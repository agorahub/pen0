Europe needs a new doctrine that places cyberspace at the heart of strategic planning, bridging civil and military domains for national resilience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent shift in US strategic posture towards Europe and trade is beginning to reveal significant implications, particularly in cyberspace and the role of the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe must not only equip itself with a defence strategy that substantially boosts investment and enhances its own autonomous capabilities, but it must also reframe how it integrates the cyber domain within its broader defence architecture. This article outlines how Europe needs a new doctrine for defence in cyberspace and makes three key proposals to accelerate and consolidate civil-military cyber convergence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While cyberspace has been formally recognised as the fourth operational domain – alongside land, sea, and air – this designation has yet to translate into making it a central pillar of defence strategy. Being recognised as a domain is not the same as being treated as central in strategic planning and operational doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyberspace is not only a theatre of operations in its own right; it is a critical enabler that underpins and intersects with all other domains. What remains lacking is the “how” – the frameworks, doctrines, and institutional mechanisms needed to embed cyber at the heart of defence planning and execution, also covering the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional defence doctrine is not readily applicable to cyberspace, due to the fundamentally different nature of the domain. Unlike kinetic environments, cyberspace does not conform to the laws of physical space, and it is shaped by a vastly different set of actors and dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The private sector plays a decisive role – not only as a provider of technology, but as the operator of essential national services. This dual dependence on infrastructure and private operators demands a radically new approach to integration, coordination, and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional defence doctrine falls short in cyberspace, necessitating the transformation of National Cyber Coordination Centres into real-time operational hubs that integrate civilian, military, and critical infrastructure actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-limits-of-traditional-approaches&quot;&gt;The Limits of Traditional Approaches&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is precisely this complexity that demands new frameworks and doctrines. Rather than treating it as an afterthought, the cyber domain must become a central pillar of Europe’s evolving defence architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional battlefields, cyberspace operates as a single, interconnected domain where technological architecture serves multiple purposes simultaneously. A server that hosts military communications could be technically indistinguishable from one supporting critical financial infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, traditional military strategies, designed for physical spaces governed by kinetic force, fall short in the cyber domain. A bullet, for instance, is universally recognised across contexts as a weapon. In contrast, a string of digital code has no inherent meaning until it is interpreted within a specific technological and operational framework – one that can vary dramatically depending on the context, the technology in question, and the identity of the operator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes cyber defence much more complex and creates a strong link between the infrastructure and its cyber threat detection and attribution, significantly increasing complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address the limits of traditional approaches, an Extended Permanent Cyber Defence Force composed of cybersecurity professionals embedded in their civilian roles should be established to optimise national resources and ensure scalable and rapid national cyber defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-fragmented-system-gaps-in-governance-and-risk-management&quot;&gt;A Fragmented System: Gaps in Governance and Risk Management&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most cyberspace operators and assets are privately owned. Consequently, private enterprises are both the primary targets of cyberattacks and frontline defenders against these threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;National cybersecurity agencies have developed regulatory frameworks aimed at fortifying critical infrastructure protections. However, while the private sector should not only comply with regulations but also proactively collaborate with governmental and military institutions to enhance collective defence mechanisms, this is currently missing from many cyber defence approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The protection of critical infrastructures is almost everywhere the responsibility of civilian agencies, with little or no coordination with the defence side. While many countries have identified a connection between defence and national cyber authorities, these are often in the form of committees that are involved in case of conflicts or major incidents, as for example the model adopted by US with Presidential Policy Directive 42 of 2016, that creates a patchwork of overlapping authorities without a clear operational model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has been one of the first countries to promote an Integrated Operating Concept, which has been followed by a new version of the National Cyber Strategy, that established the National Cyber Force (NCF), a joint unit between the MoD and GCHQ (intelligence), but only to conduct offensive cyber operations. The integrated operating model is providing ambitious objectives around multidomain integration and developing an integration model that is different from operating and warfighting – something essential for cyber as resilience can only be built overtime in preparation for warfighting. But even these examples show we are still missing the definition of an operational doctrine to develop and fully implement the high-level objectives given by the strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the often-overlooked web of interdependencies between infrastructures, the challenge is not just about protecting isolated systems but understanding how failures in one domain can cascade through interconnected systems. These connections form an intricate network where vulnerabilities in one sector can have profound ripple effects across others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An even subtler form of dependency arises from shared technologies. Independent operators may unknowingly rely on the same technological components, such as widely used software or hardware platforms. A cyberattack exploiting a vulnerability in this shared technology could simultaneously compromise a vast array of seemingly unrelated infrastructures. A particularly telling example is the deployment of identical solar panel controllers across numerous independently managed facilities. In 2024 a targeted attack against this common technological point already disrupted energy generation on a relevant scale, effectively turning what appears to be a decentralised system into a single “virtual critical infrastructure” with national-level consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many countries have established strong regulatory foundations and dedicated cybersecurity agencies, this must still translate into practical, effective action. Current frameworks often focus too heavily on individual infrastructures without fully considering the broader systemic risks posed by interconnectivity and technological convergence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, countries such as the UK, France, Germany and Italy all place the onus of protection primarily on the individual operators, which are responsible for identifying threats and countermeasures almost autonomously. It is true that all four countries mention information sharing and early warning as key enablers, but most operators of essential services have not integrated cyber risk into their broader risk management frameworks and, on the other side, national authorities struggle to have a systemic view of the national and sectorial risks, as confirmed by the lack of standards and taxonomies for sharing threat scenarios and impact on critical services. Another confirmation comes from the separation on the EU DORA regulation and the NIS2 directive between incident reporting and information sharing arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;building-integrated-civil-military-cyber-ecosystems&quot;&gt;Building Integrated Civil-Military Cyber Ecosystems&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The convergence between military and civilian authorities in cybersecurity has become an essential component of national and collective defence strategies across NATO and allied nations. Institutional configurations, such as NATO’s Integrated Cyber Defence Centre, the US. Joint Cyber Defence Collaborative, and the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre structurally embed cooperation between armed forces, intelligence agencies, civilian cyber authorities and critical infrastructure operators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joint cyber exercises – including NATO’s Cyber Coalition, US Cyber Guard, and Israel’s joint civil-military national drills (Cyber Dome) – serve as crucial testing grounds to rehearse coordinated responses to complex cyberattacks, strengthening interoperability between military cyber units, national CERTs, law enforcement and private-sector operators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information-sharing mechanisms have been formalised through platforms like NATO’s Malware Information Sharing Platform, the UK’s Cyber Information Sharing Partnership, and the US Cyber Information Sharing and Collaboration Program, ensuring rapid, bidirectional threat intelligence flows between defence entities and civilian stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public–private partnerships have expanded with initiatives such as the UK’s Defence Cyber Protection Partnership and Israel’s close industry-military ties, reflecting the recognition that national defence relies heavily on securing privately operated critical infrastructure. Additionally, innovative models, such as Estonia’s volunteer Cyber Defence League and Israel’s fluid workforce between military units and the tech sector, illustrate how talent and expertise can seamlessly operate across civil and military spheres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these convergence efforts have significantly matured, they often remain reactive, fragmented, or bound by temporary frameworks, primarily mobilised during crises rather than embedded as part of permanent national defence postures. Moreover, legal, cultural and operational barriers continue to slow the full institutionalisation of truly integrated civil-military cyber ecosystems. To overcome these limits, three decisive actions are needed to accelerate and consolidate civil-military cyber convergence into a cohesive and scalable model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, national cyber authorities should expand their strategies and frameworks to explicitly integrate the military dimension of cyber defence, establishing clear, permanent coordination mechanisms with armed forces to ensure comprehensive protection of national digital assets. This requires not only aligning responsibilities and processes but also fostering joint planning, information sharing and response protocols. At the NATO level, a common doctrinal and operational framework should be developed to guide member states, ensuring full interoperability in multinational contexts and enabling effective execution of multidomain operations, where cyber defence plays a critical role alongside traditional military domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, governments should expand the operational capabilities of their National Cyber Coordination Centres (NCCCs), transforming them into real-time operational hubs that integrate civilian, military and critical infrastructure actors. These centres should deliver shared situational awareness, fusing threat intelligence from military sources with civilian network monitoring to better predict the potential impacts of cyber threats on vital services and infrastructure. This joint operational picture would enable dynamic defence actions, improve proactive mitigation strategies and become indispensable during military operations that risk spilling over into the cyber domain – ensuring that civilian systems are defended and national resilience maintained during periods of heightened tension or conflict. Some countries such as the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Israel and Australia have already started this journey. Other national cyber authorities have started to integrate military personnel into their structure to create a stable channel with the military, like the Italian National Cyber Agency (ACN).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, an extended permanent cyber defence force (EPCDF) would address structural constraints and optimise national resources. This force would be composed of cybersecurity professionals who remain embedded in their civilian roles – whether in the private sector, critical infrastructure, research, or public administration – while being permanently integrated into national cyber defence efforts under military coordination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional reservist models, the EPCDF represents a constant, distributed defence capability operating in parallel with formal military structures, ensuring that national cyber defence is not only scalable and rapid but also deeply rooted within the systems it protects. Through joint training, shared platforms, and active participation in national cyber defence strategies, this network of civilian professionals would operate as a standing line of defence, turning the entire national cyber ecosystem into a strategic asset for deterrence, resilience, and response in both peacetime and crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These three actions would transform today’s fragmented and reactive collaborations into a coherent, institutional and enduring national defence framework, bridging the military, civilian and private sectors as a unified force to counter increasingly complex and persistent cyber threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of this strategic landscape, the development of new frameworks – and, in military terms, a new doctrine – is no longer optional; it is essential. Addressing the challenges outlined above requires institutional initiatives to accelerate the doctrinal process, overcoming the inertia and timelines that traditionally characterise defence reform. Within NATO, the pathway from early conceptualisation to full doctrinal maturity can take up to a decade. When factoring in external actors such as EU institutions, national authorities and private-sector critical infrastructure providers, that timeline could stretch to 20 years before tangible impact is realised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is clearly untenable. What is needed is a fundamental acceleration of doctrine development, anchored in a new model of private-sector participation from the outset. This must be accompanied by the immediate, agile adoption of core principles to guide collaboration, resilience, and readiness across sectors. Institutions like the European Union, NATO, and leading research centres must play a catalytic role in initiating this shift – one that aligns strategic urgency with operational agility to meet the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent Conservative governments were increasingly concerned with recognising that defence spending should contribute to UK prosperity. The Labour government, elected in July 2024, has firmly underlined this stance. In its consultation paper on national industrial strategy, the defence sector is identified as a key sector for growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In government policy, private sector defence spending aims to further multiple goals. Spending is traditionally associated with enabling UK forces to deter and frustrate aggressive adversaries, but even this is not a simple matter when a sustained conventional conflict occurs. Today, the risks of relying on foreign suppliers appear to be higher than a decade ago. Further, the outputs of the defence industry become a foreign policy tool when they are provided to others, such as Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These considerations make the defence industry a cornerstone in generating UK security. But defence-focused installations, including military bases, do also provide employment and local spending for businesses and, formally since 2015, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has been charged with using funds to support greater national prosperity. Thus, although defence spending serves multiple purposes, government policy does not precisely direct how different ends are to be weighted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Philip Dunne, a former procurement minister, found when he prepared his report on the value of the defence industry to the UK economy, there is an information problem due to the multiple sectors that are involved with defence: the MoD buys everything from office furniture to combat aircraft. This paper points to findings about which there can be considerable confidence while also noting where more research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the defence industry appears as a small element in the overall UK economy, it looms much larger once the most prosperous areas of the UK (London and the southeast) are removed from the picture. As the UK defence industry is predominantly located outside London, the importance of good salaries, a skilled workforce and above average productivity is enhanced when prosperity is the focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although defence is making increasing use of electronics and software, major weapons and platforms must be engineered and physically manufactured. Consequently, many defence industrial sites are located in areas that were part of the Industrial Revolution. Shipbuilding and its support are concentrated in historical coastal sites in Scotland and the southwest. Submarine building has become the maritime focus at Barrow-in-Furness in the northwest since the early 20th century. And as UK coastal areas are poorer than the overall UK average region, these defence sites play a significant role in sustaining economic stability in those areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aircraft became a national endeavour during the First and Second World Wars but their construction and design have since become concentrated around Blackburn and Preston in the northwest, although their engines and other subsystems are made elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While basic economic principles assert that the labour and capital resources of failing businesses will normally be taken over by others with better prospects, UK and wider international experience is that areas dominated by long-standing industries such as textiles, coal, steel, pottery and mechanical engineering take much longer to recover when such industries fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the defence industry in the UK should be recognised as a protection against impoverishment. There is wide recognition of the long-term social deprivation of a town where the workforce has been run down – for example, the shipyard’s workforce on the Trident programme in Barrow-in-Furness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defence businesses in the UK also positively contribute to the development of the national economy. With a longer-term prospect of orders, defence businesses train apprentices and graduates, some of whom become available to the commercial economy. They push forward areas of technology, including digital engineering, which is starting to dominate most manufacturing sectors. Firms in defence supply chains must use MoD standards for the protection of their IT systems, which promotes cybersecurity both nationally and in firms that work on both military and commercial contracts. This includes large firms such as Leonardo, Rolls Royce and Airbus, as well as thousands of smaller firms. Additionally, the limited exposure of defence to commercial economic cycles supports both those firms and wider resilience when the wider economy is suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK government has committed to factoring in the prosperity-generating aspect of defence to its defence equipment decisions. This can play a key role where economic infrastructure is otherwise degraded. However, the lack of concrete methods to measure prosperity-related impact often leaves this factor undervalued when deciding between international and domestic bids. This paper addresses this gap by offering a more nuanced perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The significance and value of defence industry businesses have often been contested. This attitude can be traced back to post-First World War writing countering private sector involvement in supplying defence, President Dwight D Eisenhower’s warning about the power of a military–industrial complex, and debates about the impact of defence spending on economic growth. The 2020s have seen the rise of Environmental, Social and Governance standards that sometimes classify investing in defence as “unethical”. While this line of argument has been weakened by the acknowledgement of the defence industry’s importance in supporting Ukraine, it has re-emerged through controversies surrounding the Israel–Hamas war in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spending on defence could be seen as a necessary evil. In an ideal world where armed forces were no longer needed, dismantling the defence industry would be a welcome challenge. Some felt this was the situation in the early 1990s: as demand for defence products declined, many defence companies sought business in the commercial world, which proved more difficult than expected. The leading UK example of failure concerned the General Electric Company (GEC), the large UK engineering and defence business, which sold its defence interests to BAE Systems in 1999 and moved into telecommunications a few years later. In the 2020s, changes in Russian foreign policy, an increasingly unstable Middle East and northern Africa, and China’s more assertive posture have generated a significant security agenda for Western countries. Equipping their armed forces adequately is back on the European political agenda. The UK government seeks independence in its use of and access to assured capabilities and materiel, pointing to the necessity of critical British industrial capabilities that can provide it. At the same time, political leaders are calling for defence choices to contribute to spreading prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 1 shows the multiple objectives and decisions to be served by defence spending with the private sector. Some are inter-related: for instance, operational independence is closely linked to, and even based on, industrial capability. While acknowledging all these areas, this paper focuses on prosperity and considers how the UK defence industry relates to UK economic prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has four chapters. Chapter I focuses on the key factors shaping the UK defence economy and considers the context of government policy towards the defence industry in the UK. This chapter also discusses the question of how much money is involved and considers the range of goods and services bought by the UK defence industry, and how much suppliers are focused on the defence market. Chapter II recognises that the defence industry is a relatively small part of the economy but with a disproportionate impact. Reasons for this include high pay levels, advanced technologies and the interactions between military and commercial work. The industry’s regional presence also plays a vital role, often supporting areas that are otherwise economically struggling. The chapter also considers the probable fate of defence sector-dependent areas should that business disappear. Chapter III outlines the areas in the UK in which it is likely that a significant defence industry will have a positive impact on the wider manufacturing base, where the development of skills and knowledge in defence include additive manufacturing technologies, communication technologies and digital engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology-the-residual-data-problem&quot;&gt;Methodology: The Residual Data Problem&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper does not directly address the difficult question of how value in defence should be defined. It is a multifaceted concept that is subjective and dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper uses a range of existing datasets in its descriptive analysis, including government statistics, commercial studies and academic research. It also makes reference to studies from independent consultancies sponsored by individual large firms to assess their contributions to the economy. However, despite all this quantitative information, the complexity and scale of the defence industrial sector mean that much is still unknown. Former procurement minister Philip Dunne highlighted this in his 2018 report on defence in the economy. In response, during the same year, the Joint Economic Data Hub (JEDHub) was established within the Ministry of Defence’s (MoD) Defence Solutions Centre to enhance data collection and reporting on this area. The JEDHub has since published three annual reports, the latest in April 2024, which this paper uses for its analysis and on which it builds. For much of its information, the JEDHub relies significantly on the willingness of 22 companies to collect and send information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key issue with these statistics is the definition of “defence business”. As outlined in Chapter I, the range of products and services supplied to defence is broad. This paper focuses on the specialised defence business, as this sector is mostly not driven by traditional market dynamics. The complexity, the required expertise to develop and produce defence technology and the value of major defence products, such as platforms, mean that there is often only one or very few suppliers. At the same time, these suppliers have only one primary customer – the MoD. This makes the relationship between supply and demand special and requires policy to govern that relationship. One effect is that the MoD potentially has greater agency in shaping the market than it would in a market where it is one of many customers. This paper is concerned therefore with a key driver of that policy – the economic impact of UK defence businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key definitional problem remains: even businesses that specialise in defence technology may also have a substantive commercial business. Thus, there is a need to differentiate between their activities for defence and for the commercial market. This can be hard to describe statistically because of the lack of a distinct definition of what constitutes “defence business”. For instance, dual-use items may be primarily developed and produced both for defence and for the commercial sector. This has an impact on the effect that defence spending has on jobs associated with that business and is also difficult to measure. There is no easy way to establish the necessary share of a firm’s work being devoted to a defence product for it to qualify as a “defence business”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statistical datasets struggle with accurately pinning down the regional impact of the defence industry. This is because regional data is often compiled from the address to which money is paid, but not necessarily from where the cost has been incurred. Also problematic is the challenge of discerning what contributes a “British defence business” when the headquarters is located overseas. At the turn of the millennium, the Blair government concluded that a range of factors impacted “Britishness”, including where technology was created, where skills and intellectual property resided, where jobs were, and where investment is made. Clearly these are related but separate elements, although the link between jobs and investment is normally close. A significant part of this framework was that the location of ownership and overall control was considered not relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, the UK activities of firms such as Airbus, Leonardo, Thales, Raytheon and General Dynamics are all treated as “British” businesses, even though they are all foreign owned. They add significant value to UK jobs and the UK economy, are permitted to be members of the UK industrial body Aerospace, Defence &amp;amp; Security (ADS), and several were part of the former UK Defence Suppliers Forum. It should be stressed that there are many more foreign-owned businesses in the UK carrying out defence work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of decades of privatisation, almost all businesses supplying the MoD are in the private sector. Those whose shares are available on the London Stock Exchange can be bought by funds from around the world, although the government does keep an eye on foreign purchases that would give a controlling interest to foreign businesses. Additionally, over the last two decades, important second-tier UK-owned firms have been bought either by foreign primes (for example, Lucas Aerospace is now part of GE Aerospace), or by capital funds looking to generate more value through restructuring (while generating an option of selling off part, or the whole of, the business). GKN, bought by UK-based Melrose, Cobham, bought by Advent International and Ultra Electronics, bought by the now US-based Cobham share this experience. In early 2025, the latest target of a US investor has reportedly been the defensive aid business Chemring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all this in mind, this paper uses the best information currently available, noting that the most common limitation in the JEDHub work is the omission of defence data rather than overstatement of defence claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-government-policy-on-the-defence-industry&quot;&gt;I. Government Policy on the Defence Industry&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper was primarily prepared in the context of previous Conservative government policy, which encouraged the MoD to use its resources to deliver on multiple objectives beyond securing military advantages for the UK’s armed forces. The 2021 Defence and Security Industrial Strategy referred to “critical industrial capabilities” as “a vital strategic asset in their own right”. Defence choices should provide the UK government with operational independence regarding the use of its armed forces, contribute to UK economic prosperity and levelling-up agendas, and strengthen the UK. The current Labour government’s January 2024 paper on safeguarding the UK made particular reference to the role of the defence industry in Northern Ireland. Since coming into office in July, the government has also underlined its expectation that the defence sector should benefit the UK economy. Its Green Paper on UK industrial policy identified the defence sector as a key sector to driving growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper directly addresses how to build, strengthen and sustain UK prosperity, with limited attention paid to the link between domestic industrial capability and the government’s desire for operational independence in its forces, which would be compromised if domestic defence firms fall short. However, the importance of operational independence should not be overlooked, especially as the UK aspires to use its forces for purposes other than the defence of national and allied territory. This paper also does not consider the economic impact of spending on governmental defence establishments in detail. However, it recognises that some military bases are of great local significance in terms of direct civil employment, as are those who deliver infrastructure projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In principle, the current government could abandon all these policy stances, but its previous positions on defence suggest that this is unlikely. In fact, the government would like to generate further positive economic benefits from defence spending, and has identified defence as a key sector for economic advances in its first paper on national industrial strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-much-money-is-spent&quot;&gt;How Much Money is Spent?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MoD data for 2023/24 separates payments to the US government for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) items – which the US Department of Defense (DoD) then buys for the UK from US industry – from direct transactions with UK and overseas industry. The MoD knows that some FMS work is carried out in the UK, particularly with the F-35 fighter aircraft, and reports its value. The MoD also reports on spending directly with industry worldwide and the proportion that is spent in the UK. Thus, it is possible to discern how much money has been spent in the UK and how much has been spent overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The total amount spent by the MoD globally with UK and foreign-owned organisations was £38.2 billion in 2023/4, of which £600 million was on FMS deals with the US. Of this, the total spent with UK firms was £28.8 billion. Excluding mine-protected vehicles for Afghanistan and Iraq, such as Mastiff and Ridgeback, the list of platforms bought from the US in the last 15 years includes C-17 transport aircraft, F-35s, Predator remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAs), Reaper RPAs, Apache A-64E attack helicopters, Rivet Joint electronic intelligence aircraft, Chinook helicopters, Wedgetail airborne command and control aircraft and P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft. The latest data from the US State Department (published in 2019) showed that the UK imported three times more defence equipment from the US than Germany did, and seven times more than France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defence firms and the government seek to use the domestic defence goods and services market as the basis for exports to foreign governments. The scale of exports is a matter of some contention since the data collected in the UK and published by the government typically addresses orders rather than the deliveries that often follow years later. The data shows that the five-year average of defence exports between 2018 and 2022 was around £10 billion a year, equivalent to 40–50% of what the UK MoD buys overall. The aerospace sector dominates defence exports and the Gulf states have emerged as major customers. However, the full picture is more complex. Rolls-Royce and Leonardo sell important subsystems, such as radars, to a wider range of customers. The Swedish Gripen, for instance, has a Leonardo radar from the UK, some Japanese ships have Rolls-Royce engines, the New Zealand navy has MBDA missiles, and BAE Systems has provided technical help for other national combat aircraft programmes, including in Sweden and Korea. There is no assurance that UK-developed and UK-built military equipment would succeed in export markets, but extensive reliance on imports certainly erodes the UK defence industry’s export potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-does-the-ministry-of-defence-buy-and-from-whom&quot;&gt;What Does the Ministry of Defence Buy, and from Whom?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goods and services used by the defence industry span a vast range of categories. At one end, governmental defence customers require generic commercial goods and services, such as office furniture, sports clothing for soldiers, fuel and catering services. There are many potential suppliers in these areas, and the MoD is just one of multiple customers, and could account for just a small part of such firms’ sales. Moreover, the entry barriers for firms trying to break into most of these areas are modest in terms of the required expertise, facilities and finance. New firms can come in while poorer performers disappear. Such commercial products have many characteristics of perfect markets on which much of conventional economics is based.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the large middle are firms supplying goods and services on a commercial basis, but which involve little to major modification to make them suitable for defence use. Trucks, roll-on roll-off ferries, some helicopter types and some UAVs have these attributes. A useful delineator of such goods is whether they are defined in export control law and regulation as dual-use goods requiring export licences before they can be sold to a foreign customer. The UK list of dual-use goods is extensive, covering some 350 pages in the government’s Export Control List. The list also contains 36 pages for specialised defence areas, such as combat aircraft, artillery pieces, armoured vehicles and warships. Suppliers of major platforms and systems for defence tend to have very different problems, opportunities and natures from those in the commercial world. There is just one key initial customer for a UK specialised defence supplier – the MoD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-ministry-of-defence-and-armed-forces-as-sole-buyers&quot;&gt;The Ministry of Defence and Armed Forces as Sole Buyers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Navies, air forces and, to an increasing extent, armies rely on platforms to move and indeed to operate. Platforms are thus important, with many remaining in service for decades. For example, there was a 20-year gap between one UK Army order for an armoured combat vehicle (Challenger 2 in 1994) and the next (Ajax in 2014). For firms required to develop, produce and sell such platforms, a viable business model can be difficult to specify because national orders can be rare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When intervals have been long between domestic orders of a military product category, the unsuccessful firm in a bidding competition, or even the winning firm, often either closes or sells that part of its business. Other firms have behaved similarly when they believed that their overall defence order prospects were too limited. In 1989, General Electric, Plessey, Vickers Shipbuilding &amp;amp; Engineering, Devonport Management, Ferranti, Hunting, Racal, Thorn EMI, Vickers plc and Westland were among the 18 suppliers listed by the MoD as among its top suppliers paid more than £100 million in 1987–88. Today, none exist as a separate entity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, UK defence in 2025 is often marked by a monopsony buyer (one buyer among many sellers) facing an oligopoly or even a monopoly seller. This is not just a UK phenomenon, with oligopolies or even national champion companies facing the defence ministries of countries such as France, Germany and even the US. After 1993, as noted by Michael Brown, “America’s 50 main defense suppliers consolidated to five. Today, the top six suppliers to the U.S. Department of Defense receive two-thirds of all procurement dollars”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some companies survive in the sector through export orders and by generating required upgrades to older systems. However, it is never easy to sell a defence product internationally that has not been endorsed – that is, bought by the armed forces of that company’s national government. Moreover, a growing number of countries are seeking to develop their own defence industrial capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is here that several policy directions meet. The UK government wants operational independence regarding the use of its forces, which means the UK should enjoy access to a capable industrial base. To survive commercially, a firm requires continuity in development, production and support work. For national and regional prosperity, a region needs defence businesses that provide secure and sustained opportunities. A firm might struggle to attract and train specialised young staff if they will only have a job in their locality for eight or nine years. The Appledore shipyard in Devon, for example, had minimal work once it had completed its blocks of the Queen Elizabeth-class carriers. Babcock closed the shipyard in 2019, and its yard in Rosyth, Scotland has no assured shipbuilding work once the five Type 31 fleet is completed. There is uncertainty about the Type 32 project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boards and personnel of major defence firms should not be drawn into complacency and must be aware that their position depends on their delivery record, creating a synergistic relationship between government and defence business. If firms perform well, they enjoy security and the government obtains operational independence and military capability. If companies fall short, they are likely to lose their business with the government, and the government will have to turn to foreign suppliers. The price of this, for government, is the loss of a credible claim to operational independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some firms that have a significant defence portfolio can choose whether they will focus entirely on defence sector equipment or whether they want to also compete in the commercial sector. In a comparison of three UK firms in the Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP), BAE Systems is 96% dependent on revenue from defence sector products; Leonardo 75%; and Rolls-Royce 25%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deeper investigations go into supply chains, the more it is revealed that firms address both defence and commercial markets. Every firm has its own concept of how defence work fits into its overall strategy and business model. Specialised defence products contain components, and even subsystems, that are produced by firms serving both commercial and military markets, and it is likely that there are more than 10,000 firms in the UK that have some defence business. From a prosperity perspective, a crucial, yet unresearched, question concerns the extent to which a mixed commercial–military firm benefits from more defence work or suffers from its cancellation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To contain external dependence while seeking the claimed benefits of competition and maintaining access to advanced systems, successive governments in the UK have allowed, or even encouraged, foreign defence firms to invest in the UK. Each firm has its own individual pattern of activity, which can address some or all R&amp;amp;D, manufacturing and support activities. Airbus, Leonardo, MBDA and Thales are the most prominent firms from Europe operating in the UK, while General Dynamics (about 1,500 employees), Lockheed Martin (about 1,700) and Raytheon (about 2,000) are the larger US firms operating in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further feature of the market for many defence systems is that the purchase price is often just the beginning, with direct in-service costs exceeding the purchase within a decade. A US DoD memorandum observed 15 years ago that: “Sustainment costs have five to ten times more impact on total life cycle costs than do RDT&amp;amp;E [research, development, test and evaluation] costs”. Frontline defence equipment is still generally designed for high-level performance rather than the maintenance-free operating periods that form the basis for most commercial equipment. Military platforms and many of their subsystems are supplied and supported on the basis of mean time between failure rates that would be unacceptable in commercial markets. The US is more open about availability than the UK: in 2021, across the US Air Force, for every 10 aircraft in its possession, three were unavailable at any one point in time. As of 2022, all variants of the F-35 had lower availability rates than this. Other reports indicate that the situation has not much improved, if at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These factors mean that defence maintenance, repair and overhaul absorb significant costs, but also provide much work for the industry. Many in-service needs can only be supplied by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), which may opt to offer a modest initial purchase price, knowing that it can charge handsomely for parts supply and related services over the following decades. Total in-service costs are much harder to calculate than “sticker prices” and are much less available in the public domain. However, particularly with combat aircraft, UK governments have pursued in-service support savings by contracting with the lead companies for availability and reliability rather than simply supplying parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An increasing challenge in the 2020s is that there is an opportunity, and in some cases a need, for regular upgrades to military equipment as opposed to just maintenance and repair, given the increased electronic content and software of many systems. In defence (as in the commercial world), firms are usually reluctant to transfer full intellectual property (IP) rights to a user, which would be needed for the government to make its own arrangements for the modification and even repair of equipment. Understandably, some governments are seeking to weaken the power of OEMs, but this is not easy given legitimate concerns about safety, fair trade and the commercial importance of IP for the firm involved. The bottom line is that in defence, the governmental customer can feel itself to be subject to vendor lock-in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defence industrial capabilities and behaviours are also central to governmental efforts to protect the country and the government’s perception of the national interest. Happily, for the most part, defence activities are focused on deterrence and capability preparation, but actual military operations often place special demands on the industrial sector. Experience of protracted conflicts, including the Second World War, the Korean War and the ongoing war in Ukraine, have demonstrated the value of access to a strong and agile supply base. Maria Eagle, the UK Minister for Defence Procurement, observed at RUSI in March 2025:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Amidst the uncertainty surrounding European security … one thing … is certain and that’s a fighting force is only as strong as the industrial base that stands behind it. So transforming European defence industrial capabilities and boosting capacity are going to be integral to this defining mission of our time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the more recent British military operational activities, despite being less intense on an order of magnitude, placed urgent demands on the supply base. All these considerations result in the choice of this paper to focus on defence in the economy rather than “defence economics”, as well as why the government, like others, has accepted that the defence industrial base should be viewed as a strategic asset. However, as noted earlier in the Methodology section on data issues, there is no clear specification of which defence suppliers qualify as sufficiently British to be a strategic asset. What is most likely to interest the MoD, from an industrial capability perspective, is a firm’s capacity in R&amp;amp;D, integration and production, as well as support and upgrades. From a wealth-creation perspective, the scale of employment and salary levels should also loom large. Each of these considerations should inform the MoD’s approach to choosing firms, which will in turn inform the government’s strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-key-economic-contributions-of-defence-firms&quot;&gt;II. Key Economic Contributions of Defence Firms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter addresses the economic consequences of defence spending with the private sector rather than the consequences of defence spending overall. There is an argument that suitable defence spending boosts investor confidence, because defence spending assures potential investors that a country is unlikely to be attacked (and is thus a safe investment), but this is not addressed in this paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;defence-can-appear-economically-insignificant&quot;&gt;Defence Can Appear Economically Insignificant&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;National economic statistics signal that defence should be a minor factor in the UK economy. Defence’s share of the economy, at a little over 2.3% of GDP, has reduced from its Cold War percentage share (4.1%) and considerably reduced from what its share of GDP was 50 years ago (5.1%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defence has become a small part of the national R&amp;amp;D effort. The Office of National Statistics reported governmental R&amp;amp;D spending in 2022 as £2.1 billion on defence, with £13.4 billion focused on commercial purposes. For the economy as a whole, a parliamentary study notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Office for National Statistics (ONS) shows that, in 2020, total public and private expenditure on R&amp;amp;D in the UK was £61.8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, along with government funding from UK Research and Innovation, defence may be ready to support projects with a more distant return than that of some commercial firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding employment, MoD data for 2022/23 shows that defence accounted for a total of 434,000 UK jobs, which constitutes one in 60 UK jobs. Of these, 239,000 were in the private sector, and the MoD employed 58,000 civilians and 142,000 service personnel in the UK. (The private sector numbers exclude those involved in the promotion and delivery of defence exports.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The employment significance of exports is almost impossible to decipher since the levels of exports and the numbers of people involved varies from year to year. Thus, the significance of exports must include their potential to provide a continuity of work once UK needs have been met, which in turn sustains the industrial capabilities needed for the development and production of future systems. For some years, Thales in Belfast sustained a workforce and capability in anti-tank and short-range air defence missiles through exports. The RAF took delivery of its last Typhoon in 2019 and production has been sustained by sales to Austria, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, as well as additional deliveries to collaborative partner countries. At the 2024 Berlin airshow, Germany announced that it would be buying an additional 20 aircraft to cover the period until approximately 2040 (when the Franco-German SCAF aircraft should come into service).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of ships, although the sales of the Type 26 frigate to Australia and Canada mainly involve the design (the vessels will be built in the customer states), there are some subsystems involved that will be made in the UK. The same is true of the three Type 31 ships being bought by Poland. There are hopes of further sales of both vessels. Under Patrick Sanders as Chief of the General Staff, the Army focused on equipment modernisation and relationships with industry. In a keynote speech in 2023, Sanders said,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Like many other nations and Defence industries, we have studied the war carefully, identifying and learning valuable lessons which are shaping our decisions for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At RUSI, I trailed our initial response to these lessons and we have forged a credible plan for the British Army’s renewal. Renewal to make sure we can fight the war we must. A renewal founded in hard-won lessons of the past, orientated to the future to ensure that we emerge more lethal, agile, expeditionary and resilient, all underpinned by our digital framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This renewal is delivering now and gathering momentum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also underlined the need and opportunities for more exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its modest size, the defence industry has features that give it greater importance than numbers without context would imply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;high-productivity-pay-and-levels-of-knowledge-and-skills&quot;&gt;High Productivity, Pay and Levels of Knowledge and Skills&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defence firms feature high productivity rates, offer high salaries and are adept at generating knowledge and skills. JEDHub data shows that value added per employee is high in defence, with gross value added estimated in 2022 at £112,000, compared with the national average in manufacturing as a whole of £81,062.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the national level, the JEDHub (as well as company-sponsored studies) finds that salaries in the defence sector are higher than the UK average, and that salaries in the defence sector are higher than UK average pay in the manufacturing sector specifically. While this could make some government officials complain that the MoD is paying more than it should for its private sector labour, defence firms are under clear pressure to pay what is required to recruit and retain their expert staff, whose training they have often significantly funded. Moreover, firms serving both military and commercial markets, such as Rolls-Royce and Leonardo, who move their staff around, do not pay their employees in the commercial sector less than they do those in the military domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/EYer0qT.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: MoD Expenditure Per Capita with UK Industry by Region 2023/24.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/mod-regional-expenditure-statistics-with-industry-202324&quot;&gt;MoD, “MOD Regional Expenditure with Industry 2023/24”, 21 November 2024&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it could be argued that higher wages come at the expense of creating more, albeit lower-paying, jobs through government spending in other areas. However, higher salaries mean higher disposable incomes and a more significant multiplier effect in terms of supporting a wide range of businesses. For example, a 2024 study by Oxford Economics of Leonardo’s economic impact in the UK showed average wages at Leonardo Yeovil of £51,000 compared with the overall local average of £32,000, and that every Leonardo and Leonardo-supported job in its supply chain generated about a third of a job through employees’ spending in the wider economy. Oxford Economics also researched similar salaries and multiplier effect ratios for Leonardo’s Edinburgh electronics firm and other smaller UK sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Higher salaries also mean that the government gets more than a third of its defence industrial spending in the UK directly back in the form of national insurance payments, income tax, corporation tax and VAT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is likely that the eventual net cost to government revenues will be small when a foreign bid has succeeded, provided that an unsuccessful UK bidder has other projects to work on. But defence is a de facto UK government monopsony, meaning that a similar opportunity is often unavailable. As noted, British defence firms have been subject to multiple takeovers and plant closures over decades. This issue is discussed later in this paper in the section The Consequences of Defence Cuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further consideration is that while defence firms employ a high number of people from science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) backgrounds, they also train a large number of apprentices who become everything from skilled tradespeople to chartered engineers. For example, more than 10% of Leonardo’s employees in Luton and Edinburgh are graduate trainees, apprentices or placement students. In 2022, BAE Systems said it had invested approximately “£100m in education, skills and early careers activities in the UK annually”. In 2025, it will have a record 6,500 people in training, around 15% of its UK workforce. Such qualified young people become an important part of the UK’s overall stock of knowledgeable and skilled personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The view that defence firms do not spend their own money on R&amp;amp;D also needs to be qualified. Much of defence is R&amp;amp;D intensive and, while most defence funding comes from government, the 2024 JEDHub report found that up to 30% of defence R&amp;amp;D funding comes from the private sector. In relation to the wider economy, Dunne’s report observes that: “Historically, there has been a strong correlation between defence research and technological advances across society”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK governments usually make sure an announcement of a contract with a UK firm mentions how many jobs will be sustained and/or created, to allay any doubt regarding the positive economic consequences of defence spending. Also, perhaps as an effort to win favour from the first Trump administration, a British defence official based in Washington stressed in 2018 that British defence spending was increasing to America’s benefit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;That’s not only good for strengthening our defense capabilities; it’s excellent news for the U.S. We’re focusing on American priorities, like counterterrorism, while bolstering the U.S. economy. This year, European allies are buying more than $35 billion of American products, such as F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, Poseidon P-8A Maritime Patrol Aircraft, Reaper drones, and billions of dollars in Patriot missile defense. UK’s defense spending alone is helping to employ more than 160,000 Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A month later, then-secretary of state Gavin Williamson repeated this number (of defence-supported jobs) to a Washington DC audience. If the MoD recognises that UK spending in the US benefits the US economy, it must also recognise that defence spending at home helps with the UK economy. Similarly, if it is accepted that technology and manufacturing are important foundations even for a service-based economy, it is significant that defence appears to be in excess of 10% of total British manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-value-of-defence-business-in-a-commercialdefence-firm&quot;&gt;The Value of Defence Business in a Commercial–Defence Firm&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to generalise about the extent that businesses which work with defence find such work to be helpful in sustaining and developing their commercial work. Even at the top level, firms vary in their strategies and market focuses. While BAE Systems and QinetiQ are dominated by defence, Rolls-Royce receives only about 30% of its revenue from defence. In terms of the commercial–defence links, much of the technical workforce in Rolls-Royce has the ability to work in either side. Babcock received 68% of its 2023 revenue from the defence sector and presents itself as serving defence, security and commercial markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While defence spending is most visible in terms of the large primes that dominate major projects, and while governments for some years have sought to bring more (innovative) small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) into defence, it is easy to overlook the fact that major firms already outsource much of their activity and have hundreds of identified firms in their supply chains. Oxford Economics and individual companies’ reports provide evidence of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Babcock International 2022:&lt;/strong&gt; “£1bn spent with more than 5,700 UK suppliers, including £230m spent with 1,070 suppliers in deprived local authority areas, and £337m spent with 2,200 SMEs”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leonardo 2020:&lt;/strong&gt; “Two thirds of Leonardo’s 2,100 UK suppliers were small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and more than a quarter (28%) of all Leonardo supply chain spending was spent directly with these SMEs”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BAE Systems 2018:&lt;/strong&gt; “More than 3,000 contractors [are] employed by BAE Systems as part of its procurement spending”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rolls-Royce&lt;/strong&gt; (with its larger civil business) spends £2.3 billion a year with more than 2,300 companies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The degree of corporate dependence on defence reduces further down supply chains. Certainly, many members of ADS, MAKE UK Defence and Tech UK (the industrial bodies that support access to the defence market), have members serving the commercial world as well. The perceived benefit of having some defence business is reflected in the growing number of companies joining these bodies. As mentioned earlier, another consideration is that supplying defence requires all firms to have high cybersecurity standards, which should enhance their overall resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this constitutes hard evidence of the benefits of defence work, but it does signal that many firms see access to both sectors as beneficial. Spirit AeroSystems in Northern Ireland explicitly pursued the defence market as a strategy because, having experienced the collapse of commercial air transport during the Covid-19 pandemic, it recognised defence as a valuable counter-cyclical element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An issue worth detailed research concerns the wider impact of defence work on dual-use suppliers. For example, can longer-term defence contracts justify capital investments that a predominance of short-term commercial contracts would make more risky? And can gaps between work be a difficulty for dual-use firms?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these considerations suggest that, as a generalisation, defence business appears to have a higher impact on the UK economy than a superficial look would suggest. This message is reinforced when regional and local needs are considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-local-and-regional-economic-impact-of-defence&quot;&gt;The Local and Regional Economic Impact of Defence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defence industrial and wider economic considerations loom larger once London is excluded from the picture. MoD data shows that London only gets around £2 billion in defence spending – around 7% of the total. London accounts for 13% of the UK population but 23% of GDP. In brief, although London has some very poor areas, it is much richer than the rest of the UK, while not receiving much from the defence budget. GDP per head in London was £69,000 in 2023. GDP per head in the southeast made it the next highest income region at £41,319. This high level in the southeast might be surprising, but the delineation of naval facilities in and around Portsmouth, plus army facilities in the southeast, contribute to this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of the MoD’s top 10 suppliers has major defence manufacturing installations in the southeast, but BAE Systems employs around 650 staff at Frimley, who carry out IT and ship support work. Airbus is now the owner of Surrey Satellites, based in Guildford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparing defence spending per capita in different areas with GDP per capita suggests the positive impact of defence (except in the southeast). Defence spending per capita is high in the northwest, the southwest and Scotland. These regions, despite having either extensive coastal boundaries or significantly de-industrialised communities, have slightly higher GDP per capita than any other UK region (except London and the southeast). For the southwest, there is little defence activity in Cornwall compared with other counties in the region. It is possibly not a coincidence that it has higher unemployment and lower pay than the overall southwest region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognition that defence spending in a local area can be of significance is reflected in the focused interest that MPs from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland show in whether their regions are getting their share of defence, however “defence” is defined. The Scottish Affairs Committee has completed a series of inquiries, with those members who oppose Scottish independence looking for evidence of the benefits of being in the UK. The Scottish National Party finds it awkward to oppose shipbuilding links with the rest of the UK that bring so many benefits to Scotland. The Welsh Affairs Committee can see how little defence work has come to their area, and the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee is in a similar place. Both the Northern Ireland and Wales inquiries established by these committees were terminated due to the June 2024 general election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;government-revenues-and-the-balance-of-trade&quot;&gt;Government Revenues and the Balance of Trade&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK government has a significant budget deficit problem, and the country has a long-standing balance of trade deficit. It is therefore of some significance to assess the impact of the defence industry on these matters. In terms of the trade deficit, a foreign defence product clearly constitutes an import, which presents a challenge for a country that imports more than it exports over a sustained period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is incontestable that, when the MoD spends government money in the private sector, some of that becomes revenue to the Treasury in the form of tax. At first glance, free-market economics would argue that, if well-paid defence jobs were not available, those affected would quickly find other well-paid sources of employment (which would mean they paid similar amounts of tax). For some this will indeed be the case, while others will opt for early retirement, albeit on a reduced pension income. Some will take time to find new work and weigh on government spending rather than contribute financially to the Treasury. Here it could be said that the burden of proof lies with those who argue against the assertions in a 2012 RUSI Briefing Paper which demonstrated that, on a contract involving no foreign elements, the government would get back as much as 36% directly in the form of income tax, national insurance and other direct payments to government, without any multiplier effects included in the calculation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exports present a slightly different situation. A UK or collaborative product may or may not generate foreign exchange revenues from exports, depending on its commercial terms. But it is quite clear that a product bought from a foreign supplier, such as Apache E or Predator, can only be an import. This is not an argument for rejecting foreign products when the frontline military case is strong and/or there is no capable supplier in the UK. But security of supply in the support phase, and operational independence, are other factors that affect import decisions – as is clearly considered when the US buys an overseas defence product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-consequences-of-defence-cuts&quot;&gt;The Consequences of Defence Cuts&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The argument so far is that defence work has wider benefits than might be assumed, but there is a further issue. What can be observed about the impact of reduced defence spending and a lack of defence orders? In mid-2024 there was uncertainty about the affordability of the defence programme, so such reductions cannot be ruled out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, adjustment to defence closures has been easiest in regions with a diversified, already prospering economy. Here, those affected by a defence firm closure may be able to quickly find other ways of contributing to the economy, and any abandoned infrastructure would get reused. The closures of BAE Systems factories at Kingston, Hatfield and Enfield have not affected long-term local prosperity – at Hatfield, for instance, the site of the Flight Test Hangar “is currently a David Lloyd Leisure Centre and hotel”. In diversified, prosperous areas, other activities can usually replace closed defence entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it is also clear that, in many areas of the UK, the loss of major industries has had major negative repercussions for decades. Many of the towns and areas that were at the forefront of the Industrial Revolution have seen the decline of their traditional industries (especially textiles, coal, steel and heavy engineering) in the face of foreign competition from countries with less expensive labour and/or more efficient working practices. Many of these places, not least the north and some parts of the West Midlands, did not experience the speedy replacement of a failed firm with well-paid jobs, and their populations have instead suffered sustained periods of unemployment, low pay and social deprivation. The employment and value added by an Amazon warehouse near a motorway exit differ from the benefits of a thriving factory. Social deprivation is a multidimensional concept with a range of metrics, several of which are inter-related: low wages, unemployment, poor levels of educational performance, poor health and crime. Once in place, it is difficult to improve social deprivation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further consideration is that coastal areas in the UK are poorer, have poorer health and more crime than their inland neighbours. By definition, they are peripheral rather than “core” UK locations, and many have not experienced a replacement for UK tourists moving to international destinations or for the decline of the fishing industry. In the defence domain, a report in March 2024 covered the current revitalisation of Chatham, albeit 40 years after the closure of its naval dockyard. Industrial sites by the coast thus have a special economic and social significance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The town of Barrow-in-Furness, for example, had a highly negative experience when there was no design work for a new submarine for almost 20 years between the Vanguard and Astute projects, and Astute manufacturing did not start until three years after the completion of the last Vanguard. Indeed, as the shipyard’s number of employees dropped from 14,000 to 3,000, the town went into a major decline, although some were able to find work at the neighbouring Sellafield nuclear installation. This resulted in more people living on social security payments and increased drug use. Male unemployment in the constituency was 7.3% in 1998. In 2001, data showed that there were almost half as many economically inactive males in Barrow-in-Furness as those measured as economically active. Poor educational standards became a feature, with almost 50% of the adult population having no formal qualifications and another 20% with only Level 1 qualifications. Almost 2,000 people had never worked or were long-term unemployed. A significant question that merits future research (but may prove tricky in terms of data access) is to what degree running down the shipyard contributed to the region becoming less a contributor to government tax revenues and instead a greater burden on social security spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of industrial capability, defence suffered as the restoration of submarine building proved a protracted, difficult and expensive process. According to John Schank and others, “submarine design and build skills atrophied in the United Kingdom, resulting in a costlier and lengthier Astute procurement effort”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The maturing of Astute production and the start of Dreadnought-class building has contributed highly to the restoration of employment in and around Barrow-in-Furness: BAE Systems reported in 2024 that its “submarines business already employs approximately 13,500 people, mainly in the North West of England, with that figure set to grow to around 17,000 in the coming years”. This has required, and been accompanied by, improvements in education and cultural opportunities. Given the labour demands of the Astute and Dreadnought programmes, and plans for the Astute successor, BAE Systems felt it necessary to establish its own education and training centre (Academy for Skills and Knowledge) and its website proclaims:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Barrow-in-Furness is a hub for learning and innovation. We’re not just building the next generation of nuclear submarines here. We’re developing the next generation of engineering talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, cutting defence work often quickly leads to levelling down when no comparable new opportunities arrive, and bringing about recovery using defence money is a protracted process. There has been progress in Barrow-in-Furness, but there is still a way to go. The government’s March 2024 nuclear white paper detailed the multi-year efforts being made to rejuvenate the town with a major waterfront housing development, improved education provision and a decade-long, £20-million-a-year Barrow Transformation Fund, all aimed at encouraging “more people to come to live and work in the area”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of sustained economic difficulties in areas that led the first Industrial Revolution, the survival of defence aerospace and missile firms in the northwest takes on added significance. BAE Systems, with core factories near Preston and Blackburn, contributes significantly to local prosperity. BAE Systems also uses multiple subcontractors in a regional cluster. Also in the northwest, MBDA has a modernised missile factory in Bolton, which employed “670 highly skilled design, engineering and manufacturing employees” when it opened in 2018. As of January 2024, the company employs more than 1,000 people and has plans to triple its workforce in future years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When considering that defence cuts would likely mean levelling down an area for a sustained period, naval work conducted entirely in coastal locations merits particular attention. UK warship building is focused on the Govan and Scotstoun yards near Glasgow and the Babcock site at Rosyth, also in Scotland. These sites are currently busy building Type 26 and Type 31 ships, but what will come next (if current work is successfully completed) has not been confirmed. There is also extensive ship support work in Portsmouth, Devonport (Plymouth) and Faslane. Because of the overall reduced size of the Royal Navy, there is now much less of this type of work. Gosport, adjacent to Portsmouth, is now recognised as one of the more deprived areas of the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeovil, the home of Leonardo helicopters, is unusual. Its rural location was important to a new firm called Westland Aircraft during the First World War, when the aircraft industry came to life. The company survived the downturn in defence spending after the end of that conflict and after the Second World War the company focused on helicopter technology. In 2024, Leonardo was directly employing around 3,000 people in a town of just over 40,000 inhabitants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Westland Aircraft is owned by Italian firm Leonardo, and the Italian side of its helicopter business is larger than the British element of the business. However, the latter still works on development, production and support for both military and commercial helicopters. A factory with such a long history and significance is inevitably a key presence in its community. To ensure it has suitably qualified and motivated young people to come into its workforce, it actively supports local education. Nonetheless, Yeovil’s future is uncertain. In recent years the MoD has turned increasingly to US helicopter suppliers, opting for the Apache E helicopter (with no role for Leonardo), and buying more Chinook helicopters. With the Wildcat helicopter production completed, and despite Leonardo having a strategic partnership agreement with the MoD, the (MoD) initial decision was to use a formal competition for the next military helicopter (the New Medium Helicopter, NMH) – with Airbus and Lockheed-Martin chosen alongside Leonardo as viable bidders. In April 2024, the MoD bought six Airbus H145 helicopters as Puma replacements for deployment in Cyprus and Brunei. Later in 2024, Airbus and Lockheed-Martin withdrew from the NMH competition, and as of April 2025 there was no firm MoD commitment to the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leonardo does, however, have a £50-million, four-year MoD contract agreed in 2022 to generate Proteus, a flying demonstrator of an uncrewed naval helicopter that, when developed, could carry out surveillance, supply and casualty missions. Proteus could also substitute, to a degree, for the EH-101 Merlin helicopter. The project has been pursued on an incremental basis and is intended to provide employment for about 100 development engineers in Yeovil until 2026. If Leonardo closed in Yeovil, the town would likely become another (seasonal) tourist centre, although the southwest region has a wide range of defence industrial capabilities which in 2025 its companies came together to publicise and attract further work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A feature of domestic defence industrial capabilities is that they can provide a variety of benefits. When successful, they can serve as a conspicuous symbol of national technological and management capability, support both the reality and the image of a government with meaningful sovereign freedoms and enable an armed force to secure access to equipment with its preferred characteristics. They can provide stable and well-paid employment, deliver tax revenues and reduce a government’s foreign exchange needs. In this situation, it is not surprising that ever more countries are seeking to enhance their domestic defence industrial capacity, with many having formal offset regulations to stimulate advances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-the-potential-of-the-defence-industry&quot;&gt;III. The Potential of the Defence Industry&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter outlines the key areas in which defence could make contributions to the wider manufacturing base in the UK. Their impact has been of particular interest to the current government, which pledged to harness it further through defence investments, stating: “Defence and strategic capability play a unique role in our economy, providing both high-skilled jobs and spillover innovation, as well as supporting Britain’s position on the world stage”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Integrating defence spending more closely with economic benefit would imply maintaining the previous government’s focus on developing UK products for which there was also an export market. The GCAP and Type 31 projects are both instances of the UK aiming to generate a core product (with a minimum deployable capability) that would be affordable in export markets and modifiable to meet the specific needs of a customer. Currently, Australia and Canada are working to modify the Type 26 to meet local needs, while both Poland and Indonesia are interested in buying their own versions of the Type 31.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A government seeking to improve the wider economic benefit from defence would consider the wider potential of the technologies in a defence project. Some focused technologies, such as those involved with gas turbines, have applications in both military and commercial products. Others can be understood as almost general purpose technologies, with applications in multiple domains: for example, the electric motor. At least four areas in the defence industry stand out as having many commercial applications:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aerospace&lt;/strong&gt; has been defined in dual-use terms since its inception. The RAF was supplied until 1964 by the Air Ministry, which had responsibility for both the military and commercial worlds. On the commercial side was the Society of British Aerospace Companies, which transformed into ADS in 2009. The lead professional body is the Royal Aeronautical Society, founded in 1866, and it also has both commercial and military agendas.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In (outer) space&lt;/strong&gt;, challenges and opportunities for sensors and communication abound. This can be subdivided into ground installations, launchers and satellites. UK industrial progress was long neglected by the MoD on the grounds of expense and a readiness to rely on US capabilities, but the small-satellite achievements of Surrey Satellites, plus falling launch costs and participation in some European programmes, have resulted in some changes in attitude. A National Space Strategy was announced in 2021 as a joint effort of the MoD and the (then) Department of Business, Energy &amp;amp; Industrial Strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digital engineering&lt;/strong&gt; is destined to become the central driver behind manufacturing advances. Of great interest to defence, but also of huge commercial potential, is the integration of a range of focused digital technologies into a digital engineering whole. GCAP is a demanding product for digital engineering, but it could generate a large, informed workforce and multiple lessons to be learned through integrated digitisation. These lessons learned could be curated and mechanisms put in place to make them available across the whole UK manufacturing sector.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Computing, AI, machine learning and data science&lt;/strong&gt; are key enablers of digital engineering but also have huge implications for many decision-making activities, including modelling, empirical analysis of data from multiple sources, recommendations for risk assessments, and commitment to an action. In the defence sector, AI is not a new phenomenon: defence has been using advanced data processing and analysis for decades. But AI is advancing quickly and will have many commercial uses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to these four fields, there are more specific areas on the defence agenda, including advanced materials with weight, strength and radar absorption attributes. Additionally, power generation, storage and distribution technologies have the potential to provide mobile capabilities and reduce the use of fossil fuels. Such fields also have commercial applications and potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For defence to lead on technologies with wider applications, defence systems must work in a much more hostile environment than most commercial products. Organised crime and governments pursuing deniable attacks on civilians are blurring this distinction, but it still carries core validity. For example, how long would “self-driving” cars work once those who wished to subvert them resort to using the electromagnetic spectrum to interfere with their connectivity. The reverse argument also can be offered: if a technology has been demonstrated to work in a military context, it will almost always also work in a commercial one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To generate enhanced macroeconomic benefit from military progress, it will not be enough to entrust defence work to firms with a dual-use output. Some firms choose strategically to focus on defence because of the background knowledge this requires about defence challenges, organisational structures and procurement procedures. Also, those who invest in defence firms bring a risk perspective over a portfolio of activities: sometimes they do not embrace diversification in those firms but rather see defence investments as generating modest, but low-risk, returns because of the long-term nature of contracts and the assured financial survival of the customer. This does not make commercial spin-offs within defence companies impossible, but it involves choices that should be seen as strategic rather than opportunistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government needs to think hard about how it will make the nature of dual-use but defence-origin technology advances available to the wider UK economy. This will include specifying the security classifications of a technology to allow dissemination but prevent undesirable releases to non-UK firms and governments. There could be pressure on the MoD to continue to support defence companies in defence-dependent areas, even if the outputs of those companies have lost much of their security relevance. This consideration would be less important if regions that are currently defence-dependent had a more diversified economy. Supporting firms that could use the skills and knowledge found in the defence sector and improving infrastructure in neglected areas of the UK would also help. But a broader point is that government, military and industrial leaders need to be thinking ahead to innovative products and new routes to military capabilities. All this implies that, while the defence sector already can be seen to provide benefits to the wider economy as well as imposing costs, careful allocation of defence funding and effort mean that it has the potential to do more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The defence industry’s role in the UK’s economy extends beyond pure macroeconomic metrics. This paper has attempted to provide a more granular perspective on the value of defence to the UK economy. Defence can contribute significantly to social stability and regional cohesion by providing meaningful employment and vocational training in areas where they are not always provided by commercial industry. This socioeconomic impact aligns with broader established government objectives, such as narrowing the gaps between the wealthiest and poorest areas, and efforts to strengthen the UK by ensuring that all regions benefit equitably from defence spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, UK forces must have the equipment that enables them to deter adversaries, and to prevail in conflicts, if necessary. But, to sustain the quality of their products, defence firms need continuity of work (as is well understood by other countries, including in the US, France and Germany). For projects of particularly high cost and risk, collaborative approaches with allied states are often available. For the immediate future, the MoD will be pressing for more funding, an option that it seems to believe is more likely to win public support if it can be seen to contribute to national prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defence industrial spending is a major component of the UK’s economic landscape, particularly in terms of local and regional prosperity and industrial capability. It helps prevent the levelling down associated with de-industrialisation in traditional areas and supports higher-than-average wages and productivity. As the UK navigates its future defence and economic strategies, it must balance immediate fiscal prudence with the long-term benefits of a robust, strategically managed defence industrial base. This balance is crucial not only for national security but also for sustaining regional economies and, by extension, the socioeconomic fabric of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK defence spending currently benefits the economy and society through several of its attributes, from providing a national supply base, which brings well-paid jobs wherever it is located, to training many young people, especially in STEM-related areas. This is not the case across the wider economy. Defence spending is especially beneficial in coastal areas that are less prosperous than the country overall, but it is also beneficial in regions, such as the north of England, which have already experienced long-term damage from de-industrialisation. Large defence firms spread MoD revenues across extensive supply chains, including to many small firms. As defence-relevant technology increasingly interacts with rapid growth commercial technologies, defence spending can provide stimulus for dual-use innovations and a counter-cyclical source of revenue. Several countries are working to develop their own defence industries, and globally there is widespread appreciation for defence industrial employment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK government does not, and should not, spend defence money in the UK just to prop up disadvantaged regions. Nonetheless, the reality of 2025 is that assured defence capabilities look especially valuable. Russia has re-emerged as a hostile entity, and it seems the US can no longer be seen as a reliable ally to the UK. Moreover, there is little reason to think that defence spending at levels significantly higher than today would damage the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last 20 years of the Cold War, the UK government spent on average just under 5% of GDP per year on defence. Economic growth fluctuated significantly during this period, but the average was over 2% per year. In the last 20 years, defence has been just over 2% of GDP per year. Although growth rates during the same period fluctuated, the average annual growth has been just over 1.4%. If there has been a peace dividend, it has allowed governments to spend more on social welfare, health and education, which dominate government spending, but there is no obvious evidence that this helped economic growth. Overall, it appears that increasing defence spending in the UK would not necessarily be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The arguments in this paper are broadly compatible with the policy stances of both the current government and its predecessors, dating from around 2015. However, policy implementation is usually more challenging than policy formulation. Defence industrial policy can only be implemented through acquisition choices, and these choices can be shaped by a range of stakeholders with different, more focused priorities than supporting the UK economy. While the next iteration of the UK Defence Industrial Strategy should be closely studied, much will rest on how it is put into practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to the terrorist attack in Pahalgam, India launched Operation Sindoor on 7 May. Initially limited to strikes on terrorist-linked targets, the operation expanded over several days, with subsequent phases coinciding with Pakistani retaliation. Within hours of the first sorties, international media had seized on Pakistani allegations that their Chinese-built J-10s shot down up to five Indian aircraft, including three French-made Rafaels. In the absence of official clarification from India, the episode was swiftly recast in popular outlets as a technology shootout between Chinese and French fighters. Lost in the noise were the questions that mattered: What were India’s objectives? Were they achieved? And what does this operation reveal about the future trajectory of South Asian deterrence?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;losing-the-narrative&quot;&gt;Losing the Narrative&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any military campaign, shaping the strategic narrative is nearly as important as shaping the battlespace. Unfortunately, India ceded that narrative space. The initial silence from Indian military spokespeople created an information vacuum. Into that vacuum poured commentary that was often technically uninformed and strategically misleading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What emerged was a distorted framing of the conflict. Rather than serious analysis of India’s targeting methodology, command intent, or escalation thresholds, coverage focused instead on the air-to-air engagement that led to the loss of Indian aircraft.Undue prominence was given to the performance of specific platforms, with little regard for the broader operational context or the rules of engagement that shaped the encounter. As a result, Chinese arms manufacturers enjoyed a perceived PR win – one arguably disproportionate to the tactical or strategic context of the engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-quiet-operational-success&quot;&gt;A Quiet Operational Success&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That misleading narrative obscures a more consequential truth: despite Pakistani tactical successes, India appears to have largely achieved its stated objectives. On the opening day of strikes, the Indian Air Force (IAF) demonstrated a credible capacity to identify and destroy what New Delhi characterised as terrorist-linked infrastructure in Pakistani territory, employing stand-off weapons to deliver precision strikes at speed. In the following days, operations expanded in scope, penetrating Pakistan’s Chinese-supplied air defence network to target select forward airbases for the first time since the 1971 war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While losses were incurred, these must be evaluated against the scale and complexity of the mission – not simply tallied in isolation. The mere fact that the Indian Air Force could strike targets under defended conditions and undertake follow-on attacks demonstrates its capacity for coercive precision operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;restraint-under-fire&quot;&gt;Restraint Under Fire&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arguably more impressive than the operation’s reach was its restraint on the first day. According to Indian officials, pilots operated under strict rules of engagement that prohibited initiating attacks on Pakistani aircraft or pre-emptively suppressing air defence systems. This decision – to accept heightened operational risk in order to confine the conflict strictly to terrorist-linked infrastructure – is telling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It suggests a political leadership determined to signal its intent with clarity: India was not interested in initiating a conflict with the Pakistani state, but rather in degrading a specific ecosystem of terrorist violence that exists in the country. That some Indian aircraft were lost on the opening day of the operation was a direct consequence of a consciously limited rules of engagement. In effect, India accepted heightened operational risk in pursuit of clear strategic messaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such discipline in the face of a capable adversary is neither automatic nor easy. Yet it may well have prevented a broader escalation spiral. That alone deserves more analytical attention than it has received.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;escalation-managed&quot;&gt;Escalation, Managed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some reporting suggested that the region stood on the brink of nuclear war during Operation Sindoor. US President Donald Trump alleged that if the conflict had not ended when it did “…it could have been a bad nuclear war. Millions of people could have been killed.” These characterisations appear overstated in light of the facts on the ground. Unlike prior crises in South Asia, there were no public nuclear threats issued by either side, nor were there discernible moves toward strategic mobilisation. Rather than the brinkmanship so often invoked in academic literature on the subcontinent, what we saw instead was calibrated force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both New Delhi and Islamabad appeared to make deliberate choices about what not to do: India refrained from targeting Pakistani air defences or forward-deployed fighter aircraft in the early phases, while Pakistan retaliated against military targets but did not initiate large-scale mobilisation of its forces. The thresholds of escalation were tested, but not crossed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This conflict illustrates that limited military engagement under the shadow of nuclear weapons can be contained – provided escalation thresholds are mutually understood, signalling remains disciplined, and objectives are narrowly defined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some analysts have questioned how carefully escalation was managed during the conflict, the absence of nuclear signalling and the evident restraint by both sides suggests that this particular crisis was more contained than it first appeared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-new-normal&quot;&gt;The New Normal?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most significant legacy of Operation Sindoor is the precedent it sets. In the eyes of the Indian government, the use of cross-border force against terrorist-linked targets in Pakistan proper has now moved from exception to expectation. Whereas past crises often relied on signalling and symbolic action, future attacks on Indian soil – especially those traced to infrastructure across the border – are likely to draw a response of equal or greater magnitude to degrade the assets enabling terrorist action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of attempting to concretely link the terrorist incident to agents of the Pakistani state, the Indian government has taken the view that a failure to control or deny space to terrorist groups on Pakistani soil is sufficient to legitimate military action. Thus, India appears to have signalled a revised threshold for response, one that regional actors will have to factor into future risk assessments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;international-stakes&quot;&gt;International Stakes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The temptation among some external observers will be to treat Operation Sindoor as a contained South Asian episode with little wider relevance. This is a mistake. With India’s new posture, so long as Pakistan’s territory continues to serve as permissive environments for transnational terrorist infrastructure, the risk of periodic crises will persist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few examples better illustrate Pakistan’s long-standing role as a sanctuary for terrorist leadership than the discovery of Osama bin Laden in a compound just miles from the country’s premier military academy. Preventing the next Sindoor – or the next 26/11 – requires sustained international pressure to dismantle the networks that make these attacks possible in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sustaining-calibrated-deterrence&quot;&gt;Sustaining Calibrated Deterrence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Operation Sindoor demonstrated India’s ability to apply military power with restraint and precision, the durability of that approach will depend on how future crises are managed. India’s signal of intent to retaliate against cross-border terrorism marks a clear shift in posture. Yet deterrence by punishment carries inherent risks – chief among them the possibility that fringe actors may attempt to provoke confrontation in order to manipulate state responses. The continued viability of this approach may depend, in part, on the creation of complementary mechanisms for crisis management. Expanding communication channels – beyond existing National Security Advisor (NSA) and Director General of Military Operations (DGMO)–level contacts – could offer decision-makers greater flexibility to evaluate and contain emerging incidents. In a strategic environment shaped by tempo, perception, and public pressure, preserving space for discretion may be as vital as projecting resolve – particularly when domestic audiences may expect increasingly forceful responses in the wake of future provocations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equally salient is the operational challenge of maintaining the effectiveness of coercive military action over time. As targeted groups adapt – dispersing their assets, improving their concealment techniques, and altering their operational rhythms – the demands placed on India’s intelligence and targeting apparatus will intensify. The strategic interaction may increasingly resemble an iterative contest of adaptation, in which each side seeks to outpace the other’s capacity for detection and response. In that sense, the long-term viability of calibrated retaliation may rest not only on its political logic, but on the practical capacity to identify and neutralize meaningful targets in an increasingly evasive operating environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operation Sindoor should be remembered not as a dogfight between airframes, nor as a stumble toward strategic instability. It was a calibrated use of force, intended to signal resolve, degrade terrorist infrastructure, and demonstrate capability – without crossing the line into broader war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In doing so, it has redefined the contours of India’s response toolkit. What comes next will depend not only on India and Pakistan, but on whether the international community chooses to engage with the structures that give rise to such operations – or simply wait for the next one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rise of China and its growing assertiveness present both a challenge and an opportunity for the United States to strengthen its alliances and partnerships across Asia. While countries like Japan, South Korea, India, and the Philippines are increasingly alarmed by Chinese actions, U.S. efforts to coordinate with these allies are hindered by misaligned interests, weak institutions, occasionally overbearing American leadership, and China’s countercoercive strategies. Problems such as poor intelligence sharing, burdensome arms sales procedures, and limited multinational strategic planning hinder overall cooperation. The United States should institute a White House–led prioritization of China coordination, implement reforms to better respect allied political and economic needs, expand regional institutions like AUKUS and the Quad, and strengthen personal ties among defense and intelligence officials. Implementing these steps is essential to enhancing deterrence and warfighting capability in a rapidly shifting Indo-Pacific security environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rise of China and Beijing’s aggressiveness have alarmed countries across Asia. This growing fear—seen in Australia, India, Japan, the Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan, and other states—represents an opportunity for the United States to solidify, and build on, its partnerships in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s advancements in its military capabilities, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region, demand a coordinated response; no single nation can effectively manage this challenge alone. Indeed, close ties to allies and partners are a notable U.S. competitive advantage compared with China. These nations provide basing and access for U.S. forces, help deter aggressors, and ensure there is strong support in the face of Chinese economic coercion. They are often at the cutting edge of a range of defense-related innovations, such as directed energy weapons that use concentrated electromagnetic energy, rather than kinetic energy, to destroy targets, and advanced semiconductors. Should war break out, they would do much of the fighting—and the dying. Most U.S. operational plans include a major role for allies and partners, providing for basing, access, pre-positioning, logistics, and coalition operations. Protecting allied territory and populations would also be an important U.S. mission in many scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its competition with China, the United States needs to share intelligence, plan jointly, sell arms, and otherwise cooperate with a range of countries. Some of these, like Australia and Japan, are long-standing partners, but many other regional countries have not worked closely with the United States in the past. But even the United States’ closest allies face barriers that inhibit effective cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even when allies are rhetorically embraced, they are often treated as afterthoughts. Allies are not given timely and detailed intelligence against shared threats because of security concerns and cumbersome procedures. They are excluded from strategic planning even though their own roles are often central to U.S. plans. Allies are often encouraged to buy U.S. arms, but face barriers receiving advanced technologies and military equipment because of the cumbersome Foreign Military Sales (FMS) policy and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results are potentially catastrophic. Allies may be less aware of threats because they lack access to U.S. intelligence, contribute less to military operations when excluded from planning processes, and face delays acquiring vital weapons systems and integrating U.S. technologies into their armed forces. They may question U.S. willingness to support them in a crisis and thus be more receptive to overtures from China. These problems may lead to redundancies—or worse, gaps—as allies pursue their own intelligence and military capabilities, and perhaps even seek their own nuclear capacity, separate from those of the United States. Some allies may even question whether they should risk standing up to Chinese aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poor cooperation may also result in allies being surprised by or unprepared for a conflict, leading to higher casualties. They could be quickly overwhelmed because the United States did not help them prepare properly for various contingencies. The United States may need to deploy more of its own forces in response or otherwise step up its direct involvement even when allies would otherwise be willing and able to play a greater role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solving coordination and bureaucratic problems is necessary, though rarely glamorous. However, any effort to contain or otherwise counter China requires using all available resources, including those of allies and partners, efficiently and cost effectively. Relatively small changes in the U.S. approach can unlock tremendous benefits in the contributions of allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brief addresses three areas where the United States can strengthen its alliances and partnerships across Asia in peacetime in order to enhance deterrence against China and be better prepared for conflict: strategic planning, intelligence sharing, and arms sales. It draws heavily on (and at times takes text directly from) three other CSIS reports in this series on cooperation with allies and partners that examine ways to improve U.S. intelligence sharing, transform the Department of Defense’s multilateral strategic planning, and streamline U.S. arms sales. These earlier reports and thus this brief rely on interviews, discussions, and workshops with officials and experts; a literature review on the practice and theory of alliances; survey work of key partner states; and historical case studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper identifies four categories of challenges that hinder effective cooperation in any confrontation with China: competing interests and unclear priorities; weak institutions and cumbersome procedures; concerns about U.S. dominance; and potential Chinese countercoercion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States, however, is well positioned to manage these challenges. This can be achieved by prioritizing a White House–led effort focused on Asia, supporting Asian states in developing their own industrial bases and otherwise respecting their own political needs, improving regional institutions and expanding resources dedicated to cooperation with Asian allies, and bolstering personal ties whenever possible. Taken together, such steps will help solidify U.S. alliances and partnerships and, in so doing, enhance both deterrence and warfighting capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper first briefly lays out some of the challenges China poses to the United States and its allies. Second, it describes a range of problems and fears that inhibit strong partnerships in Asia. Third, it assesses how these problems might manifest in a confrontation with China. The paper concludes by offering recommendations for strengthening U.S. partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-china-challenge-a-brief-overview&quot;&gt;The China Challenge: A Brief Overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China poses an array of threats to the United States and its allies. Beijing is making aggressive claims in both the East China Sea and the South China Sea, infringing on the sovereignty of Japan, the Philippines, and other countries. China has made the assimilation of Taiwan a top priority, building up its conventional military and nuclear forces and turning them into a potentially formidable foe. More broadly, Beijing is seeking to challenge U.S. global dominance and create a new international order centered on China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of its effort to build military and economic power, China is methodically developing its defense industry. China’s arsenal grew by over 400 modern fighter aircraft and 20 major warships between 2021 and early 2024. China also more than doubled its ballistic and cruise missiles arsenal, developed a stealth bomber, and doubled the number of nuclear weapons it possesses. China is the world’s largest shipbuilder, with a military and commercial shipbuilding capacity that is roughly 230 times larger than that of the United States. In addition, China has become notably faster than the United States in acquiring weapons systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to a strong industrial base, China is moving increasingly close to Russia, Iran, and North Korea. Although these relationships are not institutionalized like NATO, they have already proven formidable. Russia has sustained its war in Ukraine with massive economic assistance from China, Iranian drone systems, and North Korean troops. It is plausible, and indeed likely, that these countries might assist China in any confrontation it has with the United States and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is engaged in a massive espionage campaign, seeking to penetrate the United States and allied governments. In 2023, the director-general of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) warned that Australia faced “unprecedented” threats from Chinese intelligence. This danger requires U.S. allies to have robust security protocols, which many of them lack. Chinese intelligence penetration of the Philippines and Taiwan, for example, is considerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is thus seeking to advance on multiple fronts. In addition to using its growing military prowess to bolster its aggressive regional foreign policy, Beijing is also using alliances with other anti-U.S. countries and its intelligence services to advance its agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fears-and-problems-of-allies-and-partners&quot;&gt;Fears and Problems of Allies and Partners&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the shared threat from China, U.S. cooperation with actual and potential allies and partners is uneven and fitful. Some reasons for this are inherent to any alliances, while others are due to U.S. policies and attitudes. The reasons can be grouped into four categories: competing interests and priorities; lack of institutionalization and cumbersome procedures; concerns about U.S. dominance and a lack of autonomy; and Beijing’s countercoercion. These issues are discussed in the context of intelligence sharing, multinational strategic planning, and arms sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-competing-interests-and-priorities&quot;&gt;1. Competing Interests and Priorities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and its allies often have competing interests, hindering military planning and other forms of cooperation. One South Korean official noted fears in his country that Europe and the Middle East would distract the United States from threats in Asia. Allies, for their part, often have different priorities: North Korea, not China, is Seoul’s top concern. Even when there is agreement on the threat, there may be disagreement on the response. Some regional states that fear China believe that accommodation is necessary, while others favor a more confrontational approach. One official pointed out that many in South Korea, while not sympathetic to China, do not share the U.S. view that China is an adversary that must be confronted, preferring a more stable relationship. The Philippines, which seeks U.S. support in its own maritime disputes with China, at the same time is hesitant to back Taiwan in a crisis. Making this more difficult, many U.S. partners in Asia do not trust each other: U.S. efforts to bring South Korea and Japan together have had multiple setbacks due to their bitter history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So-called “chain gangs,” where allies drag their partners into a conflict, are another problem where different interests lead to inadvertent conflict. U.S. leaders have feared that a Taiwanese declaration of formal independence would generate a backlash in China, which would in turn lead Beijing to go to war and force the United States to come to Taiwan’s defense. Thus U.S. officials have tried to assure Taiwan of U.S. support in a conflict with China while trying to prevent it from acting unilaterally, claiming that in such a scenario the United States would not back Taiwan. If U.S. support is too unconditional, Taipei may believe it has a shield against Chinese aggression even in scenarios where it, rather than Beijing, is changing the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as the United States worries about chain-gangs, so too do U.S. allies. NATO leaders have declared that they oppose any Chinese military efforts to control Taiwan, but European states have less concern about a China-Taiwan dispute than does the United States; as a result, they lack the extensive security relationships that the United States enjoys in Asia. Even a basic step such as NATO opening a liaison office in Japan was met with opposition within the alliance after Chinese concerns became clear. However, through NATO and other relationships, European states are tied to the United States, and it would be difficult for them to remain neutral in a U.S.-China conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mixed messages and unclear prioritization on the U.S. side have worsened these problems. Although the United States has emphasized Asia as its top area of security interest since the Obama administration, Europe, the Middle East, and (under the second Trump administration) Latin America have all competed for resources and senior-level attention. Part of this is due to the nature of the U.S. system, where multiple voices speak simultaneously on security and other issues. However, even within smaller communities there can be confusion, with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, combatant commands, and other entities within the U.S. defense establishment sending different signals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States, however, faces a dilemma: Increasing trust can, at times, lead allies and partners to do less, particularly when they have other priorities, such as emphasizing domestic spending over national security. A historic problem has been “buck-passing,” wherein allies free ride off their alliance with the United States or another power, not spending enough on their own militaries or otherwise not contributing their fair share. Although measures like military spending as a percentage of GDP are at best rough, it is clear that many at-risk Asian states are spending relatively little (often short of 2 percent) on their militaries. Many allies have failed to invest in basic capabilities, such as fuel storage and transport, as well as high-end systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-weak-institutions-and-cumbersome-procedures&quot;&gt;2. Weak Institutions and Cumbersome Procedures&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strong institutions can build trust, facilitate planning, reduce barriers to arms sales, promote interoperability, ease information sharing, and play many other important roles. Institutions create their own momentum, reinforcing habits of cooperation that in turn feed back into the sense of shared purpose and strategic alignment that birthed the institutions in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is, however, no Asian NATO. The institutions that do exist are valuable, but they are more limited in their size, scope, and integration. Four existing arrangements merit discussion: the Five Eyes, the Quad, AUKUS, and the Military Framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Five Eyes intelligence alliance, which grew out of the U.S.-UK World War II partnership, is often held up as the gold standard for intelligence sharing. The Five Eyes consists of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. As scholars have noted, the Five Eyes “is unique in the combination of its longevity, its resilience to changing global circumstances, and its ability to survive periodic tensions as well as maintain an ongoing similarity in the worldviews of its membership.” The countries involved share extensive intelligence related to foreign communications and methods of collection, as well as finished intelligence products. There is also some division of labor, with Australia monitoring South and East Asian communication while New Zealand covers the South Pacific and Southeast Asia. In recent years, cooperation has increased with regard to intelligence collection on China, with different members trying to expand their overall collection and coordinate regularly with others.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Quad, composed of the United States, Australia, India, and Japan, focuses on high-level coordination on issues like maritime security and natural disasters, with little day-to-day integration. Although all members worry about an assertive China, India has been reluctant to go beyond general joint statements. In 2022, however, the Quad launched the Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness, which provides an opportunity for expanding institutionalization and organizational structures in maritime areas related to law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A small but powerful alliance structure is AUKUS, a 2021 trilateral agreement between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States to equip Australia with a conventionally armed, nuclear-powered attack submarine and enhance cooperation on advanced capabilities, including arms sales. This has included limited trilateral planning through the rotational presence of U.S. and UK submarines in Australia. The United States, United Kingdom, and Australia have also established the International Joint Requirements Oversight Council (I-JROC) as a forum for the vice chiefs of defense in the three countries to review joint and combined warfighting concepts as they develop.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Military Framework is a U.S.-led forum of 14 countries that began with a focus on the Islamic State militant group. In recent years, however, it has expanded its scope to address strategic competition in both Europe and in Asia, with an eye toward improving planning and intelligence sharing. The Military Framework and the Five Eyes have members from Asia, but key countries such as South Korea are not included.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these institutions are valuable, but none include all of the key countries in the region that the United States would work with in a confrontation with China. Others do not involve detailed integration and planning or efforts to facilitate arms sales. The strongest—AUKUS and the Five Eyes—are particularly narrow in both their composition and function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the U.S. efforts with allies and partners in the region are bilateral. These include the U.S.-Philippines Salaknib exercises or the U.S.-Republic of Korea Freedom Shield exercises; bilateral wargaming such as the U.S.-Japan Integrated Air and Missile Defense Wargame; and various dialogues and working groups. There are also formal joint commands, such as that with South Korea. The United States has extensive, but uneven, bilateral intelligence sharing relationships with key countries in Asia beyond the Five Eyes, such as Japan and South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States sets its own intelligence collection requirements, as do most allies; this can make resource issues more pronounced. Because collection is not coordinated, the United States often does not know what information allies—even Five Eyes countries—already have, thus reducing the economy of efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to insufficient military spending, allies and partners often have weaker counterintelligence capabilities than the United States, which inhibits sharing. Allies often lack Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet) access and similar systems designed for sharing highly classified information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because institutions are weak, cooperation depends more on personal relationships. These types of relationships allow a margin for error: When things, inevitably, do not go as expected, interpersonal relationships allow for creative solutions and workarounds that the standard institutional processes cannot generate in a timely way. Relationships formed when sharing intelligence or making joint plans can pay off in numerous ways during a crisis and help overcome bureaucratic complexities. In many cases, however, U.S. officials deployed to non-English speaking countries do not know the local language and at times have limited background on the country’s history and strategic situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to weak institutions for coordination with partners, the U.S. system is bureaucratically complex and technically difficult to access, which inhibits bilateral cooperation. The United States also often defaults to NOFORN (Not Releasable to Foreign Nationals) classifications, hindering planning, intelligence sharing, and information about arms sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when institutionalization works, information sharing and coordination are often confined to military, intelligence, or other technocratic problems, with a lack of commensurate dialogue at the political level. This hinders broader strategic planning, as key actors are often not present. In addition, allies may receive different signals from military officers versus political leaders, making it harder for them to understand U.S. objectives and priorities. Indeed, the non-military side may be going in the wrong direction. A U.S. official responsible for security cooperation noted that the military is the front end working with partners, but civilians are the back end, and the latter do not have enough capacity to keep up with constant demands in Asia. The official pointed out that personnel cuts to the civilian workforce will harm military efforts at security cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-concerns-about-us-dominance&quot;&gt;3. Concerns About U.S. Dominance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cooperation with the United States creates autonomy issues for allies and partners. U.S. budgets and capabilities dwarf those of even wealthy allies like Japan, and thus partners can benefit tremendously from U.S. assistance. At the same time, however, specialization of partners to avoid duplication or reliance on U.S. intelligence, logistics, or other capabilities leaves partners vulnerable if the United States sees its interests differently during a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States at times worsens this problem with its tendency toward unilateralism. During Desert Shield, an important U.S. operational plan (OPLAN 1002-90) did not account for Saudi logistics capacity, which led to the overallocation of U.S. logistics assets to Saudi Arabia and the ad hoc incorporation of Saudi logistics capacities by local-level leaders. In the end, this error meant little due to the enormous coalition military advantage over Iraq, but a war with China would depend heavily on effective logistics, and similar errors could be disastrous. In Afghanistan, the United States took greater control over planning as the insurgency worsened in order to improve overall speed. Plans, however, were often implemented before NATO validation, and the contributions of U.S. allies were often more limited as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allies see multinational planning as initiated, led, and dominated by the United States, and this is difficult when allies have their own interests and views of how to fight a conflict. One former U.S. official noted that the United States often believes it understands the interests of allies better than they themselves do—even as U.S. policies and priorities regularly flip-flop. U.S. stances are, or can be perceived as, arrogant and uninformed at times: A “daddy knows best” approach, as the official described it. In arms sales, U.S. procedures are designed to reduce U.S. purchases from allies and partners, leading to resentment when the United States pushes allies to purchase U.S. systems. In general, building domestic industry capacity is a top goal of allies, which they see as vital economically and also a way to bolster deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nationalism and local politics often complicate other countries’ relationships with the United States, making open coalition planning and formal alliances more difficult. In general, states do not like to openly rely on other states for their security, as it implies government weakness. In addition, world opinion of the United States varies considerably by country and historical period, often creating pressure on governments to publicly distance themselves from Washington. In some important countries relevant to potential China-related contingencies, such as Vietnam and the Philippines, the United States has a history of conflict, generating additional suspicions. When the United States acts without consulting allies, the political consequences can be considerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4-countercoercion&quot;&gt;4. Countercoercion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because allies are often weaker and closer to potential aggressors, the cost of betting on the wrong horse is higher. As one foreign official noted, “Allies have less room to say ‘oops’.” This is a problem for allies in Asia, where China is near and the United States is far away. Thus, they are highly vulnerable to Chinese military and gray zone pressure, particularly if the United States is not there to back them up. Sam Roggeveen, a former Australian intelligence analyst, notes that greater U.S. military ties to Australia—including the construction of air bases in the country that host U.S. forces—“conflates America’s strategic objectives in Asia with ours, and it makes those bases a target.” Similarly, a South Korean official noted, “Being on the side of the United States is not cost free,” adding that “South Korea cannot wish away geography.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is also an important trading partner for allies in Asia, and it weaponizes these economic relations when its political positions are challenged, imposing selective boycotts on imports from the offending country or otherwise imposing restrictions. This threat has shaped the behavior of even close U.S. allies. New Zealand, for example, has feared alienating China, and thus its intelligence partners have at times been reluctant to cooperate with it. As one expert put it, “the Kiwis are reluctant to say ‘boo’ to China.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. allies and partners worry that the United States will not honor its promises to them, making them more sensitive to the risks involved in crossing China. This concern has grown in the Trump administration, as the United States has criticized many long-standing allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-these-problems-inhibit-cooperation-against-china&quot;&gt;How These Problems Inhibit Cooperation Against China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a confrontation with China, problems related to intelligence sharing, strategic planning, and arms sales could prove catastrophic. These would hinder deterrence, making a conflict more likely; undermine responses to Chinese coercion before and during a crisis; and hinder the U.S. and partner response should a shooting war with China break out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problems may begin with different threat perceptions. Some valuable information may fail to reach allies. One Japanese intelligence official noted that they rarely see U.S. information in their day-to-day work. This, in turn, affects threat perceptions and attitudes toward the United States. Allies may prove slower to recognize aggression from Beijing in the absence of salient U.S. intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lack of trust occurring due to different interests and a limited and slow supply of critical weapons systems may inhibit allied confidence in U.S. security guarantees. This in turn may weaken deterrence and create incentives for nuclear proliferation. Allies may be more willing to bandwagon with a potential aggressor if they are unsure that the United States will back them or if they believe close ties to the United States will “chain gang” them into an unwanted war. Some partners and allies might turn to China or other providers for weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In such circumstances, it is far easier for Chinese countercoercion to function. Allies and partners will fear that they are too weak or that the United States will not back them—or both—and they will not have a coordinated response to Beijing’s military and economic pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing may believe that poorly armed and trained U.S. allies create an offense-dominant environment in which a fast strike would succeed while a more prolonged conflict would fail, as the United States would then step up its support. China may also believe that allies with poorly armed militaries and weak defense industrial bases will be easy pickings. This perception is especially likely if they believe that the victim state has weak intelligence and could be caught by surprise. Chinese leaders may also reason that differing U.S. and allied interests will allow them to find cracks in any alliance, posing challenges in areas where one party has less of an interest, such as China staking a claim to tiny, unpopulated islands in the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cooperation is likely to suffer both before and during a crisis. Military operations depend on a wide range of tactical information, and, as one allied official put it, “Bad intelligence means bad plans.” Allied military forces may have suboptimal postures, fail to be prepared for a confrontation, or lack personal relations that can facilitate cooperation during a crisis. As one official put it, key figures may be exchanging business cards as they meet for the first time rather than rolling up their sleeves to work. Interoperability at all levels would pose tremendous challenges. This would include allies and partners having weapons systems from non-U.S., perhaps even Chinese, manufacturers, but also unfamiliarity due to insufficient preparedness, limited training, and coalition-wide military exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a conflict, a lack of effective coalition planning may lead the United States to wrongly assume that allies will take on roles for which they are unprepared or unwilling, while conversely allies may wrongly assume that the United States will manage difficult aspects of a conflict, such as air supremacy or strategic lift, without fully understanding U.S. limits. Allies that are poorly trained and lack access to high-end military systems will be less able to counter air supremacy, deny sea lanes to adversary shipping, prevent cyberattacks, or otherwise act on their own. This increases the risk that the United States would enter a shooting war from a position of weakness and that, during a conflict, it would not be able to take full advantage of allied and partner capabilities and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To improve cooperation with allies against China, the United States should consider four steps: improving prioritization; respecting allied politics; strengthening Asia-focused institutions; and bolstering personal ties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-prioritize-coordination-on-challenges-related-to-china&quot;&gt;1. Prioritize Coordination on Challenges Related to China&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government, in the best of times, involves a welter of competing bureaucracies with different missions and concerns, which in turn make different and competing demands on allies and partners. When the United States prioritizes a concern, as the Biden administration did after the 2022 full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, the resulting chaos can be overcome, but this is the exception, not the rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A high-level working group on China, run out of the White House, should coordinate planning, arms sales, intelligence sharing, and other requests from China-facing allies to ensure they are given top priority. Examples would include ensuring that intelligence-sharing procedures are streamlined for key countries in Asia and that ITAR; Technology, Security, and Foreign Disclosure (TSFD); and FMS processes do not hinder arms sales. Coordination would also ensure that U.S. guidance to allies and partners is clear and does not conflict at different bureaucratic levels. Working with Congress to reduce the number of Congressional authorizations for sales that are not strategically sensitive and do not involve the most sophisticated systems could speed up the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prioritization should then occur when U.S. officials engage allies in bilateral and multilateral forums in Asia. This will be a back-and-forth, with the United States adjusting its priorities in response to allied concerns as well as encouraging allies to embrace U.S. priorities. In the end, U.S. priorities will not be achieved without allied assistance, so accommodating their concerns is vital for ultimate U.S. success. Ideally, this would be bipartisan, as allied and partner cooperation will span administrations and suffers when U.S. priorities oscillate. Intelligence sharing also plays a role here. One former allied official noted that U.S. assessments shaped their own country’s worldview in dozens of small ways that, over time, brought the two countries into greater alignment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-respect-allied-politics-and-economics&quot;&gt;2. Respect Allied Politics and Economics&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as arms sales and other forms of cooperation bolster the U.S. economy, so too can military cooperation help allies’ economies and their willingness to work with the United States. In particular, a “build allied” approach allows the United States to better achieve important goals, such as more rapid shipbuilding, while benefiting allied economies, making cooperation much easier for them politically and giving them a vested interest that will transcend various administrations. Collaborative ventures can be particularly valuable, increasing economies of scale and enabling the United States to profit from allied arms sales and vice versa. However, the U.S. bureaucratic incentives all go in the other direction. As one interviewee noted, “no one gets fired for buying American.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, Washington must recognize that the unpopularity of the United States and allied concerns for autonomy may at times make cooperation difficult. Improving cooperation often requires behind-the-scenes engagement rather than open pressure, accepting that allies will differ with the United States, at times publicly, and letting allies take the lead in visible ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-strengthen-institutional-ties-and-expand-the-circle&quot;&gt;3. Strengthen Institutional Ties and Expand the Circle&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. alliances and partnerships in Asia may never mirror those in Europe, but they can be strengthened. Expanded, AUKUS-like arrangements with Japan and South Korea would be highly valuable, and the Philippines should also receive extra attention. Outside AUKUS, the United States could consider coordinating arms sales and FMS cases for countries like Japan and South Korea to speed up the process so both can advance together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the Quad is among the weaker of the existing institutions in Asia, there is hope for invigorating it. President Donald Trump’s good relations with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and the recent commitment to deepen the U.S.-India defense relationship, could be used to address India’s concerns and improve alignment over the Quad’s role and purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should also begin the long process of expanding and institutionalizing intelligence cooperation with key Asian allies outside the Five Eyes. This will involve technological upgrades on the allies and partner side and procedural changes on the U.S. side to reduce the automatic default to NOFORN. In addition, the United States will need to start with more limited sharing and build from there as allies and partners improve their counterintelligence and, over time, harmonize their collection efforts with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. systems are complex for partners and allies to navigate, and they are made worse when the United States lacks the personnel to ensure prompt responses. More liaison officers for joint planning and intelligence sharing are necessary, as is more training for both U.S. and allied officials on the complexities of U.S. procedures, so their requests can avoid common pitfalls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4-build-stronger-personal-connections&quot;&gt;4. Build Stronger Personal Connections&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multinational efforts can also improve personal connections and, in so doing, build trust that is invaluable during a crisis. In addition, these connections are vital for work-arounds when institutional cooperation is slow or otherwise insufficient. As the Military Framework’s official history notes, “The most precious ‘product’ of the framework is neither tangible nor measurable. It is instead something elusive and sublime: trust.” Expanding the circle for institutions will strengthen personal connections, as will increasing personnel. A particular effort should be made to increase the number of speakers of Asian languages who work with allies and to ensure that rotations and assignments to Asia help build long-term expertise and personal connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-benefits-of-greater-cooperation&quot;&gt;The Benefits of Greater Cooperation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These recommendations, taken together, can improve planning, make partner militaries stronger, and bolster sharing in general. With common or compatible systems, procedures, and communication protocols, allied forces can coordinate actions more efficiently, respond faster to emerging threats, and achieve objectives with greater precision. Intelligence relationships can also bolster overall diplomacy and alliance strength. By sharing capabilities, resources, and information, interoperability leads to more efficient use of military assets and more coordinated responses. Demonstrating military interoperability also sends a clear message about the solidity of alliances and the collective commitment to maintaining international security and order. Integrated command and control systems enable allied forces to deploy and operate together effectively on short notice, helping allies to leverage each other’s strengths and compensate for individual limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with allies and partners can be frustrating and is always time-consuming. The results are invariably incomplete, and the benefits difficult to measure in peacetime. Strong alliances, however, are the bedrock of deterrence and warfighting: They can help the United States avoid a war with China through effective deterrence and, should deterrence fail, enable the United States to triumph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;US defence policy and planning will increasingly focus on preparing for possible military conflict with China. The trade war between the two could accelerate tensions and planning on both sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The policy will be more transactional, requiring allies and partners to assume greater responsibility for defending their countries and regions, underwriting the costs of US bases and activities, and expecting them to continue to buy US equipment in large volumes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At home, there will be attempts to refocus US defence towards better securing and defending the US homeland. The DoD will need to square the circle between the trillion-dollar defence budget Trump has mooted and the cost-cutting exercises in train. Key areas for investment will include accelerating force modernisation and missile defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these strands could overlap or combine this Summer: at the NATO Summit in June, in the event of a ceasefire in Ukraine (or major falling-out between the US and Russia) and in case of major Israeli strikes against Iran’s nuclear facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new National Defence Strategy is due to be completed by the end of August. We should expect a short, punchy document setting out principles, tasks and priorities rather than a detailed blueprint for future US force structure and capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-approach&quot;&gt;Policy Approach&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the first 100 days of the President Trump’s second presidency, his economic policy approach and foreign policy priorities became clearer, with the contours of his defence policy now firming up to become increasingly consequential as the year progresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as the “America First” principle, key themes of US defence policy include: stopping current wars and preventing new ones; restoring US military strength and rebuilding the US defence industrial base; requiring allies and partners to pay more for their own defence and their regions’ security; strengthening US borders and stepping up protection against potential missile attacks on the US; and rebalancing US capability planning and force posture to prepare for a future conflict with China – as “the pacing threat”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Washington post reported in March the headlines of a secret internal planning document, the Interim National Defence Strategic Guidance, which provides a prioritisation framework for officials to turn these defence policy themes into plans, activities and operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assessment in the executive summary above assumes a relatively orderly approach to implementation of this policy approach. Trump’s approach to foreign policy, tariffs and trade show that he is prepared to take significant risks. It remains to be seen whether his approach to defence will remain within the contours that have emerged so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of May, Defence Secretary Hegseth issued a memorandum directing the development of a new National Defence Strategy to help deliver Trump’s twin imperatives of putting “America First” and delivering “Peace Through Strength”. It is due to be completed by the end of August, with an unclassified version probably available in September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;use-of-military-force&quot;&gt;Use of Military Force&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tump authorised the first military action of this administration, against the Houthis in Yemen, in March. US-led attacks increased in scale over several weeks. On 6th May Trump announced that the Houthis had agreed to stop attacks against international shipping in the Red Sea, and in response he was suspending attacks against Houthi targets in Yemen. The Houthis have subsequently said that attacks against Israel will continue. There is speculation that this “truce” will end after Trump’s tour to the Gulf this week concludes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand Trump’s attitude to the military instrument requires looking back to his first term. In 2017, Trump inherited a major coalition campaign already underway against ISIS, but US operations against the organisation intensified and culminated under his leadership. He eventually presided over its final territorial defeat in Syria in 2019 (and, with some fanfare the special forces operation which led to the death of its leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi). The coalition later assessed at least 80,000 ISIS casualties during operations against the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Publicly hostile to long-term military commitments, beyond the Counter-ISIS campaign, Trump authorised relatively few military operations in his first term – but those he did sign-off were significant (notably strikes against Bashar Al-Assad’s Syria after use of chemical weapons and the targeted killing of IRGC Quds Force Commander Qassem Soleimani).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite his own personal interest in being perceived as a peacemaker, he could be prepared to resort to the military instrument more regularly – and potentially at scale – during his second term if he judges that circumstances require such responses. As well as the operations against the Houthis, the US bombed targets in Somalia, Iraq and Syria in the past three months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump will want to avoid the military entanglements and longer-term commitments of which he has been so dismissive. So, he will prefer the precise and occasional use of naval and air power – and particularly stand-off missile strikes – to the use of land forces wherever possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The build-up of US forces in the Middle East now underway would provide the capability to undertake a range of operations if circumstances required. The US is actively discouraging Israel from any attack against Iran’s nuclear programme this summer and is investing heavily in diplomacy designed to reach a new nuclear deal with Iran. But in the event that Israel ignores this counsel and mounts independent large-scale attacks against Iran, and Iran retaliates at scale, it seems likely that the US would be drawn into the conflict. Any such conflict could well be protracted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Middle East, the US has been clear that it will not provide a “backstop” security guarantee for Ukraine or support for a European assurance force in the event of a ceasefire or peace deal there. More broadly, the US commitment to the NATO Article V guarantee seems weaker than at any time since it was agreed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closer to the US, DoD planners have been asked to draw up options to increase the US troop presence in Panama. Defence Secretary Hegseth visited last month and has spoken of “reviving” US military bases there. Further covert US military action against the cartels in Mexico and Venezuela seems possible – surveillance operations over Mexico are being stepped-up and the US military is taking control of land along the US-military border. Ecuador’s president said recently that he would welcome US military assistance in his “war” against the cartels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Direct US military action against Greenland seems unlikely, but it would not be surprising to see the US military presence at its space base there being increased, perhaps quite substantially. That would enable the US to declare effective military control over Greenland if circumstances required it – in US eyes. A US military attack against Canada seems inconceivable; continuing economic coercion seems highly likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither the US nor China want to go to war over Taiwan. But both are actively preparing for major operations in that area. The risks are increasing sharply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-people&quot;&gt;The People&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with other areas, major US defence policy decisions will continue to be made by Trump and his immediate inner circle. But Trump has no background in defence, the DoD is a huge, complex bureaucracy and defence planning is a long-term business. So, the top team in the Pentagon should have increasing influence as Trump’s second term progresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Defence Secretary Hegseth and his deputy, Stephen Feinberg, have little relevant defence experience (Hegseth’s position is also in doubt after his own role in the “Signal” controversy, as well as firing several of his own personal advisers). On the military side, having removed Charles Brown as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Trump has replaced him with a retired 3-star Air Force officer, Dan Caine, who has now been confirmed by the Senate. He has also removed a string of other senior military personnel and national security staff. There are concerns that, after public disagreements with a series of strong-minded Defence Secretaries and Chairmen during his first term, Trump is appointing figures who will demonstrate the personal loyalty he prizes – and be less likely to obstruct his plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major contours of US defence policy are instead likely to be set by Elbridge Colby, who was confirmed by the Senate last month as Under Secretary for Defence Policy. He is a China hawk and critic of European defence spending. He will reinforce arguments for re-setting US defence policy, posture and planning towards preparing for a conflict with China. He will argue for withdrawing some US forces from Europe and spoke last week about the need for the Europeans to assume much greater responsibility for and focus more directly on security in this region. He supports AUKUS in principle but has suggested that the US will need to re-think its commitment to providing Virginia-class submarines to Australia in advance of building up the US attack submarine fleet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colby will author the new US National Defence Strategy. The strategy he produced in 2018 was well regarded, including for its qualities of brevity and clarity. We should expect another short, punchy document setting out principles, tasks and priorities for US defence rather than a detailed blueprint for future US force structure and capabilities. The prospectus he spoke to at Policy Exchange last summer and during his Senate confirmation hearing will likely be reflected in this new strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above the Pentagon, four figures other than Trump will be particularly influential. Vice President Vance’s position on European security and disdain for allies is very clear. On defence matters, we should expect him to be aligned with the positions Colby is advocating. Analysts in the defence community hold that Stephen Miller, Trump’s Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy sees major reductions in the defence budget as possible, and that Russell Vought, the director of the Office for Management and Budget, shares his view. Elon Musk’s views are starker still, although he now seems to be losing ground and influence as he steps back from his role in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Nonetheless, we expect the cost-cutting and efficiency initiatives he set in motion will continue to influence federal agencies, including DoD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This quartet is likely to be influential and hands-on in the approach Trump takes to driving through plans to re-set military commitments overseas and reform US defence at home. It remains to be seen whether Marco Rubio or whoever succeeds him as NSA chooses to play a major role in setting defence policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;re-setting-us-defence-overseas&quot;&gt;Re-setting US Defence Overseas&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European theatre will be an early test-case for how the US intends to re-set its overseas commitments. A set of steps/measures could include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Withdrawing progressively up to a third of current US combat forces from Europe, mainly from Germany, potentially some from UK, Poland, Italy and Spain, and rotational forces from the Baltics and Romania.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Progressively withdrawing key capabilities and enablers, particularly command and control capabilities, air defence, armour and artillery, deep strike capabilities, air and space-based ISR, AAR and transport aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Explicitly linking a US commitment to Article V only to those allies that satisfy certain conditions, including levels of defence spending.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More radically, and less formally, the US nuclear guarantee could be diluted by equivocation about using US nuclear weapons in the defence of Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some capabilities and enablers would be redeployed to the Asia-Pacific theatre, others would return to the US. More importantly, US contingency planning seems likely to quite significantly adjust downwards assumptions about the scale of reinforcements the US would be prepared to deploy to Europe in the event of a major crisis there. In the scenario above, the US would continue to sell platforms, weapons and other systems to European nations (insofar as they wish to buy them in future) and provide effective support to in-service capabilities and systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secretary of State (now also NSA) Rubio offered European members of NATO reassurances in Brussels at the start of April that the US would re-set its approach to European security in a measured way. And some US figures, including outgoing SACEUR, General Cavoli, are stressing that a strong US presence in Europe contributes to US national security by defending the US homeland forward, allowing the US to project combat power globally, and deterring Russian aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But from Trump down, senior US figures are united behind the demand the European members of NATO should spend 5% of their GDP on defence and take greater responsibility for the defence of Europe. Most will regard this target as an unrealistic negotiating ploy. NATO Secretary General Rutte is working to find creative ways to bridge this gap. These issues could well come to a head at the NATO Summit in the Hague between 24-26 June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There would be a major gap to fill in the second half of this decade as and when the US enacts the changes set out above – or goes further. Major European defence players are reportedly drawing up plans to take on greater responsibilities for the continent’s defence, on the basis of a managed transfer over the next 5-10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the current US military build-up in the Middle East region and the growing possibility of a major crisis there this year, we do not expect the US to make any significant adjustments to the current US basing-arrangements in the region until after this tension has subsided – or the crisis has played itself out (though the US military presence in Syria is being trimmed). Thereafter, the US is likely to continue to adopt a mercantile approach to US military presence in the region, maintaining bases and forces in countries who pay for those bases and buy significant amounts of US military equipment. Trump will be well satisfied with the major financial commitments he received from leaders in the Gulf this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reforming-us-defence&quot;&gt;Reforming US Defence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picture on reforming US defence at home is less clear. Some announcements have been contradictory. One of Hegseth’s first moves was to announce that he would significantly re-balance US defence towards Trump’s new national security priorities, and remove 8% of the budget, circa $50 billion, allocated to non-core activities over the next five years. A major set of programmes that would be exempted from these measures, including the nuclear programme, Virginia-class submarines, uncrewed systems and the Air Force’s emerging uncrewed fighter jet program, surface ships, cybersecurity, munitions and homeland missile defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together this list of programmes accounts for the vast majority of the DoD’s equipment spend. It follows that, in order to deliver these reductions, the DoD would need to take an aggressive approach to delivering the core programmes more cost-efficiently, cutting back non-core programmes and reducing the costs of the civilian and contractor workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two constituencies will potentially stand in the way of this approach. The defence-industrial complex in the US has adapted slowly over the past several decades, despite the reformist zeal shown by more effective teams than the new management in the Pentagon. And Congress has always played a significant role in the oversight of defence policy, plans and particularly the defence budget. Senior Republicans might yet find their voices on these issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of last month, Trump spoke of increasing the US defence budget to $1 trillion (up from circa $890 billion this US financial year). Neither the DoD nor White House has provided any detail on how this uplift would be spent. The “Golden Dome” missile defence system Trump has spoken of could absorb a significant element, as would widespread force modernisation. The defence budget request for the year ahead is expected in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the picture on US defence should be clearer by the end of the summer, when several of the issues described above will have developed or played-out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the 2014 Wales Summit, the UK country spearheaded the formation of a multi-national military partnership – the Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF). The announcement elicited only a moderate degree of attention and reaction at the time. But more than a decade later, it has proven to be a remarkable and surprising success in keeping the peace in Northern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An often overlooked but strategically vital part of Europe – the Western Balkans – now stands at a critical turning-point. Decades of peacebuilding risk being undermined by secessionism and increasingly militant local nationalisms, both emboldened by Russian interference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Croatia, Slovenia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Albania are in NATO – but as long as Bosnia and Kosovo remain outside of the Alliance, they will remain deeply vulnerable to external interference. In the absence of their membership in the trans-Atlantic community, these two countries have remained the prime target of Serbian and Russian meddling in recent years. This could cascade into greater instability, and even warfare, in the Balkans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This situation can be changed by thinking outside the box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-origins-of-the-jef&quot;&gt;The Origins of the JEF&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The origins of the Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) date back to 2010, when the UK Ministry of Defence established the Northern Group concept. The Northern Group includes the five Nordic countries, the three Baltic states, as well as Poland, Germany, and the Netherlands. Three main factors motivated the creation of this grouping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the UK is a Northern European country with corresponding security interests. At the time, much of the strategic focus was on counterinsurgency operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. As a result, British policymakers appeared to lose sight of the enduring threat posed by Russia, and London’s broader role in European security. The 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review placed an emphasis on boosting “Alliances and Partnerships,” stating that the UK should seek “new models of practical bilateral defence and security co-operation with a range of allies and partners.” As a key power in the region, the UK had both the interest and the responsibility to assume a more proactive leadership role in Northern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Northern Europe needed greater co-ordination and co-operation on security matters. There was significant overlap and fragmentation among the various existing regional security arrangements. For example, in 2010, Finland and Sweden were members of the European Union but not of NATO. Norway was a NATO member but not part of the EU. Denmark was in both the EU and NATO, but had a special opt-out from the EU’s Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). The Northern Group demonstrated that traditional diplomacy and multilateral engagement could still enhance regional security – defence co-operation need not be confined to or directed by large institutional frameworks like NATO or the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the creation of a multinational security platform in Northern Europe served a domestic political purpose. It allowed Conservative ministers in the coalition government with the Liberal Democrats to show that scepticism toward Brussels was not synonymous with being “anti-European.” At a time when Euroscepticism was beginning to rise in the UK, initiatives like the Northern Group helped communicate that London was not abandoning Europe – even as debates about the UK’s relationship with the EU intensified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These developments eventually led to the establishment of the JEF in 2014. For the Nordic and Baltic states, the JEF has become a flexible, predictable and capable source of deterrence in Northern Europe. This 10,000-strong force – “committed to upholding peace, stability, and international law” – has consistently punched above its weight. Rather than undermining existing defence efforts, the JEF has complemented them, helping to turn the ambitious goals of the Nordic Defence Co-operation (NORDEFCO) into a reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The JEF has demonstrated its ability to address today’s most pressing geopolitical challenges. It has been a steadfast supporter of Ukraine, and there have been growing calls from key officials and ministers to invite Ukraine to participate in the future. The JEF could also play a constructive role in any future ceasefire or post-war security arrangement between Ukraine and Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has praised the JEF’s support, attending a JEF summit and urging its members to “help yourselves by helping us.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The durability and popularity of JEF is a testimony to its success. It has even been touted as a model for addressing wider Indo-Pacific theatre and emerging global security issues more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bjef-is-needed&quot;&gt;BJEF is Needed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is another region that also requires a more focused UK role: the Balkans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the same factors that prompted the creation of the Northern Group and the Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) also apply to the UK’s approach to the Balkans and support the case for establishing a Balkans Joint Expeditionary Force (BJEF) led by the UK and including the seven Balkans countries of Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Slovenia (Henceforth, the BJEF-7).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, Britain has a long historical involvement in the region dating back to the 19th century. More recent history – whether the events of 1914 or the wars of the 1990s – demonstrates that instability in the Balkans often reverberates across Europe, including the UK. While the UK is not itself a Balkan country, it can act like a Balkan power, as the region remains closely tied to Britain’s security and broader strategic interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, as in Northern Europe, the Balkans comprise a complex patchwork of overlapping security and organisational affiliations. Croatia and Slovenia are members of both NATO and the EU. Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Albania are in NATO but not the EU. Bosnia and Herzegovina is in neither but is a candidate for NATO membership and hosts the EU’s largest military operation through EUFOR. Kosovo – while not recognised by all NATO and EU member states – strives for deeper integration with the Euro-Atlantic community and currently hosts NATO’s largest ongoing military operation through KFOR. Despite this fragmented institutional landscape, the countries of the region face shared security challenges. The UK is well positioned to serve as a framework nation and convening power for a JEF-style force in the Balkans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is a domestic political incentive for London to act. The UK has been a leading European power for centuries, and this will continue regardless of its EU membership status. Moreover, the Labour Party was recently elected on a platform that included a commitment to establish a new security relationship with the European Union. Focusing UK-EU defence cooperation on the Balkans would be an ideal way to build confidence between London and Brussels – while also demonstrating to Washington that Europe is willing to shoulder a greater share of the security burden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;geopolitical-and-security-challenges-in-the-balkans&quot;&gt;Geopolitical and Security Challenges in the Balkans&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirty years after the Dayton Peace Agreement brought an end to the Bosnian War, the Balkans remain an area of unfinished business for Euro-Atlantic integration and continue to represent a source of instability in the continent’s immediate neighbourhood. Aside from Ukraine, it is Europe’s most persistent geopolitical challenge. Following the violent wars of the 1990s that accompanied the dissolution of Yugoslavia, Europe and the United States helped stabilise the region through sustained peacekeeping and diplomatic engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, times have changed. With the US and Europe unwilling or unable to engage meaningfully in the Balkans, a deep power vacuum has emerged in the region that outside actors like Russia and China are rushing to fill. The challenges in the Balkans are threefold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the past risks repeating itself if the West/Britain fails to learn its lessons. Serbia is where Russia was in 2014, intoxicated by historical grievances, anti-Western sentiment, and engaging in “wolf-warrior” diplomacy. Unfortunately, the EU, US and UK have met this sabre-rattling with equivocation and weakness. Seeing Serbia’s success with this approach, others have increasingly followed their lead, including Croatia and Hungary, who now routinely interfere in the domestic politics of Bosnia and Kosovo. (NB: Croatia has excellent links to Kosovo, mainly due to Kosovo being seen as a counterbalance to Serbia).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, Serbia has matched such rhetoric with action – the “Serbian World” agenda is in full swing, inspired by Slobodan Milosevic’s “Greater Serbia”. President Vucic has been called “The Political Son of Milosevic” and has taken Serbia down an increasingly illiberal and irredentist path. Serbian rearmament, the planned introduction of conscription, and the illegal deployment of troops to the Kosovan border are no accidents – they are part of this broader strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, across the Balkans, with the exception of KFOR, there is no credible and effective deterrence to meet this challenge. EUFOR has been hollowed out, and the lack of a robust NATO and EU commitment to the region has created a power vacuum which adversaries have exploited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has fuelled and embraced the rising discord in the region. Russia has provided extensive political, economic, and diplomatic support to Serbia and secessionists in Bosnia’s Republika Srpska entity. The Russian Ambassador even remarked that ’In the case of practical rapprochement of Bosnia and Herzegovina and NATO, our country will have to react to this hostile act’. Yet the vast majority of Bosnians – including a significant minority of Bosnian Serbs – support NATO membership, and the 2005 “Law on Defence” clearly stated the ambition to join NATO, and committed officials to prepare the country’s legal architecture for the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, Russia continues to block international recognition of Kosovo, to embolden secessionists in the Republic Srpska entity, while seeking to expand their “near monopoly on the oil and gas market” in the region. Russian sympathizers in Bosnia’s Croat nationalist HDZ also continue to block the country’s decoupling from Russian gas. Moscow’s “War on Truth” disinformation campaigns, spearheaded by state-backed media forces such as RT and Sputnik, have also fuelled the rising anti-Western sentiment in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could escalate into armed conflict if the situation deteriorates much further. Successive rounds of armed clashes in Kosovo and acts of state-backed sabotage are major red flags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;benefits-and-challenges-of-a-bjef&quot;&gt;Benefits and Challenges of a BJEF&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result – a Balkan Joint Expeditionary Force (BJEF) may just be the “Game-Changer” the region needs in a time when the peace, 30 years later, seems to be unravelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A BJEF could bring the unity, stability and security the region deserves and needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improving regional interoperability.&lt;/strong&gt; A Balkans Joint Expeditionary Force (BJEF) would enhance interoperability among participating forces and deepen the region’s integration with the institutions of the democratic world. It would help place the Western Balkan countries firmly on the path toward Euro-Atlantic integration, supporting their eventual membership in NATO and the EU. British forces could serve as the framework nation and provide training, mentoring and assistance to local forces, as they already do under existing initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expanding Operation CHELONIA.&lt;/strong&gt; The UK could use the BJEF framework to scale-up and broaden the scope of Operation CHELONIA, its current defence cooperation initiative in the Balkans.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establishing a standing coordination mechanism.&lt;/strong&gt; The BJEF would institutionalise UK-Balkan defence coordination, leading to annual BJEF ministerial meetings and CHOD-level (Chiefs of Defence) engagements. Between summits, UK officials would regularly consult and coordinate with their BJEF-7 counterparts to ensure strategic alignment and operational readiness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improving regional military capability.&lt;/strong&gt; By standardising training, facilitating joint exercises, and promoting doctrinal alignment, the BJEF would strengthen the military effectiveness of participating countries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operational flexibility.&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike NATO or EU CSDP missions, the BJEF would not require unanimity to initiate operations. As with the JEF, the United Kingdom would act as the framework nation and, following consultation, could launch operations with any combination of participating members. Each BJEF-7 state would retain full sovereign authority over whether or not to contribute forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expanding options for policymakers.&lt;/strong&gt; Like the JEF, the BJEF could serve both as a deterrent and a rapid-response mechanism. It would train for, and when necessary, conduct localised operations across the region, such as:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Bosnia and Herzegovina,&lt;/strong&gt; it could reinforce EUFOR-Althea in deterring secessionist threats from the entity of Republika Srpska or establish a permanent presence in the strategically critical Brčko corridor.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Kosovo,&lt;/strong&gt; the BJEF could augment KFOR to deter aggression and support the security of Serb-majority municipalities in the north. It could work alongside local security services in joint patrols and border control missions to combat organised crime and smuggling.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In the event of natural disasters, the BJEF could also provide emergency relief, including search and rescue operations.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Giving Britain a stake in Balkan security.&lt;/strong&gt; The UK would serve as the “organiser-in-chief” of the BJEF, with regional partners contributing the bulk of the personnel. The UK would provide planning, command and control, special forces capabilities, logistics, and the institutional knowledge gained from its leadership of the JEF. Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina, due to their relatively larger armed forces, would likely be the main troop contributors, with Kosovo rapidly developing its own capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhance burden sharing within the transatlantic alliance.&lt;/strong&gt; President Trump and his senior officials have consistently highlighted the imbalance in transatlantic defence contributions. Greater British involvement in the Balkans – particularly through the creation of a BJEF – would serve as a clear example of a European-led solution to a European security challenge. Such a move would undoubtedly be well received by the White House as a demonstration of increased European responsibility in regional defence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give the UK more leverage.&lt;/strong&gt; A UK led BJEF would enhance London’s leverage in regional talks and negotiations, sending a clear signal of resolve and strength to autocrats like Vucic and Putin. For example, a decisive show of strength, such as the mobilisation of the BJEF may be sufficient to deter them from aggressive policies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake, even with the many opportunities that the creation of a BJEF could have on the region, this initiative is not without its challenges. Several obstacles would need to be addressed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limited resources among regional states.&lt;/strong&gt; Collectively, the BJEF-7 countries spent approximately $4.1 billion on defence in 2024, according to NATO’s official data releases for NATO members and World Bank estimates for Bosnia and Kosovo. For comparison, Sweden – a single JEF member – spent roughly three times that amount in the same year. Only four of the BJEF-7 (Kosovo, Albania, North Macedonia, and Montenegro) met or slightly exceeded NATO’s 2% of GDP defence spending benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enduring regional mistrust.&lt;/strong&gt; The historical and contemporary tensions between the Western Balkan nations make it a challenge to bring these nations together in a common cause. However, a bias-free neutral framework combined with mission clarity will ensure that BJEF operates as a force to heal, not exacerbate, existing tensions. A key example is the relationship between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia. Croatia’s involvement, particularly its political support for Bosnian Croat leaders seeking greater autonomy or the creation of a separate entity within Bosnia and Herzegovina has, at times, complicated Bosnia’s internal stability and efforts at unity. Addressing such sensitivities with balance and care is essential for building regional cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-recognition of Kosovo.&lt;/strong&gt; Bosnia and Herzegovina does not formally recognise Kosovo’s independence. While this complicates Kosovo’s full participation in the BJEF, it does not render it impossible – particularly if pragmatic and inclusive policies are pursued.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resource constraints in the UK.&lt;/strong&gt; Successive British governments have underinvested in defence. Nonetheless, the geopolitical benefits of serving as the BJEF framework nation would far outweigh the modest financial burden. For context, since 2023 the UK has allocated only £1.19 million to the JEF – an affordable investment relative to the strategic value returned.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russian misinformation.&lt;/strong&gt; As with any significant NATO or European military deployment or training exercise, Russian disinformation efforts will seek to undermine the legitimacy of the mission and sow distrust among local populations. The UK must proactively counter this by developing a clear public engagement strategy that explains the purpose of the BJEF, its activities, and the benefits it brings to regional stability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand that the BJEF is not a silver bullet.&lt;/strong&gt; The Balkans region faces many challenges unrelated to security. Rampant corruption and stagnant economic activity are exacerbated by a lack of energy security and sectarian divisions. The BJEF should be considered a tool in the UK’s Balkan toolbox, but it must be one part of a larger strategy that London should take towards the region.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenging situation in the Western Balkans is a security issue – demanding a security response – grounded in firm clarity and decisive action. With this in mind, there are three pressing challenges facing the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-british-role&quot;&gt;The British Role&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Britain ought to take this seriously and urgently. Indeed, globally there are now the highest number of active conflicts than at any point since the Second World War. MI5 recently warned of “mayhem in our streets” due to covert, and overt, Russian action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Britain has taken a more active approach to the Western Balkans, as embodied by the recent Operation Chelonia training exercises and the signing of new deals to tackle smuggling gangs are most welcome. It has also provided critically needed training to the Bosnian Armed Forces in recent years, increasing their NATO interoperability capacities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Britain has the means and resources to organise and promote BJEF, supporting the force from its bases in Cyprus and Gibraltar. As the UK seeks to fulfil our post-Brexit “Global Britain” ambitions, there are few better ways to signal its commitment to deterrence. There are also facilities in Bosnia and Kosovo that could be easily re-operationalized for these purposes, in addition to NATO facilities in Albania, Montenegro, and North Macedonia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the sidelines of the UK-hosted Berlin Process Summit in October, the UK should convene an initial meeting of the BJEF-7 countries. This should be followed by technical consultations at the official level, leading to the signing of a Letter of Intent, a Foundational Memorandum of Understanding, and ultimately a Comprehensive Memorandum of Understanding. The Comprehensive MoU would provide the strategic context and formalise the operational framework within which the BJEF would function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration has made it clear that the Europeans must step up “Burden-Sharing”, and not rely on American resources and troops, as their geopolitical focus shifts further to the Indo-Pacific. The creation of the BJEF could be the first step in this direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now is the time to show firm leadership and clear resolve. An EU-UK defence pact is welcome, and the Western Balkans ought to play an important role when European security is considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rapid reaction capabilities and the flexibility of the BJEF would be an essential tool to act not only to deal with crises quickly and effectively – but also to deter them. If such a force had existed and been employed in Bosnia and Kosovo in the 1990s, countless lives could have been saved, and the region’s political stability would certainly be in far better shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK can either ignore the problem and deem it to be beyond its immediate concern and interest because the Balkans are more than 1,000 miles away, or policymakers can deal with an even greater problem later on. If conflict did break out, another refugee and energy crisis would once again sweep Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recall, Putin moved on Ukraine first in 2014, and then again in 2022. Years of Western appeasement, the rollback of military commitments, and the inadequate sanctions regimes emboldened Moscow. The UK risks repeating the same mistakes in the Western Balkans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the UK has a responsibility to the region, to the soldiers who served and to those who do not wish to see decades of peacebuilding and reconciliation abandoned. From the Baltics to the Nordics to Ukraine to Hong Kong, the British Government has shown admirable leadership and moral clarity in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK ought to take the initiative once again to prevent our continent from sleepwalking into conflict once again. The challenge in the Balkans, due to the lack of deterrence, the rise of Serbia, and the spectre of Russia, risks escalating into a full-blown crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would be a much more efficient, organised, and powerful force than the existing haphazard and fragmented arrangements. And it would help to bring unity and hope to the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A force centred around the use of rapid reaction, pooled resources and cutting-edge technology – but guided by the timeless principles of unity, peacekeeping and collective security, will blend the old with the new to create a power fit for the challenges of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The price of pre-emptive action is always much cheaper than the price of apathy and abandonment. But if the UK opts for the latter, it won’t be just the Balkans which will suffer as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

Closer cooperation with allies on ship construction and repair could help counter China’s maritime threat and bolster U.S. industrial resilience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military conflict in the Indo-Pacific would demand overwhelming U.S. naval power. Yet the shipbuilding sector faces capacity shortages, industrial base constraints, cost overruns, and delayed delivery, suggesting that Washington should explore alternative pathways for delivering naval capability. One approach is to enhance cooperation with close allies such as Japan and South Korea. Options for cooperation include allied participation in maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO); allied purchase and revitalization of U.S. shipyards; various methods of coproduction, including modular construction; and U.S. purchase of allied-built ships. Novel strategies that leverage the United States’ strong and unique network of allies and partners will require thoughtful implementation of industrial cooperation policy, which has historically been challenging. For the United States to strike the right balance between leaning on its allies and partners to alleviate its shipbuilding problems and investing in its own capabilities at home—for these approaches are not mutually exclusive—it should understand the implications of its various cooperative options with its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2022 National Security Strategy identifies China as the United States’ “pacing challenge,” and recent announcements by the Trump administration have reaffirmed this focus. CIA Director John Ratcliffe said in April 2025 that “no adversary in the history of our nation has presented a more formidable challenge” than China. Given the vastness of the Pacific theatre, its vital shipping lanes, and the many regional allies and partners depending on a persistent U.S. security presence, sea power is critical to the U.S. strategy for promoting a free and open Indo-Pacific and competing with China. However, the United States has long struggled with shipyard capacity as well as timely and cost-effective construction of naval vessels. Policies aimed at maintaining its shipbuilding industrial base have failed to yield a sector that keeps pace with those of potential adversaries. In April 2024, a 45-day review of the U.S. shipbuilding industrial base by the secretary of the Navy found that many of the Navy’s major shipbuilding programs were one to three years behind schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lack of adequate naval shipbuilding capacity, as well as the moribund state of the U.S. commercial shipbuilding industry, significantly hinders the country’s ability to increase production of ships. U.S. workforce constraints, facilities limitations, and supply chain challenges have contributed to an inability to deliver necessary capabilities on schedule and at scale. At the same time, China’s share of global commercial and military shipbuilding continues to grow rapidly, accounting for 51 percent of global ship deliveries in 2023, with current trends pointing toward an eventual shift in the maritime balance of power.&lt;/p&gt;

Funaiole, Brian Hart, and Aidan-Powers Riggs, Ship Wars: Confronting China’s Dual-Use Shipbuilding Empire (Washington, DC: CSIS, March 2025)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to this shipbuilding crisis, new modalities are needed, particularly those that lean on the United States’ allies. The U.S. Navy could turn to Japan and South Korea for industrial cooperation to scale warship production, which would represent an important shift in its naval acquisition policy and broader industrial partnerships with allies. South Korea and Japan are the world’s second and third largest producers of ships, respectively, and could contribute significantly to U.S. warship production, whether overseas or at U.S. shipyards. Carlos del Toro, the secretary of the Navy under the Biden administration, was forward-leaning in considering the possibility of looking abroad to reinvigorate the U.S. shipbuilding industry and maritime production, and recent comments from the Trump administration appear to indicate it is also favorable to rethinking approaches to increase capacity. An April 2025 executive order entitled “Restoring America’s Maritime Dominance” explicitly discusses the possibility of shipbuilders in allied nations undertaking capital investment to help strengthen the shipbuilding capacity of the United States. However, there is currently a lack of rigorous and public analyses on the potential advantages and challenges of the several ways in which U.S. industry could cooperate with allies on shipbuilding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are multiple approaches that United States could take to leverage allied capacity. These include using allied MRO capabilities to free up space in U.S. shipyards, enabling allied purchase and revitalization of U.S. shipyards, working with allied shipyards to coproduce ships through modular construction methods, or purchasing ships directly from allied yards. All these pathways involve trade-offs between time, cost, regulatory and political hurdles, as well as other variables of interest to policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each approach to international shipbuilding cooperation comes with its own benefits and drawbacks. These pathways are not mutually exclusive, and the U.S. government may also choose to pursue a combination of pathways; if so, it should also consider whether and how cooperation methods affect each other when pursued simultaneously or sequentially. Such an analysis should take into account the possibility that pathways impact the same underlying factors, such as labor availability or overall demand, as well as potential path dependencies in industrial planning, wherein funding one shipyard approach may require the conversion or use of limited yard space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these approaches could each serve as useful measures to enhance naval capability, they would each affect the long-term health of the U.S. shipbuilding industry. Determining the nature of this impact—be it positive, negative, or a combination of the two, with variation across different subsectors—is critical for policymakers as they balance meeting the imminent threat from China with the strategic need to ensure the long-term strength of the U.S. shipbuilding industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background-and-analysis&quot;&gt;Background and Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-strategic-situation&quot;&gt;The Strategic Situation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sea control will likely play a key role in any potential conflict with China given the vastness of the Pacific Ocean and the location of flashpoint areas such as Taiwan, the South China Sea, the Korean Peninsula, and Guam. A series of wargames conducted at CSIS in 2024 indicated that in the case of a conflict over Taiwan, the United States would likely incur significant losses of ships, submarines, and planes, including naval aviation assets. While the U.S. Navy retains a qualitative and tonnage edge over China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), the pace of PLAN construction greatly exceeds that of the U.S. Navy. Chinese shipbuilding, both naval and commercial, has been thriving. Due to substantial industrial subsidies, China’s shipyards have gone from producing 5 percent of the world’s commercial ships in 1999 to over 50 percent in 2025, and many of these shipyards embrace the Chinese Communist Party’s military-civil fusion strategy and produce warships for the Navy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a protracted great power conflict that leads to significant losses, the United States would have to rapidly repair and replace its ships and invest in new vessels to maintain control of sea lines of communication. Given the well-documented struggles of U.S. shipbuilding, the United States should explore supplementing domestic production with other options for sustaining and growing its naval might. Cooperation with shipbuilding heavyweights South Korea and Japan offers one possible approach to solving this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-united-states-shipbuilding-challenge&quot;&gt;The United States’ Shipbuilding Challenge&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. naval shipbuilding sector faces critical hurdles. The most commonly cited are skilled-workforce constraints, antiquated shipyard infrastructure and equipment, insufficient use of new technology including digital tools and modular construction techniques, and legacy organizational structures. Analysts point to issues in U.S. design capacity, hyper-specialization of military shipyards that holds back scalability, and a 20-year backlog of maintenance and repairs that constrains the Navy’s ability to practice and train with its existing ships. Some of these issues stem from the closure of U.S. shipyards during the 1990s, which hindered the domestic production of ships and left significant gaps that in industrial readiness. The reasons behind the U.S. shipbuilding challenge are the subject of a substantial and growing body of literature, including recent analyses from policymakers such as Senator Jack Reed (D-RI) and former Senator Jim Inhofe (R-OK); public institutions such as the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the Congressional Research Service; and various think tanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A near universally agreed-upon challenge for the U.S. shipbuilding industry is the need for a larger skilled workforce. A demographic shift away from manufacturing careers, coupled with the retirement of workers with shipbuilding skills, has created recruitment and retention issues, resulting in an inexperienced workforce that lacks proficiency in skilled trades and requires increased supervision to avoid quality problems. A March 2025 Congressional Research Service report found that part of the difficulty in recruiting and retaining new workers lies in the relatively low wages and benefits of shipbuilding jobs. While such jobs still pay better than service and retail, the differential in wages has narrowed, and the latter are less likely to involve risk of serious injury, are often located in areas with easier commutes, and are generally done in cleaner indoor settings. Although increasing total wages for shipbuilding workers could reestablish a large differential in wages and benefits, it would also substantially increase ship procurement costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, shipbuilders also struggle to acquire land for expanding existing shipyard facilities, building new shipyards, or providing housing for workers near shipyards. In 1988, the first Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process prompted the selling of land access along coastlines, resulting in the closure of four naval shipyards in the 1990s. In some places, land could theoretically be repurchased, but at a steep price, given that it has since been put to new productive uses. Greenfield development along coastlines is generally difficult, as there are few appropriate locations that are both unused and affordable to buy and build on. Even when land itself is inexpensive, shipyards can face high costs when developing it—whether for industrial use or worker housing—due to the potential for industrial contamination, which requires expensive remediation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many shipyards around the world, civilian shipbuilding is a critical supporter of naval construction due to the scaling benefits of sharing skillsets and material inputs, as well as the smoothing of demand over time. The United States has rarely been a world-leading constructor of civilian vessels, except during and immediately after World Wars I and II. Consequently, maritime historians argue that the United States’ strategic culture is split between alignment with territorial land empires such as Germany and true sea power states such as the United Kingdom—and therefore is less likely to maintain a consistent engagement with the sea via commercial shipbuilding the way a fully maritime state would. This lack of persistent cultural and strategic interest is reflected in the poor state of U.S. shipbuilding today relative to the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While analysts debate the root cause of the United States’ shipbuilding issues, the U.S. Navy’s demand is only increasing. Its requested shipbuilding budget has risen 38 percent from FY 2020 to FY 2024, according to the Navy’s 2024 plan. The disconnect between supply and demand of shipbuilding capacity is a strategic problem for the United States as it faces stiffer global competition from China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;us-policy-options&quot;&gt;U.S. Policy Options&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to these clear challenges in the face of growing strategic demand, the United States has several possible options, some of which have engaged leaders’ interest and support. Senior political figures such as Senator Mark Kelly (D-AZ) and former National Security Advisor (and former Congressman) Mike Waltz (R-FL) have been at the forefront of efforts to revitalize shipbuilding via domestic investments. Their “Congressional Guidance for a National Maritime Strategy,” published alongside other members of Congress, proposes both incentives for building ships in the United States and carrying cargo on U.S.-flagged commercial vessels. This congressional effort, in the form of the Shipbuilding and Harbor Infrastructure for Prosperity and Security (SHIPS) for America Act of 2025, advances a domestic approach focused on revitalizing shipbuilding within the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SHIPS for America Act, like other current efforts, focuses on generous subsidies and legal privileges for the U.S. shipbuilding industry. This domestic approach draws upon a wide and deep body of literature that aims to diagnose the issues facing domestic shipbuilding; it has many political and intellectual champions within the United States, including from powerful industry groups that have been active since the 1930s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the most promising—yet less comprehensively studied or advocated—policy options involve the United States partnering with Asian allies. Statements from officials in the Trump administration, such as Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, as well as from the Biden administration, including former Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro and former Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel, suggest that U.S. policymakers are interested in exploring cooperating with South Korea and Japan to overcome challenges to the naval shipbuilding industry. Even the SHIPS for America Act’s explicitly domestic strategy includes references to assistance from international actors, especially treaty allies such as South Korea and Japan. The associated congressional guidance notes that the United States should “seek mutually beneficial relationships with treaty allies, exploring comparative advantages to lower cost, time, and the complexity of rebuilding America’s domestic shipping and shipbuilding industry.” Indeed, analysts have proposed a variety of international cooperation options, from realistic ones grounded in statements by Navy and political leaders to more theoretical and creative options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;why-cooperate-internationally-examining-allied-strength-in-shipbuilding&quot;&gt;Why Cooperate Internationally? Examining Allied Strength in Shipbuilding&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the United States, South Korea and Japan have impressive shipbuilding industries, making them valuable potential partners. While China builds more ships overall due to its greater number of shipyards, South Korean and Japanese shipyards continue to lead the world in contemporary productivity due to technical advancements. However, China is rapidly closing the productivity gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea rose as a commercial shipbuilding power between 1970 and 1990 as significant government subsidies, technological advancements, and favorable economic conditions such as low labor costs enabled it to outpace U.S. and European industry during a challenging period for the global shipbuilding market. South Korea has retained its cost-competitive edge even as its labor has grown more expensive alongside the development of its economy. Advancements in automation and control systems within its shipbuilding industry have shifted the sector from labor-intensive to technology-driven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japanese shipbuilders maintain a strong market presence, building on their long period of dominance that began after World War II. The country nevertheless faces challenges in competing with South Korean and Chinese shipyards that excel in increasingly high-value and rapid ship construction. Japan’s focus on high quality standards and adoption of automation could be enhanced to meet military demands, especially with increased collaboration across maritime technology sectors. Much like South Korea, Japan has a strong focus on automation in its shipbuilding sector for both simple vessels and highly complex naval ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the appeal of working with allied shipbuilders, U.S. policymakers should also consider the impact that international approaches to shipbuilding may have on the health of the U.S. shipbuilding industry. Some pathways explored below, such as international companies purchasing U.S. facilities and incorporating their advanced production techniques, have the potential to boost domestic productivity and competitiveness. Other approaches could undermine the industry’s long-term health, particularly if they direct production to foreign shipyards at the cost of domestic order books—which could have downstream impacts on labor force retention and the capacity of U.S. shipbuilding in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea and Japan are not the only U.S.-aligned countries with innovative and effective shipbuilding industries. Other nations may have much to offer the United States, particularly regarding cost-effective warship construction. However, South Korea and Japan are logical starting points for possible cooperation owing not only to their dominance of the commercial shipbuilding market, which gives them significant scale advantage on cost, but also their history of close industrial cooperation with the United States on military production and sustainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;possible-pathways-for-international-cooperation-with-us-allies&quot;&gt;Possible Pathways for International Cooperation with U.S. Allies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study identifies several approaches for international cooperation on naval shipbuilding with South Korea and Japan, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;allied maintenance, repair, and overhaul of U.S. ships to free up U.S. shipyard capacity;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;allied acquisition of U.S. shipyards to revitalize their production capability;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;joint distributed production of warships via modular construction methods; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;U.S. purchase of existing allied warship designs from allied shipyards.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although there are additional avenues for cooperation, these four pathways have emerged as the most likely based on a survey of public discourse, existing U.S. government policies such as the Regional Sustainment Framework, and CSIS interviews with U.S. and allied industry, as well as with government officials, over the past year. Other policy options outside the scope of these pathways, and this report, have been floated, including various combinations or divisions of the above ideas, as well as proposals that depend on outside parties, such as the global naval export market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following sections discuss these possible pathways for cooperation in greater detail. They review the extant literature relevant to each pathway and describe the most viable forms of cooperation within it, as there is often more than one form of activity that the pathway could take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;international-cooperation-on-us-maintenance-repair-and-overhaul&quot;&gt;International Cooperation on U.S. Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MRO activities are essential for ensuring a fleet’s operational readiness and long-term availability for action. MRO activities range from routine inspections and maintenance actions (for example, applying surface coatings) to major service life extensions or refits of weapons systems. Robust MRO capacity enables a nation to maintain combat power during prolonged conflicts and ensure cost-effective and timely servicing of ships during peacetime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, MRO operations in the United States are under severe stress. Due to shipyard capacity, the U.S. Navy is estimated to be 20 years behind on maintenance work; this has led to the decommissioning of viable ships as a result of its inability to conduct core MRO, modernization, and service-life extensions. A February 2025 GAO report identified a lack of infrastructure and workforce capacity as the main obstacle to ship repairs, resulting in an inability to perform unplanned work such as emergency repairs. Even if hiring and retention efforts for skilled labor are successful in ameliorating the widespread workforce shortages, new employees will still be inexperienced, which will likely result in reduced efficiency in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report also notes that workforce and infrastructure capacity is dependent on “fleet concentration areas,” or places where ships are homeported and undergo repair at domestic facilities. The GAO identified the five such areas that conduct major repair: one each in California, Florida, Hawaii, Virginia, and Washington. If slated repair work exceeds the capacity of one fleet concentration area, it may have to be done at another location. To address these physical capacity constraints, two out of seven shipbuilders interviewed for the GAO study have outsourced work to their suppliers, with “plans to expand the volume of material they are outsourcing.” Another shipbuilder has plans to use outsourcing, and an additional one is considering outsourcing if it is awarded a new contract by the Navy. While outsourcing can reduce physical constraints at shipyards, suppliers often “have their own workforce and infrastructure problems.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of these challenges, enabling greater use of allied MRO in the Indo-Pacific region is critical for U.S. strategic goals and those of Japan and South Korea. Allied MRO could help the United States by strengthening supply chains, leveraging the strategic positioning of allied ports, and expanding MRO capacity. Some scholars believe the United States could solve its shipyard dilemma by empowering domestic yards to focus on facilities and process modernization by having allied yards take on maintenance work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has already begun laying the groundwork for greater MRO cooperation across the Indo-Pacific through the Regional Sustainment Framework. One of the core goals of the framework is to leverage existing regional MRO capacity within partner nations, particularly for shared weapons systems operated by allies and partners. Close MRO cooperation with Indo-Pacific treaty allies has already been pursued in Australia, where the United States has begun an initiative to advance combined regional MRO solutions in support of the framework. Another venue for cooperation is the U.S.-Japan Defense Industrial Cooperation, Acquisition, and Sustainment (DICAS) Forum, which aims to accelerate joint development and sustainment of defense equipment. DICAS oversees multiple working groups, including the Ship Repair Working Group, which seeks to identify opportunities and challenges for U.S. naval ships to be maintained by Japanese shipyards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MRO cooperation with South Korea and Japan is hardly new. The U.S. Navy has been collaborating with Japanese industry on MRO since the end of World War II, with NIPPI beginning to service assets in the 1950s. In 2019, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) conducted maintenance on the USS Milius, an Arleigh Burke–class guided missile destroyer, and signaled their desire for more contracts with the U.S. Navy. In 2024, U.S. Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel announced plans to build on the 2019 maintenance collaboration with MHI, saying that the U.S. Navy would send some of its vessels to Japanese shipyards for MRO. Japanese companies have also performed MRO activities on some U.S. auxiliary vessels. Similarly, in August 2024 South Korean naval shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean received their first MRO contract with the U.S. Navy to provide services to one of their cargo and ammunition ships, the USNS Wally Schirra, which has since been completed. In November 2024, Hanwha Ocean received another contract to perform MRO services on the USNS Yukon, a replenishment oiler. Another South Korean shipbuilder, HD Hyundai, signed a Maintenance and Ship Repair Agreement (MSRA) with the U.S. Navy, which qualifies them to bid for maintenance projects for U.S. combat and support ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, some existing literature highlights that shifting MRO work to foreign yards could have negative economic consequences for the U.S. ship-repair and shipbuilding sector, namely the potential loss of business. Other sources indicate that certain parts of MRO operations, such as routine maintenance, constitute only a limited part of shipyard economies; as such, shifting some MRO operations abroad is unlikely to damage the U.S. shipbuilding industry and broader economy. Nevertheless, naval MRO activities between World Wars I and II were a source of stability for cash-strapped shipyards that were otherwise out of work—even if these activities only constituted 0.3 percent of the value of U.S. private shipyards’ total commercial and naval work from 1920–39.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This pathway requires close study to ascertain its potential value to the U.S. Navy, especially in terms of how much it may free up new production capacity in the United States and how offshoring these small but routine (and therefore valuable for long-term financial stability) contracts to U.S. allies may affect the domestic shipbuilding industry. A critical factor in determining the viability of this approach will be its anticipated ability to create new shipbuilding capacity—as the facilities, machinery, and skilled workforce used in MRO operations are not necessarily the same as for shipbuilding and may require substantial time and money to switch. For U.S. allies and partners, the economic appeal of this pathway will depend on the potential magnitude of the market as foreign shipbuilders consider whether to dedicate existing facilities to U.S. naval MRO, expand capacity to support U.S. Navy ships in their home country, or expand capacity in third countries such as the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;allied-acquisition-of-us-shipyards-tech-transfer-and-productivity-improvements&quot;&gt;Allied Acquisition of U.S. Shipyards: Tech Transfer and Productivity Improvements&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allied companies’ acquisition of U.S. shipyards offers another approach for Japanese and South Korean shipbuilders to support U.S. shipbuilding via entering the U.S. market. The goal would be for the purchasers to impart the home nation’s shipbuilding expertise. The foreign company would need to set up a U.S. subsidiary that can prove it is not under foreign ownership, control, or influence—meaning it qualifies as a U.S. company for both Jones Act considerations and “Buy America” clauses in military contracting. In a relevant example, Hanwha Ocean completed its purchase of Philly Shipyard in 2024, having received the necessary regulatory approval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is not just one way for international shipbuilders to become involved in the U.S. domestic shipbuilding market. Through reviews of the literature, qualitative research, and interviews with industry over the past nine months, the following have emerged as possible sub-pathways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;international purchase of existing operational U.S. military shipyards;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;international purchase and renovation of defunct or nonmilitary U.S. shipyards;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;creation of new government-owned, commercially operated (GOCO) U.S. shipyards with foreign shipbuilders considered in the operator bidding pool; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;creation of a joint venture or consortium between U.S. and international industry to produce ships within an existing U.S. shipyard.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key question regarding international acquisition of U.S. shipyards in any of these sub-pathways is whether new ownership can improve shipyard performance. Given that the U.S. workforce and material input costs will largely remain unchanged, the key theorized drivers of improvement would be altered management practices, possible training of U.S. shipyard workforces by experts from shipyards in allied countries, and technology transfer of more advanced foreign shipbuilding techniques to the United States, as well as the accompanying capital infusion required to implement those new techniques. Some of these methods have been publicly discussed by officials from Hanwha as ways to improve their newly acquired Philadelphia yard. These sub-pathways are not mutually exclusive, and selecting one for a given situation would depend on both local conditions and an assessment of how its particulars would facilitate—or not—productivity gains in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology transfer is difficult to catalyze and manage properly. The United States’ experience managing military technology transfer—especially through the Department of Defense, where national competitiveness and security are paramount concerns—has overwhelmingly been as the provider, rather than the recipient. This lack of DOD experience may be a complication for this pathway, necessitating further close study so policymakers and implementers are fully aware of potential hurdles and best practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A limited literature supports the possible beneficial returns of technology transfer from advanced shipbuilding nations like Japan to companies in the United States. One 1987 study examined Japan’s Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries’ (IHI) technology transfer efforts to U.S. shipbuilders, which built on IHI’s advanced techniques, such as block construction, process lane systems, and a strong emphasis on material management and design standardization. It found that IHI was able to improve productivity, but could not bring the U.S. shipyards up to Japanese standards. More recent comprehensive studies are lacking, however, providing an opening for scholars to contribute to the literature on the possible returns and tradeoffs of technology transfer to U.S. shipbuilders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This pathway has been pursued in recent history. Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri purchased the Wisconsin-based Marinette Marine shipyard in 2009, with Lockheed Martin as a minority owner. The new company won the competition to build the Constellation-class guided missile frigate in 2020, although construction setbacks, including workforce limitations and requirements creep, have contributed to late delivery of the first-in-class ship. Austal, an Australian shipbuilder, started operations in Alabama in 1999 and began to expand rapidly in 2005 after winning a contract to design the Independence-variant Littoral Combat Ship for the U.S. Navy. Foreign shipbuilder acquisition in these cases has brought in new investment and modernization efforts. Fincantieri has invested over $300 million in its yards in Wisconsin. It also has leased new yard space in an existing Florida shipyard near Commodores Point in Jacksonville, and announced plans to invest $30 million into improvements and modernization there to support its sustainment and repair work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These examples of international acquisition offer some insight into the opportunities and challenges of foreign ownership that could be applied to future cooperation with South Korea and Japan. The benefits of foreign ownership are clear. Foreign parent firms with commercial shipbuilding enterprises—a rarity in the United States—can bring the energy, expertise, and innovative capabilities of the advanced commercial market to U.S. shipyards. For example, these shipbuilders often use more robotics and automation in processes such as panel making than U.S. defense shipyards do, which can reduce strains on a depleted workforce and improve efficiency. Foreign ownership by large shipbuilders can also enable buying certain inputs in bulk, especially if they are not exclusively military in nature. At a minimum, parent firms can help provide information and negotiation power to their U.S. subsidiaries as they buy components for ships, contributing to lower costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regulatory barriers such as complying with Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) and Foreign Ownership, Control, or Influence (FOCI) mitigation are unlikely to pose major barriers provided there is government support. However, International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) are likely to pose challenges. Ship designs are controlled by ITAR, down to the nonmilitary design elements that could benefit from foreign owners’ commercial expertise, including galley and berth plans. Even visits by experts from potential parent companies can involve ITAR, and long-term residency permits to allow foreign expertise to benefit U.S. yards can be difficult to obtain. A further complication is that U.S. Navy standards and procedures are unique, and communicating these requirements to foreign parent firms can require an additional ITAR waiver, making it more cumbersome for the U.S. shipyard to benefit from foreign expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;modularity-in-shipbuilding-via-distributed-construction&quot;&gt;Modularity in Shipbuilding via Distributed Construction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modularity is part of the advanced shipbuilding approaches employed by South Korean and Japanese shipbuilders. For commercial shipbuilding of massive cargo and tanker ships, it is analogous to taking 250–300 modules manufactured in workshops and assembling them like bricks in a drydock. For this report, “modularity” in shipbuilding refers to two separate but related methods, both of which have the potential to improve U.S. shipbuilding capacity. The first is advanced outfitting, or the construction of a ship by assembling pre-furnished modules, such as horizontally and vertically joining sections of a ship. The other method is the use of modular systems, or the integration of various components—from weapons systems to power plants—onto a hull using common standards for key interfaces, enabling different contractors to be involved in the manufacture of the ship and the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modularity is a key enabler of the distributed approaches that could bring in both international shipyards and U.S. subsidiaries of international firms. In the international context, therefore, possible complementary pathways for the United States to work with its allies include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;a business-to business distribution system in which U.S. shipyards subcontract or enter joint ventures to assemble ships from complete, pre-furnished hull modules and systems built by the United States and its allies;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;a government-furnished equipment system in which the U.S. Navy procures U.S.- and allied-built hull modules and systems directly and provides them to U.S shipyards; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;a system assembly approach in which U.S. shipyards integrate modular systems (such as weapons and propulsion systems) onto pre-built, complete ship hulls from South Korea and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each form of modular cooperation involves its own advantages and challenges. In general, the literature on the role of modularity in shipbuilding is overwhelmingly positive, with many studies highlighting how flexible and modular designs could reduce costs, enhance international cooperation, and support modernization and adaptability. Rains, for example, highlights the benefits of the potential reduction in ship size, while Malone and Rubeša, Fafandjel, and Kolić emphasize pre-outfitting in modules in workshops to minimize the work that must be done in dry docks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, three types each of modularity and flexibility are identified as having potential for the modernization and adaptability of the U.S. Navy. For modularity, these include common modules, self-contained modules, and modular installations. For flexibility, types with potential include ship infrastructure, additional space, and additional ship services. The U.S. Navy could additionally benefit from a more optimized and comprehensive approach to modularity, for example by integrating standardized components and standardized weapons systems into a collection of ready hull designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies of recent shared-build warship programs in the United States, France, and the United Kingdom identify risk reduction areas, key costs, and potential benefits of international modular shared-build programs. These studies highlight the conditions and circumstances under which multi-shipyard, modular-build strategies can be adopted. In addition, the works of Friedman, Lombardi, and Rudd, who outline recent challenges faced by the United Kingdom with joint shipbuilding, become particularly useful for understanding how the United States might leverage international partnerships to fill in its aforementioned gaps in production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One international shipbuilder thought it could potentially subcontract to U.S. shipbuilders to provide either modules produced in a U.S. subsidiary yard or generators built in other inland facilities. The business-to-business path was seen as a low-margin but nevertheless appealing opportunity to generate revenue and build trust with other shipbuilders who might be otherwise inclined to see new entrants primarily as competition. Modularity, referred to as “federated shipbuilding” or “nation as a shipyard,” has also been proposed as a solution to domestic U.S. shipbuilding constraints. If these approaches are adopted, allied firms could plug into these domestic modular approaches as suppliers, leveraging workforces and materials not just in the inland United States but across allied nations as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skeptics of modularity, however, point to inefficiencies in the field that can counterintuitively lead to higher procurement costs and delayed timelines. This is due to the high degree of skill that complete modularity requires and is evidenced by the case of the U.S. Littoral Combat Ship, where design for mission modularity is one of many contributors to the program’s high cost and other challenges. As an additional challenge, some of the efficiency of high-productivity shipyards comes from the equipment they employ to move the largest of modules, so additional capital investments may be required for some U.S. producers to take advantage of offsite module production, particularly across the long distances involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;us-purchase-of-ships-from-allied-yards&quot;&gt;U.S. Purchase of Ships from Allied Yards&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final pathway identified by this work is that of the U.S. Navy purchasing ships that are produced in allied yards. There are numerous sub-pathways for this form of cooperation, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;allied yards building licensed U.S. designs;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;allied yards building a new codeveloped design; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the United States buying allied-built and allied-designed ships.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the existing literature on such approaches is sparse due to the limited political support for this idea throughout U.S. shipbuilding history. The U.S. has a long history of protectionist policies towards its shipbuilding industry, most often characterized by the Jones Act, a law designed to ensure that cargo being shipped within the United States is aboard U.S.-built, -owned, -registered, and -crewed vessels. These same protectionist tendencies apply to naval shipbuilding, and many on the Hill and in the Navy may be reluctant to see U.S. naval ships be built abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is perhaps the most difficult and unlikely pathway explored in this paper. For instance, although reusing the existing designs for foreign ships would likely offer the most cost effective and rapid solution to at-sea capacity gaps, these ships might not meet the U.S. Navy’s specific operational requirements, including full interoperability with U.S. systems. Past experience in trying to adapt foreign designs shows that the U.S. Navy’s tendency to “gold plate” design requirements can cause scope creep, raising costs and time frames. Moreover, its standards and procedures are not shared by other navies, requiring a major rework of allied designs to be acceptable for domestic use. The Navy’s attempt to have the existing Italian design of the European multipurpose frigate (FREMM) quickly converted into the U.S. Navy’s Constellation class, for example, has resulted in a final U.S. design that reportedly bears less than a 15 percent similarity to the FREMM, down from a planned 85 percent, at great cost of time and money to the United States government. Some allied designs are similar to existing U.S. designs, such as South Korea’s KDX-III Batch I Aegis destroyers, which are said to be based on the DDG-51 Arleigh Burke–class of the U.S. Navy. Use of these mostly shared designs could potentially ease the compatibility issue. Alternatively, cooperation on building fleet auxiliaries or support ships may encounter less difficulties with requirements and political sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new codeveloped design could take advantage of partner shipbuilding expertise to incorporate manufacturability in the design phase. However, designing new ships is a notoriously hard and slow process. Modern warships are incredibly complex machines; even a single amphibious assault ship contains 4.7 million parts from over 700 companies. The lengthy process of designing and building new destroyers means this approach would have a long time horizon, making it susceptible to changing political winds. While some experts float this option, linking it to potential export sales as a way to spread out production costs across more customers, its technical and political challenges are daunting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The approach of allies building U.S. ships alleviates many of these considerations but raises new challenges of its own. Designs will need to be licensed to allied yards, which will take time to negotiate, as will securing funding for intellectual property rights. It can take two years for even a comparatively expedited technical-assistance agreement to address export controls and the release of closely held U.S. weapons-system designs. However, the United States has managed to share its advanced capabilities with Korean shipbuilders before. For instance, HD Hyundai recently delivered the Republica of Korea’s Jeongjo the Great to South Korean Navy; it is the first of the new KDX III Batch II Aegis destroyers and the fourth domestically designed and built South Korean Navy ship to incorporate the U.S. Aegis system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These alternative approaches can all be used to build warfighting capability through the delivery of additional ships. It remains unclear, however, whether and how they might address core concerns about the capability and capacity of the U.S. shipbuilding industrial base—a broader strategic issue that needs to form part of any consideration of an alternative approach. While the United States has some partnerships with other nations on specific programs, relying on allies as a complete solution to capability gaps would be unprecedented. Moreover, given South Korea’s and Japan’s location close to China, U.S. policymakers should also consider the possibility of damage to their shipyards during any active conflict. Finally, the health of the U.S. shipbuilding industry is not only a national security concern but also a political one given the well-documented impact of shipyards on their local economies and the interest of Congress in ensuring domestic capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications-for-policy&quot;&gt;Implications for Policy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is no secret that the United States has a shipbuilding problem. The U.S. policy community has long studied this issue and has produced a strong body of work exploring a wide range of possible domestic solutions. However, a continual lack of progress within the United States, the increasingly pressing threat of a naval war with China, and recent shifts in political support for more creative solutions means a window of opportunity is opening for the Navy to consider adopting novel strategies that leverage the United States’ strong and unique network of allies and partners. To date, policymakers lack a clear and comprehensive analysis of the options for industrial maritime cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security cooperation policy is difficult to get right, and industrial cooperation policy can be even harder due to its inherent complexity. For the United States to strike the right balance between leaning on its allies and partners to alleviate its shipbuilding problems and investing in its own capabilities at home, it will need to properly understand the advantages and challenges inherent to each kind of international cooperative activity in isolation and, critically, as they relate to one another. Recent history is littered with attempts at international cooperation that were partially or completely stymied by their starting conditions. For example, Constellation-class ships face three years of delays due to alterations to meet U.S. Navy requirements that lowered commonality with FREMM designs from 85 to 15 percent; both Australia and the United Kingdom have ratified technology-control treaties that go largely unused because industry is not confident in the regulatory implementation; and the F-22 fighter jet ended production rather than being exported because there were no initial investments in addressing technology-release concerns and the systems proved too expensive to retrofit. Policymakers pursuing any of the pathways would greatly benefit from understanding the prerequisites for success as early in the process as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Department of Defense will likely need to come to a decision on this key issue in the coming years, this paper aims to support policymakers as they grapple with these difficult but critical decisions. Future work will evaluate these pathways using various assessments of interest to policymakers, including time to implement, cost to government, economic viability for industry, political and regulatory viability, and creation of new U.S. shipbuilding capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The arrival of DeepSeek’s model exposes at least three fundamental developments in the U.S.-China tech race. First, it shows that it is possible to develop more efficient AI models with less advanced chips and with models training at a fraction of the cost. Second, it highlights that China’s tech ecosystem is capable of innovating and working around constraints from U.S. export controls on chip manufacturing equipment in the race for AI dominance. Third, it indicates that China has developed an open model that is catching up with the well-known OpenAI proprietary products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the pressure for both American and Chinese tech companies to deliver the latest AI breakthrough increases, they are asked to do so in an increasingly fractured global economy—fraught with a tech trade war, volatile protectionist policies, and ever-shifting supply chains. Just twelve days after DeepSeek’s launch, U.S. President Donald Trump introduced a fresh set of 10 percent tariffs on Chinese goods that were swiftly followed by China imposing 10 to 15 percent tariffs on American coal, liquified natural gas (LNG), crude oil, and agricultural machinery, as well as the launching of an antitrust probe against Google. The tech trade fight continues to quickly escalate, with the United States raising levies on Chinese imports to 145 percent and China retaliating by raising tariffs on U.S. goods to 125 percent in early April 2025. In sharp contrast with 2018, when Chinese tech giants ZTE and Huawei were the first companies brutally hit by U.S. trade bans, 2025 shows a more resilient and agile Beijing that has updated its laws and learned its lessons from the early tech trade war to now be able to respond in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the tech trade war and the case of DeepSeek has renewed national security concerns in the White House and Congress regarding economic and technological dependency with China. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt notes that DeepSeek “is a wake-up call to the American AI industry… The last administration sat on their hands and allowed China to rapidly develop this AI program,” and that the U.S. National Security Council was “looking into” the national security implications of DeepSeek’s model to the United States. The White House announcement came right after R1’s launch and was followed by Australia, South Korea, Italy, and the State of New York deciding to ban the app from locally hosted app stores due to privacy and “unacceptable” national security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As U.S. and Chinese industries grapple with measures to deter each other’s AI development, it is tempting to focus on government action and narratives in the tit-for-tat tech trade war. Ultimately, any response will rely on the capacity of these governments to effectively leverage and create the conditions for competition among private companies, which begs the following questions: How have companies in China and the United States responded to the “DeepSeek moment?” Are companies in China ready for the pressure of a post-DeepSeek push? What is Silicon Valley’s response—and is it at all coordinated? What are the implications of the tech trade war for other countries in the Indo-Pacific?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-pressure-of-renewed-optimism-in-china&quot;&gt;THE PRESSURE OF RENEWED OPTIMISM IN CHINA&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek has injected a renewed momentum and morale in Chinese industry amid the AI race. It has not only promoted a sense that China is no longer constantly lagging behind the United States, but also that DeepSeek’s cost-effectiveness could outmaneuver U.S. competitors. Since DeepSeek’s R1 launch, Beijing has pushed for a nationwide dissemination of the model’s use, which has led to at least 13 city governments, 10 state-owned energy companies, and three state-owned telecommunications operators deploying the AI model into their systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies in China now face renewed pressure to accelerate adoption of models such as DeepSeek’s while trying to develop equal or superior models and products. DeepSeek itself is in the frontline of innovation pressures. Less than a month after announcing its R1 model, the Chinese company had already indicated its ambition to release a new R2 model planned for May 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite DeepSeek’s domestic and international impact, China’s competitiveness will rely on how avidly the Chinese government decides to push other parts of the AI supply chain to deliver more rapidly. This includes meeting its ambition to become less reliant on Nvidia chips following U.S. export controls measures limiting access to high-end chips since 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The positive momentum in Beijing has also provided the stage for Huawei to more boldly promote their own Ascend chips and increase the yield—the percentage of functioning chips in the line of production to make them profitable. After the U.S. Department of Commerce blocked Huawei from accessing manufacturing that used U.S. technology in 2020, chipmaker TSMC had to stop producing Huawei’s Ascend chips, which led Huawei to partner with also-sanctioned Chinese Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) in order to relaunch Ascend. In February 2025, the chip achieved a yield of 40 percent, bringing it closer to the 60 percent yield of Nvidia. While Huawei’s progress is unlikely to change Nvidia’s prominence in the short and medium term, Huawei’s chips can boost competition in specific subfields of the market, especially inference chips that are usually used for lightweight AI applications in smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The accelerated pace from Beijing to narrow the U.S.-China gap on AI modelling also means that companies in China will compete among themselves for the spotlight with the government. Chinese companies benefit from government backing if they demonstrate they can overcome Washington’s export controls and help China enhance self-sufficiency in AI supply chains. Days before the R1 model was announced, Chinese premier Li Qiang invited DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng to represent the AI sector in a closed-door meeting with other businessmen. A year earlier, Baidu’s CEO Robin Li attended a similar meeting when Baidu was still considered a top Chinese contender to rival OpenAI’s ChatGPT model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, the post-DeepSeek moment has left the Chinese tech sector with renewed confidence that should be handled with caution. As they compete for their own DeepSeek-like moment in the sun, Chinese firms risk overselling potential and under delivering. That is the case of Chinese startup Butterfly Effect’s release of Manus AI in March 2025. Unlike ChatGPT, Manus AI has been described by its co-founder Yichao Ji as “the world’s first general AI agent,” meaning it could independently perform tasks without human prompts for every step. While some media outlets, such as Forbes, portrayed Manus AI as a breakthrough similar to DeepSeek, it has so far received mixed reviews. The Economist and Tech Crunch have criticized it for not delivering on its promise: “in releasing it, its makers have obviously prized a job done first over a job done well.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, DeepSeek’s open weights model has also provided a first-step opportunity for public and private services in China to use it as a baseline. While AI and tech companies will continue to develop their own models and become more competitive, many have nonetheless rushed to integrate DeepSeek as part of their existing products. This includes big tech companies such as Alibaba, Tencent, and Huawei, as well as electric vehicles companies such as BYD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Export controls have only delayed, not stopped, Chinese AI supply chain innovation, meaning that Washington will need to reassess its strategy. There are now three important trends for the United States to watch: First, with slightly optimistic Hong Kong market performance in the tech sector, foreign investors might look more favorably at the Chinese market. Analysts at Morgan Stanley note that DeepSeek’s rise has led investors to start further scrutinizing companies’ AI investments with the hopes that it will lead to more efficient and accountable spending from AI companies. Second, as argued by Tobias Feakin, former Australian cyber and tech ambassador, the emergence of cheaper high-performance models could redefine cost structures and lower subscription prices, making them more competitive in developing country markets. Moreover, Feakin argues that DeepSeek has shown that competitiveness does not rely solely on access to the high-end chips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;twisted-incentives-in-silicon-valley&quot;&gt;TWISTED INCENTIVES IN SILICON VALLEY&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek’s shock came only a few days after OpenAI, Oracle, and Japanese investor SoftBank Group lined up behind President Trump at the White House as he announced Stargate, a massive $100 billion joint private venture to develop data centers in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though such efforts indicate that companies are coming together to pursue a U.S. strategic advantage in the AI race, make no mistake: these companies are still market players who will seek to maximize their own gains—and that became clear in the different ways in which they reacted to the DeepSeek moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, stated on X that it was “legit invigorating to have a new competitor.” 24 hours later, the company stated that they were concerned that their proprietary model had been used to train DeepSeek’s model, thus raising fears of breaches of OpenAI intellectual property and terms of use. OpenAI’s terms of use note that users are prohibited from “using the Output to develop models that compete with OpenAI”—this section provides the initial basis for determining whether DeepSeek’s use of OpenAI’s service was inappropriate. However, in 2023, Twitter owner Elon Musk cut off both Microsoft and OpenAI for “illegally” using Twitter data and API to train its own AI technologies. The difference with DeepSeek is that, for OpenAI, it rapidly went from a “legit competitor” to being accused of intellectual property theft via distillation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other U.S. tech giants shrugged off DeepSeek’s achievements and impact, seeing them as a temporary blip. Two days after DeepSeek’s release, Zuckerberg dismissed the low-cost training efficiency narrative and announced that Meta would spend $60 billion on capital expenditure. Nvidia joined the “shrugging off” momentum by welcoming DeepSeek’s open model innovation only a few weeks after its market valuation plunge. Moreover, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang noted that R1 was an “excellent innovation” during an earnings call while also noting that this is a business opportunity for fewer chips to be used more efficiently. Anthropic’s CEO, Dario Amodei, also notes that even if the cost of training a specific model declines, the overall investments would be “eaten up” immediately to train other more sophisticated and efficient models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reactions from tech companies also make it clear that the benefits of the U.S.-China AI competition are not evenly distributed across Silicon Valley. Some tech companies benefit from stronger restrictions on Chinese tech while others benefit from the shock of Chinese innovation. As CEO of Tesla, Musk is potentially caught in the crossfire: tariffs and export controls on Chinese-made electric vehicles (EV) hurt Tesla’s Shanghai-based EV factory production—a key source for European supply of EVs. At the same time, U.S.-China competition creates opportunities for securing competitiveness in global markets for the Starlink satellite communications service—also owned by Musk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies such as Microsoft and Amazon Web Services have taken a more acquiescent approach and integrated DeepSeek’s R1 model into their cloud and AI platforms. These platforms provide developers with access to a library of AI models and environments to test them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple experienced the other side of the DeepSeek’s shock as it saw its shares rise right after the R1 release. Small and efficient models such as DeepSeek’s provide a glimpse at what could make Apple more competitive. By engaging not in a crowded market of Big Tech investments in capital expenditure, but as a distribution platform for smaller AI models in smartphones, Apple could become less vulnerable to any potential AI bubble burst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with any shock, DeepSeek’s market disruption is temporary but sends purposeful waves, and there are two clear messages resulting from DeepSeek’s conundrum. The first message is that models can be potentially developed at a lower cost. The second message is that if it can be done more cheaply, it raises concerns that investors—who have so far been generous—might wonder whether it is a question of when, not if the AI bubble might burst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The low-cost efficiency presented by DeepSeek has renewed concerns about the sustainability of continuous injections of capital into AI supply chains and infrastructure. Meta and Nvidia’s persistent investment show that there is no immediate change to the investment mantra. This continuous cash flow is important in maintaining the market perceptions about the value of these companies, but it is not necessarily driving actual results. As hedge fund investor Ray Dalio noted: “there’s a major new technology [AI] that certainly will change the world and be successful. But some people are confusing that with the investments being successful.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite Trump’s apparent support, his fluctuating trade policies have also significantly impacted the AI supply chain market, with some tech companies delaying going public due to expectations of tariffs and export controls. Since the first Trump term, export controls and tariffs—also tightened during the Biden administration—have forced companies to swiftly reshuffle supply chains while maintaining competitive prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many unicorns, such as OpenAI, have oddly been able to delay going public and continue receiving rounds of bigger investments—growing their speculative private valuation. This has also excused them from certain levels of accountability that come with the pressures and volatility of publicly trading in the open market. The trend of delayed initial public offerings (IPOs) has also meant that there might be a discrepancy between firms’ real value and the value set by the private market—which only feeds the speculative AI bubble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;implications-in-the-indo-pacific&quot;&gt;IMPLICATIONS IN THE INDO-PACIFIC&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the U.S. and Chinese markets have developed their own government-backed investment strategies. That is the case of China’s Digital Silk Road or groupings such as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) informally leveraging such fora to discuss AI. However, across the Indo-Pacific—as in other parts of the Global South—countries have continuously used hedging strategies to manage risks and avoid exclusive entanglements with the U.S. or China by being more opportunistic about Washington and Beijing’s offers. Strategic ambiguity and pragmatism is something that has also benefited tech development in the region. For example, Singapore and Malaysia have partnered with both OpenAI and Alibaba to boost domestic AI companies and local capacities, as well as with Nvidia to develop AI infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI models such as DeepSeek R1 can further stimulate AI innovation across the Indo-Pacific in at least two ways. First, the cost-effectiveness of DeepSeek’s R1 model training provides a benchmark against which companies in the region can further optimize and test at smaller scales through partnerships with U.S. and Chinese companies. Second, rather than being seen as national security threats, open weights models such as DeepSeek’s R1 can further stimulate innovation around other open models or innovative applications. Local and regional Large Language Models (LLMs) in Southeast Asian countries have been built on top of Big Tech LLM architectures. From 2020 to 2024, cross-regional and country-based initiatives in Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand have released 35 LLMs, with 21 in 2024 alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly, rather than solely taking foreign technologies from China and the United States, countries in the region have sought to develop their own models as well. AI companies in the region have been harnessing the potential to develop models more sensitive to other languages and dialects. That is the case of homegrown indigenous LLMs such as AI Singapore’s SEA-LION, VinAI’s PhoGPT, Mesolitica’s MaLLaM, and India’s Sarvan AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;calibrating-responses&quot;&gt;CALIBRATING RESPONSES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of 2025, all eyes were focused on understanding what the new Trump administration’s posture would be on the U.S.-China trade tech war. Trump started his second term by easing Biden-era regulations on the domestic AI industry before tightening on China. Then, starting on February 27, 2025, Trump announced an extra set of tariffs on Chinese goods, accounting for a total of 20 percent tariffs in less than two months since his start—all of which escalated following his reciprocal tariffs announcement on “Liberation Day” on April 2, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite DeepSeek-triggered turbulence, this context might be good news for tech companies working on AI. Growing competition will push innovation on both sides, with China more actively seeking to mainstream and test services such as DeepSeek and the United States promoting their own companies in conjunction with what could be further tariffs (and potentially export controls) at the heart of Trump’s strategy to economically and technologically deter China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is clear that China has been making the most out of its DeepSeek moment by emboldening private companies across the AI supply chain, encouraging local deployment of the model, and savoring advances in the semiconductor supply chain. The clock is ticking on how long the economic coercion tools in the U.S. toolbox can endure, or whether we are slowly reaching a tipping point where intended economic disruption has boosted innovation in China—making them rapidly more competitive than before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a regional perspective, the Indo-Pacific remains a dynamic arena where countries seek to balance opportunities and risks amid the U.S.-China tech rivalry. With DeepSeek’s model setting new benchmarks, Indo-Pacific nations will need to carefully assess their engagement with both U.S. and Chinese AI ecosystems. Whether through regulatory frameworks, investment incentives, or fostering homegrown AI innovation, regional players will be crucial in shaping the trajectory of AI development beyond the immediate contest between Washington and Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump’s second term also inaugurates another phase in the long-term power struggle between the United States and China, with economic deterrence at its forefront. However, both sides face risks that can critically affect the AI race: American protectionism stifling Silicon Valley growth and provoking and exodus of investors; economic coercion measures backfiring if they remain the primary tool for delaying Chinese innovation; China’s overconfidence in the AI race amid the DeepSeek moment leading them to favor rapid delivery over quality; and a lack of agility in adjusting and responding to growing tariffs and export controls inhibiting Chinese progress in the AI race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US Army announced a series of organisational and capability decisions on 2 May, with Chief of Staff General Randy George promising more to follow. It may be tempting to interpret these decisions as signalling what the US Army thinks about the future of war. In reality, they speak to a series of institutional reforms that the US Army believes are pre-requisites to being ready for war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;merging-command-headquarters&quot;&gt;Merging Command Headquarters&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The announced decisions fall into two categories. First are the merger of several US Army headquarters. US Army Training and Doctrine Command and US Army Futures Command will now revert to being a single headquarters. Meanwhile US Army Forces Command – responsible for the readiness of US Army units in the Continental United States, US Army Northern Command and US Army Southern Command, are to be merged into a Western Hemisphere Command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was some logic behind the separation of these functions. Designing how the force will fight in the future is different to assuring that it is properly trained today. Managing operations in South America is not the same operational problem as preparing to screen the Arctic approaches or managing units on training rotations throughout CONUS. However, with a directive to cut the size of the force, the US Army was determined to reduce the number of headquarters rather than combat units. While the mergers will create headquarters with large spans of command, they remain coherent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second category of announcements relate to the retirement of older UAV platforms, and halting procurement of Joint Light Tactical Vehicles (JLTV), Humvees, M10-Booker Light Tanks, and AH64D Apache attack helicopters. The thing to emphasise is that these are not cuts. On JLTV and Humvees, the US Army has thousands of these vehicles in the force. The decision to stop procuring more was a determination that there are enough vehicles available for the Army’s needs. When it came to the M10 Booker, it fell victim to having a significant logistical requirement while the Army already fields a large fleet of Abrams main battle tanks and wants to invest in improving the survivability of armour through systems deployed with them, rather than duplicating the sustainment burden through another armoured vehicle type. The judgement had little to do with the Booker’s merits as a platform and much more to do with the readiness of deployable units of action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-unified-apache-fleet&quot;&gt;A Unified Apache Fleet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision to retire AH64D will see the Army continue to operate AH64E Apache. Put simply, the Army is trying to move to a unified Apache fleet to make maintenance more efficient and cheaper, and to ensure that its attack aviation can integrate with other elements of the force. The US Army still believes attack aviation is part of its combined arms toolkit, albeit in a more limited role than during the high point of AirLand Battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Retiring some older UAV platforms speaks to the more fundamental changes that General George wants to see through his programme to Transform in Contact. He wants to move away from long acquisition timelines and protracted programmes of record with a high price per platform. Instead, learning from the rate of adaptation necessary to remain competitive in Ukraine, he wants to see the Army buy many different classes of UAV, empower units to upgrade and adapt them, and purchase new systems quickly. Critically the career path for UAV operators will move away from grading them as dedicated operators of defined platforms – Shadow or Grey Eagle – towards classing them as expert UAV operators competent on using different platforms and adapting them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the thrust of General George and his team’s thinking before the Trump Administration took office. Indeed, initial steps in this direction were underway in 2023. However, acquisition for the US Army is managed by the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology, who reports to the political leadership and not to the Army Chief of Staff. Before freeing up budget, therefore, the US Army wanted assurance that it could reallocate funds to key new priorities, but also spend money more flexibly to change the way it procures. It seems that progress is being made in this direction with the new Administration, though critics in industry would argue that little has actually changed as regards the bureaucratic processes they must follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That the US Army wants to make procurement more agile does not mean that it lacks the need for major programmes of record. Magazine depth of long-range strike munitions, next generation command and control, integrated air and missile defence including counter-UAV systems, and electronic warfare are all major priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;points-of-interest-for-uk-defence&quot;&gt;Points of Interest for UK Defence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those watching these decisions – and those that will follow – the question is not whether to replicate US Army decisions. The British Army, for example, has one Apache fleet at the AH64E standard. It lacks key equipment types rather than having a surplus of platforms in service. The decisions are therefore different. But the changes made to how the US Army is procuring, and the authorities it is seeking to accelerate procurement and make it more flexible, certainly chime with critiques of the UK procurement system as used in peacetime, compared with the demonstrated requirements in war. Chief of the General Staff General Roly Walker’s emphasis on increasing the lethality of British Army units is intended in part as a benchmark against which to change how the army acquires and introduces equipment. The question is whether the UK’s National Armaments Director and wider Defence Reform will deliver the institutional changes to make procurement match modern industrial and military needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge for both the US and British Army’s in this process is how little of the problem they control. General George may be able to free up some budget by cutting programmes, to move laterally. General Walker can use innovation funds to try and rapidly bring novel equipment into discrete units. But the dysfunction of military procurement in the US and UK reflects departmental policy, legal requirements, and political interference in what militaries keep and buy that are beyond the control of service chiefs. Army leadership are signalling that they are prepared for change. It remains to be seen whether the political leadership in either country are invested in the reforms necessary to make those changes ultimately successful.&lt;/p&gt;

Identifying key drivers of change, as well as understanding their second- and third-order effects and the interrelationships between them, does more than help to prepare for contingencies—it also helps to look for warning indicators and triggers of profound change, and it can drive action to prevent scenarios from coming about in the first place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scenario-1&quot;&gt;Scenario 1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;china-stalls&quot;&gt;China Stalls&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China faces serious headwinds, and it is possible that its economic challenges have begun to sap the energy behind its global rise. One headwind is not China’s fault: By their very nature, developing economies tend to grasp the low-hanging fruit early in their growth. As their economies grow larger and more complex, and as businesses begin to maximize efficiencies and streamline processes, economic growth inevitably slows. It is easy to grow swiftly from a low base, and it is nearly impossible to do so from a high one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is a high likelihood that China’s growth trajectory will flatten going forward. In addition to the factors noted in this scenario, China’s political system may be ill-equipped to respond to mounting headwinds. China’s political system is conservative by nature, making it less suited to deliver sharp course corrections.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;director-john-l-thornton-china-center-at-brookings&quot;&gt;Director, John L. Thornton China Center at Brookings&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another headwind for China is its demographic outlook. China’s adoption of the one-child policy in 1979 created a demographic dividend. In 1975, the United Nations estimated that for every 10 Chinese of working age, there were 8 who were too old or too young to work; by 2010, the number who were not expected to work was half that. Now, with Chinese fertility stubbornly low and the population aging, the trends are reversing. According to current estimates, by 2075, every 10 Chinese workers will be supporting 10 dependents, and by 2093, that number will rise to 13.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, China’s population peaked in 2021 at 1.4 billion people. It is set to sink to under a billion in 2070 and continue drifting down to 639 million by 2100. While these are still very large numbers by any measure, shrinking populations depress markets for everything from real estate to manufactured goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Will China prioritize tech dominance or rebalance toward household consumption and welfare? The former likely means expanded commercial and political tensions with much of the world; the latter would turn China into a net importer and lead to improved ties with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other headwinds are many: a burst real estate bubble, sagging productivity growth, growing tensions with the United States that restrict technology inputs, and a leadership that seems less willing than its predecessors to let entrepreneurs roam free. Government statistics are enjoying less trust amid suspicions that conditions are worse than the government is willing to admit. Businesspeople are concerned that the Chinese banking system is not only full of nonperforming loans but has also lost much of its dynamism. Local governments in China have been especially affected by deteriorating economic conditions, and they are cutting spending on infrastructure projects and other important initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Beyond tech and trade, U.S.-China security tensions are likely to intensify, particularly regarding Taiwan. It is possible that even as China’s economy stalls, Beijing may need to increase security spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While China has steadily expanded for four decades, it is worth considering what a steadily contracting China might look like in the future. In part, it would enjoy less soft power. China has earned widespread admiration for producing sharp economic growth uninterrupted by social upheaval. Economic stagnation maintained through authoritarian control is a less remarkable feat, and while it is not currently the Chinese calling card, it could be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When China experiences challenges, however, policy inflexibility becomes a liability. China’s leaders may also underappreciate the scale of the challenges on their horizon because they judge that the United States’ problems are larger than their own.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-ryan-hass-1&quot;&gt;— Ryan Hass&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If some in the United States have their way, the movement of manufacturing out of China and into countries that are closer to the United States—whether ideologically or geographically—would drop Chinese growth further. Whether one calls it “de-risking” or “decoupling,” a reduced U.S. export market for China, combined with restrictions on technology that China can import from the United States and its partners, would change conditions in China significantly. Arguably, that would advance U.S. interests at China’s expense, although how the United States would pursue it and how China would respond are open questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whichever way the United States pursues de-risking, it would likely put a further damper on foreign direct investment in China because it would create uncertainty about the prospects of exporting to the United States, the world’s largest market. While that alone would not force a contraction in the Chinese economy, it would contribute to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A contracting China would also spread less cash around the world. By 2017, China had become the world’s largest official creditor, with its loans exceeding the combined value of those of the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, and all 22 wealthy governments that constitute the Paris Club. The Belt and Road Initiative seized imaginations because of expectations about its scope and scale. Not only has the initiation of program projects slowed, but overall Chinese lending to developing countries has slowed as well. According to data from Boston University, China financed $87.0 billion of overseas development projects in 2016; by 2021, the total had dropped to $3.7 billion. The university also notes that over the last decade, Chinese lending to Africa has increasingly come from Chinese commercial banks rather than policy banks. The resultant loans are concentrated less on infrastructure and more in revenue-producing industries such as mining and financial services. They also have less favorable terms of repayment and can complicate sovereign debt burdens. In the last five years, Sri Lanka and Zambia have defaulted on past loans from China, and countries such as Pakistan have enacted draconian budget cuts to meet their Chinese debt burdens. Increasingly, China is appearing in the role of extractor rather than developer of resources in target countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China asserts that it spends $230 billion per year on defense; some in the U.S. government assert that the true number is $700 billion. While Westerners can debate the size of the Chinese military buildup, there is little question that the Chinese military footprint is currently expanding in Asia and around the world. China has the world’s largest navy, with more than 370 ships and submarines, and it is fielding a nuclear-capable refueled bomber. The Chinese navy paid 27 naval port calls in 2023, demonstrating its capacity to operate far from Chinese shores. In addition, China sent more than 2,000 troops abroad on peacekeeping missions, building goodwill and exhibiting a capability to deploy and operate far from Chinese shores. China is also rapidly expanding its military technology base, with advancements ranging from aircraft carriers to advanced fighter jets and autonomous systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A slowing China could still become more formidable militarily and technologically. China’s advantages in manufacturing are unlikely to disappear, and the military investments it has already made will continue to provide advantage in the future. The Soviet Union stagnated for decades before collapse, but it was perhaps increasingly formidable even amid that stagnation. The same may be true of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An economic slowdown would constrain China’s military growth. Facing a traditional choice between guns and butter, China’s leaders would have to be even more selective about what military capabilities they are willing invest in, what contingencies they will prepare for, and what locations they will protect. A tightening fiscal environment will narrow the choices China’s leaders have to exercise national power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;China may need to spend more on security to address external threats and internal unrest. It is possible that China may not be (more) selective about the military capabilities it invests in.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-bonny-lin-1&quot;&gt;— Bonny Lin&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Regardless, China’s diplomatic activism is likely to continue to gradually expand to other regions, while its military focus is likely to remain on its periphery, with primary attention on contingencies such as in the Taiwan Straits.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-scott-kennedy-1&quot;&gt;— Scott Kennedy&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its challenges, China is currently more economically, diplomatically, and even militarily dominant than Russia. Yet, over time, it may begin to fall behind India, which has already surpassed China in population and is exhibiting stronger economic growth (albeit from a lower base). India has attracted significant investment from the Arabian Peninsula, which has historic ties to the subcontinent. A growing India could hem in China’s rise in Asia, and it could squeeze out Chinese relationships in parts of the Middle East. Since the United States views India as a more benign power, the United States may abet India’s rise in a way that constrains China and gives the United States a relative advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The effectiveness of using a rising India to balance China depends on India’s internal constraints. It would turn heavily on whether India could finally overcome seemingly enduring internal political and ideological constraints and translate its economic and military potential into reality. Given China’s substantial head start, China will still be formidable in absolute and relative terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scenario-2&quot;&gt;Scenario 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;us-global-leadership-falters&quot;&gt;U.S. Global Leadership Falters&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has seen itself in a global leadership role for so long, it is hard for many to imagine how a retreat from that role would manifest itself. The United States leapt onto the global stage as the Cold War unfolded, abandoning decades of inward focus. It found both security and purpose restoring war-ravaged countries in Europe and Asia, as well as building the emerging postcolonial countries in Africa and the Middle East. For decades, the United States invested its overwhelming economic and military dominance into shaping a global system that others would feel a stake in sustaining. What many Americans have come to call the “rules-based order” certainly privileged the economic, legal, and governance patterns of the United States and its allies, but it was also constraining. It led to limits on U.S. action and lent a certain predictability to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are seeing a momentous change in world politics. What some termed the “liberal international order” was actually an “American-led international order,” which is not quite the same thing. The United States set certain rules of the game, promoted certain values, and maintained order not universally, but in selected areas.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;arleigh-a-burke-chair-in-strategy-at-csis&quot;&gt;Arleigh A. Burke Chair in Strategy at CSIS&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for many Americans, and for the Trump administration, the United States has invested too much and reaped too little from subordinating U.S. interests to a so-called “rules-based order” that seemingly lets others take advantage of the United States. For them, the U.S. commitment to international affairs is an elite luxury, not a bedrock concern, and they perceive recent U.S. international efforts as expensive failures—not least multitrillion-dollar efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan in the wake of 9/11 whose results fell far short of expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid this international context, the U.S. government’s budget is under strain, and that strain will increase in the coming years. With $7.3 trillion in planned outlays in 2025 and only $5.5 trillion in receipts, the U.S. federal budget is far out of balance. A growing cohort of retirees entitled to government support, combined with promises to cut taxes further, will put increased pressure on government spending. The calls to focus on curtailing foreign engagement are likely to survive long beyond when the Trump administration’s term ends in January 2029.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The scenario assumes the United States can retain hegemony without global leadership, which seems unlikely. The United States can’t get to the tech restrictions or military scale necessary to manage China without allied assistance, the dollar will be a less recourse to safety, and without global leadership, the United States won’t be setting the rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effects of a U.S. pullback in international affairs would not be evenly distributed. Given a deep and bipartisan consensus that China represents the largest challenge to U.S. global interests, the United States will almost certainly maintain a strong if not growing military commitment to the western Pacific. India’s growing economy, combined with its increasingly agile diplomacy and its sometimes-strained ties to China, will draw increased U.S. attention in the coming years, too, as will rising economies in Southeast Asia. For countries in the Pacific, it may feel in many ways like the United States has not pulled back at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The credibility of that military commitment will be called into question by U.S. allies and partners across Asia. Deterrence is a combination of capability and will. The demonstrated U.S. willingness to transform (in a rather negative way) its relationships in Europe and pull back from being the guarantor of European security is already fomenting distrust and skepticism elsewhere—including in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for much of the rest of the world, the United States would likely be felt less. The voices of Americans who have argued for more than a decade that the United States has been overcommitted to the Middle East would rise, and the time and attention the United States pays to Africa and Latin America would fall. Not only would Europe be expected to fend more for itself, but the intra-European rivalries and tensions that had been blunted under three-quarters of a century of U.S. primacy would flourish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A U.S. withdrawal from its role protecting norms is likely to open up the way for greater international violence. Large states will attempt to assert spheres of influence and smaller ones will defend themselves in a variety of ways, including by the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-eliot-a-cohen-1&quot;&gt;— Eliot A. Cohen&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Europe is clearly going to have to do more for its own security. What we don’t know is whether this will lead to greater unity on the continent given that Europe now has to worry about three adversaries (China, Russia, and the United States) rather than just the first two or whether the absence of U.S. hegemony will lead to the greater intra-European rivalries and tensions that are cited here.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;professor-of-international-relations-at-american-university&quot;&gt;Professor of International Relations at American University&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia and China would seek to expand their ties further into regions that feel newly neglected. Even more importantly, a growing number of governments would seek to expand their own ties with Russia and China, partly to hedge against U.S. abandonment, but also to gain leverage against a newly hegemonic United States that feels less bound by international rules. Regional hegemons would almost certainly seek to fill the vacuum the United States has left in its wake, requiring regional states to make new accommodations to their interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The main “glue” of the Sino-Russian relationship is shared hostility to a U.S.-led order. How does the underlying strategic logic of their relationship evolve in a world where the United States is playing a much less active role in key arenas? China will still have good reason to contest the United States, assuming the United States’ presence in Asia remains consistent. However, there may be good reasons to expect Moscow and Beijing to feel less compelled to align and coordinate if the United States isn’t pushing as hard into domains of shared interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A United States that gives up global leadership will not necessarily sustain military forces in East Asia. A likelier move will be to reduce forces, shifting defense burdens onto regional allies and making U.S. security commitments more brittle or, at the extreme, a bargain with China that limits or withdraws U.S. forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-kori-schake-1&quot;&gt;— Kori Schake&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. commitment to international organizations could also shrink, which would be felt both in terms of diplomatic attention as well as budget support. The United States is the largest contributor to the UN system, paying just under a quarter of the organization’s expenditures. The United States spent more than $15 billion on humanitarian assistance in 2023 (including more than $10 billion in voluntary contributions to UN agencies such as the World Food Programme, UNICEF, and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees) and about $10 billion more on global health. The U.S. role supporting the orchestration of such assistance could also diminish, reducing the efficiency and effectiveness of aid missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Will NATO continue as an institution if the United States disengages or withdraws from it? Will the lack of U.S. involvement with NATO destroy the institution? If NATO survives without U.S. leadership, what will its relationship with the European Union be? The expectation that a U.S. withdrawal from Europe will lead to a flourishing of intra-European rivalries and tensions is warranted, but given the threats Europe faces, it might instead lead to greater unity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-james-goldgeier-1&quot;&gt;— James Goldgeier&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A commitment of military resources absent economic and diplomatic cooperation will appear halfhearted. This is due to the onslaught of tariffs and the degradation of Department of State resources. These sentiments will be felt even in Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-mara-karlin-1&quot;&gt;— Mara Karlin&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The broader economic effects of a more unilateral U.S. approach to international affairs are unclear. We should expect some slowdown in U.S. efforts to integrate global financial networks, and an increase in transparency is expected, combined with an increased effort by others to create parallel institutions. Trade would likely grow more regionalized as the security of sea lanes diminishes and the robustness of global free trade efforts languishes (or potentially withers under U.S. assault). The United States would also emerge as a more aggressive trading partner, using the size of its domestic market to win concessions for U.S. exporters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While none of this necessarily would lead to warfare, there would be a period of adjustment and volatility as the world settles into a new equilibrium. Throughout, and perhaps even afterwards, governments would need to put a premium on hedging and agility, and businesses would be evaluating their prospects in a higher-risk environment. Of course, returns would be higher for some, but probably not for all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We must expect a level of instability in international politics that we have not known since the 1930s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scenario-3&quot;&gt;Scenario 3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;trust-fails&quot;&gt;Trust Fails&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of technology’s relatively unappreciated qualities is that it has helped boost global trust. The internet has become an ecosystem whereby anyone can purchase goods from any seller anywhere in the world. Both the buyer and seller have relatively high confidence that the promised goods will be delivered and the seller will be paid, even if this is a one-time transaction where the parties have no connection to each other. Government identification documents have increasingly moved beyond photographs to include definitive biometric data. The global banking system mostly has abandoned paper documents that can be forged—or lost—and sends money around the world in a fraction of a second. Databases contain vast amounts of information that can verify almost any data point and make information available to any mobile phone user anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology’s ability to ensure that strangers can trust each other has accelerated and deepened economic activities, even in remote places. If one side or another fails to meet obligations, that will be recorded in some way in the vast depository of shared information: Credit reports will be hurt, online reputations will be tarnished, and platform access will be revoked. In that environment, individuals and firms need not limit their engagements to a small number of well-known entities, promoting efficiency, innovation, and agility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Encryption is the bedrock on which digital commerce is built. We trust it to protect sensitive information and validate digital identities. But quantum computing could render most existing encryption technology obsolete. Trust doesn’t just depend on how we use existing technology, but also on how new technologies impact existing digital foundations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, just as technology has boosted trust, there are increasing signs that technology can be used to diminish trust. One part of this dynamic involves disinformation and misinformation. Deepfakes—which use advanced technology to create visual and audio records of people saying and doing things they have not done—are just the beginning. Computing power can be used to create false records that either build or tarnish a reputation and can create entities and events that exist only in the imagination. Once corruption infects an information system, it compromises the presumed integrity of everything in that system. For example, if a hostile actor can change even a limited amount of information in a government employment database, every data point for every employee potentially becomes suspect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;U.S. adversaries already use technology to facilitate information operations aimed at undermining trust. This includes cyber-enabled info ops. Damaging reputation, usually a collateral impact of a cyber incident, can instead be the objective. Likewise, disinformation can magnify the consequences of a cyberattack—or any other attack or disaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have lived in a world where creating high-quality evidence of an event has been significantly easier than creating high-quality forgeries. The balance of cost and complexity has favored easy authentication. That was not true 150 years ago, and it may be less true going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There will be an arms race on creating and detecting fakes. It will take time for detection technologies to diffuse. Generating tech may spread faster than detection tools, creating windows where no credible verification tech exists.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;research-fellow-at-rand-corporation&quot;&gt;Research Fellow at RAND Corporation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disinformation can also reduce the perceived credibility of news sources, spreading knowledge of false stories and undermining the credibility of true ones. Citizens’ trust in institutions, in governments, and in those around them would diminish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Without journalists to do rigorous reporting, we risk losing reliable accounts of world events. We may be left with only anecdotes and conjecture as a source of information, degrading the quality of information everywhere and further undermining trust. A healthy information ecosystem is essential for trust, and depends on trust to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-will-carter-1&quot;&gt;— Will Carter&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Lack of trust complicates response activities and contributes to social unrest. It can ultimately erode the thin veneer of civilization.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-suzzanne-spaulding&quot;&gt;— Suzzanne Spaulding&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second way technology can diminish trust is through spreading disinformation through social media. Because social media’s algorithms are optimized for engagement, it tends to support material that evokes an emotional reaction. Under these circumstances, misinformation that elicits outrage becomes widespread, and information that corrects the misinformation is downplayed. In addition, malign actors’ own algorithms can create vast amounts of disinformation with relative autonomy, allowing those actors to experiment with a wide variety of products to see what works. While most social media platforms have a vetting process meant to curb the most serious excesses, critics have argued that they are insufficient. When it works at its best, social media connects people with shared interests and identities. But social media sometimes does so at the expense of larger, more heterogenous communities and can promote internal division. In addition, social media also allows for cyberbullying and anonymous attacks, diminishing social trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;AI companies, or at least actors with AI expertise, will build tools to detect AI-modified content. Trust may erode more quickly or unevenly if it relies on tech companies, especially internationally, where other countries may be quite suspicious of U.S. companies adjudicating what’s fake and what’s not.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-christopher-byrd-1&quot;&gt;— Christopher Byrd&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consequences of a collapse in trust over the next decade would be broad. Economically, it would reverse a trend toward global trade dynamism. It would likely result in increased tariffs, require increased inspections of shipments, and make arms-length trade connections more difficult. Digital platforms would be encumbered, and financial platforms would become less efficient. Reduced trust in supply chains, exacerbated by disinformation or fears of cyber sabotage, could disrupt global trade. The increased costs of identity verification within societies would also spread widely, and it would increase friction in commerce and slow growth. Small- and medium-sized enterprises, which lack the resources of larger corporations to manage these risks, would be particularly vulnerable, widening economic inequality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;AI digital forgeries may affect different countries differently. Highly developed economies will have better access to state-of-the-art verification technologies, and undeveloped economies may not be contract-intensive enough for forgeries of records to matter as much. We may have economies in the middle tier where records matter but forgeries are hard to detect.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-christopher-byrd-2&quot;&gt;— Christopher Byrd&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We’re entering a new era, when an auditable chain of custody of photo, video, and audio recordings matters far more than their mere existence. For now, technical means can still usually detect the presence of AI interventions, but this gets more difficult with each passing day. The human eye and ear are no longer enough.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-greg-allen-1&quot;&gt;— Greg Allen&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Politically, less trust would be likely to polarize societies, reducing confidence in governmental institutions and deepening a sense of pervasive unfairness. Because central governments are responsible for engaging with other governments, diminished support for governments would be likely to encumber international cooperation, especially on complex regulatory matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Even without a significant incident or disaster, trust in institutions can erode over time. This includes sources of information and can lead to despair and disengagement, robbing society of the informed and engaged citizenry necessary for democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-suzanne-spaulding-1&quot;&gt;— Suzanne Spaulding&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internationally, a decline in trust would diminish foreign direct investment and international loans, especially in countries that do not have a robust digital infrastructure to protect trust. Creating and supporting such an infrastructure would be an expensive proposition, and diminishing global trust would likely deepen the divide between wealthier and poorer states. In addition, perceptions that foreign governments are using their technological power to weaken adversaries could set off an escalatory spiral of attacks and counterattacks that further diminish trust within societies, making agreements between governments even harder to strike. That could promote a world that is not only less peaceful and less prosperous, but one with more robust criminal networks that can escape government control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ironically, more controls against malicious uses of technology often exist in countries with fewer protections against government intrusion. When companies are asked to police use of their technology, they face criticism for intervening too much and not doing enough. This trade-off is one of the great challenges of digital policy—enforcing norms of digital behavior that protect trust requires tools and authorities that can also enable serious abuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia is reportedly mobilising 160,000 new troops, ramping up its war efforts in Ukraine. Meanwhile, President Trump is eager to broker a peace deal, despite remaining obstacles and with limited US support for Ukraine. The burden of leadership is increasingly on the Coalition of the Willing – led by the UK and France and composed of states committed to supporting Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether current diplomacy succeeds, Russia will pose the central threat to European security. This requires a strong, coherent long-term strategy. Such a strategy must incorporate historical “tools” alongside other approaches. While policymakers in the field of international relations do recognise the importance of historical knowledge and skills, it is often lacking a structural integration in the onboarding processes for new diplomats and policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tool-1-understanding-russias-historical-narrative&quot;&gt;Tool 1: Understanding Russia’s Historical Narrative&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to gain a deep understanding of the Russian historical narrative. This narrative became more assertive from 2007/2008 onwards and centred, on the idea of reunifying different Slavic peoples within one holy Russian nation and protecting (ethnic) Russians (abroad). It reflects the Kremlin’s motivations on the international stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One cannot assess the value of a concession without a clear grasp of what drives Russia’s leadership. In parts of the West, the (naïve) belief persists that Russia’s imperial ambitions are limited to Ukraine. Yet Russia’s historical narrative is not rhetorical. It is used for political purposes and weaponised to justify the ongoing war. Russia’s historically informed agenda leaves no doubt about its ambitions on the international stage and the threat it poses to European security. Effectively communicating these insights to the public is important for sustaining public support for Ukraine and for broader investments in European security, particularly as these investments will compete with other spending priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s historical narrative must also be considered in the negotiations over a peace deal. Even if a deal is reached, the Russian perception of Ukraine as a hostile Nazi state is unlikely to disappear. This narrative – propagated through state media, the education system, and even a military-theme park near Moscow – remains deeply embedded. The Coalition of the Willing must reckon with this factor when shaping its longer-term strategy towards Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tool-2-learning-from-analogies-and-precedents&quot;&gt;Tool 2: Learning from Analogies and Precedents&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second historical tool is the analysis of analogies and precedents. In the context of the ongoing negotiations over a peace deal, it is relevant to examine how Russia has approached diplomacy in past conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, during the wars in Chechnya (1994-1996, 1999-2009), Russia used the interwar period to reorganise, and ultimately launch a renewed offensive. A comparable pattern played out in Syria, where Russia’s intervention from 2015 onwards was marked by strategic use of ceasefires, not as pathways to peace, but as opportunities to regroup before resuming military operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2016, Russia announced a withdrawal of its forces from Syria. In reality, this was a rotation of troops in preparation for a large-scale offensive. These examples are a recurring strategy: using diplomacy as a tactical opportunity rather than as a step towards lasting peace. The Minsk Agreements (2014-2015), which sought to halt fighting in the Donbas, similarly failed to produce durable peace and ultimately preceded Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the battlefield, Russia pursues a long-term objective to disrupt the European security order that has existed since the 1990s. While the US has repeatedly reaffirmed its continued support for NATO, growing indications suggest European reliance on American security can no longer be taken for granted. Telling signals include US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth’s statement that the US is no longer “the primary guarantor of security in Europe,” as well as President Trump’s remarks on potentially using military force to acquire Greenland from NATO ally Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, Europe must accelerate efforts to develop greater autonomy. Over the longer term, this calls for institutionalising the Coalition of the Willing into a more permanent European security structure. The EU, in its current configuration, is unlikely to serve as such a structure, given internal divisions and the problematic role of member states like Hungary. A new model is required. Historical precedents, including the Western Union (1948), the European Defence Community (proposed 1952), and the Western European Union (1954-2011), offer useful points of reference. The point is not to replicate these past models, but rather to examine what once existed, understand what worked and what did not, and draw relevant lessons for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, analysing analogies and precedents offers no certainty about what lies ahead. Events may unfold differently. However, history helps to identify which factors must be taken into account. By understanding the past, policymakers are better equipped to anticipate developments, and in some cases, even prevent certain scenarios from materialising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tool-3-contextualising-the-war&quot;&gt;Tool 3: Contextualising the War&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third historical tool is contextualisation. Contextualisation aids in elucidating Ukraine’s position regarding potential peace negotiations. A key reference point is the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, in which Ukraine relinquished its nuclear weapons in exchange for security assurances from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Russia. The lesson Ukraine has drawn from this experience is that written agreements offer limited protection. This insight helps explain President Zelensky’s reluctance to engage in negotiations and his persistent insistence on obtaining firm security guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;historical-tools-at-the-strategic-level&quot;&gt;Historical Tools at the Strategic Level&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historians, especially those working on international relations, typically emphasize history for policy: providing insights based on their scholarly research. Yet what is increasingly needed is a shift toward history in policy: the structural integration of historical thinking into the policymaking process itself. Where and how can historical tools be embedded? And what knowledge and skills do policymakers – particularly those within the Coalition of the Willing – need to meaningfully incorporate historical perspectives into their work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our research shows that many diplomats and policymakers already apply (some of) the historical tools we have mentioned, sometimes consciously, often intuitively. The real question thus is whether political leaders are willing and able to act on the insights history provides.&lt;/p&gt;

This paper provides a wider conceptual lens, looking beyond the UN debate and, to some degree, Western perspectives.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responsible cyber behaviour (RCB) refers to the collective expectations of state and non-state actors about how they should behave in cyberspace. “Behaviour” in this context comprises the values, norms, policies, practices and technologies that are meant to protect and secure cyberspace. These expectations are highly contested and vary across regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within cybersecurity debates – and specifically in the context of the UN’s Open-Ended Working Group on the security of and in cyberspace (OEWG) and Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) – “responsibility” has often been associated with “responsible state behaviour”. Within this context, the term “responsible state behaviour” mainly concerns the collective expectations of UN member states in meeting and observing their international commitments to norms and international law. The debate largely concentrates on how states should behave towards each other, rather than how they ought to act domestically. As these discussions are held at the UN First Committee responsible for international peace and security, dialogue on responsibility in cyberspace is restricted to those parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RUSI’s research, and this paper, takes a wider view, based on the premise that understanding RCB requires consideration of cultural values, regional alliances and domestic factors such as institutional or legislative setup. The objective of this paper is to provide a wider conceptual lens on RCB, looking beyond the UN debate and, to some degree, beyond Western perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper investigates two areas: states’ perceptions of what international responsibility entails; and how other multilateral bodies and initiatives have sought to frame responsibility. The research evidence, gathered via a series of semi-structured interviews and workshops, shows that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is widespread recognition that the UN framework alone does not enable a sufficient understanding of RCB: elements of a state’s strategic preferences (such as regional dynamics, foreign policy, economic status and domestic regimes) are equally critical to a state’s view of RCB.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beyond the UN framework, states view RCB in at least three ways: as an economic driver; as a set of tools that help them define and signal unacceptable behaviour; and as a multi-sited diplomatic strategy to advance a national interest.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most states emphasise a positive interpretation of responsibility, linking RCB to economic development and prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cyber capacity building is the most consistent theme associated with RCB, as it provides states with mechanisms and resources that help them act responsibly in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some states emphasise the usefulness of negative responsibility measures, such as “naming and shaming” tactics, but most states avoid publicly identifying bad actors, concentrating instead on condemning behaviour generically and responding with discreet diplomatic and technical measures.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given increasingly fragmented multilateral governance and growing geopolitical divides, states have progressively used non-UN forums to develop norms and shared views on irresponsible behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recommendations include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encourage diplomatic engagement with non-Western attribution narratives:&lt;/strong&gt; As non-Western states become more vocal in attributing behaviour, Western states should develop strategies to address emerging public attribution practices – especially by countries such as China and Russia – including by clarifying evidentiary standards and proactively communicating their own thresholds for public attribution. This can help manage the reputational risks of being named by adversarial states.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clarify expectations for private sector actors in cyber diplomacy and capacity building:&lt;/strong&gt; International organisations and donors should define clearer expectations around the involvement of private companies in cyber capacity building, particularly regarding transparency, conflict of interest and alignment with international standards of responsible behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support the development of national legal and policy frameworks that define operational cyber responsibility:&lt;/strong&gt; States, particularly in the Global South, should be supported in developing national policies that articulate their approach to cyber operations or the acquisition of cyber capabilities –including doctrines, thresholds for response and mechanisms for oversight – in line with international commitments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrate incident response practices into ongoing cyber norms discussions:&lt;/strong&gt; Multilateral and regional cyber forums should seek to leverage more insights from national computer emergency response teams and technical agencies in discussions on cyber norms, with a focus on how real time responses to incidents reflect or challenge evolving expectations of responsible behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Map how existing multilateral forums interpret and apply RCB principles:&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers and policymakers should continue to collaborate to further develop a comparative analysis on how different multilateral organisations or groupings seek to shape and/or operationalise RCB (for example, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, the BRICS, the International Telecommunications Union, ASEAN, and the OECD), even where the term “RCB” is not explicitly used. This will help identify overlapping expectations and areas of normative divergence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2015, UN member states agreed on 11 international norms to guide their behaviour in cyberspace. The norms establish general expectations for interstate interaction in cyberspace on topics such as cooperation, information sharing, respect for human rights, assistance with major cyber incident recovery, and the reporting of vulnerabilities. These norms are part of a two-decade set of dialogues conducted by the UN Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) and the UN Open-Ended Working Group on the security of and in cyberspace (OEWG), respectively. Successive resolutions from these processes have established what has come to be known as the UN framework for responsible state behaviour, comprising four main pillars that encompass the 11 norms (Figure 1): international law, cyber norms, confidence building measures (CBMs), and cyber capacity building (CCB).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/70GAyrv.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: UN Norms of Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aspi.org.au/report/un-norms-responsible-state-behaviour-cyberspace&quot;&gt;Bart Hogeveen, “The UN Norms of Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace”, Australian Strategic Policy Institute, 22 March 2022&lt;/a&gt;, p. 14. Edited by RUSI.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite geopolitical tensions between the US and China, the ongoing war in Ukraine, the crisis in Gaza and critiques concerning the erosion of the multilateral system, cyber has remained a slow but steady area of debate at the UN. Elements of the framework have been implemented regionally and domestically: since 2012, 32 countries have outlined their interpretations of international law’s application to cyberspace; public attribution of cyber incidents has become more frequent (albeit still limited to only a few states), CCB has gained prominence as a strategic investment area, and regional bodies have expanded their lists of cyber CBMs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, viewing responsibility in cyberspace solely through a UN lens is insufficient for understanding how responsible cyber behaviour (RCB) is perceived across different regions, and for identifying emerging state practices in this field, for a number of reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The UN framework provides only a partial picture of debates on responsible behaviour in cyberspace and can create a limited view of international expectations of state/non-state actors’ observance of emerging standards of responsibility, leaving out a much broader field of initiatives, practices and dialogues.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both policy and scholarly debates on responsibility and accountability in cyberspace have been led by a narrow interest in the international security dimension advanced by the UN, which has focused on questions about attribution and the consequences (or lack thereof) of non-observance of agreed norms and international law.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the UN framework is the outcome of consensus-based processes, the diplomatic power to shape the international agenda is concentrated in the hands of a few states. As a result, the consensus has, at times, been tabled and drafted by many, but meaningfully negotiated by only a select few.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;States have struggled to track how the UN framework is implemented and referenced domestically (beyond, that is, general acknowledgements from ministries of foreign affairs or other departments that might be more attuned to international security dimensions of responsibility in cyberspace).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These challenges raise important policy questions: how and (whether) the UN framework is socialised beyond diplomatic circles, and how states have sought to demonstrate their commitments to it domestically. The challenges also underscore the limitations of a UN-centric perspective, which conceals an equally important policy question: how have different views of responsibility so far emerged via other international dialogues and across regions and countries?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing on interviews, workshops, participant observation and a literature review, this paper responds to these and other challenges by taking stock of how notions of responsibility are socialised beyond the UN discussion in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investigating states’ perceptions of how to exercise international responsibility:&lt;/strong&gt; The paper provides an analysis of emerging state practices in response to the different components of the UN framework. It reflects on practical examples of how states have enacted international responsibility in terms of both positive responsibility (observance of rights, obligations and voluntary commitments) and negative responsibility (identifying or acting on lack of observance).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identifying how other multilateral or multistakeholder forums define RCB beyond the UN:&lt;/strong&gt; The paper offers a reflection of how RCB has been defined beyond the UN First Committee terminology, and provides a multi-sited perspective of international responsibility by analysing documents from other international organisations, multilateral groupings and regional bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If left unaddressed, these challenges could erode confidence in and observance of accountability measures by states. For Western governments, understanding the limitations as well as the perceived biases of a UN-centric approach can help them to identify blind spots and opportunities for engaging in constructive dialogue with developing and Global South countries in multilateral negotiations. For most states, and for those in the Global South in particular, having a clear grasp of the evolving state practices at the domestic, operational and international levels, and how they already connect to international commitments, can help them to identify areas of existing and potential implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most crucially, and as this paper shows, although states might not explicitly use the terms “responsible state behaviour” or “responsible cyber behaviour”, this does not mean that expectations of responsible behaviour in cyberspace are not being shaped in other multilateral, thematic or bilateral forums. Understanding and tracking forums beyond the UN can help states identify values, motivations and emerging interpretations of RCB – including those that might not always be aligned with the UN framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The structure and content of this paper were developed and collected throughout the duration of RUSI’s Responsible Cyber Behaviour project. The findings are based on a combination of different data collection methods that were used to map states’ views on RCB and the implementation of the UN framework (albeit not restricted to the latter). Data collection took place from July 2023 to October 2024, during which the author engaged with approximately 70 governments and other non-governmental experts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The methodology used for data collection and analysis as part of this project included a set of primary sources (workshops, participant observation, interviews) and secondary sources for data collection (and literature review). Together, these sources cover the UN, other multilateral forums, national policies and scholarly analyses of RCB-related topics covered in this paper:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Literature review:&lt;/strong&gt; A review of literature from the past decade including (but not restricted to) academic papers, policy documents, official statements, resolutions and news pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interviews:&lt;/strong&gt; Semi-structured interviews with 15 government representatives from different regions. These interviews took place either as follow-ups to workshops or alongside participant observation. Their primary purpose was to fill gaps in information. Interviewees 1–7 were from the Indo-Pacific, interviewees 8–10 from Europe, interviewees 11–12 from the Middle East and Africa and interviewees 13–15 from Latin America and the Caribbean.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Participant observation:&lt;/strong&gt; The research team participated in cross-regional events held in London, New York, Accra, Santiago, Singapore and Kyoto. Participant observation included workshops in each of these locations, RUSI’s inaugural Securing Cyberspace Conference, and attendance at multilateral negotiations within the UN OEWG process and region-specific meetings. Data collection involved field notes documenting interactions and conversations at these events. Combining international and regional dialogues allowed the research team to engage with a broader range of stakeholders and identify emerging areas of RCB beyond the UN framework.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workshops:&lt;/strong&gt; Research involved organising seven workshops, primarily for data collection. Two workshops addressed cross-regional topics, while five focused on gathering national perspectives on RCB within specific regions. Each workshop hosted 30–40 government representatives, along with 3–5 non-governmental participants on average. Given that states do not always publicise their positions or interpretations of cyber norms implementation, the workshops were designed to focus on specific cases and practices (for example, incident response, regional norms guidance, principles for responsible cyber operations and ransomware) to facilitate information sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-defining-responsible-behaviour-beyond-the-un-framework&quot;&gt;I. Defining Responsible Behaviour Beyond the UN Framework&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As “responsibility” is a multifaceted term that conveys notions of morality, values, ethics and legal obligations, cybersecurity debates have incorporated both the ambiguity and challenges that accompany it. Some researchers have opted for alternative concepts, such as “accountability”, shying away from responsibility for a number of reasons. First, “responsibility” evokes strict notions of legal obligations – complying with regulations or international law, for example. Second, both binding and non-binding obligations are often framed as a negative responsibility, that is, focusing on ensuring that actors are held responsible for inaction/non-observance or violation of international commitments, rather than addressing the structure of incentives for them to engage in positive observance in the first place. The over-emphasis on a negative view of responsibility, combined with the absence of an international, legally binding instrument specifically dedicated to cybersecurity, often leads to a third challenge: the view that responsibility is values-driven and thus deemed less objective in calling out or defining “bad” or “irresponsible” behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, responsibility is shaped by other factors beyond the UN framework and a state’s culture – that is, the ideas (shared beliefs and assumptions), norms, historical experiences and behaviours that inform a state’s approach to strategy, security, military affairs and cybersecurity. This paper seeks to better understand how cultural values shape and signify RCB – even if they are not aligned with or are broader than the UN framework. And while the UN framework has narrowed the scope of what analysts look for when seeking to understand views of responsibility, nonetheless it cannot and should not be neglected. This is why this paper assesses state practice in implementing the UN framework while simultaneously incorporating the views of responsibility articulated in other multilateral, regional and theme-specific forums. In so doing, this paper provides state and non-state actors with a clearer analytical lens through which to view the UN framework in a broader landscape of RCB, providing a practical means by which to identify interests, possibilities for convergence/divergence, and strategies for engaging in bilateral and multilateral cooperation – UN or otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-concept-of-responsible-cyber-behaviour&quot;&gt;The Concept of Responsible Cyber Behaviour&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the narrow nature of the concept of responsible state behaviour as it relates to the UN framework, this paper proposes an auxiliary concept to support present and future research on state practice and strategic preferences: responsible cyber behaviour. Countries such as the US, Australia and Canada have referred to “responsible state behaviour” as part of their cyber strategies. Other countries, such as the UK and Greece, have used the term “responsible cyber behaviour” in some of their national documents; the latter term does not restrict responsibility to state actors only. As research by RUSI and the Australian Strategic Policy Institute has shown, policy terminology varies across regions, but nevertheless the concept of RCB can enable a better understanding and tracing of state practice and strategic culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word “responsible”, in this case, invites a reflection on the responsibilities of a range of actors (state and non-state) within the global cybersecurity governance regimes, as well as on the positive (incentives) and negative (obligations and expectations from the international community) responsibilities that they bear. The word “cyber” indicates the realm of that responsibility – that is, in or through cyberspace. Finally, “behaviour” deliberately focuses on practices and conduct that are seen as responsible/irresponsible, acceptable/unacceptable or lawful/unlawful in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A summary of this paper’s working definition of RCB is therefore:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;RCB refers to the collective expectations of how actors should or should not behave in cyberspace. It is composed of the values, norms, policies, practices and technologies that inform/are articulated by stakeholders, including with the purpose of protecting and securing cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not assumed here that countries have explicitly used the term “responsible cyber behaviour”, nor that they necessarily need to have done so for their cyber behaviour to be considered “responsible”. In this regard, this paper represents a multi-sited approach to international responsibility: that is, it investigates how other multilateral and thematic forums (as well as middle-ground and non-Western governments) have framed the idea of “responsibility” in this context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;responsible-cyber-behaviour-beyond-the-un&quot;&gt;Responsible Cyber Behaviour Beyond the UN&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the start of 2022, the RCB project has mapped 12 case studies of how RCB is regionally and nationally defined and/or influenced by a country’s culture. These examples, in conjunction with the present research data, have highlighted that there are numerous themes associated with states practising responsibility that transcend the UN framework. This is the case, for example, with the association between RCB and government control over media content or free speech (due to government concerns about political and social instability), or RCB and the existence of tools and legal frameworks to effectively combat cybercrime (regardless of whether it remains unclear how intrusive cyber-intrusive tools might be and what their “legitimate use” means in practice).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside the UN framework and the realm of the First Committee on disarmament and international security, there is a vast patchwork of views on what defines RCB. As noted by one of the interviewees, “We try to follow the UN cyber norms and framework, but like any other international issues [sic], it’s quite complicated. We cannot outright say that [we agree with the consensus document and that is] what we want. We can only say that there are no objections”. Another interviewee said, “We are adamant that responsible state conduct starts with the eleven norms, but also recognise that the norms and framework don’t cover everything that everyone might consider as responsible behaviour. These are negotiated outcomes – and there are norms that we feel more strongly about than others”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all the states’ representatives interviewed and for most of those present in the workshops, RCB is primarily about having policies (for example, national cybersecurity strategies, cybercrime legislation and data protection legislation) and institutions (for example, national computer emergency response teams (CERTs) and cybersecurity agencies or centres) to enable the country to respond to and/or prevent incidents in accordance with their international commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter presents three snapshots of interpretations concerning RCB beyond the UN: RCB as an economic driver; RCB as an evolving set of practices to determine unacceptable behaviour; and RCB as a multi-sited diplomatic strategy to advance national interest. In so doing, it reflects on states’ responsibilities to develop their own capacities, in the context of different perceptions about economic development as it relates to cybersecurity; looks at how states have sought to identify malicious cyber activity without necessarily having to name and shame state-based/-affiliated/-sponsored cyber actors; and examines how the UN First Committee, rather than being an initiator, is only one of many sites through which a proposal for a legally binding instrument has been advocated for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;rcb-as-an-economic-driver-the-responsibility-to-develop-capacities&quot;&gt;RCB as an Economic Driver: The Responsibility to Develop Capacities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrary to the predominantly negative view of responsibility being focused on calling out bad behaviour and deploying other “sticks” to deter malicious cyber activity, most developing countries favour a positive view of responsibility: one that is centred around the development of economic capacities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question of developing economic capacities has only been tangentially covered in discussions in the GGE and OEWG, and through CCB. In 2021, states agreed, within the context of the UN OEWG, on principles that should guide CCB. These principles are: process and purpose, partnerships, and people. However, as one of the interviewees noted, for a minister or a decision-maker in a state capital, RCB is as much about the “ability to have and establish the proper mechanisms to act responsibly” and assess how to effectively spend money as it is about the UN framework, adding, “responsible state behaviour [as postulated by the UN framework] should not be seen in a vacuum [given that] CCB is a fabric for [a state’s] development”. As this suggests, not only does the relationship between RCB and CCB extend well beyond the remit of the UN First Committee within the UN, it also takes different shapes and forms in other multilateral groupings, raising the questions: what are states’ responsibilities to develop capacities to tackle cyber threats and how do they perceive them? The following points describe some of the ways in which RCB relates to CCB and cyber capacity development within and beyond the UN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capacity building enabling observance of international commitments:&lt;/strong&gt; First, states have committed to implementing the UN framework. In this context, “capacity building” refers to the enablers and constraints for state observance of their collective commitments to the framework. Examples include initiatives that seek to enable states to develop their national position on how international law applies to cyberspace. Global Affairs Canada (GAC), for example, supported the AU with capacity building sessions to enable the development of a common African position, which led to the AU being the first regional body to publish a joint position of this kind.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Moreover, according to international law, states need to have the capacity to observe, respect and enact – whenever appropriate – their international commitments. CCB is not only an enabling element of the implementation of the framework but also an integral part of the state’s capacity to observe international law. Due diligence refers to a state’s obligation to not knowingly allow its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other states. It constitutes an obligation of conduct where states commit to pursuing their best possible efforts to prevent, respond to or terminate malicious cyber activities. However, if a state is unable to determine who is responsible for a malicious cyber activity because, for example, it does not have the capacity to identify, mitigate or discern from where such activity emanates (jurisdictionally speaking), then it cannot attribute and affix responsibility to another state, making it inviable for them to undertake countermeasures – thus illustrating the critical relevance of CCB in mitigating existing observance shortfalls and in elevating attribution.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capacity building as state building:&lt;/strong&gt; Interviews and workshop discussions showed that even though states might observe the UN framework, this does not guide the domestic RCB discussion. Rather, it is primarily led by development-related concerns such as CCB, economic prosperity and/or resilience, regardless of whether they are directly linked to the framework or not.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Policymakers and ministers at the national level are much less concerned with the international law and norms dimensions of CCB. Capacity building is, first and foremost, an economic and development agenda directed at helping states respond to and/or prepare for a more digitally connected society. As one of the interviewees highlighted: “In the end, our cybersecurity agency’s focus is not cybersecurity but prosperity. To have that, you need to take risks – and we want to make sure we can manage those risks. Security is not the only thing that our nation needs, but the growth of [the] economy and safe and secure cyberspace are the main things”. It becomes clear that the economic prosperity narrative guides cybersecurity investment and not necessarily national security.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, most states that engaged in this research associated RCB with developing core state functions for a more digitally-connected government – that is, with how capacity building enables the state to respond more effectively and proactively, and with the adequate legal and institutional resources. Unless a project explicitly relates to the OEWG (as is the case with the above-mentioned AU–GAC partnership, or with the Women in International Security and Cyberspace Fellowship), the connection with international commitments is often made ex-post in an attempt by the ministry of foreign affairs to translate existing initiatives into the OEWG agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As highlighted in the different workshops and interviews, the development of a national cybersecurity strategy, a national CERT and/or a cybersecurity agency can provide more transparency and predictability about a government’s action and mandate to act in cybersecurity-related areas. Such predictability is essential for creating an environment of stable development within which donor organisations such as international development banks know what they can expect in terms of implementation and returns.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;However, workshop participants from some states also noted that while organisational, institutional and policy measures that demonstrate RCB are important economic enablers, in the final analysis, one of the biggest challenges for them is ensuring they have sufficient budgetary resources to adequately purchase and renew licences for specific incident response and vulnerability management tools (as well the skills to effectively implement them).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regional bodies as catalysts for RCB:&lt;/strong&gt; In recent years, regional organisations have started to play a key role in the implementation of the UN framework and beyond. Participants in the workshops highlighted how such organisations can: help track the implementation of international agreements; support the development of common positions on the applicability of international law in cyberspace; and develop further confidence building measures to enhance regional collaboration, and play a role as hubs for CCB.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Both the AU and the EU have now published their respective common regional positions on how international law applies to cyberspace, boosting expectations that regional bodies can help strengthen RCB. During one of the workshops, participants discussed this matter and highlighted that:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Not all regional organisations should be expected to support the development of a common position. On the one hand, organisations such as the OSCE might not be well placed to advance a common position (due to geopolitical tensions regarding Russia’s membership), but will continue to work on CBMs and other forms of capacity building. On the other hand, the Organization of American States (OAS), under the auspices of the Inter-American Judicial Committee, facilitated a multi-year project from 2018 to 2022 which included a survey to identify areas of convergence and divergence on how international law applies to cyberspace. Even though the OAS produced five reports on the topic this has not produced a common position, due to varying degrees of political appetite and maturity to engage in the discussion. The level of political appetite is also influenced by a degree of historical and institutional unease among Latin American countries with the OAS as a regional organisation. This is partly because rather than focusing on specific subregions such as Latin America, South America or even Latin America and the Caribbean, it includes the US and Canada under the broader umbrella of “the Americas”. However, such dynamics have not stopped countries in the region from progressively publishing their views, as in the cases of Brazil (2021), Costa Rica (2023), Cuba (2024) and Colombia (2025).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regional approaches to RCB&lt;/strong&gt;, such as the common positions on international law, do not supplant individual national action, and can occasionally provide a stepping stone for states to develop the capacity and confidence to establish their own national positions. Diplomats in the workshops noted that common positions provide them with a reference document that they can use to articulate the importance of their national position within their respective government departments/ministries. The risk, however, is that governments with less capacity might settle for the common position and, in so doing, not progress with developing their own understanding – and consequently fall short of a progressive development and codification of international law.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;rcb-as-identifying-unacceptable-behaviour-beyond-public-cyber-attribution&quot;&gt;RCB as Identifying Unacceptable Behaviour Beyond Public Cyber Attribution&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the discussion on unacceptable behaviour in cyberspace has revolved around a negative view of responsibility: that is, the ability of states to call out bad behaviour whenever necessary. The UK, the US, Canada, Japan, the EU and others have increasingly used sanctions, indictments (in the US), joint attributions and démarches to put pressure on state-sponsored groups from China, Iran, Russia and North Korea. The challenge, however, is that most countries do not publicly and politically attribute cyberattacks to other states, begging the question of how states can draw the lines of unacceptability if they are not inclined to politically and publicly attribute responsibility for perceived misdemeanours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research for this paper has identified at least three ways that states can signal (and have signalled) unacceptable behaviour, beyond public attribution:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Technical attribution and/or indirect endorsements/references to other technical reports.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Via other non-UN forums that seek to facilitate state convergence around a new norm targeting a specific unacceptable behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Through thematic initiatives that seek to better understand the problem and the non-state actors’ stake in it so as to devise norms for the group.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/yBaBknr.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: State Practices in Signalling Unacceptable Behaviour Without Publicly Attributing Responsibility.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: The author.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the states that participated in the RUSI/GP-RCB workshops, as well as other government representatives who were interviewed as part of this project, noted that a lack of public political attribution should not be equated with a posture of complacency or absence of political will with regard to calling out unacceptable behaviour. Some interviewees stressed that they are more concerned with rejecting a certain type of behaviour than with discrediting the actor behind it – especially in the case of a state-sponsored or state-affiliated cyber incident where they are unwilling to take the risk of facing a political or economic backlash. While such a strategy arguably seeks to manage the risk of interstate cyber escalation, the actions it produces are insufficient to deter state-linked actors from conducting malicious cyber activity; this is a trade-off of which most states are conscious. Moreover, these actors might also be less inclined to attribute as a consequence of their cultural background, strategic preferences and/or regional dynamics. As one interviewee put it, “I think it is easier for the EU and NATO to take sudden actions against Russia. But for countries in Southeast Asia, it might be harder, or perhaps not so convenient to take certain actions [such as public attribution]. What you fundamentally do is you preserve your space. … Culture is important, and it shapes our way of communicating our grievances. We might not do it publicly, but in the background, there is considerable action”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In cases such as this, where there is no political will to name and shame state actors, the national cybersecurity agency or CERT often plays a significant (yet tricky) role in navigating between technical and political attribution. For example, Switzerland – the foreign policy of which has been characterised by a posture of neutrality – has not sought to publicly attribute. However, in 2024 the Swiss National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) mentioned for the first time that a “presumed pro-Russian” group called “NoName” had claimed responsibility for launching a distributed denial of service attack against multiple websites of the Swiss Federal Administration in protest at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s attendance at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos. The word “presumed” here is important, as it is an attempt to cautiously restate the self-affiliation of the NoName group to Russia while not explicitly ascribing responsibility to Russia. The Swiss NCSC’s role on this occasion illustrates the fine line between technically and politically attributing an incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other countries might not even come so close to making a technical attribution but would rather use subtler strategies to indicate concern. For example, following the 2022 Russian attack to disrupt satellite communications provider Viasat’s services to Ukraine just a few hours before the full-scale invasion took place, Singapore referenced the cyberattack in a series of public statements from ministers at the end of 2022, and in 2023 the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore included a reference to the operation in its 2022 annual report, explicitly referencing the attribution to Russia made by the US, the UK, Australia and others. Interviewees and workshop participants noted that their governments have used consistent referencing as a tool for articulating unacceptable behaviour, while controlling for risks. Such a practice, which refrains from politically joining a broader coalition to attribute but refers to the attribution, favours signalling over punishing or shaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The factors that can prompt states to shift their posture towards making public attribution vary, and many of them have remained focused on the behaviour rather than the perpetrator (if state-sponsored or -affiliated), even after large-scale incidents. After 27 government bodies in Costa Rica were targeted by Russia-affiliated ransomware group Conti in 2022, the government was the first to declare a “national state of emergency” due to a cyberattack but did not go so far as to publicly associate the group with Russia. This example, as also highlighted during our GP-RCB regional workshop, shows that rather than seeing attribution as the ultimate tool to signal unacceptable behaviour, a country’s response to an incident can accelerate its maturity in defining red lines. In Costa Rica’s case, this was manifested through practices such as the government publishing its view on how international law applies to cyberspace, approving its national cybersecurity strategy (2023–27), strengthening the national CERT’s role as national cyber security coordinator, and receiving financial and capacity building assistance from the US to enhance recovery and response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estonia provides a contrasting example. The country had been a target for Russian state-sponsored cyber operations for nearly two decades, and yet in that time had decided not to publicly and politically attribute any cyberattacks. This approach changed in 2024, with the country naming, for the first time, Russia’s military intelligence service (the GRU) as responsible for a 2020 cyberattack targeting Estonian ministries. While scale might not have been as decisive a factor as it was for Costa Rica, the Estonian attribution was the outcome of a years-long build-up of their appetite for engaging in such practice. While no single trigger for the change in posture has been confirmed privately (as part of this research), or publicly, a number of factors can be seen to have created the enabling context for the change in posture: the fact that since Russia’s 22-day cyber campaign against Estonia in 2007 the EU had developed a cyber diplomacy toolbox encouraging the practice; more countries having signed up to joint cyber attributions; and the context of Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine and and targeting neighbouring countries with cyberattacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regional organisations or groups of like-minded countries can progressively enable an environment of trust wherein states that are disinclined to attribute individually can align themselves with existing public attributions without overcommitting. This is the case with the EU’s Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox (CDT). The CDT was established in 2017, and two years later was adopted by the Council of the EU as part of the EU’s Common Foreign and Security Policy, enabling sanctions to be imposed in line with the CDT’s provisions. In 2020, the Council imposed sanctions against cyberattacks for the first time. While it cannot be categorically stated that the CDT directly influenced Estonia’s shift in posture, these developments do illustrate that the existence of shared frameworks embedded in regional bodies can foster an environment of trust wherein member states can build upon and develop their national approach to cyber attribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are still multiple reasons why a country might not seek to publicly attribute a cyberattack, including: avoiding exposure to potential retaliation from the state to which the malicious cyber activity is attributed; lacking the capacity to respond to and/or identify the origin of the malicious cyber activity; and/or expecting more information to be shared by countries that are trying to recruit support for specific public attributions. The tendency to use public attribution often shifts only after large-scale incidents: as seen in Albania after the Iranian group HomeLand Justice targeted Albanian government public services and government websites, or in the UK after the 2017 WannaCry ransomware attack attributed to North Korea’s Lazarus Group. Whether such trend is consistent across regions and cases remains uncertain. As shown in cases such as in Costa Rica, for example, the inclination to publicly attribute after a cyber-enabled national or diplomatic crisis is not a universal pattern. Additionally, countries embroiled in ongoing border disputes or facing persistent threat-actor clusters, such as India and Pakistan, have shown little inclination to publicly attribute cyber incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to technical attribution or government reference to private companies’ threat intelligence reports or alerts, some states also signal unacceptable behaviour by leveraging like-minded forums to build consensus on other potential norms for RCB. This is the case with the G20 and G7 advocating for a norm against cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property (IP). This norm has not been explicitly recognised by UN processes, although it would fall broadly under the norm on not knowingly allowing a territory to be used for internationally wrongful acts. The G20 and G7 discussions about the norm emerged after the Obama–Xi agreement in 2015 – following comments from General Keith Alexander, former head of the US Cyber Command, describing China’s IP theft as “the biggest transfer of wealth in history”. The initial 2015 momentum also meant that the norm managed to gain traction in other groupings: the G20 leaders’ communique recognised state-sponsored economic cyber espionage as a risk to long-term economic growth in 2015, and a year later G7 member states also stressed their commitment “that no country should conduct or knowingly support ICT [information and communications technology]-enabled theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets or other confidential business information, with the intent of providing competitive advantages to its companies or commercial sectors”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, not all commitments persist over time. Current US–China relations and broader geopolitical context could not be more different from those in 2015, amid increasing international tensions involving Russia and between the US and China (especially after the discovery that the Chinese Ministry of State Security and the People’s Liberation Army were conducting cyber espionage and pre-positioning of malicious software in US critical infrastructure). While the G7 has continued and expanded its efforts in the cybersecurity domain, the G20 has become an ever-more contentious forum given the lack of a common position condemning Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and in the context of the trade war between the US and China – all of which has rocked the prospects for further norms diffusion and implementation across G20 member states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;States also engage in defining unacceptable behaviour by promoting or participating in exploratory discussions and groupings that seek to enable norms emergence. That is the case, for example, with the Pall Mall Process (PMP), an initiative set up by the UK and France in 2024 to discuss the proliferation and irresponsible use of commercial cyber intrusion capabilities, and with similar US-led efforts to control proliferation of commercial spyware via the Summit for Democracy, and the resulting joint statements. The topic of commercial cyber intrusion had not been referenced in UN GGE or OEWG resolutions prior to the PMP or the joint statements. Probably the closest reference to it was the norm that notes that: “States should [seek to] prevent the proliferation of malicious ICT tools, techniques or harmful hidden functions”. Despite the Summit for Democracy focusing exclusively on the most intrusive type of commercial cyber intrusion capability and the PMP focusing on getting less like-minded countries and companies on board to discuss irresponsible use of other tools (while recognising that there are legitimate uses), both initiatives arguably spurred momentum for the topic to be recognised for the first time in the UN OEWG 2021–25 interim annual progress report, in mid-2024. While the report did not add a new norm on the topic, it did recognise the threat that commercial cyber intrusion poses to ensuring state responsibility in cyberspace:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;States noted the growing market for commercially-available ICT intrusion capabilities as well as hardware and software vulnerabilities, including on the dark web. States expressed concern that their ready availability to State and non-State actors was increasing the opportunity for their illegitimate and malicious use and making it potentially more difficult to mitigate and defend against the threats they pose, while emphasizing that such capabilities could be used in a manner consistent with international law. States further expressed concern that the dissemination of ICT intrusion capabilities by State and non -State actors could contribute to unintentional escalation and threaten international peace and security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cases above highlight a few examples of the practice of RCB beyond the UN, demonstrating: how consensus and signalling concerning irresponsible cyber behaviour need not start at the UN; that successful dissemination of a norm of unacceptability may or may not result in it being incorporated in UN resolutions; that the fact that a norm has not been accepted by UN processes does not mean that other countries might not take it up as a national commitment; that domestic motivations and demonstrations of condemned behaviours vary, yet still signal unacceptability (albeit through different means and practices); and that there is much more to learn about countries’ views of RCB – and consequently the demarcation of irresponsible behaviour – from incident responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;rcb-as-a-diplomatic-strategy-the-quest-for-a-legally-binding-instrument-for-cybersecurity&quot;&gt;RCB as a Diplomatic Strategy: The Quest for a Legally Binding Instrument for Cybersecurity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether a treaty or convention on cybersecurity is required has been the subject of a long-time contentious debate at the UN – and not without reason. With the exception of the AU’s Malabo Convention, the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime and the UN Cybercrime Convention, there is no “special” law for international security in cyberspace. And, as highlighted by different states, the absence of such lex specialis for cyberspace means that general rules of state responsibility and customary international law apply in the cyber context. While states remain divided into three camps regarding the development of special law – “no need”, “maybe later”, “urgently needed” – in UN OEWG and GGE negotiations Russia has sought to advocate for a treaty (special law) through other multilateral organisations and in bilateral dialogues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2013, the BRICS (Brazil, China, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, India, Russia, South Africa and the UAE) summit declarations have included mentions of espionage, cybercrime and international cybersecurity. The specific topics might have changed slightly over the years, but some notable examples include, in 2014, committing to “the negotiation of a universally legally binding instrument” for combating the criminal use of ICT. Subsequent years have seen the recognition and emphasis of “the importance of an open, secure, peaceful, stable, accessible and non-discriminatory environment for information and communications technologies”, in addition to “the importance of universally agreed norms, rules and principles, under the auspices of the UN, for the responsible behavior of States in the realm of ICTs, and uphold the centrality of the United Nations in their development”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some might question how closely summit declarations reflect states’ views, it remains the case that such declarations do illustrate how these states publicly, deliberately and politically endorse a particular narrative about RCB. These kinds of statement have also been accompanied by the establishment of cybersecurity-specific mechanisms under the auspices of the BRICS. This includes the Working Group on Security in the Use of Information and Communication Technologies and the BRICS Roadmap of Practical Cooperation on Ensuring Security in the Use of ICTs. These and other mechanisms provide a specific space for socialisation of norms and understandings of what RCB means within the BRICS, albeit with limited public visibility of the frequency of meetings, activities and outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite such limitations, two key references to RCB have emerged publicly from the BRICS Summit declarations. The 2023 Johannesburg II Summit Declaration reintroduced a reference to the leading role of the UN in “developing a universal legal framework” on international ICT security after a six-year gap between it and the first time it had been mentioned in a BRICS Summit Declaration. The reference re-emerged at the same time as the UN Ad Hoc Committee on cybercrime was conducting its own negotiations for a global cybercrime treaty and was published less than two months after Russia, Belarus, North Korea, Nicaragua, Syria and Venezuela had submitted a concept document to the OEWG proposing a Convention on Information Security. While Russia was not the main sponsor for the latter – despite having historically been the country tabling the proposal for a convention on the topic – the reference shows that in settings such as the BRICS, there are specific leads pushing for RCB-related proposals such as a legally binding treaty on cybersecurity. Moreover, when this development is considered in the broader context of concomitant negotiation processes, it becomes evident how Russia advocates for similar agenda items across UN and non-UN forums. That is the case, for example, in Russia–Africa summits, where Russia has not only pushed for representatives from African states to “work towards legally binding norms” on the security of ICT but has also referred to it during OEWG negotiations in order to pressure African states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The announcement of the expansion of the BRICS in August 2023 raised numerous questions as to what BRICS+ negotiations would deliver on cyber-related issues – if anything – given the increasing disparities of views among members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) has also been addressing cybersecurity issues. According to the 2023 SCO Deputy Secretary General, cybersecurity has been part of the SCO’s dialogues since 2006, when the group’s foreign trade ministers established the Ad Hoc Working Group on ICTs. In 2009, SCO member states signed an Agreement on Cooperation in Ensuring International Information Security, which provides a list of common threats, terms and concepts, and lists areas for future cooperation in cybersecurity and cybercrime. Notably, the document also includes a list of general principles, agreeing that “[cooperation and the activities in the international information space should meet] the conventional principles and rules of international law, including the principles of peaceful settlement of disputes and conflicts, non-uses of force, non-interference to internal affairs, respect of the rights and fundamental freedoms of the person, and also to the principles of regional cooperation and non-interference to national information resource.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the 2022 Joint Communiqué following the 21st Meeting of the SCO Council of Heads of Government (prime ministers) shows, initiatives in this field have continued. The document refers to the Concept of Cooperation of the SCO Member States in the Field of Digitalisation and Information Communication Technology (Bishkek, 14 June 2019 – not publicly available). Also in 2022 the SCO released a statement on the diversification of supply chains, noting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We emphasise the devastating impact of unilateral economic measures, which run counter to the general principles and rules of the WTO, and of measures regarding the financial systems of the SCO member states on the security and stability of supply chains, as well as on the multilateral trading system and all its participants. We reaffirm our desire to ensure the resilience, reliability and stability of international supply chains, and maintain the openness and transparency of cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While not cyber-exclusive, the discussion does relate to views on the responsible use and development of technologies. On a similar topic, since 2022 the Samarkand Declaration and the New Delhi Declarations have iteratively stressed SCO states’ categorical opposition to the militarisation of ICT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SCO member states have also reinforced their support for the “development of universal rules, principles and norms of responsible behaviour of states in this area, and in particular, welcome the development under the auspices of the UN of a comprehensive international convention against the use of ICT for criminal purposes”, while also reiterating the central role of the UN in countering threats in the information space by “creating a safe, fair and open information space, with respect of principles of state sovereignty and non-interference”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;risks-to-enactment-of-international-responsibility&quot;&gt;Risks to Enactment of International Responsibility&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notions of responsibility or responsible behaviour are not always explicitly referred to within a UN First Committee but, as this section shows, they are nonetheless portrayed, encoded and exported in documents produced across multiple sites and by many types of actors. It is vital that scholars and policymakers track and reflect on how UN debates unfold not only in New York but also in other multilateral and multistakeholder discussions. This is because states might seek to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Advance and consolidate norms in smaller groupings on specific topics and then resocialise them in key processes such as the UN OEWG and its future regular mechanism for institutional dialogue. Ongoing ad hoc initiatives such as the PMP serve as an example of spaces where states, private sector actors and civil society collaborate to shape emerging norms before bringing them to multilateral forums such as the UN.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ensure complementarity of the different mandates of these organisations and processes whenever possible. This is the case, for example, with cross-referencing or enabling participation of International Telecommunications Union (ITU) representatives in OEWG dialogues with the purpose of understanding broader CCB initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Identify areas of contention around or divergence from evolving international views on RCB. Despite the GGE and OEWG resolutions, as well as the restated commitment to the UN framework, other multilateral groupings or initiatives might share different values or concerns. This directly influences whether they will concentrate in areas such as development rather than deterrence, or on the development of a legally binding instrument rather than customary international law.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, throughout the interviews, workshops and participant observation in multilateral negotiations, the following challenges to the effective operationalisation of states’ international commitments to RCB – whether the UN framework or others – have been identified and need to be further investigated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenges in tracing norm implementation and political will:&lt;/strong&gt; Despite widespread agreement among member states on voluntary commitments, implementing and monitoring adherence to international norms remains problematic. Efforts such as checklists created by Mexico, Australia and ASEAN have aimed to provide frameworks for assessing cyber norms, yet awareness and practical application are often lacking. This gap underscores the difficulty of translating commitments into measurable actions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risks of a predominantly negative accountability framework:&lt;/strong&gt; A negative approach to responsibility often concentrates on the consequences and reparations arising from wrongful or irresponsible actions. This state-centric, punitive view has notable shortcomings:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It marginalises non-state actors, despite their significant role in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It overlooks non-malicious actions that inadvertently cause harm.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It fails to account for variations in understanding and enacting responsibility, even within the context of international agreements.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Over-reliance on public attribution by a select few:&lt;/strong&gt; Public attribution and practices such as “naming and shaming” remain key tools for signalling unacceptable cyber behaviour. These actions highlight prohibited targets, methods and effects, serving as a deterrent for some states. However, this approach is not universally embraced – most states refrain from public attribution, which in turn hinders the development of more comprehensive and strategic responses beyond a limited coalition of like-minded states.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disparities in national capacities and their impact:&lt;/strong&gt; The absence of clarity regarding whether states are unwilling or unable to effectively respond to malicious cyber incidents (or adhere to international commitments) complicates the assessment process. This uncertainty can lead to an over-reliance on assumptions, further impeding efforts to accurately evaluate state capabilities and willingness to address emerging cyber threats and norms implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-widening-the-lens-on-responsible-cyber-behaviour&quot;&gt;Conclusion: Widening the Lens on Responsible Cyber Behaviour&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has demonstrated that RCB extends beyond the parameters established by the UN. While the UN framework continues to play a critical role in shaping international discussions on cyber responsibility, it is only one part of a broader evolving landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following key insights emerged from this study:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RCB as a multidimensional concept:&lt;/strong&gt; Responsibility in cyberspace is not confined to legal obligations or diplomatic commitments within UN-led processes. Many states perceive responsibility through the lens of economic development, national resilience and CCB. The UN framework provides a foundation, but state practice indicates that cybersecurity is often framed in terms of economic security and domestic stability rather than purely in terms of international law.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The role of alternative norm-setting bodies:&lt;/strong&gt; Multilateral organisations such as the G7, the BRICS and ASEAN and regional cybersecurity frameworks play a crucial role in defining and reinforcing cyber norms. These organisations provide alternative venues for states to engage in cyber diplomacy, shape expectations around responsible behaviour and develop cooperative mechanisms outside the UN framework. The diversification of norm-setting spaces reflects both geopolitical realities (in other words renewed minilateralism) and the need for more flexible, context-specific approaches to cyber governance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operational responsibility and emerging norms:&lt;/strong&gt; Beyond the high-level diplomatic discourse, states demonstrate RCB through national policies, incident response practices and engagement with technical communities. While some states prioritise deterrence and attribution, others focus on discreet diplomatic and technical responses to cyber threats. The emergence of new policy discussions – such as pre-positioning cyber capabilities, commercial cyber intrusion and the role of private sector actors – illustrates the evolving nature of challenges facing RCB.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications-for-policymakers-and-researchers&quot;&gt;Implications for Policymakers and Researchers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As geopolitical dynamics continue to shift, tracking and analysing RCB beyond the UN will remain an essential task for ensuring diplomats and policymakers are equipped to negotiate diverging views on RCB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding RCB beyond the UN framework is crucial for both policymakers and scholars. Western governments must recognise the limitations and perceived biases of a UN-centric approach to cybersecurity, which may not fully capture the concerns of developing nations. For non-Western states, especially those in the Global South, acknowledging their own cyber practices and aligning them with broader international commitments can enhance their strategic positioning in global cyber governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, further research is needed in the following areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-Western perspectives on cyber responsibility:&lt;/strong&gt; More studies should explore how different cultural, economic and political contexts shape state approaches to RCB. This includes investigating how regional and national security policies integrate cyber responsibility in ways that differ from dominant Western perspectives in key areas including attribution, institutional setup and incident response. Examining how Global South nations define and implement cyber norms within their own strategic priorities will be key to fostering a more inclusive and representative cyber governance framework. However, there are thornier policy challenges ahead that merit further research: as countries such as China, Russia and others become more comfortable in conducting public cyber attribution against the US, for example, Western governments will need to reflect on how publicly naming and shaming – usually used as a negative accountability measure – can be instrumentalised against them. The emergence of non-Western attribution will put renewed pressure on the expected level of information shared in those attributions and the kinds of behaviours that are deemed unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The role of private sector actors:&lt;/strong&gt; Given their influence on cyber norms, the responsibilities of private companies to ensure international cybersecurity should be further examined. Many global technology firms play a dual role as both enablers and enforcers of cybersecurity measures. Their involvement in CCB, threat intelligence sharing and incident response demands greater scrutiny. Future research should focus on how private entities can be held accountable for their role in cybersecurity governance, shape the political economy of cybersecurity, and contribute to fostering RCB at an international level.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operational cyber responsibility:&lt;/strong&gt; A deeper assessment of how states justify and conduct cyber operations, including legal and ethical considerations, will be crucial for shaping how RCB is applicable to the design, conduct, approval and assessment of cyber operations, for example. This includes an exploration of how states define acceptable thresholds for cyber defence and retaliation, the legal frameworks governing cyber operations, and the impact of emerging cyber capabilities on national security. Additionally, research should examine how cyber operations intersect with human rights obligations and the role of oversight mechanisms in ensuring compliance with international law. Moreover, emerging practices such as pre-positioning – increasingly seen on the part of state-affiliated groups linked to China – pose a challenge to RCB, as they explore the fine line between tacitly acceptable practices (espionage) and cyber operations. It remains uncertain whether a norm will develop in this sphere or whether there will be a growing consensus rejecting the practice of pre-positioning. However, developments in this area will continue to present relevant tests to defining operational responsibility as it relates to states’ international commitments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incident response and cyber norms as RCB in practice:&lt;/strong&gt; While much of the existing research focuses on diplomatic and legal frameworks, there is a growing need to investigate how states respond to real world cyber incidents. Understanding how national CERTs, intelligence agencies and law enforcement bodies interact in the wake of cyberattacks will provide valuable insights into how cyber norms are operationalised. Future research should assess how best practices in cyber incident response contribute to broader international expectations of responsible behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The evolution of cyber norms in multilateral forums:&lt;/strong&gt; Beyond the UN, various international and regional organisations continue to shape discussions on RCB. Further research should examine how alternative forums – such as the OECD, ITU and regional cybersecurity initiatives – influence cyber governance. Investigating how these organisations establish new norms, enforce existing agreements and facilitate capacity building efforts will be essential for understanding the future trajectory of global cybersecurity cooperation in RCB, even if they do not employ the same terminology.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia’s drone campaign utilizes inexpensive Shahed drones to saturate Ukrainian air defenses and erode civilian morale through persistent nightly attacks. Originally Iranian made, these drones are now mass produced in Russia using Western electronics and essential Chinese components.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ukraine urgently requires layered, cost-effective air defenses, including high-energy laser systems, to counter drone saturation. Targeted long-range strikes on drone production and launch sites and disrupting China’s supply of critical electronics to Russia are essential steps.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia’s relentless use of low-cost drones signals a broader shift toward attrition warfare based on overwhelming air defense systems with sheer numbers. Western governments must innovate in economical defenses and tackle Chinese technology flows fueling Russian drone production.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia is using a punishment strategy to force Kyiv into negotiations designed to end the war and hamper Ukrainian sovereignty for the next generation. This approach increasingly relies on a single weapon: the Shahed drone. Originally imported from Iran but now mass produced in Russia using a mix of smuggled Western electronics and important Chinese parts, these low-cost attack drones cause millions of Ukrainians to wake up to the sound of air raid sirens every night. This terror campaign has lasted longer than the infamous Blitz aerial bombing of London during World War II and shows no signs of letting up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intensive use of these low-cost drones highlights the need to help Ukraine discover additional low-cost countermeasures that limit the ability of Russia’s punishment campaign. Specifically, European states and U.S. firms should work together to test new approaches to air defense that build on Ukrainian wartime innovations (e.g., acoustic sensors, an integrated air defense network, and improvised surface-to-air missiles) and emerging approaches that use electronic warfare and even high-energy lasers. Second, the U.S. military should catalogue these efforts and use them to accelerate its own thinking about layered air defense in future conflicts, which will almost certainly see a mix of cruise missiles and ballistic missiles attacking alongside waves of one-way attack drones. In these fights, point airfield defense and mobile counter–unmanned aircraft systems will not be enough to counter drone saturation designed to break air defense systems and open attack lanes for more exquisite weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brief proceeds by analyzing Shahed attack trends during the Ukraine war. Understanding these trends highlights three policy options for both helping defend Ukraine and reducing the ability of Russia’s punishment strategy with low-cost drone attacks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Testing and fielding new high-energy lasers to add an additional layer to Ukraine’s air defense network.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Increasing long-range strikes against Shaheed production, supply, and launch points.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Countering the flow of Chinese electronic components to Russian weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;drone-saturation-cost-effective-attrition-warfare&quot;&gt;Drone Saturation: Cost-Effective Attrition Warfare&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s dependence on Shaheds is based on attrition logic: Each drone costs approximately $20,000–$50,000, whereas even a single modern surface-to-air missile (SAM) battery or interceptor missile can cost several hundred thousand dollars. Russia has tolerated high loss rates—often losing more than 75 percent of its drones—in an effort to gradually overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses. Conversely, Ukraine’s ability to scale up interceptors, radar networks, and point-defense systems has helped maintain a favorable cost-exchange ratio, although this has depleted expensive Western-supplied interceptors. Consequently, Ukraine has increasingly relied on electronic warfare tactics, prioritizing reducing drone accuracy rather than direct interception owing to the sheer number of Shaheds launched each night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The net result is drone saturation. It doesn’t matter if an individual Shahed hits its target. What matters is the compound effect the terror weapon has on civilians and the stress it places on air defenses. By saturating the skies with low-cost weapons, Moscow wages an attritional campaign targeting both the will of the Ukrainian people and the readiness of its air defense network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting in September 2024, Russia significantly ramped up its use of Shahed drones, increasing from approximately 200 launches per week to more than 1,000 per week by March 2025 as part of a sustained pressure campaign. Initially designed in Iran, Shahed drones are now manufactured by Russia using engines from various sources, including China. The Russian company Alabuga has contracted with Iran for Shahed drone deliveries. Recent reports indicate that Russia significantly increased its manufacturing capability, particularly at the IEMZ Kupol facility, and has developed an advanced version of the Shahed drone: the Shahed-238 Loitering Munition. These versions likely include a mix of software-defined radios and other guidance systems that make them more difficult to jam. Russia has also started to explore methods for increasing the “punishment” value of each Shahed strike, including adding tungsten balls and lacing components with toxic agents to maximize civilian harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also indications that Russia is set to expand its mass production of low-cost, long-range attack drones and add new variants. There are reports that China is manufacturing Garpiya-3 drones for Russia, which have a 2,000 kilometer (1,200 mile) range with a 50 kilogram (110 pound) payload. Moscow has also started production of a jet-powered variant of the Shahed, the Geran3, which has a range of 2,500 kilometers (1,533 miles) and can travel at speeds up to 550–600 kilometers per hour, making it much harder to intercept. These systems will allow Russia to increase its number of attacks while at the same time making it harder for Ukraine to shoot down every attack drone. Absent additional support to Ukrainian air defenses and new approaches to cutting off the flow of components used to mass produce attack drones, the net result could tip the war in Moscow’s favor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shahed-launches-in-ukraine-war&quot;&gt;Shahed Launches in Ukraine War&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to data released by the Ukrainian Air Force, Shahed drone launches have intensified significantly throughout the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/v20Ioea.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data reveals notable patterns:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting in September 2024, Shahed drone launches escalated sharply. Before this period, the average weekly launch rate was around 130. Within six months, the rate peaked at approximately 1,100 launches per week. This indicates that Russia effectively scaled both launch and production capacities within a short time frame.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite Ukraine’s continued success in intercepting or neutralizing these drones with electronic warfare methods, the relentless pressure of Shahed attacks constitutes a clear attrition strategy. The weekly number of successful drone hits reached approximately 110, nearly 10 times higher than the previous year’s average. This indicates that increased launch intensity directly contributes to heightened damage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/fKAf0DQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: Launch Locations of Shahed Drones.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Ukrainian Air Force; CSIS Futures Lab.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Primorsko-Akhtarsk in Krasnodar Krai is the primary launch site (312 launches), underscoring the strategic importance of the southern front and the Black Sea corridor targeting infrastructure in the Odesa region. Crimea’s Chauda airfield (160 launches) complements this southern axis, allowing drones to circumvent Ukraine’s western air-defense systems. Additionally, oblasts bordering Ukraine—Kursk (248 launches), Bryansk (113), and Oryol (130)—serve as proximate launch points targeting the Donbas and Kharkiv regions, while Millerovo (100) and Yeysk (37) reinforce pressure on eastern targets. The extensive range of launch locations complicates Ukrainian air-defense targeting efforts, forcing allocation of scarce precision-strike and electronic warfare resources over a wide area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past seven months, there has not been a single uninterrupted three-day period without a Shahed drone launch. Salvos have occurred nearly every other day. Overall, 75 percent of Shahed launches have occurred on consecutive days (see Table 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-strategy-of-constant-pressure&quot;&gt;A Strategy of Constant Pressure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s Shahed drone campaign illustrates the changing nature of aerial warfare in an era dominated by inexpensive, mass-produced unmanned systems. For most of the twenty-first century, the focus of aerial attack has been on precision. States use integrated global battle networks to find, fix, track, target, and assess strikes. Entire concepts of joint fires and targeting have evolved, largely driven by a mix of U.S., Russian, and Chinese military theory that emphasize waves of precision strike. In Russian writing, these ideas have tended to include more of a focus on striking critical infrastructure that speaks to a counter value (e.g., civilian targets) and not just a counter force (e.g., military targets). This approach is consistent with what Robert Pape referred to as a punishment strategy in his seminal book Bombing to Win. Seen in relation to competitive strategy, the logic is one of cost imposition, albeit focused more on civilian pressure points than critical military targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, nightly waves of Shaheds produce a secondary effect of military value. Even if the low-cost attack drones are easy to intercept, they force the defender to spend limited defense resources to intercept them. That is, the attacks impose costs not just on Kyiv’s leaders through popular pressure but also through attriting air defense assets. The net result is that Ukraine and its backers must find a way to change the cost calculus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key insight for defense analysts and strategists is that survival against large-scale drone saturation attacks requires a comprehensive, multi-layered defensive approach. This involves balancing the economic costs of attrition warfare with adaptable defense strategies. In other words, the theory of victory is lowering the cost of intercepting long-range, cost-effective attack drones like the Shahed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To a large extent, Ukraine has developed ingenious solutions, many of which are linked to wartime innovation efforts run by its Digital Ministry, that lower the cost of intercept. First, Ukraine has fielded a network of tens of thousands of acoustic sensors to detect and track drones. Second, Ukraine has effectively built a common operating system called DELTA that allows it to track attacks and coordinate responses. By fusing data on attack drones with radar coverage and what frequencies systems are using, Kyiv can better allocate a mix of defense measures ranging from deploying mobile anti-aircraft teams to electronic attack and even aerial intercepts using light attack propeller planes. Other measures have included releasing small attack drones from high-altitude balloons and even custom, low-cost interceptor drones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, for all the battlefield innovations, the rate of Shahed attacks keeps increasing. As a result, new methods to combat drone saturation are needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-test-and-field-new-defeat-measures&quot;&gt;1. Test and Field New Defeat Measures&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the sheer volume of low-cost, long-range attack drones, Ukraine needs to develop new approaches to protecting its skies. To complement its existing command and control system and network of mobile defense teams, Kyiv should work with partners in the United States and Europe to test and field high-energy lasers to counter drone saturation attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are large number of high-energy lasers on the market. RTX makes a 50-kilowatt laser mounted on U.S. Stryker combat vehicles (DE M-SHORAD) as well a smaller road mobile 10 kilowatt laser called the H4. This system would align well with the mobile air defense teams Ukraine already uses to hunt Shaheds. There are also palletized options, like BlueHalo’s LOCUST, that can be quickly moved to adapt to Russian targeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also larger systems that could be integrated with urban power grids. Lockheed Martin manufactures the HELIOS, a 60-kilowatt laser that can be installed on ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other countries also have candidate high-energy weapons that could support defending Ukrainian cities, including the United Kingdom, Turkey (through Aselsan), and Germany (through Rheinmetall), the latter of which has successfully tested a 50-kilowatt laser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine presents a win-win opportunity. These firms need battlefield tests of their systems to further refine them. Every Russian low-cost, long-range attack drone shot down with a high-energy laser makes Ukrainian cities safer and sends a clear message to other coercive states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-increase-long-range-strikes&quot;&gt;2. Increase Long-Range Strikes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best place to destroy a Shahed is on the ground. From factories where the drones are assembled to storage and launch facilities, there are multiple points Ukraine could hold at risk to decrease the number of Shahed attacks. Ukraine has demonstrated its ability to conduct long-range strikes against Russian logistics networks and airbases. These attacks could be complemented by cyber operations that reduce the rate of production, creating, in effect, virtual attrition. They can also involve covert action against the supply chain, a technique recently tried against Russian first-person view (FPV) drone components. In other words, Kyiv needs a campaign for targeting the entire system that produces, launches, and targets Shahed attacks daily that links kinetic and non-kinetic effects as well as conventional and unconventional methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-counter-the-flow-of-components&quot;&gt;3. Counter the Flow of Components&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a role for economic policy. The United States can work with European states to finally hold Chinese firms accountable for their support to Russia’s war machine. Earlier in the war, Moscow used sanctions-evading networks of shell companies and third-country trading to import the electronics needed to build long-range precision strike systems. Now, that market has shifted to China. The Main Intelligence Directorate of Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense has identified 200 component parts made in China that fuel Moscow’s punishment campaign. These include critical Controlled Reception Pattern Antennas (CRP) in the Shahed as well as onboard computers used for multiple classes of drones and Kinzhal ballistic missiles. Furthermore, since late 2023, Russia has been using Chinese technology for engines in its long-range attack drones. While the United States and European states cannot stop the flow of technological components, they can take steps to make it more costly, including launching investigations, levying sanctions, and freezing assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-weaponized-cost-imposition-and-the-future-of-air-defense&quot;&gt;Conclusion: Weaponized Cost Imposition and the Future of Air Defense&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s Shahed campaign is more than a series of drone strikes—it’s a warning shot about the future of war. In this new battlespace, coercive states don’t need precision to win. They need volume, velocity, and the willingness to deploy cheap systems to break expensive defenses and the will of a populace to resist. The Shahed is not just a drone—it is a coercive instrument in a broader punishment strategy aimed at draining Ukrainian resolve and testing the limits of Western support. It’s a slow grind, a war of wear and will, where the cost of each intercept slowly shifts the burden from offense to defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For defense planners and policymakers, the lesson is clear: Surviving drone saturation attacks in the age of autonomy and attrition requires more than exquisite systems and intermittent aid packages. It requires a full-spectrum approach—high-energy lasers for point defense, deeper strikes against production nodes, and a concerted campaign to cut the technological lifelines that connect Chinese components to Russian launch rails. Ukraine’s battlefield improvisation has bought time. What’s needed now is a strategic shift—one that builds layered, resilient, and economically sustainable air defenses while targeting the industrial ecosystems that power drone warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, every Shahed in the sky is a signal. They signal a new phase of military competition—one defined not by singular decisive blows, but by the persistent erosion of capacity and will. The challenge for democracies is to adapt faster than their adversaries escalate. Because if war is ultimately a test of systems—political, economic, and military—then the side that learns faster, fields smarter, and fights cheaper will shape the future battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

As allies shoulder a growing conventional burden, they want to ensure US extended deterrence commitments remain.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, several U.S. allies have expressed a growing interest in developing independent nuclear programs. This trend could reflect a combination of factors, such as geostrategic uncertainty, growing regional tensions, and questions about the credibility of U.S. security guarantees over time. The United States has dedicated significant effort to preventing the spread of nuclear weapons to new possessors for much of the nuclear age and has successfully utilized extended deterrence to dissuade allies from succumbing to proliferation pressures. While U.S. allies have expressed interest in developing their own nuclear weapons before, the United States has historically gone to significant lengths to prevent allied proliferation. Today, U.S. allies in Europe are once again experiencing regional security pressures and fears of U.S. abandonment, both of which have historically motivated interest in proliferation. Yet, by and large, allied leaders have still caveated public preparations for a revised transatlantic relationship with the sentiment that the status quo of cooperation with the United States is preferable to its alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To explore this phenomenon, CSIS’s Project on Nuclear Issues (PONI) gathered a range of views on allied priorities and preferred outcomes for U.S. extended deterrence, modernization, and arms control efforts across a series of workshops with both U.S. and European experts during the winter of 2024–25. The workshops utilized an alternative futures methodology, developing four scenarios that covered a range of adversary capabilities and cooperation along with variations in NATO cohesion. Accompanying the four core scenarios were two “black swan” scenarios, one in which Russia used nuclear weapons and another where there was a change of political leadership in Moscow. The workshops captured strategic objectives and arms control priorities for U.S. allies across the scenarios, providing a robust look at what U.S. allies want and why the current transatlantic relationship is a more desirable outcome than other options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some allies feel compelled to consider alternatives to U.S. extended deterrence, they do not want to pursue nuclear proliferation unless they feel there is no choice. Instead, allies prefer a continued close relationship with the United States underpinned by the guarantee of U.S. extended nuclear deterrence while Europe assumes a greater burden for conventional deterrence. Continued U.S. extended deterrence commitments mean European defense investments can focus on complimenting, rather than replacing, U.S. capabilities, allowing Europe to maximize the efficiency of its investments and avoid accidentally convincing the United States it can afford to withdraw from Europe entirely. At the same time, some allies feel domestic pressure to support and pursue nuclear disarmament, which has stark implications for how these states balance arms control and deterrence priorities. On the one hand, many allies welcome continued U.S.-Russia engagement on arms control and nuclear risk reduction; on the other, arms control agreements or negotiated ends to the war in Ukraine that indicate rapprochement between Washington and Moscow or otherwise undermine the security of Europe could be strongly discouraged. Workshop participants were broadly in agreement on these two key points. It is important to caveat at the outset that allies are not monolithic and that views on specific issues vary across the alliance and within the states themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper will proceed in three parts, considering in turn the three defining categories of the transatlantic nuclear relationship: extended deterrence, nuclear modernization, and arms control. While allies are exploring options for taking on greater responsibility for deterrence, maintaining close military and political ties with the United States remains a top priority. Increased European strategic autonomy should not be mistaken for a breakdown in transatlantic relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;extended-deterrence&quot;&gt;Extended Deterrence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clearer U.S. signaling is on extended deterrence in Europe, the more confident Europe can be in shouldering a higher conventional burden for regional defense. European strategic stability is dependent on NATO having a coherent force structure. NATO allies have spent much of the last several years discussing where the deterrence gaps in the current nuclear force structure are. These gaps have both nuclear and conventional dimensions. NATO allies have continued to debate how NATO’s nuclear mission could be modestly expanded and improved. Meanwhile, the war in Ukraine has accelerated posture adaptations to plug conventional deterrence gaps. For example, the public release of NATO’s Integrated Air and Missile Defense Policy in early 2025 builds on previous statements from the Vilnius and Washington summits and indicates the alliance’s prioritization of air and missile defense, particularly on its eastern border. If the United States is to enact its goal to empower Europe to take ownership of conventional deterrence, Europe will need clarity regarding U.S. nuclear commitments in order to commit to owning most of the conventional deterrence burden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearer, more consistent political signals and renewed U.S. extended deterrence commitments will give Europe more flexibility in allocating resources toward its own defense. Strong U.S. extended deterrence engenders confidence in assessing what future European capabilities will need to achieve and allows states to more authoritatively specialize and maximize comparative advantages across the European defense industry. Continued diplomatic signaling that the nuclear powers of Europe, France and the United Kingdom, want to retain the transatlantic partnership with the United States, combined with acquisition plans that generate a European ability to enhance, rather than replace, U.S. extended deterrence in the region, would give the cooperative, enhanced status-quo approach the greatest chance for success. This approach carefully balances the risk of prompting U.S. disengagement—whether from insufficient burden-sharing on one side or from signaling that U.S. assistance is no longer needed or wanted on the other. European politicians leaning into abandonment fears to motivate defense spending will need to balance such statements with signals favoring transatlantic cooperation. The current approach taken by Paris and London, which have both signaled readiness to bear a larger defense burden while supporting U.S. involvement in a negotiated settlement to the war in Ukraine, may prove to be an ideal model for other allies to emulate. For example, the 30-plus members of the coalition of the willing could serve as the ideal vehicle to demonstrate that Europe is “willing to step up and support the U.S. and Ukraine to achieve a just and lasting peace.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until the Trump administration begins to publish strategy documents like the Nuclear Posture Review, allies may base their perception of their relationship with the United States, and therefore the United States’ credibility as an ally, on statements from members of the administration. These statements—such as Vice President JD Vance’s comments at the Munich Security Conference in February 2025 or the widely publicized Signal exchange in which several administration officials accuse Europe of free riding on defense issues—have generated anxiety among members of the alliance, leading to growing speculation in Europe that U.S. extended deterrence commitments are unreliable. Ambiguous U.S. political commitments have already had tangible effects beyond the political uncertainty they have generated, with France spending €1.5 billion to reopen one of its nuclear air bases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European allies therefore want a clarification of U.S. extended deterrence commitments for more than just a feeling of security: Without knowing what capabilities, personnel, and policies will stay and which will disappear, Europe cannot develop a coherent strategy regarding which U.S. capabilities to compliment and which to replace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;modernization&quot;&gt;Modernization&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alliance needs to follow through on defense improvements, and failure to execute modernization plans across the alliance risks inflating adversary confidence regarding capabilities to survive retaliation or giving the perception that aggression might go unpunished altogether. In the nuclear realm, allies want the United States to follow through on its nuclear modernization programs, and major discrepancies between what is proposed and what is acquired sends the wrong signal about U.S. commitment to the alliance. Furthermore, failure to augment the nuclear posture of the United States or NATO may invite aggression by adversaries. Strategic planners must assume that adversaries see allied modernization plans and develop their own systems accordingly, meaning significant delays in U.S. nuclear modernization may invite the perception among adversaries that U.S. capabilities or commitments are lacking or not credible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, U.S. modernization efforts are directly linked to allied capabilities in certain instances. Nuclear weapons cooperation between the United States and the United Kingdom fostered by the 1958 US-UK Mutual Defense Agreement (MDA) will continue in the next generation of ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs), with common launchers, missiles, and aeroshells and separate but parallel warhead designs under development for the Columbia (United States) and Dreadnought (United Kingdom). The 2024 indefinite extension of the MDA included an amendment that ensured the sharing of information, nuclear material, or equipment would continue in the event the United States or the United Kingdom decided to terminate the agreement. While this largely insulates the agreement from political challenges, it is less reassuring in the event of modernization delays or failures. While these challenges have prompted some allied experts to consider alternatives, cooperation with the United States remains a more favorable path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States, and the alliance more broadly, would benefit from widening the variety of nuclear options available to the alliance in order to further complicate Russian strategic planning. U.S. allies recognize an imbalance between Russia and NATO in theater-range systems and encourage U.S. modernization efforts to play a role in filling that gap. Similarly, allies could undertake modest expansions of their nuclear arsenals to complement existing capabilities, such as the reintroduction of an air leg to UK nuclear forces. Several capabilities were repeatedly mentioned in workshops as priorities to develop and integrate into the alliance: an improved standoff capability, intermediate-range ground-launched ballistic missiles in the European theater, and an expanded number of countries participating in the NATO Dual-Capable Aircraft (DCA) nuclear-sharing mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alliance-wide modernization will similarly need to strike the balance between two extremes: On the one hand, it must go far enough to plug critical deterrence gaps; on the other, it must avoid overcorrecting to the point that it manifests the very credibility concerns it looks to solve. A modest expansion of UK and French nuclear forces to supplement U.S. extended deterrence may strike this balance. Such an expansion could take place within existing structures and would not need to be accompanied by a complete overhaul of the software that governs the alliance’s nuclear weapons. Furthermore, this expansion could be much smaller in number and more tailored in purpose, avoiding the perception that Europe may no longer need to rely on U.S. extended deterrence guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;arms-control&quot;&gt;Arms Control&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one participant noted, arms control exists to codify the strategic balance between its parties through limiting destabilizing activities and systems and promoting confidence in the balance through monitoring and verification practices. European allies largely do not find the current nuclear and conventional balance on the continent comfortable, citing the expanding Russian defense industrial base and Russia’s existing advantage in theater-range nuclear systems. Indeed, some find repeated Russian violations of its arms control commitments evidence that it is sprinting toward a new strategic balance tilted in its own favor. For that reason, some European allies would likely not support an arms control agreement that they believe limits the credibility of U.S. extended deterrence commitments to Europe or Europe’s ability to execute an independent nuclear deterrent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European attitudes on arms control are consistent with their historical positions: Eastern European states are deeply skeptical of the value of negotiating with Russia more generally, Northern European states are more supportive, and the United Kingdom and France largely welcome arms control so long as it does not infringe upon their sovereign nuclear forces. Regarding conventional forces, some European experts favored either delaying any pursuit of conventional arms control until its conventional rearmament is sufficiently complete or pursuing an agreement that allows a controlled ramp-up of conventional forces. Conventional arms control was met with mixed enthusiasm. Some experts believed Europe’s pursuit of specific conventional systems Russia has expressed concerns over, like missile defense and conventional long-range precision strike, would be a boon for arms control in Europe. Other participants noted that those systems are too valuable to Europe and that many allies would not be comfortable negotiating limits on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the workshop discussions, there was a general aversion to an agreement on nuclear arms control that harmed the credibility of U.S. extended deterrence guarantees or otherwise froze the nuclear balance in a favorable way for Russia, even if that arms control allowed for further allied buildup. For example, some European experts in the workshops cautioned against such “performative arms control” that would impose a warhead ceiling higher than New START limits, as it would likely not limit Russian nonstrategic systems that threaten Europe, nor would it likely contain rigorous verification mechanisms that generate confidence in the alliance about the size, distribution, and makeup of the Russian arsenal. Workshop participants were relatively unanimous in the perception that any nuclear arms control agreement must take Russian nonstrategic nuclear weapons into account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some European allies see the collapse of arms control in Europe as a symptom of Russia’s war in Ukraine, in turn weakening their desire to entertain a return to arms control out of concern that it will not prevent future Russian aggression. This has generated skepticism in the utility of arms control as a tool and Russia’s reliability as an arms control partner in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has also demonstrated the military value of weapons limited by arms control agreements, such as antipersonnel mines and cluster munitions, forcing some participants to consider whether Europe needs to leave arms control agreements to maximize its ability to resist Russia in and around Ukraine. Since the conclusion of the workshops, a number of Baltic states have announced their intention to no longer comply with the Ottawa Convention banning antipersonnel landmines, and Lithuania has withdrawn from the Cluster Munition Convention, indicating this challenge is no longer purely hypothetical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workshop participants were split on whether arms control, in its current form, has a future. Arms control still plays a valuable role in preventing the further expansion of the war in Ukraine; Russia’s decision to provide the United States with advance warning of its use of Oreshnik ballistic missiles in Ukraine demonstrates that there are still slivers of the existing nuclear order that all parties find valuable and worth protecting. Furthermore, some allied countries contain large and vocal publics that consistently apply internal arms control and disarmament pressures, meaning the preservation of existing arms control structures may be more politically appealing to some allied governments than others. At the same time, some participants feared that demonstrating an attachment to those remaining pieces of the nuclear order would simply signal to Russia where it still has leverage over the West and that the nuclear order was worth sacrificing if it meant Europe and the United States could deter Russia free of political constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. allies in Europe face a paradox. While the United States has signaled that it remains committed to NATO and its partnerships in Europe “full stop,” those same assurances have recently come with caveats that the United States “will no longer tolerate an imbalanced relationship which encouraged dependency.” At the same time, Europe must find a way to strike a balance between shouldering an increased burden while making sure it does not go so far as to enable a self-fulfilling prophecy of a total U.S. withdrawal from the region. While allies may possess different visions for how to best achieve this balance, continued cooperation across the Atlantic is still widely preferred to its alternatives. Discussions on how to ensure this cooperation continues in the face of political and security pressures has renewed debates within the alliance about the future of arms control, nuclear modernization, and U.S. extended deterrence commitments, and while there remains a great deal of debate regarding the specifics of each, there also remains significant trade space for cooperation and compromise before allies begin to consider alternatives to transatlantic cooperation. Nevertheless, incentives for continued cooperation cannot be taken for granted, and listening to and considering the priorities of its allies remains in the national security interests of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea is a middle power in the Indo-Pacific region that has been seeking to articulate a global role through partnerships with like-minded countries, including the UK. In November 2023, South Korea and the UK signed the Downing Street Accord (DSA) that promised to raise their bilateral ties “to the highest level of strategic ambition, to endure for this century and beyond”. The relevance of the UK–South Korea bilateral partnership is clarified by common challenges to the rules-based international order as manifested by the growing influence of illiberal states and their undemocratic behaviours, such as Russia’s aggression against Ukraine. Such developments have further led to the strengthening of illicit ties between Moscow and Pyongyang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against such a backdrop, the political turmoil in Seoul that began in December 2024 with the short-lived martial law declaration by ousted president Yoon Suk Yeol creates uncertainties not only for its domestic politics, but also for its foreign policy projection. The purpose of this Policy Brief is to situate UK–South Korea ties in the context of Seoul’s larger strategy and outline the implications of South Korea’s global vision for its relationship with the UK. Despite South Korea’s political embroilment, enhancing the UK–South Korea partnership is important because the two countries complement each other – Seoul’s aspirations to increase its capacity as an important global stakeholder remains unwavering, while Westminster continues to expand its engagement with the rising Indo-Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Policy Brief examines South Korea’s foreign policy trajectory and its relevance for the UK. The research is based on a review of key official documents and speeches released by former South Korean administrations to understand Seoul’s global vision. It briefly outlines the historical development of South Korea’s ambitions as a growing middle power and how Seoul pursues its goals. It goes on to argue that the UK should extend its efforts to strengthen the bilateral ties that will also promote its own global status in the Indo-Pacific. The brief concludes with practical policy recommendations for enhancing UK–South Korea cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;south-korea-as-a-global-middle-power&quot;&gt;South Korea as a Global Middle Power&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea’s goal of globalisation was set in the 1990s after achieving democratisation and economic development. Since then, every successive South Korean government, regardless of political complexion, has endorsed the mission to put itself forward as an active global stakeholder. From the 2000s, South Korea’s policy began to be branded as a “middle-power” diplomacy seeking an enhanced role in the world. By the early 2020s, Seoul described its heightened global status as “standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the G7”, with reference to two G7 summit invitations in 2020 and 2021. These narratives illustrate South Korea’s enthusiasm to play a role in global ordering institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most recently, the Yoon administration carried this mission further and actively promoted the vision of South Korea becoming a Global Pivotal State (GPS) and set this as one of six key policy goals. Compared to the previous middle-power diplomacy, Yoon’s GPS concept projected Seoul’s aspiration to be not merely a “middle” power but a “pivotal” one, carrying greater global influence. Prior to assuming office, Yoon’s presidential transition committee announced its 110 key policy tasks, of which one was to strengthen a role as a GPS that befits a country’s elevated status, thus becoming an “influential power rather than one being influenced by others”. To this end, the Yoon administration released two policy documents (the Indo-Pacific Strategy and the National Security Strategy), elaborating Seoul’s revitalised global ambitions and the strategic objectives required to play such roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GPS goal was pursued through a two-track approach. First, it enhanced strategic partnerships with like-minded partners based on shared values. As an Asian democracy with a developed economy, South Korea strengthened ties with those who share such values – the US, Australia, Japan and European countries. Second, Seoul increased its engagement with the Global South by enhancing its development assistance capacity. In recent years, its official development assistance budget each year has been the largest on record, marking $3.94 billion in 2025. South Korea aims to become a top 10 donor country by 2026 and is reaching out to different corners of the world, including Africa, Southeast Asia and the Pacific, seeking to play a global role extending beyond the scope of its traditional foreign policy, which was limited to the Korean Peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;seouls-indo-pacific-strategy-more-than-a-regional-framework&quot;&gt;Seoul’s Indo-Pacific Strategy: More than a Regional Framework&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When its region began to be reframed from “Asia-Pacific” to “Indo-Pacific”, South Korea was initially hesitant to embrace the new concept. Although it had been advocated by the first Trump administration and others in the region since the mid-2010s, the administration of then-president Moon Jae-in maintained an ambiguous position as the idea of the free and open Indo-Pacific began to imply a growing US–China rivalry. Instead, Seoul sought to walk a fine line between its ally and largest trading partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While acknowledging the regional developments based on the new framework, South Korea laid out its own New Southern Policy (NSP) aimed at enhancing ties with Southeast Asia and India. The NSP allowed Seoul to continue its Asia-Pacific rhetoric and cooperate with regional stakeholders on its own terms. It was only in May 2021 that the term “Indo-Pacific” was officially endorsed by Seoul at the US–ROK summit under the Biden presidency, when the two countries agreed to “work to align the ROK’s New Southern Policy and the United States’ vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a political change from a progressive to a conservative government in May 2022, the Yoon administration announced Seoul’s Indo-Pacific Strategy (IPS) during the ASEAN–ROK Summit in November 2022, and the official document was published a month later. In accordance with the NSP, Seoul indicated its mindfulness of ASEAN centrality as emphasised in the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific when embracing the Indo-Pacific. Similar to other countries in the region, such as India and ASEAN member states, South Korea’s new strategy noted China as a cooperation partner, rather than framing the Indo-Pacific as part of an anti-China narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What differentiated Yoon’s IPS from Moon’s NSP and the Indo-Pacific strategies of other countries is that the IPS was a global rather than a regional strategy. It was at the centre of Seoul’s GPS ambitions and stretched beyond the geographic scope of the Indo-Pacific, promising to “work closely with Europe and Latin America”. It also embraced the universality of liberal values, vowing to “uphold international norms and strengthen a rules-based order built on universal values including freedom, democracy, the rule of law, and human rights”. This was central to Yoon’s foreign policy as its emphasis on values featured prominently in the country’s diplomatic overture towards like-minded states and organisations such as the UK, the G7 and NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-value-based-diplomacy-and-uksouth-korea-partnership&quot;&gt;A Value-Based Diplomacy and UK–South Korea Partnership&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea finds liberal democracy to be one of its defining national identities. Despite polarised domestic politics, liberal values such as freedom, democracy and human rights are embraced across all political spectrums. The Yoon administration took this a step further by placing such values at the heart of its foreign and security policies. In addition to the IPS, its National Security Strategy also placed significant emphasis on values. It pinned value-based diplomacy as one of the five “core strategic tenets”, and two of six strategic tasks laid out in the document were related to this theme: “conducting diplomatic cooperation grounded in freedom and solidarity” and “defending liberal democracy and contributing to global prosperity”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on such notion, Seoul has been strengthening its foreign and security relationships with like-minded partners, most notably the US and the UK. These relationships are enhanced through several bilateral and multilateral meetings, bolstered by new cooperation frameworks such as the Washington Declaration with the US and the DSA with the UK that have laid out cooperation in various sectors where South Korea has a competitive edge, such as cyber, economy, energy and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The partnership with the UK is of particular significance as the DSA is the only major framework that Seoul has established besides Washington, its only treaty ally. This illustrates the importance of the UK in Seoul’s foreign policy thinking, which deserves greater recognition and reciprocation. While cooperation with other regional like-minded partners, such as Australia and Japan, are deemed important and necessary, South Korea’s prioritisation of enhancing ties with the UK demonstrates its ambition to step up as a global actor, forging a “global strategic partnership” with a P5 (permanent UN Security Council member) and G7 member.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underscoring such significance, the UK should set out the areas of bilateral cooperation with South Korea that would assist the UK’s outreach to the Indo-Pacific, as well as accommodating Seoul’s engagement with Europe and NATO, which has expanded over recent years. Since 2022, when NATO began to increase its ties with like-minded Indo-Pacific countries amid deepening Russia–China ties, South Korea took part in every annual NATO summit and NATO–South Korea cooperation has rapidly developed. Seoul signed the Individually Tailored Partnership Programmes in July 2023, indicating a more concrete security cooperation. Moreover, South Korea became NATO’s first Asian partner to sign an agreement on mutual recognition for military airworthiness certification, and joined the Science &amp;amp; Technology Organization Partnership with the aim of enhancing military interoperability and collaborating in defence research. These developments are significant as Seoul deepens its defence engagement with Europe as a partner for defence manufacturing and procurement, as well as a model of maintaining powerful and efficient military power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;internal-and-external-challenges&quot;&gt;Internal and External Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK–South Korea partnership is faced by shared challenges both from within and outside. Yoon’s abrupt martial law declaration jeopardised both South Korea’s status as a mature democracy and its future policy orientations. While democratic processes that nullified the martial law – followed by Yoon’s impeachment – demonstrated the country’s democratic resilience and the rule of law, the future trajectory of Seoul’s foreign policy is still in question, particularly given the diverging foreign policy outlook held by different political groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too often Seoul lacks bipartisan foreign policy as political groups take different stances on its relationships with key partners such as the US, China and Japan. Under such circumstances, Yoon’s value-based diplomacy has been criticised by opposition parties. The first impeachment bill against Yoon drafted by the oppositions criticised Yoon’s value diplomacy, saying that it had “ignored geopolitical balance, provoked North Korea, China, and Russia, and pursued an unusual pro-Japan stance”. Instead, the oppositions argue that South Korea’s national interest is served best by pragmatic diplomacy that seeks to balance between the great powers, given geopolitical realities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his speech at the Korean Council on Foreign Relations, Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul argued, in defence of Seoul’s value diplomacy, that it is imperative for Seoul to “strengthen our solidarity with democratic nations to uphold universal values and the rules-based international order – both of which have helped the Republic of Korea come as far as it has today”. While acknowledging the internal foreign policy debate, Cho asserted that South Korea “must reduce swings in our foreign policy and be steadfastly consistent in our vision and our goals”. However, as the diverging views stem from fundamental differences in attitude towards the country’s important neighbours, questions remain regarding policy sustainability, as a leadership change is often followed by a dramatic turn in the country’s foreign policy orientation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A change in policy direction following a political change is also a feature of UK politics. The most recent change of government brought uncertainty about its engagement with the Indo-Pacific. In the Labour Party’s manifesto, there is no mention of the term “Indo-Pacific” and its primary prescription for “rebuilding [external] relationships” is with the EU, while the AUKUS partnership and the UK’s relationship with China are only briefly noted. It should be remembered that there had been scepticism over the sustainability of Britain’s Indo-Pacific tilt even during the Conservative government that initiated it. For the UK to strengthen its global relevance, particularly in the Indo-Pacific, the Labour government needs to reassure its regional partners that its engagement with the region will continue to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea and the UK are also faced with greater external challenges, particularly the prolonged effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which has led to a convergence of Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific security theatres. Since the outbreak of Russia’s aggression, Seoul has been providing humanitarian support to Ukraine, equipped other supporters of Ukraine with munitions and joined international sanctions against Russia. In turn, Moscow has sought external support, reaching out to Pyongyang. Since the signing of mutual military assistance from the Putin–Kim summit in June 2024, North Korea has deployed troops and munitions to the battlefront. Such illicit development of the alliance between the two illiberal states jeopardises the security of both Europe and the Korean Peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-recommendations-for-the-uk&quot;&gt;Policy Recommendations for the UK&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the UK, South Korea has become an emerging economic and security partner. The UK’s services exports to South Korea have more than doubled in current prices to £3.8 billion in 2023. According to the UK’s Department for Business and Trade, the two countries ranked as the 25th-largest trading partners to each other in 2024, indicating that there is potential for improvement. To this end, the ongoing negotiations to upgrade their free-trade agreement, signed shortly after Brexit in 2019, will help strengthen their economic interdependence. Their partnership has also been growing in the security realm, with increased joint military exercises and cooperation in the defence industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a major Indo-Pacific partner alongside other like-minded countries, such as Australia and Japan, Seoul’s rise as a middle partner capable of playing a greater global role is beneficial for the UK. South Korea will support upholding the rules-based international order, in which the UK’s national interests also lie. As the US now challenges the traditional international norms it had set since the end of the Second World War, cooperation with the Indo-Pacific is needed more than ever to uphold Britain’s regional and global interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, UK–South Korea cooperation supports the UK’s engagement with the Indo-Pacific by developing another key partnership that links Europe and the Indo-Pacific. Enhancing ties with regional partners helps to ease the region’s scepticisms over the UK’s interest and commitment, as well as answering calls for a more constructive engagement. It is therefore in the UK’s interest to continue supporting South Korea’s vision to play such an expanded role, with the UK as a key partner. Several practical policy recommendations can be made in this respect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the UK should be more proactive in developing the bilateral partnership with the South Korean government. It is therefore necessary for the UK to take the initiative in setting out a more ambitious bilateral agenda. In this respect, the UK’s response to Seoul’s political turmoil was adequate to reiterate the UK–South Korea global strategic partnership. To further these efforts, the UK should reappraise the DSA and take concrete steps to follow up on implementing promised cooperation frameworks that would prompt Seoul to reciprocate the commitment. The signing of the DSA demonstrated South Korea’s recognition of the UK as an important partner for its global ambition. Despite Seoul’s temporary leadership vacuum, the UK’s lead in reappraising the bilateral cooperation will reiterate the significance of the partnership and allow the UK to set priorities for bilateral cooperation with the next South Korean government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the UK should hold an ASEAN or Indo-Pacific Policy Dialogue with South Korea to pursue its cooperation mechanism with Southeast Asian countries in a more effective manner. When pursuing diplomacy with ASEAN member states, the UK should work with other regional partners to efficiently manage resources and maximise policy goals. South Korea serves as an ideal cooperation partner in this area as it has experience in holding these dialogues with like-minded partners such as Australia, the US and France, as well as trilateral dialogues with Australia, Japan and the US (US–Australia, US–Japan and Australia–Japan, respectively) to map out their respective Southeast Asia and Indo-Pacific policies and find areas of collaboration with each other and with ASEAN countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussing ASEAN and Indo-Pacific policies with Seoul will be a constructive channel for the UK to effectively distinguish areas where it can make a visible contribution without overlapping agendas with other regional stakeholders, which could overshadow the UK’s role, and continue its engagement with Southeast Asia as anticipated. Most countries in Southeast Asia are developing countries and thus a collaboration between the UK and South Korea can complement each country by bringing together their development cooperation experiences. The UK is a prominent donor nation, but its top aid recipients are mostly in Africa and the Middle East with only one Southeast Asian country in its top 20 destinations. On the other hand, South Korea’s top aid recipients in 2022 were ASEAN member states, with five of them listed in its top seven beneficiaries. Therefore, cooperation between the UK and South Korea in development assistance would be mutually beneficial as the UK’s knowhow in designing and implementing development programmes can be complemented by South Korea’s regional expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the UK can sponsor Seoul’s membership of an expanded G7. Since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, the G7 has become the most active and influential international organisation promoting democracy, freedom and a rules-based international order as the world becomes increasingly challenged by a bond between authoritarian governments and ongoing major conflicts in Europe and the Middle East. At a time when the UN Security Council is losing its effectiveness due to veto powers held by Russia and China, the stakes have become higher for the G7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea is a capable like-minded partner for G7 members and has participated in two of the most recent four G7 meetings – in the UK in 2021 and in Japan in 2023 – upon invitation by the host countries. Its failure to be invited in 2024 was criticised by South Korean opposition parties, indicating bipartisan aspirations to join the club. As seen in NATO’s increasing collaboration with Indo-Pacific partners, Seoul is ready to play a more constructive role in promoting a rules-based international order. As the solidarity of the group faces internal challenges following the return of the Trump administration, South Korea remains an ideal partner for alternative partnerships that could help leverage the possible internal friction within the G7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last, the UK should carefully consider the ways to involve South Korea in the AUKUS partnership. Whilst the pact remains a trilateral cooperation mechanism, working with other regional partners is essential as its goal is regional security. The joint statement from the 2+2 meeting between South Korea and Australia in 2024 noted that Seoul expressed its interest in the project as it “welcomed that the AUKUS countries are considering cooperation with additional partners on Pillar II”. The possibility of involving key regional partners including not just South Korea but also Japan, New Zealand and Canada in AUKUS Pillar 2 was confirmed in the third anniversary joint statement in September 2024. Up to now, rather than creating a constructive discourse, the lack of information on expanding the AUKUS partnership has caused confusion, with speculations and calls for JAUKUS (Japan) or CAUKUS (Canada). A more controlled dialogue with the existing AUKUS members will help to maximise the benefits of the partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea has attempted for decades to define itself in various ways on the global stage. In recent years, its bilateral and multilateral relationships with like-minded countries, and with the developing world, have deepened – demonstrating Seoul’s capacity to live up to its global goals. During this process, its elevated partnership with the UK has become a key anchor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the UK, its ambiguous stance on engagement with the Indo-Pacific concerns regional stakeholders as to whether its actions will follow its words. While the challenges in Europe may take priority, its overtures in the Indo-Pacific should not be overlooked. Moreover, supporting South Korea’s global vision can be constructive for European security, as Seoul increases its defence ties with the UK and other European partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its continuing political upheaval, South Korea is still an important global stakeholder. The UK should take advantage of this opportunity to step up its partnership with South Korea, even though there remain challenges from internal and external factors that hinder realising its full potential. The perennial challenge of North Korea’s nuclear and missile capabilities development, as well as its deepening ties with Russia, is alarming not only for South Korea, but for the global liberal international order. As Seoul seeks to enhance its global profile, the limitations to its domestic and international capacity could be supplemented by support from like-minded states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against such a backdrop, it would be in the interest of partners such as the UK to endorse and support Seoul’s quest to play a greater role on the global stage. In turn, South Korea’s enhanced global status and the increased responsibilities it will assume can complement the UK’s efforts to sustain the liberal international order.&lt;/p&gt;

This report distills 10 insights that will shape the next war.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine was the most violent seizure of sovereign European territory since World War II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the spring of 2025, CSIS military fellows worked with top resident defense experts to produce nonpolitical, actionable takeaways from the Russia-Ukraine War. Ukrainians, academics, industry leaders, and military professionals who have experienced and studied the war were brought together for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insights from this regional war have critical global relevance, as they will likely inform large-scale combat operations between great powers in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s nuclear threats impacted both the speed and scale of Western military support to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the invasion in February 2022, Putin readied strategic Russian nuclear forces and threatened the use of nuclear weapons to defend its territory (including Ukrainian territory captured during the invasion). Within this context, Western nations methodically provided Ukraine with more advanced and long-range systems, one system at a time. For example, British Storm Shadow missiles were not employed until May 2023, while U.S. Army Tactical Missile Systems were not provided until October 2023. U.S.-made F-16 aircraft were supplied to Ukraine in August 2024. By some accounts, nuclear war was only avoided by stern warnings from the U.S. national security advisor and a message from President Biden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russia-Ukraine War provides a successful model of how incremental military aid can keep warfare at the conventional, nonnuclear level. Incremental escalation—providing support and then pausing to gauge the Russian reaction before providing more advanced support—contributed to the absence of a nuclear detonation in this conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Innovation is about cycles. The speed at which adversaries complete cycles of gap detection, innovation, production, and testing impacts which side has a competitive advantage. The Russia-Ukraine War is a laboratory of such innovation and adaptation, especially in drones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the air, Ukraine’s use of cheap, expendable drones delivered precision weapons at scale. Costing several hundred to several thousand dollars each, Ukraine produced 1.5 million aerial drones in 2024, with a goal to triple that total in 2025. These drones provided surveillance and artillery adjustment, delivered kamikaze attacks on personnel and equipment, and even shot down other drones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine, a state without a navy, denied sea terrain access to a great power. Unmanned surface vessels like the Magura V5 were a game changer in the Black Sea. Built from modified jet skis, the Magura V5 sank or damaged several Russian warships. These sea drones, along with Ukrainian-built cruise missiles, contributed to Kyiv’s ability to export its agricultural products after Russia withdrew from the Black Sea Grain Initiative in July 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian forces matched Ukraine’s ingenuity on the battlefield. Their ability to adapt to new Ukrainian technology or tactics has improved remarkably since the war began and can now be measured in mere weeks. One example was their introduction of fiber-optic controlled drones, which circumvented Ukraine’s radio jamming advances while still matching their predecessors’ range and speed. As with most advancements in the war, this innovation was quickly adopted and subsequently improved by Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite rapid advances, the use of unmanned sea and aerial drones today is still an evolution, not a revolution, of warfare. Judged through the lens of defense offset strategy, a revolutionary advance would gain and maintain a significant advantage over adversaries over long periods of time. While innovative, the technological advancements gained through iteration provided battlefield advantage measured in days or even hours before the opponent adapted, thus making it evolutionary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future warfare will feature innovations that adapt as technologies evolve. Encrypted AI software in drones allowed Ukraine to maintain a technological advantage, as a simple firmware upgrade could provide enhanced capabilities without the need for new hardware. Gaining advantages without updating hardware speeds the cycles of innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the countless videos of drones destroying tanks in Ukraine, Ukrainian military leaders are adamant that tanks remain crucial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tanks with infantry do what air power, indirect fires, and drones cannot do alone: seize and hold terrain. This is often the chief objective of land warfare. Ukrainian Army Lieutenant Colonel Volodymyr Dutko noted that his soldiers “ignore tanks at high risk.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The skill of employment shapes the value of tanks. When Ukraine or Russia has committed tanks without infantry support, they became easy targets for drones and anti-tank weapons. During the 2024 invasion of Kursk, however, Ukrainian commanders used armored formations as part of a combined arms maneuver and held sovereign Russian territory for several months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For future warfare, tanks provide what future tech needs most: power. The Russian “Turtle Tanks” demonstrate how future tanks could offer a mobile and survivable platform that supplies power for electronic attack, electronic protection, and drones. The tanks of the next war might contribute to success as a mobile protected supporter that is difficult to stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scale of artillery exchanges in this war has exposed global shortages in conventional munitions. Getting limited resources to the front lines has impacted battlefield performance. At the beginning of the war, Ukraine’s state-owned defense agency, Ukroboronprom, was not able to deliver the equipment and supplies needed to effectively sustain military operations. War demands forced the rapid incorporation of foreign state and private industry equipment and technologies into the Ukrainian fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evolving tactics on the front line have required quick changes to increasingly expendable and autonomous unmanned system designs. This necessitates rapid, large-scale production of cutting-edge technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To maintain a technological and logistical edge, Ukraine has disaggregated drone maintenance and refitting into agile workshops dispersed across the frontline and embedded unmanned system engineers and technicians there. This has enabled rapid acquisition based on feedback and requirements directly from warfighters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very short design, construction, combat testing, and hardware/software revision cycles of dynamic acquisition create a competitive edge. Authorizing these decisions at lower levels and with less oversight incurs accountability and program sustainment risks but is necessary to innovate at the speed of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supplying the front lines is only possible if logistics systems are secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Russia has been able to employ munitions from North Korea and drones from Iran, Ukraine has received support from the United States, Europe, and other nations. Transportation infrastructure, including railways, roads, and ports, is vulnerable to kinetic and cyber threats. Commercial providers’ willingness and capacity to operate in conflict zones has proved unpredictable. Cross-nationally, customs and hazardous materials transport regulations, along with infrastructure limitations, also has impeded supply between allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional nodal concentration—large supply centers and transportation hubs—has proved vulnerable to long-range precision strikes. Ukraine’s cyber defense efforts, however, including a volunteer “Cyber Army,” have safeguarded logistics networks, while the rapid expansion of Ukraine’s “Army of Drones” has highlighted the potential of integrating commercial, military, and civilian innovation in wartime logistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future success in contested environments will depend not only on moving supplies but on mastering data, defending networks, and leveraging innovation across all domains. Future military logistics must also adopt a strategy of disaggregation—distributing assets to avoid targeting while maintaining the capability to rapidly reaggregate at the point of need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has leveraged AI-enabled software and data platforms to enhance its decisionmaking speed for warfare and governance—leading to lessons for kinetic, non-kinetic, and governance operations. Whoever has data superiority will gain an advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the battlefield, a powerful trio of AI-enabled software, satellite communications, and overhead imagery analysis has enabled the Ukrainian military to efficiently target and deliver kinetic fires. Rapid adaptation of data analysis has enabled rapid evolution in battlefield decisions for warfighting and logistics sustainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State, society, industry, and military units can now be connected directly and at speeds and scales previously unimaginable. Ukraine has created data tools to share tactical data from citizens and military units that bypass traditional government hierarchies. These tools visualize logistics, kinetic fires, emergency response, and even the scope of war crimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies have used radar imagery and data from commercial satellites to help Ukrainian civilians find evacuation routes and map power grid damage for restoration without dangerous surveys. The Ukrainian application Diia’s digital identification and passport system has helped displaced Ukrainians cross borders when physical documents are inaccessible. The Ukrainian tech industry recognizes it possesses several key niche capabilities for future warfare and foresees export opportunities in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russia-Ukraine War previews the future role of AI and data integration in warfare. Militaries gain advantages by creating a common platform for intelligence, operations, logistics, and planning functions; developing user-friendly systems to minimize training load; and granting authority to frontline forces to rapidly evolve tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Near-real-time commercial space capabilities have enabled a new level of battlefield transparency that is forcing changes in tactics on the ground. The Russia-Ukraine conflict has seen unprecedented integration of dual-use commercial space capabilities in warfare. These technologies have enabled Ukraine to gain an asymmetric advantage against Russia—evolving from strategic intelligence resources to critical tactical enablers. As Giorgi Tskhakaia noted, every six months, a new “game-changer” technology is presented on the battlefield, requiring adaptation and countermeasures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new elements of space warfare also have led to cross-domain implications. Russia has struggled to integrate space operations effectively and has been unable to deny Ukraine’s satellite communications. The failure to achieve spectrum superiority also has hindered Russia’s network-centric warfare capabilities and underscored the importance of resilient communications and electronic warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the collaboration between Russia and China in space operations, including sharing commercial imagery, signals a growing challenge to U.S. space security. Over the last 30 years, U.S. space domain superiority has allowed the United States to reduce its army, navy, and air force significantly. If neither side can secure the space domain in future wars, we can anticipate attritional trench line warfare like the Russia-Ukraine War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has persevered for over three years against a larger and more powerful adversary because of an outsized will to fight. When offered safe evacuation, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky replied, “The fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “will to fight” refers to the synthesis of psychological resilience, physical capability, and ideological conviction of a given side in conflict. While it is challenging to assess the will to fight before conflict, its effects have enormous repercussions on the course of warfare. Analysts underestimated the Ukrainian will to fight in 2022 and had been predicting rapid capitulation. Instead, Ukrainians have demonstrated profound psychological and ideological resilience, amplified by the reality of an existential threat to their homeland. The ability to sustain this will to fight depends on maintaining material support from the West and optimizing its few recruitable citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian soldiers’ will to fight has suffered repeated blows throughout the war, rooted in the failure to secure what seemed like a quick, guaranteed victory. Despite generous recruiting incentives to families in Russia’s struggling economy, Russia has needed to secure prisoner labor and North Korean soldiers to bolster its meatgrinder assaults. In 2024, desertion and drug use in the Russian military reached unprecedented levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All things being equal, the side with a stronger will to fight will persevere and succeed. But all things are not equal in warfare. Ukraine’s will to fight has compensated for shortfalls but might not last forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ongoing Russia-Ukraine War highlights the competitive advantages possible by integrating women into combat and support roles. Women possess unique skills and networks in society that can drive innovation and mobilize resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian women have been more active than Russian women in supporting and fighting the Russia-Ukraine War. As of 2023, more than 42,000 females were serving within the Ukrainian Army, compared with 1,100 Russian females on the front lines that same year. This disparity is shocking due to the demographic differences between the countries (Ukraine’s population is less than one-third of Russia’s) and because both militaries share a common Soviet heritage. During World War II, the Soviets gained a comparative advantage in population mobilization by integrating women into combat and support roles. This bolstered its population advantage against Nazi Germany, whose rigid ideology on gender roles precluded women in combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has embraced innovative changes to body armor and uniforms to optimize protection, functionality, and dignity for women serving in the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond serving as soldiers, Ukrainian women have contributed as humanitarian actors, community leaders, and providers for their families. Their effort contributes to a whole-of-society resilience that creates a deterrent effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Women in the armed forces and beyond enhance defense capability. For future warfare, nations that demonstrate a unified will to resist present a stronger deterrent against aggressors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has attracted international goodwill as the underdog, appealing to a diverse array of donors. This goodwill has led to support in many forms, from weaponry from Western nations to volunteers at the grassroots level. In contrast, following the opening days of the invasion, the UN accused Russia of war crimes, and the International Criminal Court indicted six Russian officials for war crimes in Ukraine. This created a general international view of Russia as the villain in the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western sanctions on Russia have limited the ability of Russia to sustain the war. Since 2023, Russia has expanded its outreach to China, Iran, and North Korea, trading unknown capabilities for additional war resources. Meanwhile, Ukraine has gained support due to a commonly held narrative that they are the victim of an invasion who refuses to give up. This has provided Ukraine with soft power. This dichotomy in the war narrative has resulted in Ukraine having additional options and Russia being constrained. The global equipment, money, and munitions support to Ukraine has enhanced its ability to fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In future warfare, the commonly understood story, supported by facts and events on the ground, will impact the amount of tangible support (or constraints) a side will receive from the international community. The way the United States is regarded by its allies and partners will influence the level of international commitment to future campaigns and impact the chances of success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2025, the Sanctions and Illicit Finance Monitoring and Analysis Network (SIFMANet), led by RUSI’s Centre for Finance and Security (CFS) and supported by the National Endowment for Democracy, held a roundtable workshop in Bucharest, Romania. The event explored the evolving challenges posed by sanctions implementation, economic security and state-driven threats. Hosted by Her Majesty Margareta, Custodian of the Romanian Crown, the event was organised in partnership with 45 North.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This meeting formed part of a wider series of country-specific engagements that SIFMANet has conducted since early 2022. The workshop brought together a diverse and highly engaged group of public and private sector stakeholders, academics, and financial specialists, including participants from the Romanian Financial Supervisory Authority, the National Authority for Management and Regulation in Communications of Romania (commonly known as ANCOM), and the Romanian National Agency for Public Procurement. The workshop also brought together Romanian banks, such as Banca Transilvania and UniCredit Bank, along with VISTA Bank (a Texas-based bank), and GARANTI BBVA (a Turkish bank). Financial agencies and academic institutions, such as the National Agency for Fiscal Administration (ANAF), Romania’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), the Romanian Customs Authority, and the Bucharest University of Economic Studies (ASE), also attended, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report presents insights and reflections from the Bucharest workshop, as well as side meetings, including a discussion with a group of members of the Romanian parliament. The report offers a grounded overview of Romania’s progress and challenges in navigating sanctions, illicit finance and economic security. While none of the discussions at the event are attributable, the lessons drawn from them contribute to a growing body of knowledge on how smaller EU economies can respond effectively to the threats posed by hostile state actors and financial exploitation, and respond to the changing European sanctions landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sanctions&quot;&gt;Sanctions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;background-romanias-evolving-sanctions-framework&quot;&gt;Background: Romania’s Evolving Sanctions Framework&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, Romania has undergone a significant legislative overhaul to modernise its sanctions framework. The reforms aimed to address enforcement challenges and align the legal system with the operational needs of both regulators and the private sector. A key milestone was the adoption of a revised legal package in December 2024, which introduced clearer mandates, more structured coordination and improved enforcement mechanisms. According to a representative of the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), additional amendments are underway to transpose the EU Directive on the criminalisation of sanctions evasion into national law by the May 2025 deadline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need for reform became particularly urgent after 2022, when the complexity and volume of sanctions outpaced Romania’s existing institutional capacity. Previously, implementation responsibilities were distributed based on authorities’ broader legal mandates. As noted by a representative of a Romanian public authority, this decentralised and implicit approach became increasingly untenable, as sanctions enforcement required cross-sectoral coordination and timely decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response, the Romanian government formally designated 18 competent authorities across different sectors, each with clearly defined responsibilities for sanctions implementation and enforcement. Particular attention was given to the management of derogations, one of the most technically and legally challenging areas of sanctions enforcement. In situations where jurisdictional overlap or disputes arise, the MFA can notify the Interinstitutional Council, a forum that reunites all implementing authorities as well as a series of other institutions providing support in their area of competence. Upon said notification, the interinstitutional council will designate the competent authority to issue an authorisation through a vote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This restructuring marks a shift towards a more rules-based and proactive enforcement model, aimed at enhancing Romania’s ability to meet EU standards and respond to emerging geopolitical threats with greater institutional clarity and coherence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the workshop, a representative from the MFA highlighted the continued relevance of sanctions as a critical policy instrument in the country’s response to Russian aggression. Instead of introducing an independent national sanctions regime, Romania chose to promote its sanctions demarches at EU level by playing an active role in shaping EU restrictive measures. The MFA has seen notable changes in its responsibilities, reflecting the growing complexity of sanctions enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ministry’s current mandate spans three primary functions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Policy leadership:&lt;/strong&gt; The MFA acts as Romania’s representative at EU-level negotiations on restrictive measures. In this capacity, it promotes Romania’s interests and proposals directly in Brussels, shaping the design of the EU sanctions framework, given the absence of a domestic sanctions regime. Romania’s experience with the sanctions regime in the Republic of Moldova illustrates this approach: Romania has actively supported and helped operationalise EU measures targeting Russian influence in the Republic of Moldova, an area of strategic importance given the cross-border security implications.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secretariat of the Interinstitutional Council:&lt;/strong&gt; A representative of the MFA confirmed that, until December 2024, the MFA served as the national coordinator for sanctions implementation, overseeing Romania’s network of national competent authorities. This coordination role is now led by a representative of the Chancellery of the Prime Minister, signifying a strategic effort to centralise and strengthen national-level oversight, while the MFA kept the role of the interinstitutional council’s secretariat.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementation authority:&lt;/strong&gt; The MFA is still responsible for managing export controls of dual-use and military products and the enforcement of visa bans associated with EU sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;private-sector-reflections-on-sanctions-enforcement-and-due-diligence-challenges&quot;&gt;Private Sector Reflections on Sanctions Enforcement and Due Diligence Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sanctions Enforcement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representatives from Romania’s financial sector, including the Romanian Banking Association (RBA) and representatives from individual banks, shared the considerable impact that sanctions enforcement has had on their operations. These effects extend beyond the Romanian context to include affiliated entities in Moldova. Since the introduction of EU sanctions in 2022, Romania’s banking system has faced intense pressure, particularly in relation to transaction screening and compliance processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While direct transactions with Russian entities have significantly decreased, the more complex challenge lies in monitoring indirect transactions. In particular, it is difficult to monitor transactions routed through intermediaries, or involving entities in jurisdictions such as the UAE and certain EU member states. These indirect links often trigger scrutiny by sanctions authorities, significantly increasing compliance workloads and stretching institutional resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private sector representatives noted that customer dissatisfaction has become a growing issue. Clients are often unaware of the complexity and time required for comprehensive due diligence processes, which can extend over several days. As a result, there is a noticeable decline in patience among clients whose expectations for rapid processing clash with regulatory obligations. From the financial sector’s perspective, economic interests tend to take precedence over geopolitical concerns for many clients, further complicating efforts to build understanding of and support for sanctions compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants agreed that adapting to the new compliance environment requires sustained investment in technology and training. A representative from UniCredit underlined that implementing robust technological systems typically takes a minimum of three years. Although the regulatory landscape has improved – particularly through clearer designation of competent authorities – challenges remain. Banks emphasised the need for greater information sharing and guidance from public institutions, especially to support smaller actors within the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another persistent issue relates to the unrealistic expectation that banks can implement sanctions immediately upon publication in the Official Journal of the European Union, the bloc’s primary mechanism for publishing sanctions. Participants argued that these lists are often unstructured and difficult to operationalise without delay. This challenge is compounded by the fact that political announcements often precede official listings, creating ambiguity and leaving institutions underprepared. Some participants noted that the departure of the UK from the EU removed a previously relied-upon source of clarity and best practices, which has left a noticeable gap in guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Significant concerns were also raised about the current state of EU-level data infrastructure. Participants specifically highlighted that the Official Journal of the European Union is poorly structured and not easily machine-readable, delaying sanctions implementation. Often, more usable documentation emerges only 20 days after initial listings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A particular concern is the trend towards reduced transparency in beneficial ownership data across the EU. Romania’s own beneficial ownership register was described by workshop participants as underdeveloped and unreliable. Without rigorous validation and monitoring, the register fails to serve its intended purpose as a cornerstone of sanctions enforcement. It was noted that other countries, such as Latvia, are considerably ahead of Romania in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Data Transparency and Due Diligence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In discussions on data transparency and enforcement tools, participants underscored the importance of integrating official business registries with investigative journalism resources and third-party data platforms, such as the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP). Integration between business registries, investigative journalism resources and third-party platforms can aid in improving the identification of beneficial owners, particularly in high-risk or opaque corporate structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative from 45 North emphasised that effective sanctions implementation fundamentally depends on the ability to ascertain who ultimately owns and controls a company. In many cases, ownership structures are deliberately obscured, often masking connections to Russian oligarchs or other sanctioned actors. To address this, the speaker advocated for the development of a robust, transparent and accessible ultimate beneficial ownership (UBO) register that enables both public authorities and private entities to carry out comprehensive due diligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a practical example, the representative explained that many companies routinely incorporate investigative journalism sources – such as OCCRP resources – into its client onboarding processes. These platforms offer critical insights that go beyond what is available in official registries, illustrating the value of open source intelligence and the importance of public–private cooperation in uncovering hidden ownership networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Romanian FIU noted its dual role in both enforcing sanctions and training reporting entities. Institutions are provided with legal provisions and digital tools to identify potential sanctions breaches. While these systems support compliance, FIU officials acknowledged the need for stronger international information-sharing mechanisms, which are essential given the cross-border nature of illicit finance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the onset of the sanctions regime, financial institutions in Romania reported a significant decline in transactions involving Russian clients. During the workshop, representatives from the banking sector noted that the risk appetite for engaging with Russian-linked entities had dramatically decreased. This shift, driven by a strong disincentive to risk exposure, led to a high degree of self-regulation within the sector. Perhaps as a result of this, participants reported that there were very few – if any – sanctions violations or penalties issued in Romania during this initial phase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as sanctions evasion tactics evolved and became more sophisticated, new challenges emerged. A former prosecutor and former FIU official highlighted that Romanian authorities have struggled to keep pace with enforcement demands. Concerns were raised about delays in asset freezes and the lack of timely suspicious transaction reports (STRs), which are critical for detecting and investigating potential violations. The absence of STRs has left authorities effectively blind to illicit financial flows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compounding these concerns, one of the participants pointed to the 45 North publication which reported that from the total number of Russian-linked companies registered in Romania from 1990 to 2023, 57% were registered in the 10 years between 2013 to 2023, after the Crimean annexation, with Russia ranking as the country’s eighth import source in 2022. Without systematic efforts to verify beneficial ownership, many of these connections remain obscured, hampering effective enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The speaker advocated for urgent reforms to Romania’s company registry and enforcement mechanisms, warning that superficial legislative improvements without enforcement would render the system ineffective. By comparison, the speaker attributed Latvia’s success in sanctions enforcement in part to the centrality of its beneficial ownership registry, offering a model for Romania to consider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Academics from the ASE argued that Romania must shift from a checklist-based approach to a more strategic, risk-based sanctions model. While the private sector has increased its resource allocation towards compliance, the state has not kept pace. Public institutions remain under-resourced, lacking the agility to match the growing sophistication of money laundering networks, including alternative payment systems and non-bank financial channels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Decentralised Sanctions System and Risks to Unity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representatives from the MFA acknowledged that while Romania’s sanctions system remains decentralised, efforts have been made to improve coordination through the Chancellery of the Prime Minister, which now oversees interagency cooperation. However, information-sharing forums and coordination mechanisms still face capacity limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private sector representatives raised concerns about broader EU-level cohesion. They emphasised that sanctions enforcement is not only a question of capacity but also political will. If one member state fails to implement EU sanctions consistently, it creates a systemic vulnerability. As one participant put it, “the chain is only as strong as its weakest link”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lack of a national sanctions regime in Romania – contrasted with other EU countries that have adopted one – has led to greater implementation complexity for private actors and has limited Romania’s ability to highlight domestic sanctions evasion concerns to its private sector. Participants also raised the spectre of further political fragmentation, particularly if member states such as Hungary choose to block new EU sanctions packages. In such cases, as a participant representing the private sector noted, the emergence of a “coalition of the willing” might become necessary to sustain meaningful enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, European cooperation also strengthens sanctions implementation in Romania. A representative from Romania’s ANAF reported that asset freezes have increased significantly. The agency collaborates with counterparts in other EU member states to trace and verify beneficial ownership data, sometimes uncovering information absent from Romania’s own registry but available in jurisdictions like Cyprus. The upcoming EU Anti-Money Laundering (AML) package is expected to improve data accessibility across borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;moving-beyond-a-merge-pe-burtă&quot;&gt;Moving Beyond A Merge Pe Burtă&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Romanian expression a merge pe burtă (literally, “to go on one’s belly”) is often used to describe a strategy of survival through discretion – keeping a low profile, avoiding visibility, and not drawing attention to oneself during uncertain or high-risk situations. In the context of sanctions enforcement, it was used during the workshop and sideline conversations to characterise how some actors or institutions may choose to quietly comply or minimally engage, prioritising self-preservation over proactive enforcement or transparency. The phrase suggests a cautious, even evasive, posture in the face of complex regulatory or geopolitical pressures. Participants at the workshop consistently highlighted the absence of a whole-of-society approach to sanctions enforcement in Romania. While government institutions and the banking sector have made measurable efforts to strengthen compliance, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) often remain underinformed or structurally unprepared to meet the same standards. As one participant noted, “even if the state does its job and banks fulfil their obligations, SMEs may still choose to engage with sanctioned entities due to a lack of awareness or incentives”. The current system lacks the capacity to conduct granular, transaction-level checks across these smaller market actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One potential solution identified was the expansion of data-collection capabilities to increase visibility into financial flows and identify high-risk actors. However, participants also cautioned against overreach: enhanced surveillance mechanisms – if poorly communicated or lacking oversight – could face public resistance or even be misused in ways that undermine democratic accountability. For example, concerns were raised about how enforcement mechanisms might operate under political pressure, particularly if the EU were to impose sanctions on countries such as China, where identifying beneficial ownership is especially opaque.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These technical and governance challenges are further compounded by weak public communication. Despite generally pro-European and pro-Ukrainian public sentiment, Romania’s government has maintained a low profile on the issue of sanctions. Workshop participants noted that public messaging remains limited and often reactive, making it easier for populist or anti-European political actors to exploit the narrative and question the relevance or legitimacy of sanctions. Some warned that without effective communication strategies, sanctions risk being perceived not as protective tools of economic and national security, but as externally imposed burdens that harm domestic interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was broad consensus that Romania must engage a wider array of societal stakeholders – including SMEs, journalists, academia and civil society – in building public understanding of sanctions and their objectives, and Romania’s role in supporting EU policy and regional security. This effort should not only inform, but actively involve these actors in implementation and oversight, reinforcing both the transparency and credibility of sanctions policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;insights-from-parliament-political-ambiguity-and-public-disengagement&quot;&gt;Insights from Parliament: Political Ambiguity and Public Disengagement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop discussions were complemented by a meeting with members of the Romanian parliament, which provided additional context on the political and public dimensions of sanctions policy. Several MPs acknowledged that sanctions are rarely a topic of active debate within the legislature. While some Russian-owned companies have drawn scrutiny – particularly in sectors such as aluminium – there has been little sustained pressure for robust national enforcement. Early resistance to sanctions was driven largely by concerns about job losses and economic fallout. Over time, however, discussion around these issues has diminished, and political messaging remains cautious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, anti-European rhetoric has emerged only recently within certain political factions. Before 2022, pro-Russian narratives were largely absent from mainstream politics, and there were no parties openly opposed to sanctions. Today, however, as noted by one member of the parliament, some political actors argue that the economic consequences of supporting Ukraine are too high, reflecting a gradual shift in the public discourse. Romania’s official position on the European stage has also remained relatively muted. As one MP noted, a general stance has been to “quietly support Ukraine” without overt political campaigning or bold public positioning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reluctance is mirrored in the general public’s limited awareness of Romania’s sanctions obligations. As one participant noted, this might be due to a significant institutional confusion and a lack of clear responsibility for sanctions implementation. The participant added that, before December 2024, authorities routinely passed responsibilities from one institution to another, creating a perception that the government was more concerned with appearing compliant than with delivering substantive enforcement. Transparency remained minimal, leaving both the public and private sectors unsure of the actual measures being applied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recurring theme in the parliamentary discussion was the underutilisation of Romania’s beneficial ownership register, which was – reflecting the earlier workshop – described as unreliable and lacking proper oversight. While banks are conducting Know Your Customer checks and screening politically exposed persons (PEPs), the central company registry functions primarily as a procedural database for incorporation, not as a strategic enforcement tool. MPs acknowledged that no agency systematically verifies beneficial ownership data, undermining the register’s role as a pillar of financial transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these gaps, there is strong societal resistance to Russia’s influence, and Romania’s population remains broadly pro-European and pro-American. However, concerns are growing about external interference, including credible reports of Russian meddling in domestic elections. Participants pointed to the Călin Georgescu campaign as a case study in long-term strategic influence operations, underscoring the vulnerability of Romanian democratic processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, questions remain about the sustainability of EU sanctions consensus, especially if member states like Hungary block new measures. As one MP warned, “if unity breaks down, every country will begin negotiating on its own terms”. The prospect of a return to transactional politics – exemplified by speculation that the current US administration could use troop deployments as leverage against European sanctions – was viewed with unease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some participants concluded that the EU itself requires structural reform to preserve unity and coherence. Without it, the risk remains that adversaries like Russia will exploit fragmentation and weaken collective responses. Romania, given its strategic position and vulnerability to influence, may increasingly serve as a testing ground for these dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;finance-as-a-vector-of-national-security-and-electoral-integrity&quot;&gt;Finance as a Vector of National Security and Electoral Integrity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants across both public and private sectors agreed that finance is now inextricably linked to national security. The role of financial systems has expanded beyond traditional concerns of AML and counterterrorism financing, encompassing hybrid threats such as foreign interference, sanctions circumvention and electoral manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representatives from the private sector emphasised that the starting point for effective financial resilience must be local collaboration. Enhanced public–private partnerships, improved UBO transparency, and deeper international cooperation were identified as key pillars. Both organisations stressed the urgency of reinforcing cross-border information sharing, especially in regions vulnerable to illicit finance and influence operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A think tank representative noted the case of Moldova, where hybrid warfare is increasingly underpinned by illicit finance. According to this analysis, Russian influence in Moldova is largely orchestrated through a financial ecosystem centred around a single oligarch. Following Romania’s successful advocacy for an EU–Moldova sanctions regime, new circumvention patterns emerged. Russian actors began shifting funds through non-traditional channels – notably via cyber networks and through Transnistria, a breakaway region where transactions are processed exclusively through Russia’s Mir payment system. Because these transactions never enter the conventional banking sector, they become untraceable. Funds are withdrawn in cash within Transnistria and are then redirected to fuel destabilising activities on the ground. This phenomenon illustrates a broader pattern: while formal financial systems implement sanctions, a parallel creative infrastructure has emerged to circumvent them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conversation then turned to electoral integrity, with multiple speakers highlighting the financial dimensions of political interference. One participant argued that while legal safeguards against electoral meddling are essential, threats constantly evolve, requiring proactive and adaptive strategies. The EU, it was noted, has not responded with the necessary speed and flexibility in this domain. The MFA shared that it had recently launched a forum on public–private collaboration, which had proven valuable in surfacing such threats. The MFA noted that this forum would be repeated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RBA provided concrete evidence of electoral risk exposure, noting that some attempts to redirect funds for the purpose of electoral influence had already been detected. Although banks are mandated to report only suspicious transactions, their internal systems allow them to discern broader patterns in financial flows that may be politically relevant. However, banks face increasing burdens in compliance and monitoring; these burdens can cost millions of euros. Despite this, the responsibility remains largely on the private sector, with insufficient state support for expanding financial monitoring infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on this point, several participants noted a surge in alternative financial channels, particularly through China, alternative payment systems and high-risk jurisdictions such as Venezuela. These platforms, often involving state-linked entities or petrodollar revenues, are significantly more difficult to monitor and regulate. Without enhanced detection mechanisms, these flows represent a growing blind spot in the sanctions and AML architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A RUSI representative argued that mindsets must evolve. Whereas AML efforts were once focused narrowly on criminality, they now sit at the intersection of financial integrity and national security. Accordingly, both private institutions and governments must invest in long-term capability building. “This is not just compliance – it’s strategy”, he observed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workshop participants also highlighted blurred lines between financial and political risks. Not all PEPs are laundering money, but many are entangled in corruption cases or reputational controversies that create institutional risk. Screening clients against sanctions lists is no longer sufficient; onboarding procedures must now incorporate anti-bribery and corruption frameworks alongside traditional AML measures. The EU’s Whistleblower Directive, although adopted with difficulty in Romania, was cited as a positive development. Participants called for stronger implementation: not only within private firms, but also within public institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MFA concluded this segment by noting that recent legislative reforms in Romania provide a foundation for improved implementation and enforcement in the coming year. If effectively operationalised, these changes could enhance resilience across the financial sector and bolster defences against both domestic and transnational threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bucharest workshop highlighted Romania’s adaptation to the evolving European sanctions landscape and in responding to the broader nexus of finance, security and geopolitical threats. As discussions revealed, recent reforms to Romania’s sanctions framework mark a significant step forward by introducing a decentralised model with clearer coordination, spearheaded by the Chancellery of the Prime Minister. However, implementation challenges persist, particularly around inter-agency accountability, resource constraints and the capacity to detect complex patterns of sanctions evasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants noted that Romania’s capacity to track UBO remains limited by persistent data gaps. Strengthening the reliability and use of the national UBO register will be crucial for both enforcement and private sector compliance. Although public–private collaboration is improving, collaboration must be expanded to include SMEs and civil society actors who are not yet fully engaged in the sanctions enforcement ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recurring theme throughout the workshop was the need for a whole-of-society approach. While Romania’s financial institutions are adapting to a more complex risk environment, public communication on sanctions remains underdeveloped. Without a coherent narrative around Romania’s role in supporting EU sanctions and protecting regional security, the risk of public disengagement and populist exploitation increases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Romania’s strategic engagement in promoting the EU–Moldova sanctions regime was cited by participants as constituting a notable success. However, the response from adversarial actors has been equally adaptive, with illicit financial flows increasingly routed through informal networks – including cyber platforms and regional grey zones such as Transnistria – thereby evading formal banking oversight. These developments reinforce the need for vigilance and improved cross-border monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, discussions underscored that Romania must deepen its cooperation with European partners, particularly in addressing regional maritime threats such as Russia’s shadow fleet activity in the Black Sea. Multilateral frameworks like the Joint Expeditionary Force offer a pathway to enhance port security and infrastructure protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agility, coordination, and international partnership will be essential as geopolitical risks continue to evolve. The Bucharest workshop reaffirmed that sanctions policy is not only a matter of compliance; it is a matter of resilience and strategic foresight. Romania’s trajectory, while still unfolding, offers valuable insights into how mid-sized EU states can navigate the complexities of modern financial security while contributing meaningfully to European unity and collective defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deterioration of European security since the start of Russia’s 2022 war on Ukraine has driven the recent strengthening of defence and security cooperation between the UK and Germany. However, the second Trump presidency is arguably more challenging as the primary source of instability is the commander-in-chief of their mutual pre-eminent ally, not the aggression of their principal foe. As the two largest European defence spenders in NATO and the top two European supporters of Ukraine in absolute financial terms, the UK and Germany will have to shoulder far more of the European security burden. They must do this together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 28 August 2024, the prime minister and chancellor announced that a new bilateral cooperation treaty would be negotiated by their respective foreign ministries. On 23 October 2024, the UK and German defence ministers signed the “Trinity House Agreement”, which has established defence cooperation as a key pillar of this new Treaty-based relationship. The Treaty will include several additional policy areas, including foreign policy, justice and law enforcement, economic growth, resilience, science and technology, energy and climate, and the environment. There is broad cross-party support in both countries for the Treaty and it is likely that it will be signed soon after the new German government takes office on 6 May 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Policy Brief examines how the UK and Germany can maximise the new relationship to ensure that it delivers the most value to each of them and to European security. The brief argues that the political desire to broaden the UK–German relationship across multiple policy areas simultaneously poses a risk to delivering on progress made in defence and security cooperation. The rapid deterioration of Euro-Atlantic security as a result of Trump’s early rapprochement with Russia – at the expense of Ukrainian security – will immediately stress-test the new relationship and there will be pressure to deliver immediate value. Consequently, the Treaty must focus on building mutual political commitment and creating effective governance structures, so that the strategic partnership becomes more than the sum of improved cooperation between Whitehall departments and their respective German federal ministries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research for this brief is drawn from two main sources. First, a review of official UK, German, NATO and EU policy documents, alongside expert and media commentaries. Second, an expert-led roundtable discussion – held in London on 25 November 2024 – which was attended by a member of the German Bundestag, academics, and representatives from the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and the German Embassy in London. The brief is supported by Konrad Adenauer Stiftung’s London office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brief is structured in three sections. The first section assesses the intensification of the relationship since the Labour government took office. The second explores the shared political opportunities and risks and the third focuses on developing coherence through strong governance structures. The conclusion identifies the priorities for establishing a value-based relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;defence-and-security-cooperation&quot;&gt;Defence and Security Cooperation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 23 October 2024, the defence ministers of the UK and Germany signed the “Trinity House” defence agreement. Signed just 111 days after the Labour government was elected, the agreement covers strengthening defence industries, reinforcing Euro-Atlantic security, enhancing interoperability, addressing emerging threats, supporting Ukraine, and working together on future “Deep Precision Strike” capabilities. Moreover, the defence agreement created several “lighthouse projects”, including German maritime patrol aircraft operating from RAF Lossiemouth, and established new governance structures to accelerate delivery. Demonstrating the centrality of the defence partnership, a German military planner is currently embedded in the UK Strategic Defence Review team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Claudia Major and Nicolai von Ondarza concluded, it is “politically noteworthy” that “Labour has chosen security and defence as the main angle for their ‘reset’ with European allies and the EU”. Therefore, the significance of Trinity House goes beyond a bilateral defence agreement and should be considered as both a framework and a model for closer UK cooperation with Europe and the EU. However, in the haste to finalise the agreement, two important elements were omitted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, export controls – a previous point of friction – were absent. Joint capability development proposals under Trinity House, especially Deep Precision Strike, will have significant export potential with Ukraine, exposing Russia’s vulnerability to such systems. An agreement on export controls will be crucial for building confidence and maximising the benefits from future joint procurement opportunities. Export controls are not led by the defence ministries in either country and will therefore need more political focus from ministers responsible for trade and industry, requiring greater political trade-offs to gain alignment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, since the agreement was signed, both countries have strengthened their respective defence industries. Germany has published its National Security and Defence Industry Strategy and the UK has announced a new Defence Industrial Strategy to be published in the spring. The UK wants to use defence (as one of eight priority sectors) to pursue growth and prosperity by onshoring a higher proportion of defence industrial capacity, whereas Germany is focusing more on pan-European cooperation. The external situation has also changed, as the US acts more unpredictably and raises concerns in Europe about overdependence on the US and buying American manufactured arms covered by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) in the future. This stands alongside strained transatlantic relations over trade tariffs. As both the UK and Germany buy a significant amount of US equipment, this shift will be a strategic challenge jointly felt by both parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the situation is also an opportunity to strengthen UK–German and European joint procurement, especially as the EU adopts its €800-billion ReArm Europe defence package. Creating closer alignment between UK and German industrial strategies would be a quick win and an effective precursor to UK–EU defence industrial collaboration to hedge against the unpredictability of the US. Moreover, the UK should immediately lobby the new government in Berlin to help gain access to the new EU €150bn rearmament fund ahead of the UK–EU summit on 19 May 2025, where an agreement on defence and security is expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;opportunities-and-risks&quot;&gt;Opportunities and Risks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although defence cooperation is most advanced, economic growth and illegal migration are both higher joint domestic joint political priorities. Keir Starmer has made “economic stability” and “secure borders” (alongside national security) the “foundations” for his “Plan for Change” and mission-led government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Strengthening our relationship with these countries (Germany and France) is crucial, not only in tackling the global problem of illegal migration, but also in boosting economic growth across the continent and crucially in the UK – one of the key missions of my government,” he said during the announcement of the bilateral treaty negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The political imperative to boost mutual economic growth is stark. Germany is the UK’s second-largest trading partner, accounting for 8.5% of UK trade. The German government has struggled to pass federal budgets, limited by the “debt brake”, leading to a loss of confidence in economic stability and responsibility – a traditional German strength – and also leading to calls for major fiscal and economic reform to stimulate growth. The fiscal necessity has already driven significant reform ahead of the new government taking office as, on 18 March 2025, the Bundestag voted to exempt defence spending from Germany’s strict debt rules and create a €500-billion infrastructure fund. Simultaneous political deadlock in France has slowed the Franco-German economic and integration motor at the heart of the EU, with confidence in the traditional leaders diminishing. Furthermore, the economic outlook could worsen as a looming tariff and trade war between the US and China will also negatively impact the EU. Starmer has already rejected making a binary choice between closer ties with the EU or US, but that was before Trump’s imposition of global tariffs and the leaked Signal discussion between key national security members of the US administration that made their feelings towards Europe well known. In this more challenging situation, closer alignment with key economic players in Europe will benefit the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, immigration is high on the political agenda. It is also a clear area of cooperation, as the governing parties are challenged by anti-migration parties. However, neither are priority partners for addressing illegal immigration: with the UK prioritising working with France, and Germany addressing southern migration with Italy and Greece. Therefore, explicitly highlighting closer working could create unrealistic expectations of delivery. In the UK, Reform has gained 12 percentage points as of March 2025, since the 2024 general election, putting them ahead of Labour for the first time. Meanwhile, the Alternative for Deutschland (AfD) – which based its electoral campaign on immigration rhetoric – became the second-largest parliamentary group after securing 20.8% in the federal election. Both the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the AfD took strong anti-immigration stances which clearly contributed to their electoral success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 10 December 2024, the UK Home Office and the German Federal Ministry of the Interior and Community set out a “Joint Action Plan on Irregular Migration” agreement to target small boat crossings. The plan commits Germany to clarifying its law to make it a specific criminal offence to facilitate the smuggling of migrants – many boats are procured in Germany – and aims to make it harder to cross the English Channel. Moreover, it welcomes more involvement from Europol, which will likely feature prominently in a future UK–EU security deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economic growth and immigration control can be domestically politically volatile. Public disagreements between the UK and German governments on immigration could easily derail greater cooperation on defence and security, or wider UK–EU cooperation, as difficulties in one policy area could easily impact the other. This makes insulating defence and security from the political weather more important. Finally, each government might also find it difficult to directly attribute successes on growth and migration to these agreements. To mitigate these risks, the UK and Germany should design effective governance structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;creating-coherence-through-effective-governance&quot;&gt;Creating Coherence Through Effective Governance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expanding the policy areas for a Treaty to manage risks the UK–German relationship becoming imprecise and unwieldy, which only achieves better department-to-ministry cooperation but fails to deliver a coherent strategic partnership. Adding additional policy areas means that cooperation could touch as many as 13 of the 34 UK ministerial departments and 10 of 15 German federal ministries (including the Office of the Prime Minister and the Federal Ministry of the Chancellery) and more non-ministerial departments, agencies and public bodies. The UK and Germany should learn from their 2021 Joint Declaration, which covered a vast range of policy areas and global regions, and was too unwieldy for the foreign secretaries to deliver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designing and implementing an effective governance structure could mitigate this risk and is an opportunity to consolidate and streamline legacy arrangements. This governance structure should focus on three key objectives: maximising political direction and buy-in, reducing duplication and intensifying integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the structure should maximise political direction and buy-in. The prime minister and chancellor must be directly involved to ensure high-level political attention, to maintain momentum, to hold ministers to account and ensure delivery of the full agenda, through regular consultations and joint Cabinet meetings. While Trinity House – both the agreement and the speed at which it was signed – was a Labour-SPD social democratic deal, it is important that better political linkages are now made with Labour and the CDU. To build cross-party consensus, parliamentary dialogues should increase and move away from organising on party political lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the structure should reduce duplication. Ministerial diaries are already too demanding, and more bilateral minister-to-minister interactions within each policy area could become cumbersome. Instead, it would be beneficial to open the extant strategic dialogue between foreign ministers (established in the 2021 Joint Declaration) to also include defence and home secretaries, to have a more comprehensive security focus. Opening dialogues between foreign, defence and home secretaries would enable greater political interest, accountability and the ability to develop integrated policy responses to complex security challenges. However, the substance of the discussions must make these more substantial dialogues worthy of ministers’ time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the structure should intensify UK–Germany integration. Both the UK and Germany operate an integrated approach to security and some functional areas – for example, intelligence cooperation – sit across multiple ministerial departments. The range of conventional and hybrid threats both countries face, from foreign election interference to incendiary DHL Parcels, and Russian military aggression against the Baltics (where the UK and Germany lead NATO’s Forward Land Forces), requires greater integration across departments and their associated agencies. The new CDU Chancellor Friedrich Merz wants to revisit the establishment of a German National Security Council (NSC) within the Chancellery after the previous coalition was unable to agree on such a machinery of government change. Creating a German NSC would establish a new and important link between UK and German national security advisers, which could foster greater integrated intelligence cooperation. Intelligence cooperation is currently underused – it was not covered in Trinity House – and falls between the seams of foreign, defence and security policy. Moreover, the UK has operated a NSC for 15 years, which has undertaken multiple reforms to remain valuable and can offer advice to Germany on establishing the office (given previous difficulties in agreeing how it would operate and where it would best be housed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Externally, the new bilateral Treaty will impact other European relationships, which will need managing, and which are working in overdrive since Trump’s re-election. These include the E3 (the UK, Germany and France), the Weimar Triangle (Germany, France and Poland), the “Weimar Plus” (Poland, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the UK and the EU’s High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy) and the newer E5 format (the UK, Germany, France, Poland and Italy). Within this system there is too much duplication, and each meeting must add value in a fast-paced environment. The UK and Germany are common denominators in many of these formats and by working together and harnessing the momentum of the bilateral they could level up these formats and revitalise them. As European defence and security leaders, they should combine their influence to prioritise and focus energy into progressing policy within one strong group. Bringing the E3 together with the Weimar Triangle would develop the strongest new European quad of powers, which could jointly lead in the absence of the US on European security and bridge NATO and the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stronger government-to-government relationships should be reinforced by sharpening non-governmental structures which advocate for closer ties across foreign policy, economics, education, cultural exchanges and youth groups. Some groups are specifically referenced by the 2021 Joint Declaration as “key fora for outreach and feedback, and an opportunity to maintain a strong and close relationship”. Therefore, there is no need to establish new structures. Rather, more impetus should be placed into breathing new life into the existing ones. As examples, the annual Königswinter Conference, and its Defence counterpart, have been operating yearly since 1950 and 2010, respectively, and the British-German Association since 1951. Multiple attendees have expressed a view that these groups have become stale, procedural and have not kept pace with changes in policy. These groups should be reinvigorated, through revitalising the attendees, securing fresh partnerships, and inviting them to establish working groups which match the areas for further UK–German policy development. Moreover, German Stiftungen (political foundations) are a key advocacy group for closer cooperation and should be allowed to operate on a more substantial footing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;establishing-a-treaty-based-relationship&quot;&gt;Establishing a Treaty-Based Relationship&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2021 Joint Declaration was an important starting point for rapprochement after Brexit, but it was not legally binding. Therefore, the Treaty has the opportunity to develop stronger political buy-in and form a joint agenda on strengthening European security. Merz reportedly has an affinity with the UK and his campaign commitments and public announcements align closely with UK defence and security objectives. There are three priorities to seek alignment on: creating a strong leadership bond and mutual leadership positions in NATO; sustaining Ukraine’s defence; and elaborating a unified European position on China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, UK and German objectives within NATO align closely as committed Atlanticists and they will be particularly vulnerable to significant US changes in policy towards Europe. The UK and Germany will need to fundamentally re-evaluate their defence and security approaches and doctrines, which have been developed over decades. Therefore, the Treaty must hedge against this and create a strong leadership bond at the heart of NATO that can best address the threat posed by Russia. Increasing their mutual leadership positions in NATO could also help to keep NATO in as close to its current form as possible, in the face of changing US policy towards the Alliance, which is a joint strategic interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The June 2025 Hague Summit is the most immediate challenge. As the top two European defence spenders, creating a harmonious position will be critical, especially as Germany is the target of Trump’s frustrations with European allies – despite currently being the second-highest spender in NATO, after decades of underspending relative to its economic size (and with questions remaining about the sustainability of its defence spending increase). Trump wants Europeans to spend 5% of GDP on defence. While such a figure is unrealistic, it creates certain US expectations. Pre-empting the debate, in his first major speech the new NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said “to prevent war, NATO must spend more” and believes the NATO target should be raised from 2% to 3%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, sustaining Ukraine’s defence should be a priority. As an immediate win, Merz has personally committed to supplying Ukraine with long-range Taurus missiles – which Chancellor Scholz has repeatedly refused to do – and will likely seek US and French support. Delivering such a system to Ukraine would bring Germany in line with the UK, France and the US in the provision of long-range strike assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more immediate and risky challenge is the potential deployment of European reassurance forces in Ukraine to secure any negotiated ceasefire. Thus far, the UK and France have taken the lead in assembling a potential 30-strong coalition of the willing that could deploy to Ukraine in the right circumstances. German officials have also worked with their UK and French counterparts to help the US and Ukraine reach a ceasefire deal which can be presented to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This presents both a dilemma and opportunity for the new German government. Chancellor Scholz had ruled it out, only for his foreign minister to suggest it might be necessary. Therefore, Germany might be pressured into an early decision on the deployment of German troops outside NATO borders, which has traditionally been politically sensitive, and must be supported by both the UK and France. However, it would also be an opportunity to show that Germany is ready to step up and lead on European security and that the Zeitenwende is not just about more money for the Bundeswehr, but also a mindset change in the deployment and employment of military force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, Trump is expected to focus on China, making it more important for a unified European position. Last year, the German government published a Strategy on China which states that “China is simultaneously a partner, competitor and systemic rival for the Federal Government. Our Strategy on China is firmly rooted in the common policy on China of the EU”. Derisking and diversification rather than economic decoupling became the policy, but with derisking left as an individual business decision, rather than a Federal diktat. The UK government is currently undertaking a “China audit”. The 2023 Integrated Review Refresh defined China as an “epoch-defining and systemic challenge”. The extant “3Cs” China policy approach of “compete, challenge, and cooperate” is similar to the simultaneous and overlapping German positions. Moreover, the new UK government has already changed its approach to get closer to China on trade, which is also closer to the current German position. As both governments seek to balance trade and security in their individual and collective approaches to China, cooperation is important. Furthermore, while these policies are being developed, external factors will also shape what is possible – NATO explicitly called out China as a “decisive enabler of Russia’s war against Ukraine through its so-called ‘no limits’ partnership” at the NATO 2024 Washington Summit. Trump is also likely to apply pressure to allies who strengthen their economic links with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Treaty will elevate the relationship and will be binding under law – going beyond the Trinity House Agreement. But the Treaty itself will not deliver the value required. Rather, the mutual political buy-in to the relationship, along with the shared challenges that the UK and Germany will face in the future, will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-maximising-the-new-relationship&quot;&gt;Conclusion: Maximising the New Relationship&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK–German bilateral relationship will be maximised in the context of the broader UK–EU relationship. The Labour government has stated that “The new UK-Germany treaty will be a key pillar of the UK’s wider reset with Europe”. Some analysts have calculated that a successful “reset” with the EU could raise UK GDP by 0.3–0.7% and the German relationship will be integral to achieving this. However, Brussels is likely to want movement on fisheries and a youth mobility scheme in return for a defence and security deal. Through improving relations with Germany – a central EU power – the UK has put itself in a stronger negotiating position. However, the UK must be realistic and accept that while this might support future negotiations with the EU, it will be no panacea, and these negotiations are likely to be challenging and could strain growing UK–German cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK and Germany – individually and collectively – will be severely impacted by external shocks across most policy areas. Both also have growing internal challenges. The new UK government is already realising how difficult it is to govern, even with a large majority. The new German government might not have the strength to lead Europe and will need to rely on partnerships with other countries. Domestic political considerations on the economy and immigration, coupled with the challenge of populist parties, will take priority, even as international security problems mount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With reduced US leadership in Europe, no one country can fill the vacuum. However, a group of leading European countries – including the UK and Germany – can mitigate this to a certain degree and keep European security together in something close to its current form. By increasing bilateral partnerships, the UK and Germany can be in the best position to shape the future to their advantage and set UK–EU relations on the right path. Here, the real value is less about what is written within the various agreements and communiqués that govern the partnership, but rather how they are used, developed and driven by political leaders on both sides, regardless of the parties to which they belong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For over a century, military professionals have treated operational fires as the backbone of modern campaigns—shaping the battlefield, degrading enemy formations, and setting the conditions for maneuver. But what happens when that logic breaks down? What if long-range strikes become less about shaping operations and more about shaping narratives—used not to support a ground advance but to terrorize civilians and coerce political outcomes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is the story emerging from Russia’s war in Ukraine. Despite inheriting a military doctrine steeped in deep battle, reconnaissance-strike complexes, and precision noncontact warfare, Russia has consistently failed to employ operational fires in a way that reflects this legacy. Instead, firepower has become unmoored from maneuver. Russian missile salvos and loitering drone attacks increasingly appear to serve a punitive, strategic coercion logic rather than a campaign to dislocate Ukrainian defenses or synchronize effects across domains. Chaos reigns along an extended front line defined by human wave attacks, thousands of small first-person view (FPV) drones, and artillery fire vectored by strike and reconnaissance unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing on an original dataset compiled by a Ukrainian researcher, the CSIS Futures Lab wrangled, cleaned, transformed, and augmented the raw data to use for analysis. This analysis critically evaluates the alleged disconnect between Russian operational fires and battlefield intensity. Using daily estimates of Russian personnel losses as a proxy for combat tempo, the Futures Lab analyzed their relationship with three types of firepower activity—(1) ballistic and cruise missile salvos, (2) strike and reconnaissance UAVs, and (3) Shahed drone attacks—to test whether Moscow was using fires to set conditions for ground advances. The findings are striking:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is no statistically significant relationship between Russian cruise and ballistic missile strikes and increased battlefield intensity three days later.&lt;/strong&gt; In fact, the data shows the opposite: Larger missile salvos are associated with lower Russian personnel losses—suggesting that fires are either poorly targeted or employed for reasons unrelated to frontline outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reconnaissance and strike UAV activity, on the other hand, is strongly associated with battlefield intensity&lt;/strong&gt;, supporting the idea that the security zone remains an active and lethal domain of modern war—a space where human-machine teams fight for information and survival.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, Russia’s widespread use of Shahed drones appears associated with rising battlefield intensity.&lt;/strong&gt; Our model shows an increase in Russian personnel loss but this is likely a spurious effect explained not by operational integration of firepower in fighting but likely by material constraints—such as shortages of precision-guided munitions—and a shift toward a desperate strategy focused on punishment rather than achieving tactical breakthroughs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together, these findings point to a dangerous evolution in modern war: the rise of coercive fires unlinked from operational design and increasingly aimed at civilian populations. The war in Ukraine is not just a land campaign—it is an algorithmic war of attrition, fought with drone swarms and missile salvos designed as much to terrorize as to degrade military capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To meet this challenge, four policy recommendations emerge:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sustain and expand air defense support for Ukraine, including both kinetic interceptors and enhanced intelligence sharing to reduce sensor-to-shooter timelines.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Disrupt the global supply chains enabling Russia’s long-range firepower, especially dual-use components from Iran, North Korea, and China.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reimagine NATO’s concept of operational fires, integrating lessons from Ukraine into new doctrines that reflect dynamic targeting in the security zone and that leverage human-machine teaming.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Develop a counter-coercion playbook, preparing allied societies for an era of low-cost strategic strike campaigns designed to break will, not win battles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s failure to employ fires operationally should not invite complacency—it should serve as a warning. The tools of war are evolving faster than the doctrines that guide them. It is time the United States caught up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;operational-fires-in-historical-perspective&quot;&gt;Operational Fires in Historical Perspective&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In military doctrine, fires traditionally support maneuver: Armies use everything from artillery fire to long-range ballistic and cruise missile strikes to set conditions for ground forces to close with the enemy. In modern war, this concept of fire in support of maneuver extends to multiple domains and includes everything from space-based sensing to cyber and electronic attacks alongside a mix of aerial interdiction and close air support. According to U.S. joint doctrine, fires “assist air, land, maritime, space, cyberspace, and special operations forces to move, maneuver, and control territory, airspace, space, cyberspace, the electromagnetic spectrum, and key waters and to influence populations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this framework, longer-range weapons systems like ballistic and cruise missiles set conditions at higher echelons, usually associated with divisions and corps. The intent is to strike deep targets linked to command and control (C2), key logistics nodes (e.g., fuel and ammunition), and troop concentrations, often up to 72 hours prior to attacks along the front, and coordinate these activities with planned close and rear military operations. These shaping fires are designed to degrade the enemy’s ability to generate combat power. The result is that the targeted enemy force struggles to coordinate (i.e., principle of mass) at the right time and place while also stumbling to conduct counterattacks (i.e., principles of objective and maneuver).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This concept has extended across different military organizations since the advent of longer-range artillery and aviation fires in the early twentieth century. Furthermore, some militaries—especially the Soviet and now Russian formations—are built to be fire-centric and place a higher premium on killing with fires than closing with the enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In World War I, Russian military planners relied on related concepts like deep operations—a set of coordinated, long-range actions designed to shape where and how the enemy can respond, often by diverting, disrupting, delaying, or destroying key forces—as a solution to countering the firepower-intensive fronts of integrated trenches in World War I. That concept extended into the Soviet and even post-Soviet period, in which the integration of precision strike capabilities led to the rise of a reconnaissance-strike complex and noncontact warfare. In Russian military doctrine, the reconnaissance-strike complex refers to the “coordinated employment of high-precision, long-range weapons linked to real-time intelligence data and precise targeting provided to a fused intelligence and fire-direction center.” In turn, noncontact warfare is a Russian military concept describing battle waged by long-range precision fires. In both, the combination of depth and precision combine to hold the enemy at risk and set conditions for major operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;operational-disconnect-in-ukraine&quot;&gt;Operational Disconnect in Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this mix of enduring practice and strategic culture, one would expect to see operational fires playing a critical role in the war in Ukraine. Yet, a mix of battlefield anecdotes and statistical observations suggest the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia used operational fires only for a short, intensive window to open its invasion. In all likelihood, Moscow was targeting preregistered (i.e., fixed) installations designed to blind Kyiv but preserve the critical infrastructure needed for an occupation. Of note, this opening salvo included a large-scale cyberattack against Viasat designed to limit Ukrainian satellite communications. In addition, Russian planners appear in hindsight to have suffered from overconfidence, limiting their firepower strike campaign because they assessed the war would last days, not years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statistical observations reveal a more enduring disconnect between operational fires and ground combat that extends beyond the flawed military planning of the opening days of the war. The Futures Lab leveraged a mix of data from Ukraine on daily battlefield casualty estimates and firepower strikes. Firepower strikes reflect the mix of cruise and ballistic missiles alongside reconnaissance and strike UAVs and one-way attack drones like Shaheds that Russia uses to bombard Ukrainian cities daily. These attacks can be further divided between weapons systems associated with operational fires (e.g., cruise and ballistic missiles), daily tactical activity (e.g., intelligence and strike drones used along the front line), and more strategic weapons used to terrorize the population and pressure political leaders (e.g., Shaheds launched in daily salvos largely against nonmilitary targets).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1: Daily Firepower Strikes in UkraineFebruary 24, 2022–April 4, 2025.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Results tabulated by the CSIS Futures Lab. The data is compiled by https://github.com/PetroIvaniuk. The raw dataset is available at Kaggle. CSIS has verified that the data aligns with the official numbers published by the Ukrainian Air Force.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the start of the Russia-Ukraine War on February 24, 2022, an average of 10.64 cruise and ballistic missiles have been launched per day, with a median of 3 and a maximum of 127 in a single day. The use of other intelligence and strike UAVs (non-Shahed drones) is significantly lower, averaging about 2 per day with a daily max of 17, with some days seeing no launches at all. These lower levels reflect that these assets—likely larger drones used to support artillery fires, collect intelligence, and strike point targets—fly at higher altitudes than quadcopters and FPV drones. In contrast, Shahed long-range loitering UAVs are deployed in much greater numbers, with a daily average of 39.29, a median of 20, and a peak of 321 in one day. As stated previously, Russia appears to be using these systems following a strategic coercive logic of punishment designed to pressure Ukraine’s political leaders by holding the population at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closer examination also reveals interesting patterns that suggest Russia is not employing operational fires in the war in Ukraine. Rather, fires appear more dynamic and tethered to shifting conditions along the front line, indicative of a suboptimal attritional approach to joint fires and a separate strategic campaign of terror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Futures Lab evaluated Russia’s use of operational fires by introducing a time-lagged variable to capture delayed effects on battlefield intensity. If Moscow employed operational fires to set conditions for its ground campaign, one would expect to observe a positive relationship between increases in operational fires and increased intensity along the front line three days (i.e., 72 hours) later. This hypothesis suggests the type of sequence accounted for in doctrine, in which longer-range operational fires hit C2 and logistics targets in depth to set conditions for sequenced tactical actions along the front line. This sequencing of battles and effects is the essence of modern operational art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To measure combat intensity, the Futures Lab used official estimates of daily Russian causalities. These losses included soldiers who were killed in action or wounded. One would expect that major offensive pushes against fixed, fortified front lines like those seen in Ukraine would be accompanied by higher casualty levels. This assumption creates the logic of the dependent variable (i.e., daily Russian personnel losses).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To measure firepower strikes, the Futures Lab adapted its firepower strike tracker data, separating and recoding categories and weapons into three groups: operational firepower strikes (i.e., cruise and ballistic missiles); security zone drone activity associated with the reconnaissance/counter-reconnaissance fight (i.e., reconnaissance and strike UAVs, often Group 3 or above); and Shaheds (i.e., long-range, one-way attack drones). If Moscow is employing its operational fires, one would expect to see a 72-hour lag between increased operational firepower strikes (i.e., ballistic and cruise missiles) and increased intensity along the front line. For additional details, including regression formulas and a breakdown of variables and limitations, see the appendix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As seen in Model I from Table 2, there is no statistically significant relationship between operational firepower strikes using cruise and ballistic missiles and combat intensity three days (i.e., 72 hours later). In fact, the coefficient (-0.333) is negative and in the opposite direction than expected, implying that increases in ballistic and cruise missiles are associated with decreased Russian personnel losses three days later. This indicates that for each additional missile launched, daily Russian personnel losses are estimated to decrease by 0.333 three days later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OBVqkXK.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 2: Regression Models to Estimate Russian Personnel Loss.&lt;/strong&gt; Operational Firepower Strike contains the daily three-day lagged numbers of ballistic and cruise missiles reported launched. Other Recon/Strike UAV (Same Day) refers to the amounts of non-Shahed UAV drones reported launched. Shaheds (Same Day) refers to the numbers of Shahed UAV dones reported launched. Lastly, reverse causality was tested, and researchers did not find a statistically significant association of personnel loss driving operational firepower strikes, rather the relationships were negative. See appendix for Table 2’s model formulas.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To further test this relationship, the Futures Lab created a second and binary variable—large salvos—that only measured when a day’s combined cruise and ballistic missile strikes were over the first standard deviation. This measure acts as a robustness check but ends up yielding the same results. When analyzing operational firepower strikes above the first standard deviation, the model predicts an expected decrease in Russian daily personnel losses three days later. The negative coefficient runs counter to expectations. Specifically, days characterized by a large missile salvo (i.e., more than one standard deviation above the mean, approximately 20 missiles) are associated with a statistically significant decrease in battlefield intensity three days later, corresponding to approximately 212 fewer Russian personnel losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This implies that large salvos are not associated with an increase in the proxy measure of battlefield intensity. The negative relationship holds but loses statistical significance when controlling for other strike and reconnaissance UAVs (Model II) and Shaheds (Model III). An alternative explanation could be that the attacks are so effective that they act as a substitute for Russian use of ground forces—saving the equivalent of two infantry companies. However, this hypothesis is not supported by battlefield accounts of Russia’s continued use of human wave attacks and operational approach of constantly pressuring key sectors along the front to gain territory. These operational patterns are not captured in the model and are instead absorbed into the error term, as indicated by the models’ generally low explanatory power, apart from some improvement in Model III. Additional threats that affect and limit inference are discussed in the appendix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another finding from Model II in Table 2 is that there is a positive relationship between strike and reconnaissance UAVs intercepted and increased combat intensity on the same day. Each additional reconnaissance or strike UAV launched on the same day is associated with an increase of approximately 13 daily Russian personnel losses, and the result is statistically significant. This finding is consistent with the concept of a security zone fight, where smaller, mobile units—modern skirmishers, including UAVs—carry out a reconnaissance and counter-reconnaissance fight in front of any formation. Their struggle is a fight for information, with each side trying to blind the other so they can gain an advantage and preserve combat power. In legacy Russian and Soviet doctrine, the security zone extends between 15 and 50 kilometers in front of the main line of troops. As a result, the positive relationship makes sense, as one would expect to see increased losses of UAVs along the front associated with increased battlefield intensity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, Model III in Table 2 also shows that coercive, counter-value weapons linked to punishment strategies like the Shahed are associated with increased battlefield intensity. For each additional Shahed drone launched, Russian personnel losses increase by approximately three soldiers per day. The results are statistically significant. Here, the findings are likely spurious. The confounding factor at play is how Russia has had to adapt its warfighting strategy to material constraints and political imperatives to end the war. Both casualty levels and Shahed strikes have been increasing over time as a result of material losses and difficulty generating cruise and ballistic missiles at the same rate as low-cost one-way attack drones. In other words, Russia’s strategy by default explains the increase in both battlefield intensity and Shahed strikes in Ukrainian cities. Russia is desperately trying to break Ukrainian front lines and the will of its people to end the war on favorable terms. The result is daily human wave attacks and air raid sirens across Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-recommendations&quot;&gt;Policy Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analyzing battlefield data from Ukraine provides insights into policy options for countering Russia and strengthening NATO. In particular, four recommendations emerge:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sustain and expand air defense support for Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The United States and Europe should continue providing Ukraine with integrated air defense systems, combining interceptors with layered sensor networks and intelligence-sharing arrangements. This includes expanding counter-UAV capabilities and deploying mobile systems to protect critical infrastructure and civilian populations. If the United States reduces its footprint due to domestic political constraints, Europe must lean forward. Russia’s campaign of strategic punishment—manifested through relentless Shahed drone and missile attacks on cities—is unlikely to abate. Supporting Ukraine’s ability to defend its skies is both a moral imperative and a strategic necessity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Disrupt the global supply chains enabling Russia’s war machine.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The sheer volume of missiles and drones launched daily by Russia suggests a failure in existing sanctions regimes. Washington and Brussels must go beyond traditional sanctions and pursue targeted technology denial strategies. This includes cracking down on the transfer of dual-use technologies and components—especially microelectronics and drone parts—from Iran, North Korea, and China. These actors are now vital cogs in a distributed arsenal supplying Russia with the means to sustain its long-range fire campaigns. Export enforcement teams should be embedded with intelligence services to map and dismantle these networks in real time. This effort must also extend to third-party cutouts and shell companies acting as proxies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reimagine operational fires and human-machine integration for NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Ukraine war reveals that legacy doctrine linking fires to maneuver may be insufficient in modern war. NATO must invest in new operational concepts that reflect the evolving character of fires—where intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) drones, loitering munitions, and long-range strikes are used to shape battlefields, but in a manner that supports both operational maneuver and more dynamic targeting in the security zone. This reimagining should include red teaming adversary use of coercive fires, as seen in Russian strikes on civilian targets, and testing new fires—human-machine integration (HMI) constructs that blend machine reconnaissance, networked kill chains, and AI-enabled decision cycles. The security zone fight of the future will be a contest between drone swarms, decoys, jammers, and algorithmic kill webs. NATO must ensure it dominates this battlespace.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Build a counter-coercion playbook for strategic strike campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Russia’s daily use of Shahed drones points to the resurgence of an old form of warfare: punishment. Future adversaries—state or nonstate—will increasingly use low-cost, long-range systems to hold civilian infrastructure at risk and manipulate domestic political will. NATO should prepare now by developing counter-coercion strategies that include hardening infrastructure, distributing critical services, integrating national warning systems, and creating escalation management protocols. Strategic messaging must be part of the defense plan, helping shape public resilience under sustained aerial and psychological assault.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s war in Ukraine is not just a throwback to World War I trench warfare and Soviet deep battle—it is a live demonstration of how authoritarian regimes adapt old ideas to new technologies. Instead of using fires to support maneuver, Moscow uses them to punish civilians, shape perceptions, and degrade morale. This is a war of attrition by algorithm, where drone salvos replace doctrine and coercion substitutes for combined arms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and its partners cannot afford to watch this play out from the sidelines. Support for Ukraine is more than a moral cause—it is a strategic laboratory. Every Shahed intercepted, every sensor spoofed, every Russian tactic studied gives NATO an edge in tomorrow’s conflicts. But only if the United States and its allies act—fast, forward, and together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a1-challenges-in-making-inferences&quot;&gt;A1: Challenges in Making Inferences&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before drawing conclusions from the available data, several threats to inference must be acknowledged:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Changes in Russian Offensive Capabilities&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The analysis assumes relative consistency in Russia’s offensive capabilities over the study period. The analysis does not codify periods of offensives or counter-offensives. In addition, significant changes—such as shifts in procurement, production rates, technological upgrades, sanctions, or personnel—could confound the relationship between operational fire strikes and daily personnel losses. This dynamic is noted in the main analysis, where battlefield tactics like human wave assaults are assumed to contribute to unexplained variance captured in the error term.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Weather and Environmental Factors&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Weather conditions may influence the decision to launch missile salvos or initiate shaping operations. For instance, cloud cover and poor visibility can reduce the effectiveness of drone strikes and affect interception rates, thereby introducing variation in the timing and effectiveness of firepower employment not captured in the model.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Data Source Limitations&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The personnel loss estimates and firepower strike counts are drawn from official Ukrainian reports. In the context of ongoing conflict, reporting may be influenced by strategic communications objectives. Consequently, any inferences made from the data are contingent upon the accuracy, completeness, and potential biases inherent in these publicly available sources.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a2-multivariate-regression-models&quot;&gt;A2: Multivariate Regression Models&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Futures Lab designed three models defined below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian Personnel Loss = β0 + β1 (Operational Firepower Strikes) + β2 (Large Salvo) + ϵ&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian Personnel Loss = β0 + β1 (Operational Firepower Strikes) + β2 (Large Salvo) + β3 (Other Recon,Strike UAV) + ϵ&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian Personnel Loss = β0 + β1 (Operational Firepower Strikes) + β2 (Large Salvo) + β3 (Other Recon,Strike UAV) + β4 (Shahed) + ϵ&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these models, Russian Personnel Loss (denoted as our Ŷ ) is the dependent variable, measuring daily Russian casualties, including those killed or wounded; Operational Firepower Strikes represents the number of cruise and ballistic missiles launched but lagged by 72 hours to capture delayed battlefield effects; Large Salvo is a binary indicator equal to 1 if the daily number of missile launches exceeds one standard deviation above the mean (approximately 20 missiles), and 0 otherwise; Other Recon/Strike UAV captures the number of non-Shahed reconnaissance and strike UAVs launched on the same day; Shaheds refers to the number of Shahed one-way attack drones launched on the same day; and ϵ denotes the model’s error term, capturing unobserved factors affecting daily personnel losses.&lt;/p&gt;

This potential 40% of Russia’s ammunition has prolonged the war to a certain extent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysis conducted by the Open Source Centre (OSC), in conjunction with Reuters, and published on 15 April 2025 indicates that as many as 5.2 million rounds of 152 mm and 122 mm ammunition may have been supplied to Russia by North Korea since August 2023. This commentary will assess the extent of this contribution by estimating Russia’s total artillery expenditure since deliveries began in 2023 and examine how North Korean deliveries have surged to support Russia’s own offensives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shell-hunger&quot;&gt;Shell Hunger&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August 2023 Ukraine’s long-awaited counter-offensive was under way, Russian units were prepared and waiting behind dense minefields, armed with anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs), loitering munitions, and supported by large groupings of artillery and attack helicopters. This defensive posture proved too lethal for Ukraine’s brigades and the counteroffensive failed to secure any meaningful territorial gains, although it did bring Russia’s own offensive to a temporary halt. The Russian lines had held despite many deficiencies at that time. Amongst many challenges, the Russians lacked artillery ammunition after firing millions themselves, and Ukraine destroying thousands more through long-range strikes. This had constrained Russia’s artillery consumption with the result that ammunition and guns had to be concentrated in priority areas, leaving other areas of the frontline under-resourced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s defence industry was expanding to address this need, but at that stage of the war, it could not do anything quickly to properly resource the units on the frontline. The answer to this dilemma soon became clear. President Putin had met with Kim Jong Un in July 2023, and satellite imagery analysed by RUSI from mid-August showed the start of regular shipments between Russia’s Dunai military facility on the coast of the Sea of Japan, and Rajin Port in North Korea. Simultaneously, the 719th Artillery Ammunition facility close to Tikhoretsk underwent a dramatic expansion with new berms added for large quantities of ammunition. This would become the end location for millions of rounds of North Korean artillery ammunition, which have helped keep Russia’s forces in the war. Those new berms were filling up by the time that Ukraine’s offensive came to an end in November 2023, and the war entered a new phase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both sides have since faced a shell hunger that has shaped the war significantly. Russia quickly emptied some of its pre-war stores, and eventually had to adapt the way it used artillery, leading to a greater focus on guided and loitering munitions. However, Russian units have come to depend upon deliveries of North Korean ammunition, which may constitute as much as 40% of the 14 million rounds fired since August 2023. It is clear that without North Korean support, Russia’s shell hunger would have been far worse, which means that North Korea’s illicit activities may have extended the war, or even prevented Ukraine from achieving greater success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The OSC analysis used modelling and satellite imagery to estimate the number of 122 mm and 152 mm rounds that the identified Russian tankers could carry per journey. They were able to count and monitor 64 journeys by four vessels between Rajin and Russia’s Dunay and Vostochny ports since September 2023. It is estimated that these journeys delivered a minimum of 15,800 standard shipping containers. By modelling the size of Russian ammunition crates against the internal dimensions of ISO containers, the OSC arrived at a figure between 4.2 and 5.8 million munitions, including 122 mm and 152 mm artillery shells and 122 mm rockets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With 4 October 2023 as a start date - to allow for the transit of North Korean ammunition to the front - and 18 April 2025 as an end date, the OSC analysis indicates that North Korea may have supplied enough ammunition for Russian units to fire 7,400 rounds per day. It is also possible to assess these figures against the totality of Russian ammunition expenditure since August 2023; table 1 below summarises publicly reported daily expenditure figures. Using these figures arranged against the available time period, it is possible to estimate the number of rounds that Russia has fired since North Korean deliveries started. This will obviously be an approximate figure, but it provides a metric against which to assess the relative impact of North Korean support to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Y1zyvYe.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Reported Russian ammunition expenditure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This incomplete estimate indicates that North Korea has supplied between 29% and 40% (based on 4.2 and 5.8 million rounds respectively) of the total number of rounds that Russia has fired since deliveries began in 2023. These numbers do not allow for Ukraine’s strikes against Russia’s arsenals in September 2024, which destroyed large quantities of North Korean ammunition, leading to a temporary drop in rounds fired. For example, the strike on Tikhoretsk destroyed a train carrying an estimated 2,000 tons of ammunition, which could represent 24,000 152 mm rounds. There is no way of knowing how many rounds the Ukrainians managed to destroy, but it is unlikely that they have dramatically altered the overall picture given the scale of deliveries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If North Korea had not supplied any ammunition at all, and the estimated total expenditure reduced by 5.8 million rounds, Russia’s daily average expenditure would fall to 13,493 per day from the current estimate of 22,729. This is still more than Ukraine for a lot of the period in question, but not dramatically so. Firing at this rate would likely have made many of Russia’s offensives in 2024 much more difficult and costly. It may also have limited the scope of offensives that Russia could undertake. In fact, the tempo of shipments indicates that North Korean shipments were timed to support major Russian offensive operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The OSC analysis indicates that Russian ships have averaged three deliveries per month since shipments started in September 2023. However, October, November and December saw 18 total shipments with seven in October alone coinciding with the beginning of the large-scale offensive to take Avdiivka, and the end of Ukraine’s own counter-offensive. A surge of another 13 deliveries between January and March 2024 appear to have supported Russia’s advance on Chasiv Yar, as well as the reopening of the Kharkiv front. Continued deliveries likely supported some stockpiling in preparation for the summer battles of Toretsk, Pokrovsk, and countering Ukraine’s advance into Kursk. Four shipments were observed in February 2025, as Russia prepared for its Spring offensive, recently announced by Ukraine’s general staff. This was the largest number of monthly trips observed by the OSC since the same month in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;impact-assessment&quot;&gt;Impact Assessment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of North Korea’s ammunition supply to Russia is hard to fully appreciate. At the strategic level, it is apparent that the renegade country has contributed significantly to Russia’s overall ammunition expenditure, likely helping Russia to keep fighting and sustaining its advances. The timings of deliveries also indicate that they have been key enablers of Russia’s offensives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact at the tactical level has also led to important outcomes for the war. Ukrainian casualties more than doubled when the number of artillery rounds they could fire fell by half, a senior officer from Ukraine’s general staff told Reuters in July 2024. Manpower has since become a critical weak point for Ukraine as it struggles to hold ground and defend against Russia’s greater numbers. When Russia combined overwhelming firepower with higher ratios of troops, the Ukrainians have often faced defeat. This combination contributed to the fall of Avdiivka in February 2024; during the battle for Avdiivka, Russia had fired nine artillery rounds for every one the Ukrainians could fire back at times, and consistently outnumbered them in personnel. Avdiivka was quickly followed by the Russian capture of Krasnohorivka and Ocheretyne, and the expansion of Russian offensives through the Kharkiv front in May, further stretching Ukraine’s limited forces and ammunition. By October 2024 Russian forces had captured the city of Vuhledar after deploying some of the most intense artillery and glide bomb bombardments that Ukraine’s experienced 72nd Brigade had ever endured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As 2024 came to a close, Russia had captured an estimated 4,168 square kilometres of territory, some of it from pushing Ukraine’s Kursk incursion back, but much of it Ukrainian land, captured in offensives that increasingly used North Korea’s ammunition. Supplies from Pyongyang have become so critical that some Russian units are only firing North Korean ammunition. Ukraine’s manpower struggles were compounded by Russia’s ability to fire more and more rounds to sustain offensives in the face of mounting casualties, with the net result being an overall worsening of Ukraine’s position by the end of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, the available evidence suggests that both Russian and North Korean factories are working to churn out more rounds than ever, with new production lines established and their legacy factories operating at maximum capacity. There will likely be some emphasis on replenishing stockpiles, but it stands to reason that many of the rounds the two states produce will be used in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, North Korean ammunition has kept Russia in the war, and arguably helped change its trajectory. If the supply increases and can be sustained for months on end, Ukrainian casualties will climb and Russia’s will fall. More territory will be taken, and Ukraine’s position will become ever more tenuous.&lt;/p&gt;

The two sites are among those most likely to be supporting Chinese intelligence-gathering operations from Cuba.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bejucal&quot;&gt;BEJUCAL&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;22° 56’ 54.5”N 82° 21’ 46.29”W&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Situated outside of the capital, near the town of Bejucal, is Cuba’s largest active SIGINT site. The facility has a long history, and is near a site that housed Soviet nuclear weapons during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the end of the Cold War, Bejucal has been widely rumored to be part of China’s intelligence-gathering ambitions on the island. U.S. congressional testimony and unclassified government documents have suggested the site has ties to China, and reporting in English and Spanish-language outlets has also linked it to China. During the 2016 U.S. presidential primary debates, then-Senator Marco Rubio called on Havana to “[kick] out this Chinese listening station in Bejucal.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSIS analysis of satellite imagery from March 2024 showed that the site had undergone major updates over the past decade, indicating an evolving mission set. Multiple antenna fields were visible across the expansive complex, and entrances to underground facilities could also be seen on the southern end of the site. Adding to its capabilities, a new radome was installed within the complex in 2014, which may conceal a radar or other system for conducting electronic surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/4wdJpDC.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New satellite imagery from April 16, 2025, shows major developments at the site in recent months. At an existing antenna field on the northern side of the complex, the land has been excavated, and six pole antennas have been removed. In their place, work is underway to construct a large CDAA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CDAAs are used primarily for high-frequency direction finding, which involves pinpointing the origin of incoming radio signals from as far as 3,000 or even 8,000 miles away. A new CDAA at Bejucal could offer a significantly enhanced capability to monitor air and maritime activity in and around the United States. Interestingly, the Soviets also operated a now-abandoned antenna array just outside of the current complex at Bejucal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While work at this site is still ongoing, it is already easily identifiable as a CDAA by its circular shape. Satellite imagery shows pole antennas already erected in a circular pattern surrounding a movable trailer at the center. Trenches have been dug for the placement of cables connecting each of the antennas to the center, though the cables themselves are not visible. As work continues, a more permanent structure could be erected at the center to replace the trailer currently there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new CDAA will likely replace an older and smaller one that was previously located in a nearby field within the complex. The antennas of that circular array are no longer visible. Notably, the new CDAA is much larger. It comprises 19 antennas arrayed in a circle approximately 175 meters in diameter, whereas the previous array had 16 antennas in a circle spanning 85 meters in diameter, with a trailer in the center. This larger size likely offers greater precision in tracking signals at long distances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CDAAs were a staple of SIGINT during the Cold War. The United States and Russia previously operated extensive CDAA networks to help military and intelligence services track targets, but new technologies and an evolving mission set have made CDAAs less common for modern day SIGINT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/GdE0hTE.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ CDAA at U.S. Naval Base, Pearl Harbor, Naval Radio Station, constructed 1963&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, these capabilities remain relevant, even for highly capable forces like the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA). China has invested in new CDAA facilities at two of its militarized outposts in the South China Sea, on Mischief Reef and Subi Reef. Paired with other forms of intelligence, CDAAs there can provide China with information about naval and air activity near these contested islands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once completed, the new CDAA site at Bejucal could enable Cuba to collect similar intelligence on U.S. activities in the region—information that would also be valuable if shared with China or other U.S. adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;el-salao&quot;&gt;El Salao&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;20° 0’19.16”N 75°44’48.49”W&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roughly 500 miles southeast of Bejucal, on the opposite side of Cuba, is another CDAA facility, near El Salao. The site had previously gone unreported until CSIS published satellite imagery of it in 2024. At that time, imagery from March 2024 showed a new CDAA under construction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, more recent imagery from April 18, 2025, reveals that work at El Salao has largely ceased. Over the last year, workers continued some minor activities such as erecting roofs on two support buildings, but there has otherwise been little activity observable in available satellite imagery. Notably, the graded area within the CDAA’s rings is being reclaimed by grass and other plant life, suggesting a lack of activity and maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jdMoDp8.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is unclear why activity at this site has gone quiet in recent months. A CDAA site at El Salao could provide a useful vantage point for monitoring air and maritime traffic over much of the Atlantic Ocean. In particular, it could assist in monitoring U.S. military traffic around U.S. Naval Station Guantanamo, which is approximately 40 miles east of El Salao.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the unclassified space, there is no smoking gun linking China to any of these sites directly, and China has denied having any links to surveillance sites in Cuba. However, U.S. officials have repeatedly signaled that China has access to spy facilities on the island. These two sites are among those most likely to be supporting Chinese intelligence-gathering operations from the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should continue to monitor developments at these facilities. Major changes at Cuban SIGINT sites could indicate an escalation in Cuban—or Chinese—efforts to collect intelligence on the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russia-Ukraine war has emerged as a watershed moment in modern military history, fundamentally reshaping our understanding of contemporary warfare. This white paper analyzes five transformative domains that have defined this conflict: autonomous systems, information operations, electronic warfare, contested logistics, and evolving air defense strategies. By examining the practical applications and lessons learned from this ongoing conflict, this paper provides military planners, defense policymakers, and security professionals with actionable insights for adapting force structures, doctrines, and capabilities to meet the challenges of future warfare. The conflict serves as both warning and blueprint—demonstrating how technological innovation, organizational adaptability, and strategic resilience have become the defining characteristics of military effectiveness in the twenty-first century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 marked a pivotal moment in modern military history, opening new avenues for studying the evolving nature of warfare. What Russian leadership initially anticipated would be a swift campaign has instead developed into a protracted conflict, transforming the battlefield into a real-world laboratory for testing new military technologies, doctrines, and operational adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the most significant developments observed in Ukraine has been the transformative role of autonomous systems, particularly unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). These emerging technologies are revolutionizing battlefield dynamics, extending operational reach while minimizing risks to human forces and challenging traditional force structures. Simultaneously, the conflict has elevated the importance of information operations, electronic warfare, contested logistics, and innovative air defense strategies in shaping the military landscape of future conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This white paper provides a comprehensive analysis of modern warfare through five interconnected characteristics that have been prominently displayed throughout the Ukraine conflict:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rise of autonomous systems and their impact on force architecture&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The information domain as a critical battleground&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Electronic warfare and spectrum superiority&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The challenges of sustaining logistics in contested environments&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The evolution of air defense strategy&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By examining these dimensions, this paper aims to provide deeper insights into how military operations are adapting to contemporary challenges and what these adaptations portend for the future of armed conflict. The lessons derived from the Ukraine conflict serve as critical waypoints for military organizations seeking to navigate the rapidly changing character of modern warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis presented in this paper draws on firsthand insights from four senior defense experts interviewed by the author in March 2025: Austin Gray, former U.S. Navy intelligence officer and co-founder of Blue Water Autonomy; Major General Gregory Gagnon, deputy chief of space operations for intelligence of the U.S. Space Force; Lieutenant General (Ret.) Lance Landrum, former deputy chair of the NATO Military Committee; and Air Marshal Johnny Stringer, deputy commander of NATO’s Allied Air Command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-rise-of-autonomous-systems-and-their-impact-on-force-architecture&quot;&gt;The Rise of Autonomous Systems and Their Impact on Force Architecture&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;range-extension-and-risk-reduction&quot;&gt;Range Extension and Risk Reduction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unmanned systems are dramatically transforming the battlefield by extending operational reach while reducing risks to personnel. They enable longer-range engagement with adversaries while minimizing soldiers’ exposure to danger. It is generally recognized by military leaders that drones offer a significant advantage in modern conflicts due to their ability to strike at longer ranges with reduced risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Ukraine conflict, both sides have leveraged drones extensively for reconnaissance, target acquisition, and precision strikes—often beyond the effective range of conventional direct-fire weapons. This capability to project force across dimensional and operational planes while removing personnel from immediate danger has fundamentally altered tactical and operational planning considerations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;democratization-of-air-power&quot;&gt;Democratization of Air Power&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most significant strategic impact of autonomous systems has been the democratization of air power. Historically, air superiority was the exclusive domain of wealthy nations that could afford expensive aircraft and specialized pilot training. The proliferation of small, affordable drones has dramatically lowered these barriers. As Air Marshal Stringer observed in the CSIS interview series mentioned above, “you could conduct most if not all of the airpower roles for the price of a drone, a laptop, and some imagination.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This democratization raises profound questions for military strategy and force planning. Nations and non-state actors now possess means to contest airspace and project power previously considered beyond their reach. In Ukraine, this reality has manifested in a complex and contested aerial environment, despite Russia’s nominal advantages in conventional air assets. The dual-use nature of military and adapted civilian drones has further complicated the operational picture, blurring traditional distinctions between military and commercial technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;supply-chain-and-technology-accessibility&quot;&gt;Supply Chain and Technology Accessibility&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The accessibility of drone technology has significantly influenced drones’ battlefield proliferation. The hardware components essential for drone development—batteries, lightweight computing systems, and airframe materials—are readily available through commercial supply chains, with many components sourced from standard e-commerce platforms. Similarly, 3D printing capabilities have facilitated rapid prototyping and scaling of drone production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software development for drone operations has likewise accelerated, with advances in firmware, operating systems, and semi-autonomous functionalities. While full autonomy remains a developing capability, even basic remote control systems with limited autonomous functions have proved highly effective in combat conditions. This accessibility has enabled Ukraine to rapidly field large numbers of autonomous systems despite limited indigenous defense industrial capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;evolution-of-asset-categories&quot;&gt;Evolution of Asset Categories&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukraine conflict has revealed an evolution in military force architecture. Traditional military planning distinguished between two primary categories of assets: expendable (ammunition) and survivable (high-value platforms). The drone revolution has expanded this taxonomy to include four categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expendable assets:&lt;/strong&gt; Single-use, deployable systems like conventional ammunition&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attritable assets:&lt;/strong&gt; Low-cost systems whose loss poses no strategic consequences&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk-tolerant assets:&lt;/strong&gt; Medium-tier unmanned systems that commanders prefer to preserve but can afford to lose if militarily necessary&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Survivable assets:&lt;/strong&gt; High-value platforms and personnel that require protection&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This revised architecture creates operational flexibility that previously did not exist. Where commanders once faced a binary choice between risking high-value assets or foregoing operations entirely, they now have degrees of risk appropriate to different threat environments. This framework is particularly valuable for conventional forces structured around high-value platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-economics-of-modern-warfare&quot;&gt;The Economics of Modern Warfare&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukraine conflict has upended traditional cost-benefit calculations in military operations. The conventional emphasis on firepower-heavy forces built around expensive platforms—tanks, warships, and advanced aircraft—is being challenged by the effectiveness of low-cost attritable assets, particularly drones. According to NATO, Ukrainian drones have been responsible for more than 65 percent of destroyed Russian tanks, representing what many analysts see as a fundamental disruption in the economics of warfare. This dynamic extends beyond Ukraine, with similar cost asymmetries observed in other theaters where non-state actors have employed inexpensive drones against high-value naval assets. These developments validate a new perspective on the “cheap–expensive” and “targetability” matrix, wherein low-cost but precision-targetable systems produce outsized operational effects when deployed at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;tactical-versatility-of-autonomous-systems&quot;&gt;Tactical Versatility of Autonomous Systems&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conflict has demonstrated the remarkable tactical versatility of unmanned systems across multiple mission profiles. Some of these varied functions are listed below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All-seeing eyes:&lt;/strong&gt; Small, difficult-to-detect drones provide unprecedented situational awareness, enabling forces to identify enemy positions, activities, and vulnerabilities without risking human observers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targeting and battle damage assessment:&lt;/strong&gt; Drones play a crucial role in designating targets for indirect fire systems and assessing strike effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strike operations:&lt;/strong&gt; Armed drones ranging from weaponized commercial models to purpose-built military platforms have been employed against personnel, vehicles, and infrastructure with high precision.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electronic warfare and communications:&lt;/strong&gt; UAVs serve as platforms for electronic warfare, communications relays, and signals intelligence collection.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logistics support:&lt;/strong&gt; Unmanned ground vehicles enable resupply to isolated units or positions under direct fire, reducing risk to logistics personnel.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These applications demonstrate the flexibility of autonomous systems in maintaining and enhancing traditional military capabilities across numerous operational domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;vulnerabilities-and-mitigations&quot;&gt;Vulnerabilities and Mitigations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite their strengths, autonomous systems exhibit significant vulnerabilities. Drone operators have become high-value targets, as they are often easier to locate and neutralize than the platforms they control. This has accelerated the development of increased autonomy to reduce operator vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Ukraine and Russia have developed techniques to trace drone control signals to their source, enabling counter-battery fire or direct strikes against operators. This has necessitated frequent relocation of control stations and the development of more resilient command and control architectures, including relay systems and distributed control networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electronic warfare and cyberattacks reveal additional vulnerabilities. The Ukraine conflict has demonstrated that these threats can be mitigated through technological and operational approaches, such as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;mesh networks that maintain functionality even when individual nodes are compromised;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;multiple communications pathways, including satellite communications, airborne relays, and ground-based systems; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;local autonomy capabilities that enable operation when communications are degraded.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, these approaches have enabled autonomous systems to function effectively even in sophisticated electronic warfare environments, suggesting that while electronic warfare remains important, it may not be as decisive as some analysts had predicted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-information-domain-as-a-critical-battleground&quot;&gt;The Information Domain as a Critical Battleground&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-strategic-importance-of-information&quot;&gt;The Strategic Importance of Information&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fundamental lesson from the Ukraine conflict highlights the paramount importance of the information domain. As Major General Gregory Gagnon, Deputy Chief of Space Operations for Intelligence of the U.S. Space Force, observed in the CSIS interview series, “the information space became incredibly important in that conflict”—not only for military command and control but also for shaping strategic narratives that influence international support and domestic perceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s approach reflects its established doctrine of “informational confrontation,” which comprises two elements: the “information technical” (controlling the means of information) and the “information political” (shaping the message itself). This represents a continuation of Soviet-era tactics, adapted for the modern digital battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cyberattacks-and-space-assets&quot;&gt;Cyberattacks and Space Assets&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Viasat cyberattack executed immediately before Russia’s invasion exemplifies the “information technical” component of this doctrine. Though aimed at Ukrainian military command-and-control infrastructure, this operation had cascading effects that disrupted approximately 5,800 German wind turbines and internet services for thousands of European users. This incident demonstrates how cyberattacks targeting space capabilities can produce widespread, often unintended consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This episode underscores the importance of gaining cyber and space superiority over one’s adversaries as an early objective in ground campaigns—a principle likely to become foundational in twenty-first-century conflicts. Successful military operations increasingly depend on establishing control in these domains from the outset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;space-superiority-and-modern-warfare&quot;&gt;Space Superiority and Modern Warfare&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukraine conflict has highlighted the critical role of space assets in modern warfare, particularly for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR). Commercial satellite operators have effectively negated Russia’s potential space advantage over Ukraine, with the constellation of space assets contributing to Ukraine’s capabilities increasing from approximately 200 to 300 satellites during the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This democratization of space capabilities has profound implications for conventional forces, as “large mass conventional forces will have a hard time executing surprise in the future” due to the proliferation of commercial remote sensing capabilities, according to Major General Gagnon. During Russia’s pre-invasion buildup along Ukraine’s borders, commercial imaging companies published satellite imagery that enabled think tanks and analysts to accurately assess Russian force dispositions. As Gagnon noted, “the commercial remote sensing market in outer space is becoming rapidly an unblinking eye,” making it increasingly difficult to conceal conventional force movements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commercial satellite systems have also played a crucial role in providing communication links for autonomous vehicles when terrestrial networks are disrupted or jammed. Starlink’s services, for instance, have enabled Ukrainian forces to maintain control of drone operations despite Russian efforts to degrade communication infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;organizational-structures-and-information-integration&quot;&gt;Organizational Structures and Information Integration&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effective integration of information and space assets into operations depends less on technological capabilities than on organizational structures that can incorporate these capabilities into overall military operations. Russia’s compartmentalized military organization and lack of trust between units have contributed to its inability to fully leverage its information warfare potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organizational structure similarly affects professional military education and the role of non-commissioned officers (NCOs). Major General Gagnon highlights how Russia’s military is disadvantaged by its conscription model (11 percent of personnel are conscripted for one-year terms) and the absence of a professional NCO corps. Effective coordination among space, air, ground, and maritime forces in combined arms operations requires communication and empowerment at lower organizational levels—a capability that depends heavily on experienced NCOs. As Major General Gagnon notes, “The reason the American yardstick is the largest yardstick in the world is because of our NCO Corps.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;electronic-warfare-and-electromagnetic-spectrum-superiority&quot;&gt;Electronic Warfare and Electromagnetic Spectrum Superiority&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;return-to-contested-electromagnetic-environments&quot;&gt;Return to Contested Electromagnetic Environments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukraine conflict has revealed a return to contested electromagnetic environments after decades of Western dominance in this domain. Lieutenant General Landrum observes in the CSIS interview series that “the biggest stark difference is, as we fought in coalition warfare in Iraq and Afghanistan . . . we were really uncontested in the electromagnetic spectrum.” For three decades following the Cold War, Western forces allowed their electromagnetic operations capabilities to atrophy, creating a significant capability gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Russia, China, and other potential adversaries continued developing their electronic warfare capabilities and units. This development has created an electromagnetic environment in Ukraine where neither side has been able to establish clear advantage—a stark contrast to Western experiences in recent conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;impact-on-air-superiority-and-ground-operations&quot;&gt;Impact on Air Superiority and Ground Operations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most direct consequence of this electromagnetic contest has been the inability of either Russia or Ukraine to achieve air superiority—a factor that has contributed to the conflict’s positional and attritional warfare characteristics. The contested electromagnetic environment has severely restricted both sides’ ability to conduct rapid maneuvers, protect ground forces, and shield maneuvering elements from enemy fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reality contrasts sharply with Western doctrines of air power that evolved from the Gulf War, where air superiority was achieved and maintained throughout operations. The Ukraine conflict suggests that in contested electromagnetic environments, conventional applications of air power may face significant limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;specific-electronic-warfare-applications&quot;&gt;Specific Electronic Warfare Applications&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several electronic warfare applications have proved particularly significant in the Ukraine conflict:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GPS jamming:&lt;/strong&gt; Disruption of GPS signals has impeded navigation capabilities for autonomous systems and precision-guided munitions, forcing reliance on alternative guidance methods.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communications disruption:&lt;/strong&gt; Both sides have systematically jammed communications networks, degrading command and control capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Signals intelligence:&lt;/strong&gt; Electronic warfare operations have included signals intelligence collection critical for battlefield decisionmaking.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tactical jamming of autonomous systems:&lt;/strong&gt; Localized jamming operations have targeted UAVs to degrade both reconnaissance and attack capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frequency agility:&lt;/strong&gt; When facing successful Ukrainian jamming of small UAV operations, Russian forces have demonstrated frequency-hopping agility, creating brief windows of operational opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-dynamic-interaction-of-drone-operations-and-electronic-warfare&quot;&gt;The Dynamic Interaction of Drone Operations and Electronic Warfare&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability of autonomous systems to electronic warfare represents a defining characteristic of the Ukraine conflict. GPS jamming has proved particularly effective, as many autonomous systems rely on GPS for navigation. Large-scale jamming by Russian forces has forced Ukrainian operators to develop alternative navigation methods including inertial navigation and line-of-sight communications. However, these alternatives present their own vulnerabilities, as line-of-sight communications remain susceptible to electronic interception and further jamming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian forces have rapidly developed defenses and countermeasures to preserve operational effectiveness, including satellite communications, relay stations, and mesh networks that address vulnerabilities while maintaining reliable command and control capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;future-implications-for-electronic-warfare&quot;&gt;Future Implications for Electronic Warfare&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukraine conflict points toward a new set of characteristics for electromagnetic warfare strategies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modern, agile systems:&lt;/strong&gt; Future electronic warfare systems will be increasingly adaptable, software-defined, and capable of responding rapidly to changing electromagnetic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrated architecture:&lt;/strong&gt; Effective electronic warfare architectures will integrate military, government, and commercial domains.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public-private partnerships:&lt;/strong&gt; Managing shared spectrum requirements will require collaboration among industry, government, and military stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artificial intelligence integration:&lt;/strong&gt; Artificial intelligence and machine learning will be central to future electronic warfare, enabling cognitive electronic warfare platforms capable of sensing, analyzing, and responding autonomously at speeds beyond human capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These technologies will be essential as warfare accelerates, requiring decisionmaking at machine speed while preserving human judgment in critical areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-challenges-of-sustaining-logistics-in-contested-environments&quot;&gt;The Challenges of Sustaining Logistics in Contested Environments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;vulnerability-of-traditional-logistics-models&quot;&gt;Vulnerability of Traditional Logistics Models&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukraine conflict has exposed fundamental vulnerabilities in traditional logistics approaches. Lieutenant General Landrum emphasizes how the conflict has “brought reality to the vulnerability of supply chains, the vulnerability of logistics centers, and how we move and project force.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war has demonstrated the extreme vulnerability of large infrastructure nodes, supply centers, distribution facilities, and transportation networks including rail, roads, bridges, and ports. These vulnerabilities are magnified by adversaries’ long-range precision strike capabilities, non-kinetic attacks, and electromagnetic interference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-postcold-war-efficiency-trap&quot;&gt;The Post–Cold War Efficiency Trap&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A critical insight from analysis of the conflict is how Western militaries have systematically reduced their organic logistics capabilities over the past 30–40 years in favor of commercial outsourcing. While this approach delivered efficiencies through “just-in-time” delivery systems and elimination of redundancies, it also created strategic vulnerabilities. As Lieutenant General Landrum stated, “over the decades . . . [the U.S. military] became incredibly efficient. We outsourced and divested of military logistics capability, using commercial capability to get this service that we needed, because we had the luxury of planning well in advance for our operations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This model functioned effectively when operations were planned months or years in advance in uncontested environments like Iraq and Afghanistan. However, it is dangerously inadequate for rapid response in contested environments where commercial providers may be unwilling to operate in high-threat areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;hybrid-threats-to-logistics-infrastructure&quot;&gt;Hybrid Threats to Logistics Infrastructure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukraine conflict has highlighted emerging hybrid threats to logistics infrastructure, including targeted attacks against supply nodes, cyber operations, underwater infrastructure sabotage, and difficult-to-attribute asymmetric operations. These new threats compound traditional challenges such as infrastructure limitations (e.g., road weight restrictions, bridge capacities), rail gauge differences, port throughput constraints, and customs and border regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reimagining-logistics-for-contested-environments&quot;&gt;Reimagining Logistics for Contested Environments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conflict has catalyzed a new paradigm for logistics in contested environments based on the principle that Lieutenant General Landrum describes as “disaggregate to survive, reaggregate when necessary.” This approach relies on several key characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disaggregated logistics networks:&lt;/strong&gt; The distribution of supply nodes and capabilities enhances survivability against precision strikes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Command and control of dispersed assets:&lt;/strong&gt; The development of command and control systems capable of managing widely distributed logistics elements is essential for enhancing operational efficiency and coordination across complex supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid reaggregation capability:&lt;/strong&gt; The ability to concentrate logistics resources quickly based on operational requirements is crucial for ensuring timely support and mission success in dynamic environments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Renewed focus on stockpiling:&lt;/strong&gt; Accepting increased costs associated with maintaining larger reserves of critical munitions and supplies reflects a strategic shift, reversing the “just-in-time” paradigm in favor of enhanced readiness and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This transformation represents a fundamental shift from efficiency-driven logistics toward approaches prioritizing resilience and survivability in contested environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;logistics-innovation-through-technology&quot;&gt;Logistics Innovation Through Technology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukraine conflict has revealed several opportunities for technological innovation in logistics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additive manufacturing:&lt;/strong&gt; 3D printing capabilities reduce dependence on vulnerable supply chains for certain components.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interoperable systems:&lt;/strong&gt; Movement away from proprietary systems toward open architectures enables integration across platforms and nations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distributed command and control:&lt;/strong&gt; Development of robust communications networks allows for managing disaggregated logistics assets effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These innovations will be essential for creating logistics systems capable of operating in contested environments while maintaining the flexibility required for modern military operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-evolution-of-air-defense-and-strategy&quot;&gt;The Evolution of Air Defense and Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;historical-context-and-strategic-reset&quot;&gt;Historical Context and Strategic Reset&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two significant historical factors have shaped NATO’s current air defense posture, according to Air Marshal Stringer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post–Cold War disinvestment:&lt;/strong&gt; The three decades following the Cold War saw significant reductions in NATO air defense capabilities, creating vulnerabilities exposed by Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Counterinsurgency operations:&lt;/strong&gt; Counterterrorism and counterinsurgency campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan and against the Islamic State diverted resources and attention from developing capabilities against conventional or near-peer threats.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These factors created military structures optimized for specific types of operations while leaving NATO inadequately prepared for the hybrid warfare techniques deployed in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;expanded-threat-spectrum&quot;&gt;Expanded Threat Spectrum&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukraine conflict has highlighted a dramatic expansion in the range of threats confronting modern air defense systems:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low-cost threats:&lt;/strong&gt; One-way attack drones and first-person view (FPV) drones equipped with simple warheads that can be mass-produced at minimal cost&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High-end threats:&lt;/strong&gt; Advanced systems such as hypersonic air-launched ballistic missiles capable of extreme speeds and ranges&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asymmetric approaches:&lt;/strong&gt; Exploitation of social media, legal mechanisms, and disinformation to create favorable conditions for military operations&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This evolving threat landscape necessitates a fundamental reconsideration of integrated air and missile defense (IAMD) approaches, focusing on what Air Marshal Stringer describes as going “back to first principles.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;enhanced-sensing-capabilities&quot;&gt;Enhanced Sensing Capabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has demonstrated innovative approaches to air defense detection, including implementation of extensive networks of inexpensive acoustic sensors linked to create comprehensive recognized air pictures; diversification beyond traditional radar systems to improve situational awareness; and integration of multiple sensing modalities to establish resilient detection networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;command-and-control-transformation&quot;&gt;Command and Control Transformation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the face of evolving threats, modernizing command and control systems is critical. According to Air Marshal Stringer, this should be done through a renewed commitment to standardization agreements (STANAGs) that were neglected during the post–Cold War period; ensuring interoperability across national air command and control systems within NATO’s architecture; and shifting from monolithic software development toward modular, agile approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This transformation would not require “one big program to try and do everything,” but rather adopting smartphone-like models with intuitive interfaces and specialized applications, while embracing development, security, and operations (DevSecOps) principles to create an “intelligent, imaginative ecosystem” of suppliers. DevSecOps integrates security throughout the software development cycle, fostering collaboration while providing mechanisms for rapidly developing secure software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;force-posture-innovations&quot;&gt;Force Posture Innovations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukraine conflict has prompted military strategists to reconsider force positioning and employment, including by reimagining defense postures and alert states for enhanced responsiveness; drawing inspiration from Cold War integration models while adapting them to contemporary threats; and balancing offensive and defensive operations, recognizing that being “necessarily offensive to be defensive” as Marshal Stringer puts it, may be required against mass drone threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;drone-warfare-implications&quot;&gt;Drone Warfare Implications&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The widespread deployment of drones in Ukraine presents both challenges and opportunities, as outlined below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Democratization effect:&lt;/strong&gt; Even resource-constrained adversaries can now execute traditional air power functions including air superiority, strike, ISR, and transport.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mass vs. quality trade-offs:&lt;/strong&gt; Drones enable “high-low mix” strategies that increase effective force mass while maintaining capability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rethinking generations:&lt;/strong&gt; Military leaders can evolve beyond platform-centric definitions, such as fifth-generation aircraft, and embrace warfare-centric concepts that define the emerging paradigm of sixth-generation warfare, emphasizing integrated capabilities, information dominance, and multi-domain operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;air-superiority-in-modern-conflict&quot;&gt;Air Superiority in Modern Conflict&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Russia and Ukraine have experienced the consequences of failing to secure air superiority, resulting in a protracted, attrition-based conflict. This underscores that while warfare’s character evolves rapidly, certain principles—including air superiority—remain essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the concept of air superiority itself is evolving to encompass control of the electromagnetic spectrum, integration of kinetic and non-kinetic effects, and employment of autonomous systems. Future air operations will require this expanded understanding of air superiority to address increasingly complex and interconnected operational variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;deterrence-recalibration&quot;&gt;Deterrence Recalibration&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukraine crisis has reinforced the fundamental elements of effective deterrence:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical capability:&lt;/strong&gt; Ensuring forces possess necessary equipment and technology&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capacity:&lt;/strong&gt; Maintaining sufficient quantities of platforms and weapons&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Credibility:&lt;/strong&gt; Combining capability, capacity, and readiness to establish a believable deterrent posture&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experts emphasize the need to avoid a “cliff edge” between conventional and nuclear options, instead providing graduated deterrent options that offer political leaders flexibility in responding to escalation. An optimally balanced force structure should include capabilities across the entire conflict spectrum, from low-intensity operations to high-end warfighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-continuous-adaptation-as-the-new-military-imperative&quot;&gt;Conclusion: Continuous Adaptation as the New Military Imperative&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;beyond-static-solutions&quot;&gt;Beyond Static Solutions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A central theme emerging from the Ukraine conflict is the need for continuous evolution in military capabilities, doctrines, and organizations. As Air Marshal Stringer observes, “better never stops”—leaders should reject the notion of achieving perfect end states for military capabilities. Instead, military effectiveness increasingly depends on continuous testing, experimentation, and validation of approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mindset represents a significant departure from traditional military procurement and doctrine development, which seeks definitive solutions to military problems. In the rapidly evolving environment revealed in Ukraine, such static approaches quickly become obsolete against technological and tactical innovations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;realistic-training-for-complex-environments&quot;&gt;Realistic Training for Complex Environments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lessons from Ukraine underscore the importance of incorporating realistic conditions into military training and exercises, including electromagnetically contested environments, logistics challenges and disruptions, hybrid threats across multiple domains, and operations with degraded communications and command and control systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Lieutenant General Landrum emphasizes, “we have to practice, train, and exercise” these capabilities during peacetime to ensure their effectiveness in crisis or conflict. This approach requires directly confronting difficult operational problems rather than “wishing . . . [them] away” in training environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;alliance-coordination-and-public-private-integration&quot;&gt;Alliance Coordination and Public-Private Integration&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukraine conflict demonstrates the critical importance of collaboration between military, government, and commercial entities across multiple domains, including managing shared electromagnetic spectrum use, integrating commercial space capabilities into military operations, developing new models for public-private logistics partnerships, and leveraging commercial technology development for military applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These partnerships require innovative approaches that balance commercial efficiency with military resilience requirements, creating effective systems for both peacetime and conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The five dimensions examined in this paper—autonomous systems, information operations, electronic warfare, resilient logistics, and adaptive air defense—represent interconnected and mutually reinforcing aspects of modern warfare. Future success will depend on mastering these domains while developing organizational structures and doctrines that facilitate continuous adaptation to emerging challenges. The Ukraine conflict suggests that military forces must embrace perpetual evolution rather than seeking static solutions to dynamic problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As armed forces worldwide adapt their planning, acquisition, and strategic processes, the military organizations that internalize these lessons—embracing technological innovation, organizational adaptability, and operational resilience—will be best positioned to succeed in the complex security environment of the twenty-first century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russia-Ukraine conflict has captivated global attention, revealing a new chapter in the evolution of warfare—one defined by resilience, innovation, and multidomain engagement. From ground offensives to cyberattacks and the contested use of space, this war has challenged traditional military assumptions and reshaped strategic thinking. Conflict in Focus, a limited event series from CSIS running from February–March 2025, explored these developments through in-depth conversations with military fellows and expert guests. Each episode centered on a key domain—air, land, maritime, cyber, and space—drawing on firsthand experience to unpack the lessons of modern conflict and implications for future wars. This paper recaps these episodes and provides the main takeaways and conclusions from each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the conditions of the Russia-Ukraine War are unique, many of its features offer critical insights for anticipating future large-scale conflicts. The lack of clear air superiority, contested space access, and the widespread use of low-cost drones and defensive fortifications point to enduring trends in warfare. Yet, notable absences—such as U.S. stealth capabilities, nuclear deterrence, and expansive naval power—are a reminder that every conflict has its own character. For military professionals, policymakers, and strategists, understanding both the innovations and limitations of this war is essential. As future adversaries adapt and evolve, the enduring lesson is clear: ccess will belong to those who can integrate all instruments of power to gain and maintain the advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;land-domain-lessons-from-russia-ukraine&quot;&gt;Land Domain Lessons from Russia-Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This panel featured Colonel Roman Kostenko, Ukrainian member of parliament; Lieutenant General (Ret.) Ben Hodges, former commander, U.S. Army Europe; and Dr. Benjamin Jensen, CSIS senior fellow; and was moderated by Colonel Scott Pence, CSIS military fellow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-operational-context&quot;&gt;Key Operational Context&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion began with an overview of how the Russia-Ukraine conflict evolved from February 2022 through the end of 2024:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In February 2022, the Russian invasion was launched along multiple axes (north from Belarus toward Kyiv, east from Donbas toward Kharkiv, and south from Crimea toward Kherson).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Initial Russian advances were repelled around Kyiv by April 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ukraine recaptured territory in Kharkiv (September 2022) and Kherson (November 2022).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The war then settled into attritional trench warfare with relatively static frontlines throughout 2023–24.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ukraine launched a surprise incursion into Russia’s Kursk region in August 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current battlefield stretches approximately 1,000 miles, with 500 miles of active contact, where approximately 400,000 Russian troops face 250,000 Ukrainian soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;major-themes-and-insights&quot;&gt;Major Themes and Insights&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;UKRAINE’S STRATEGIC NEEDS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kostenko emphasized that while Ukraine requires a consistent and uninterrupted weapons supply, true victory will depend on diplomatic efforts as well as military strength. He stressed that Western partners must distinguish between “stopping the war” and “defeating Russia,” arguing that Ukraine needs strategic support to achieve victory, not merely to hold defensive positions. Hodges added that Ukraine’s greatest challenge lies in maintaining confidence that the United States and Europe will continue supporting them, rather than pressuring Kyiv into a settlement that sacrifices Ukrainian territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE KURSK INCURSION: A STRATEGIC MASTERSTROKE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The August 2024 Ukrainian incursion into Russia’s Kursk region was highlighted as a significant strategic success. Jensen noted that Ukraine demonstrated the ability to restore mobility on a static front by attacking a “gap” in Russian defenses rather than a heavily fortified “surface.” The operation showcased Ukrainian mastery of maneuver warfare principles, effectively combining drones, electronic warfare, and mobility corridors. Hodges emphasized that Ukraine achieved tactical surprise despite Russia’s advanced drone and surveillance capabilities, exposed Russia’s command and control weaknesses—particularly the friction between Federal Security Service (FSB) border forces and the General Staff—and created strategic dilemmas by forcing Russian resource reallocations. He argued that the operation not only provided Ukraine leverage for future negotiations but also challenged the narrative of Russian invincibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MODERN COMBINED ARMS AND TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Panelists discussed how the character of warfare is evolving. Jensen emphasized the need for “super soldiers” capable of rapidly adapting to new technologies, pointing out how Ukrainian civilians quickly transformed into effective fighters. He stressed the importance of building systems designed to adapt as multiple technologies emerge and highlighted the challenge of turning tactical innovations into operational advantages. Regarding armored warfare, both Hodges and Jensen agreed that while tanks remain valuable, they must be used differently: Poorly trained and poorly employed tanks have proven easy prey for drones. Future tank designs, they suggested, might feature unmanned turrets, lighter armor, and integrated electronic warfare capabilities, with Jensen envisioning tanks as mobile power platforms supporting electronic warfare and drone operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE TRANSPARENT BATTLEFIELD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kostenko described how drones and satellites have rendered the battlefield almost fully transparent to both sides, making rapid, large-scale advances—like those seen during World War II—nearly impossible. Surprise attacks are now feasible only at the scale of a few brigades or smaller units. Jensen and Hodges emphasized the critical need for deception operations and signature management (visual, thermal, and electronic) to maintain operational surprise. They warned that U.S. forces are currently undertrained in the use of decoys and stressed that while new camouflage technologies can reduce detectability, disciplined execution is essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;COMMAND AND CONTROL CHALLENGES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jensen highlighted Ukraine’s limitations in command and control. Ukraine currently lacks division- and corps-level structures, resulting in multiple brigades reporting directly to higher headquarters, which creates inefficiencies in resource use and coordination of combat power. In contrast, Russia maintains appropriate hierarchical command structures but struggles with leadership instability, corruption, and political interference, undermining its effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE NORTH KOREAN DIMENSION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panel also addressed the role of North Korean troops fighting alongside Russian forces. Kostenko observed that while North Korean soldiers are well-trained, they rely on outdated tactics from the 1960s and 70s, advancing in large formations that make them vulnerable to modern drone warfare. Jensen noted that this development signals an early stage of broader international conflict, suggesting, “We’re already in World War III.” He pointed out the difficulty of coalition warfare without interoperability and reported that heavy casualties have forced North Korean units to be pulled from the front lines. This situation, he argued, challenges traditional notions of lethality, as physically fit soldiers are now being killed by drone operators operating at a distance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;INDIRECT FIRES AND MANEUVER&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jensen discussed how modern warfare demands the integration of electronic warfare with both direct and indirect fires. He explained how Russia successfully neutralized High Mobility Artillery Rockets System (HIMARS) effectiveness through GPS jamming but continues to struggle with synchronizing operational-level fires. He emphasized that achieving breakthroughs remains costly without well-executed deception or synchronized fires capable of overwhelming enemy defenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ENDURANCE: THE PATH TO VICTORY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hodges stressed the importance of endurance for Ukraine’s ultimate success. While Ukraine does not face a manpower shortage, he explained, it does suffer from a shortage of trained soldiers. He suggested greater integration of women into military roles and emphasized the importance of ensuring families that their loved ones will receive proper training. Despite the challenges, he suggested Ukraine will remain strong, with over 60 percent of the population opposing any territorial concessions. Jensen concluded that the war is likely to end through a combination of strategic defense and creative offensive actions. He argued that sustained economic pressure on Russia—through measures like oil price manipulation and sanctions—is critical. Ukraine’s successful drone strikes against Russian refineries demonstrate the potential of such pressure. Ultimately, he said, the West must force Russia into a strategic dilemma: “Bleed in Ukraine or go broke in Moscow.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-takeaways&quot;&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panelists emphasized several crucial points for Western policymakers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Supporting Ukraine is not charity; it serves U.S. strategic interests and deters China.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Greater economic pressure on Russia should complement military support.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maintaining Western will to support Ukraine will be the decisive factor for a Ukrainian victory.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Future land warfare will require greater integration of traditional combined arms with electronic warfare, drones, and deception operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This conflict represents a watershed moment in the evolution of land warfare, with critical lessons about integration of technology, the importance of adaptability, and the enduring human role in modern combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;maritime-domain-lessons-from-russia-ukraine&quot;&gt;Maritime Domain Lessons from Russia-Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This panel discussion featured Rear Admiral Mike Mattis, director of strategic effects, U.S. Naval Forces Europe/Africa; Dr. Rebecca Grant, vice president, Lexington Institute; and Dr. Stacie Pettyjohn, senior fellow and director, Defense Program, Center for New American Security; and was moderated by Captain Quinton Packard, CSIS military fellow. The panel examined how Ukraine, a nation with virtually no navy, successfully challenged Russia’s formidable Black Sea Fleet through innovative asymmetric warfare. Despite Russia’s overwhelming naval superiority at the start of the invasion, Ukraine has denied Russia sea control and inflicted heavy losses on the Black Sea Fleet using unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), cruise missiles, and other asymmetric approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-black-sea-maritime-conflict&quot;&gt;The Black Sea Maritime Conflict&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mattis detailed the conflict’s maritime evolution: First, Ukraine used mines around Odesa to prevent an amphibious landing and deployed coastal defense cruise missiles (Harpoon and Neptune) to create an initial sea denial zone. After Russia terminated the Black Sea Grain Initiative in July 2023 and attempted to blockade Ukrainian ports, Ukraine responded with USV attacks against Russian warships, pushing the fleet further back. By January 2024, Ukraine had sunk multiple Russian vessels using USVs, including a Raptor-class patrol boat, a Ropucha-class landing ship, and a Bykov-class corvette. These losses prompted leadership changes in the Russian Navy and forced Russia’s fleet to retreat to Novorossiysk and create a defensive bastion around the Kerch Strait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mattis outlined Ukraine’s four maritime objectives and its success so far at achieving each:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prevent invasion from the sea. Ukraine has successfully achieved this objective through mines and coastal defense cruise missiles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prevent missile attacks from the sea. Ukraine has partially achieved this objective; Russian vessels can still launch Kalibr cruise missiles but must quickly return to port rather than remaining deployed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prevent a blockade. Ukraine has successfully achieved this objective; it now exports more grain than before the war.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prevent resupply ashore. Ukraine has been partially successful in achieving this objective; Russian naval logistics to Crimea and Syria have been severely disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s primary objective to protect Crimea has been partly maintained, but Russia’s armed forces have lost effective use of Sevastopol, their main naval base. Overall, Russia has failed to achieve most of its maritime objectives (amphibious invasion, effective missile attacks, and blockade), with its only success being the continued occupation of Crimea through land routes rather than maritime supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-technologies-and-tactics&quot;&gt;Key Technologies and Tactics&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Panelists outlined how Ukraine’s success has relied on several key capabilities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unmanned surface vessels:&lt;/strong&gt; Maritime drones such as the “Sea Baby” have proven effective in constrained waters, conducting kamikaze attacks and serving as platforms for other weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diversified drone capabilities:&lt;/strong&gt; Ukraine has developed modular USVs with various capabilities, including some equipped with air-to-air missiles (which have successfully taken down Russian helicopters), quadcopters for aerial reconnaissance, and cannons for surface threats.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coordinated multi-axis tactics:&lt;/strong&gt; Videos have shown USVs operating in coordinated packs, with some drones herding Russian ships into deeper waters where they could be engaged by other drone groups.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integration with deep strike capabilities:&lt;/strong&gt; When Russian ships retreated to ports, Ukraine shifted to attacking them with deep strike missiles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;evolution-of-the-maritime-battle&quot;&gt;Evolution of the Maritime Battle&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panelists emphasized that this is a dynamic contest of adaptation and counteradaptation. Early USV attacks exploited Russian unpreparedness and lack of effective countermeasures. In response, Russia increased air surveillance (helicopters and tactical aircraft) over the Black Sea, significantly reducing USV survivability. By mid-2024, Ukraine found it “10 times harder” to get USVs from Odesa to strike targets near Novorossiysk due to increased Russian air patrols.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine responded by developing USVs with air defense capabilities to target Russian helicopters, creating diversified drone groups, and exploring undersea drones for greater survivability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panel emphasized that this pattern of move and countermove will continue to evolve, with the advantage going to whichever side can innovate faster and stay ahead of its opponent’s defensive measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;transferability-to-other-theaters&quot;&gt;Transferability to Other Theaters&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panel discussed whether Ukraine’s maritime drone successes could transfer to other conflict zones. They pointed out that the Black Sea’s unique characteristics (enclosed sea with limited access through the Bosphorus, which Turkey closed to additional Russian warships) created advantages for Ukraine that could be relevant in other constrained waters like the Baltic Sea, Taiwan Strait, and parts of the South China Sea, but would be less effective in open ocean environments like the Philippine Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, USVs offer a relatively low-cost method for smaller powers to deny sea control to larger naval forces in restricted waters near their shores. Pettyjohn noted this approach could significantly enhance Taiwan’s “porcupine defense” strategy with layers of anti-ship cruise missiles supplemented by USVs and aerial drones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;implications-for-future-naval-operations&quot;&gt;Implications for Future Naval Operations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion highlighted several implications for naval warfare:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need for counter capabilities:&lt;/strong&gt; Mattis called the Black Sea conflict a “warning shot to conventional navies,” which must develop capabilities to counter threats from USVs and unmanned aerial systems (UASs).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost-imposing strategies:&lt;/strong&gt; Pettyjohn compared USV swarms to the Houthi campaign against shipping in the Red Sea, where inexpensive drones have forced adversaries to expend costly missiles and resources, creating favorable cost-exchange ratios for the attacker.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integration with air power:&lt;/strong&gt; Grant emphasized the unique conditions of the Black Sea conflict, where Russia and Ukraine have an “air power stalemate.” She questioned how USV tactics would work against a high-end air force able to establish air superiority.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All-domain integration:&lt;/strong&gt; Mattis stressed that unmanned systems alone are insufficient—the most effective approaches integrate hybrid effects across multiple domains (sea, air, land, cyber, space) to overwhelm an adversary’s defenses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proliferation risk:&lt;/strong&gt; The panel agreed that these capabilities will likely proliferate to various actors, including nonstate groups like Hezbollah or the Houthis, posing challenges for maritime security globally.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-takeaways-1&quot;&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panelists concluded with their most important takeaways from the Black Sea conflict:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The maritime domain is more conducive to drone-enabled strategic effects than the land domain, where defensive measures create “a drone hellscape.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is an action-reaction-counteraction fight requiring constant innovation and adaptation—there are no permanent solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States needs to accelerate unmanned vessel tactics and operations but integrate them with existing naval capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cost-effective counters to USVs are essential, as this technology will likely proliferate rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unmanned systems are not a complete solution but one piece of a larger puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Drones are not direct substitutes for conventional platforms like aircraft carriers, submarines, or destroyers—they complement rather than replace these systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Traditional capabilities like air superiority should not be discounted.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panelists agreed that the future of naval warfare will require effectively integrating unmanned systems within conventional force structures, developing both offensive capabilities and defensive countermeasures, and maintaining the ability to rapidly adapt as adversaries evolve their own approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;human-domain-lessons-from-russia-ukraine&quot;&gt;Human Domain Lessons from Russia-Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This panel discussion included insights from Lieutenant Colonel Volodymyr Dutko of the Ukrainian Army; Colonel (Ret.) Mark Cancian, CSIS senior adviser; Lieutenant General (Ret.) David Barno, professor at Johns Hopkins University; and Dr. Ben Connable, adjunct professor of security studies at Georgetown University. The discussion was moderated by Colonel Scott Pence, CSIS military fellow. The panel examined how this war—described as “the first epic land conflict of the twenty-first century”—offers crucial lessons about warfare’s human elements that remain constant despite technological advances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-human-toll-and-psychological-impact&quot;&gt;The Human Toll and Psychological Impact&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The immense psychological burden commanders and soldiers face in modern warfare was a central theme of the panel. Dutko described the emotional strain of leadership: “You are responsible for human life, and you need to execute the different types of mission[s] . . . to protect native land, homes, relatives, or people, and to minimize casualty.” He noted the emotional preparation required before missions, knowing people might not return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experts highlighted the war’s devastating casualty rates, with reports of approximately 430,000 Russian and 60,000 Ukrainian casualties—figures that dwarf recent U.S. military operations. This scale of loss creates tremendous psychological pressure that most Western militaries have not experienced in generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The constant exposure to danger presents a challenge unlike anything in recent U.S. military experience. Barno emphasized that unlike the episodic combat experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan, where troops could return to secure bases with amenities, the Ukraine war features “perpetual, continual, unending exposure to danger.” This sustained combat stress tests resilience in ways that U.S. forces, for comparison, have not faced since Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing on lessons from Ukraine and wargaming a potential conflict, Cancian offers a sobering prediction of what U.S. forces might face in a future conflict with China: troops arriving at bases surrounded by wreckage, with hundreds of destroyed aircraft, improvised cemeteries, and hospitals filled with wounded. “This is an experience that we have not had, really, for 70 years,” he noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;will-to-fight-and-adaptation&quot;&gt;Will to Fight and Adaptation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connable emphasized that despite technological changes, warfare fundamentally remains “a contest of two opposing, hostile, and irreconcilable wills.” He criticized how military planners often acknowledge this principle theoretically but fail to properly assess and understand it practically. This failure led to misjudgments about both Russian and Ukrainian will to fight at the war’s outset, continuing a pattern seen in U.S. conflicts in Afghanistan, Vietnam, and Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experts identified the importance of adaptation as perhaps the most critical lesson from the conflict. Ukrainian and Russian forces have demonstrated remarkable speed in adapting tactics, techniques, and technologies. Barno observed that both sides are “moving at a pace that I think any other military in the world would have great difficulty replicating, to include the U.S. military.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This adaptability extends to drone warfare, where both sides are continually developing countermeasures against electronic warfare tactics. Dutko described this ongoing evolution as “development and blocking since development,” referring to how quickly jammers adapt to new drone communication frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;drones-and-the-changing-battlefield&quot;&gt;Drones and the Changing Battlefield&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panel identified drone proliferation as a transformative element, though they differed on whether to call it a “gamechanger.” The experts noted that while drones will likely be important in future conflicts, larger systems like Predator and Reaper are expected to be more prominent than small, expendable drones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barno warned that the United States is “behind in drone warfare,” failing to learn from the realities that Ukrainians and Russians face daily. Beyond the technical challenges drones present, he also highlighted the psychological impact of “having a machine looking at you all the time that is devoted to killing you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panel discussed recent innovations like fiber-optic-controlled drones that cannot be jammed by electronic warfare systems. While not invincible, these drones represent the rapid technological evolution occurring on the battlefield. Connable provided important context, noting that drones have been part of warfare since World War II, with significant deployment since the 1980s. He cautioned against overgeneralizations, pointing out the unique conditions in Ukraine—a static 1,200-kilometer front line and industrial bases feeding endless drones—that may not exist in other conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;tanks-and-combined-arms&quot;&gt;Tanks and Combined Arms&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experts explored whether tanks still have relevance on modern battlefields. While Russian forces have suffered thousands of tank losses, Cancian noted that similar losses occurred in the Battle of Kursk during World War II without rendering tanks obsolete. Connable, citing his study of 423 modern battles, including 61 in Ukraine, asserts that tanks remain critical by providing “shock, speed, [and] mobile protected firepower up to the line of contact.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panel agreed that tanks are now “vulnerable but useful,” with their future effectiveness hinging on cost dynamics: How many multimillion-dollar tanks can militaries afford if they can be destroyed by swarms of thousand-dollar drones? Dutko emphasized that the psychological impact of tanks remains powerful, especially when used in coordinated assaults with infantry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;surprise-in-modern-warfare&quot;&gt;Surprise in Modern Warfare&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite claims about “transparent battlefields,” the panel affirmed that surprise remains possible at tactical and strategic levels. Cancian identified four types of surprise evident in this conflict: strategic (the war’s occurrence), technical (drone developments), political/diplomatic (NATO expansion), and battlefield (ongoing trench warfare resembling World War I).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experts agreed that while more sensors make hiding harder, deception and concealment remain important. As Dutko explained, forces now “try to conceal in different forests, buildings,” to hide as much as possible. Connable rejected the notion that technological advances will eliminate surprise, saying that “if it were [completely transparent] then nobody would be fighting anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;north-korean-involvement&quot;&gt;North Korean Involvement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panel discussed the 2024 addition of North Korean troops, whose human wave tactics have reportedly led to thousands of casualties, creating psychological challenges for defenders forced to kill large numbers of attackers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connable cited reports of Ukrainian machine gunners needing to be pulled off the line because they were killing so many North Koreans, echoing similar psychological trauma from the Iran-Iraq War. Barno identified this as an overlooked aspect of combat: “The psychological impact of killing is probably underestimated, especially killing masses of your adversary.” He questioned how militaries can prepare soldiers for this reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panel also noted that North Korea’s participation in this conflict marks its first battlefield experience since 1953, potentially making its military more capable for future conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-takeaways-2&quot;&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experts emphasized several key takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Surprise is inevitable in warfare—the focus should be on coping with it rather than avoiding it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Precision weapons face new challenges due to widespread jamming and countermeasures.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cyber warfare proved less decisive than many predicted.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;War remains fundamentally about people and physical control of territory, as summarized by Cancian: “If you really want to control it, occupy it, then you have to do it the same way the Roman legions did.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barno concluded by questioning whether the U.S. military is adequately preparing for adaptation: “How much time and energy and effort gets put into instilling a culture of rapid adaptation once you get in a battle where things don’t look like what you expected?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion emphasized that despite technological evolution, warfare’s human dimension remains paramount. The psychological burden of combat, the will to fight, and the capacity to adapt remain decisive factors that can determine victory or defeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;defense-industrial-base-lessons-from-russia-ukraine&quot;&gt;Defense Industrial Base Lessons from Russia-Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panel covered lessons for the defense industrial base and featured experts with firsthand experience in Ukraine’s defense innovation ecosystem: Dr. Phillip Karber, professor of military strategy and warfighting at the Eisenhower School; Mark Valentine, president and general manager of global government at Skydio; and Kateryna Bondar, CSIS fellow. The discussion was moderated by Captain Luke Slivinski, CSIS military fellow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;historical-context-and-industrial-base-transformation&quot;&gt;Historical Context and Industrial Base Transformation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PREWAR DEFENSE INDUSTRY CHALLENGES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the 2014 conflict, Ukraine’s defense industry faced systematic challenges. As Karber noted, approximately 43 percent of Russian weapon components came from Ukraine. The state conglomerate Ukroboronprom prioritized foreign military sales and employment over Ukraine’s own defense needs. Bondar highlighted that there appeared to be a targeted effort to weaken Ukraine’s defense industrial independence during President Yanukovych’s pro-Russia administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major prewar defense industry issues included underfunding of new developments, massive outflow of engineering talent due to lack of investment, and difficulties integrating Western technologies with Soviet legacy systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EVOLUTION AFTER THE 2014 CONFLICT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial 2014 conflict sparked the beginnings of transformation. Both volunteer groups and established defense entities began developing solutions to battlefield challenges. Software engineers created situational awareness and fire control systems when they recognized frontline troops lacked such capabilities. This organic response created the foundation for systems like Delta and Kropyva that were later formally adopted by Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;FULL-SCALE INVASION IMPACT AND RESPONSE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2022 full-scale Russian invasion dramatically accelerated transformation of Ukraine’s defense industrial base. Key developments included the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Civilian-military fusion:&lt;/strong&gt; Bondar described the development of “civil-military fusion in the Ukrainian way,” with IT professionals and engineers either joining the armed forces directly or providing technical support.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decentralized innovation:&lt;/strong&gt; Beyond formal defense industries, entrepreneurs and small groups emerged as significant innovation sources.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infrastructure damage:&lt;/strong&gt; Approximately 43 percent of Ukraine’s defense industrial facilities have been struck by Russian missiles. Karber highlighted one particularly devastating strike on a design bureau, in which 40 staff members who chose to continue working through air raid alarms were killed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Western equipment maintenance:&lt;/strong&gt; The Ukrainian defense industry pivoted to maintaining and modifying Western equipment, which often arrived with issues (dead batteries, missing reactive armor, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;rapid-innovation-cycles-and-field-testing&quot;&gt;Rapid Innovation Cycles and Field Testing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most emphasized insight from all the panelists was the unprecedented speed of innovation cycles in Ukraine. Karber observed that major changes in drone technology occur approximately every six months—dramatically faster than typical Western defense acquisition timelines. “We in the West, including the United States, are just not keeping up. It takes us six years to get it designed,” he noted. For software-based weapons systems, Bondar indicated the innovation cycle could be as short as one to two weeks, with immediate battlefield testing and feedback loops. Valentine highlighted how traditional U.S. acquisition processes rely on requirements developed years before contracts are awarded, often based on lessons from previous conflicts rather than emerging threats. He explained how Skydio’s drones, designed for U.S. military needs from the Iraq and Afghanistan era—where the United States controlled the airspace and spectrum—initially failed in Ukraine’s contested electronic environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;forward-deployed-engineers&quot;&gt;Forward-Deployed Engineers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A critical factor identified as enabling rapid innovation was the direct connection between developers and frontline users:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embedded development:&lt;/strong&gt; Valentine described deploying 20–30 multidisciplinary teams to Ukraine monthly, eventually establishing a permanent presence including Ukrainian engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organic process:&lt;/strong&gt; Bondar explained the process was not formally designed, but rather emerged naturally due to widespread mobilization—many engineers had friends or family at the front, creating direct feedback channels.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Combat experience:&lt;/strong&gt; Karber described seeing drones constructed in brigade workshops by scientists who were integrated into military units and taking direct feedback from combat operators.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;drone-warfare-evolution-and-challenges&quot;&gt;Drone Warfare Evolution and Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PROLIFERATION AND TACTICAL IMPACT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Karber detailed the progression from limited drone availability in 2014–15 to nearly company-level drone operations today. This proliferation has fundamentally changed battlefield dynamics, rendering previously survivable platforms like tanks highly vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ELECTRONIC WARFARE CHALLENGES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Russia and Ukraine rapidly developed electronic warfare capabilities. Early Ukrainian drones (like U.S.-provided Ravens) were vulnerable to Russian electronic warfare, sometimes being captured and turned against Ukrainian forces. Skydio had to transition from single-band radios to multi-band frequency-hopping capabilities to counter jamming. Visual inertial odometry technology also helped counter GPS jamming and spoofing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;FUTURE DIRECTIONS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panel discussed several emerging trends:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human-to-machine ratio evolution:&lt;/strong&gt; Valentine traced the evolution from MQ-1 drones, which require 60–70 personnel per drone, to one-to-one operator/drone relationships, to future concepts of one operator controlling multiple autonomous systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swarm development:&lt;/strong&gt; While true autonomous swarm capabilities remain experimental, multiple panelists identified this as a likely future direction. Bondar emphasized that effective swarms require sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) for autonomous decisionmaking and navigation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remote operations centers:&lt;/strong&gt; Valentine described an interim step between current operations and full swarm autonomy—operations centers where small teams could control hundreds or thousands of semiautonomous drones.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;supply-chain-and-production-scale-challenges&quot;&gt;Supply Chain and Production Scale Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SCALE REQUIREMENTS FOR PEER CONFLICT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Valentine highlighted the unprecedented scale of drone usage: “In certain phases of the war, the Ukrainians were going through 10,000 small drones a month.” He noted that existing U.S. stockpiles would only last about a month and a half at such consumption rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;STRATEGIC SUPPLY VULNERABILITIES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critical components like sensors, batteries, and chips often have international supply chains vulnerable to disruption. Valentine recounted how Skydio was sanctioned by China, cutting off access to battery components and forcing urgent development of Western alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;REGULATORY BARRIERS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several regulatory barriers were identified as hampering U.S.-Ukrainian cooperation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ITAR restrictions:&lt;/strong&gt; The International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) create significant challenges for technology transfer and collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Export control classifications:&lt;/strong&gt; Valentine noted that commercially available components (like thermal sensors available on Amazon) become highly restricted when incorporated into drone systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security classifications:&lt;/strong&gt; Karber mentioned difficulties providing Ukrainians with secure help due to classification restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;post-conflict-considerations-and-deterrence&quot;&gt;Post-Conflict Considerations and Deterrence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CEASEFIRE CHALLENGES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Karber emphasized that any potential ceasefire would face significant challenges. For one, Ukraine would need to maintain forces along a 2,000-kilometer potential front. Beyond that, Russia has historically violated previous agreements (Minsk I, Minsk II, Budapest, Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty). Without external enforcement, a ceasefire would be “inherently unstable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;REQUIREMENTS FOR LONG-TERM DETERRENCE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panel identified several requirements for sustainable Ukrainian security:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-sufficient defense industry:&lt;/strong&gt; Bondar emphasized the need for talent, funding, investment, and technology transfer to rebuild Ukrainian defense capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allied support:&lt;/strong&gt; Given the long-term nature of building defense industrial capacity, continued Western support is essential to “fill the gap.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Credible deterrence:&lt;/strong&gt; Valentine stressed that deterrence depends on demonstrating the capability to impose unacceptable costs on an adversary.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;policy-recommendations&quot;&gt;Policy Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panel offered several recommendations for U.S. policymakers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Streamline collaboration.&lt;/strong&gt; Reform ITAR and export control processes to facilitate faster U.S.-Ukrainian cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create strategic partnerships.&lt;/strong&gt; Establish formal partnerships to expedite technology transfers with key allies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secure supply chains.&lt;/strong&gt; Consider Defense Production Act authorities to establish domestic production of critical components and stockpile materials.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support knowledge transfer.&lt;/strong&gt; Establish deeper information sharing about Ukrainian battlefield innovations and tactical applications.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider production scale.&lt;/strong&gt; Reassess U.S. production capacity to meet the consumption rates demonstrated in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plan for the long term.&lt;/strong&gt; Support rebuilding Ukraine’s indigenous defense industrial capacity through investment and technical assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russia-Ukraine conflict has demonstrated dramatic changes in modern warfare, particularly regarding the speed of innovation cycles, drone proliferation, and electronic warfare evolution. The traditional Western defense acquisition model struggles to match the pace of battlefield-driven innovation seen in Ukraine. For the United States to maintain technological superiority and support allies, significant adaptations in regulatory frameworks, supply chain security, and innovation methodologies will be necessary. As Valentine succinctly stated, “It’s about deterrence. And if we can’t demonstrate that we have the capability to do something, that’s how deterrence fails and wars start.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;air-and-space-domain-lessons-from-russia-ukraine&quot;&gt;Air and Space Domain Lessons from Russia-Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Part One&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This panel, part one of two sessions, featured Austin Gray, cofounder of Blue Water Autonomy, and Major General Gregory Gagnon, deputy chief of space operations for intelligence at the U.S. Space Force. The event was moderated by Colonel Matthew Slusher, CSIS military fellow. Panelists discussed the impact of autonomous vehicles in warfare and the evolving role of space in modern conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;drone-warfare-evolution&quot;&gt;Drone Warfare Evolution&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gray, a former U.S. Navy intelligence officer with hands-on drone production experience inside of Ukraine, highlighted how autonomous vehicles have fundamentally transformed modern warfare thanks to several key characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extended range and reduced risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Drones allow forces to strike targets from greater distances while minimizing personnel exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accessible technology:&lt;/strong&gt; The hardware components for military drones are increasingly available through commercial channels, with many parts ordered from Amazon and Alibaba for Ukrainian production.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid development cycles:&lt;/strong&gt; Ukrainian forces update drone software nightly and hardware every few weeks, demonstrating agility that is impossible in traditional procurement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gray emphasized the importance of understanding cost and targeting dynamics through a framework where military assets are categorized along two axes: (1) cheap to expensive, and (2) easy to target versus difficult to target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This framework reveals the emergence of a critical middle category between expendable/attritable assets (like ammunition or infantry) and expensive survivable assets (like carrier groups). Autonomous systems like collaborative combat aircraft (CCA) occupy this middle space, where they are valuable enough to not be expendable but can take on dangerous missions without risking human lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gray argued that the U.S. defense procurement culture needs to shift toward a portfolio approach that embraces more risk-taking and competition between providers. He anticipates the main technological advancements will come not from breakthrough capabilities but from better integration of existing hardware and software, creating more resilient mesh networks and improved command and control systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;space-domain-insights&quot;&gt;Space Domain Insights&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gagnon offered critical observations about space operations in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which are summarized below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;INFORMATION CONFRONTATION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s Viasat cyberattack leading up to the invasion exemplified its “information confrontation” doctrine, which employs two types of control: (1) technical information, using cyber and electronic warfare to control communications; and (2) political information, controlling messaging and narratives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though intended to disrupt Ukrainian command and control, the attack had unintended consequences, affecting wind turbines in Germany and internet services across Europe. This demonstrated how gaining cyber and space superiority is an early objective in modern campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;RUSSIAN MILITARY FAILURES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being the world’s third most powerful conventional army prior to the invasion, Russia has failed to achieve space superiority in the conflict. There are a number of key factors for this failure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no professional non-commissioned officer corps capable of executing combined arms operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There has been an inability to integrate space assets into the “reconnaissance strike complex” due to organizational silos.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia has been unable to counter commercial satellite intelligence provided to Ukraine by Western partners.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CHINA-RUSSIA SPACE COOPERATION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conflict has accelerated concerning trends in Russia-China cooperation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chinese companies are providing commercial satellite imagery to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is growing economic integration between the two countries, including a 43 percent increase in bilateral trade in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China is supplying 90 percent of Russia’s microelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There has been increased joint military exercises including ground, maritime, and bomber operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;LOSS OF CONVENTIONAL SURPRISE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large conventional force buildups can no longer achieve strategic surprise thanks to the availability of commercial satellite imagery. Think tanks and news organizations could use satellite imagery to track and count Russian forces on Ukraine’s border before the invasion; Gagnon referred to this as the “commercial unblinking eye” that has the potential to benefit global security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;U.S. SPACE FORCE STRATEGY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. adversaries have increasingly weaponized space in recent years, and China is rapidly expanding its presence in space, adding 200 satellites per year in 2022 and 2023. In response to adversaries weaponizing space, the U.S. Space Force is taking steps to protect U.S. interests, including&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;moving from single, large satellites to proliferated architectures with increased resilience;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;increasing the number of U.S. satellites in space, with over 100 new satellites planned to be launched in 2025 alone;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;developing capabilities to protect U.S. assets and hold adversary assets at risk; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;countering China’s rapid space expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gagnon emphasized that the U.S. military’s reduced size—the Army is down from 732,000 personnel in 1990 to 445,000 personnel today, the Navy from 600 to 300 ships, and the Air Force from around 10,000 to around 5,000 aircraft—is only sustainable with space superiority. Without control of this high ground, a conflict with a peer competitor could resemble the stalemate in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-electromagnetic-spectrum-insights&quot;&gt;Key Electromagnetic Spectrum Insights&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both experts highlighted the critical importance of the electromagnetic spectrum in modern warfare. The electromagnetic spectrum is essential for targeting mobile assets from a distance and crucial for networking sensors, decisionmakers, and shooters. However, it is a domain in which the United States may have lost its edge after 20 years of fighting adversaries who didn’t challenge spectrum use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gray noted that despite electronic warfare and jamming attempts, drones continue to operate effectively through spectrum maneuver, resilient communications networks, and mesh networking principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-takeaways-3&quot;&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event highlighted several transformative lessons from the Russia-Ukraine conflict:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Drone proliferation is creating asymmetric opportunities for smaller forces and nonstate actors to challenge conventionally superior forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Space domain awareness has permanently altered the strategic calculus by eliminating the element of surprise for large conventional operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Force architecture evolution requires a spectrum of capabilities from expendable to survivable, with a critical middle zone of autonomous systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Human factors remain decisive; Russia’s failures have stemmed largely from organizational issues rather than technology gaps.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Space superiority is no longer optional but foundational to modern warfare, enabling smaller but more lethal conventional forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussions underscored the critical importance of investing in space capabilities, embracing autonomous systems, and developing professional military personnel who can execute combined arms operations in contested electromagnetic environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;air-and-space-domain-lessons-from-russia-ukraine-1&quot;&gt;Air and Space Domain Lessons from Russia-Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Part Two&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This panel was the second part of a CSIS event focused on air and space domain lessons from the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The discussion featured Lieutenant General Lance Landrum, former deputy chair of the NATO Military Committee, and Air Marshal Johnny Stringer, deputy commander of NATO Allied Air Command. The conversation, moderated by Colonel Matthew Slusher, explored critical insights about electronic warfare, contested logistics, air defense systems, drone warfare, and the future of NATO air doctrine in light of evolving modern warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;electronic-warfare&quot;&gt;Electronic Warfare&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE NEW CONTESTED ELECTROMAGNETIC ENVIRONMENT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Landrum emphasized that neither Russia nor Ukraine has achieved air superiority in this conflict, which has resulted in positional warfare and attrition. The contest for superiority in the electromagnetic spectrum is ongoing; unlike in Iraq and Afghanistan, where Western coalition forces operated uncontested in the electromagnetic environment, Ukraine represents a fully contested space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TECHNOLOGICAL REGRESSION AND ADAPTATION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Cold War, Western forces shed three decades of electromagnetic expertise, in both human capital and equipment modernization. Meanwhile, Russia formed specialized electromagnetic warfare units and developed capabilities that gave it superiority in certain areas. The conflict has demonstrated the vulnerability of GPS-dependent systems to jamming, forcing adaptation through alternative navigation methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;IMPACT ON MODERN SYSTEMS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly all modern systems rely on connectivity through the electromagnetic spectrum, making them vulnerable to interference. Specific examples include&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;jamming of GPS signals affecting autonomous systems’ navigation;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;disruption of communications networks;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;electronic eavesdropping and signals intelligence; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;tactical jamming of drone operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Landrum described how Russia initially operated small UASs in a specific frequency band. When Ukraine began jamming those frequencies effectively, Russia adapted by moving to different frequency bands, creating a temporary vulnerability window for Ukrainian forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;FUTURE DIRECTIONS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future systems will need to be “modern, agile, nimble, software-defined, and able to react and maneuver” within the electromagnetic space, as Landrum highlighted. Cognitive electronic warfare using machine learning and AI will be crucial for&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;rapidly sensing and analyzing the electromagnetic environment;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;automated decisionmaking at machine speed;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;deconflicting friendly systems from adversary jamming; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;managing the increasingly complex shared electromagnetic space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;contested-logistics&quot;&gt;Contested Logistics&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SUPPLY CHAIN VULNERABILITIES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukraine conflict has demonstrated the vulnerability of logistics centers, infrastructure, and transportation networks. Landrum noted that Western militaries have divested significant military logistics capabilities over decades, outsourcing to commercial industry for efficiency. This approach worked when operations had months of planning time in uncontested environments but is problematic when forces are facing contested spaces from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DISAGGREGATION FOR SURVIVAL&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key lesson is the need to disaggregate logistics and sustainment capabilities for survival while maintaining the ability to reaggregate them when needed. This presents significant command and control challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;INFRASTRUCTURE AND POLICY CHALLENGES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving forces across Europe faces numerous obstacles, such as road infrastructure and weight-bearing limitations, rail infrastructure and gauge changes in eastern Europe, inadequate port structures, customs regulations and border-crossing complexities, and the challenges associated with transporting hazardous materials across borders. Landrum emphasized that these procedures must be practiced and streamlined during peacetime operations to ensure smooth transitions during crises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;STOCKPILING AND SUPPLY CHAIN INNOVATION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russia-Ukraine conflict revealed inadequate stockpiling of critical munitions like artillery shells. With this in mind, future procurement strategies should&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;accept the cost of maintaining larger stockpiles;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;utilize additive manufacturing (e.g., 3D printing) for certain components;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;move away from proprietary systems toward interoperable solutions; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;improve command and control of disaggregated logistics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;air-defense-and-natos-adaptation&quot;&gt;Air Defense and NATO’s Adaptation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EVOLVING THREAT LANDSCAPE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evolving threat landscape has forced NATO to fundamentally rethink its approach to integrated air and missile defense. Stringer described how the modern battlefield now presents a dramatically expanded range of aerial threats, divided broadly into two categories. On the low end, inexpensive one-way attack drones and first-person view drones can be produced in the thousands, overwhelming traditional defenses through sheer volume. On the high end, advanced weapons like hypersonic missiles, including systems such as the AS-24 air-launched ballistic missile, pose existential challenges to existing detection and interception frameworks. This dual-threat environment demands a new level of speed, agility, and adaptability from NATO forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MULTILAYERED RESPONSE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response, NATO is developing a multilayered air and missile defense strategy built around several critical components. First, sensing capabilities must move beyond traditional radar systems, taking cues from Ukraine’s use of thousands of inexpensive acoustic sensors to detect incoming threats. Second, command and control structures must be modernized to facilitate faster, more flexible decisionmaking. Third, strategic force posturing and alert states must be recalibrated to reflect the dynamic threat environment, ensuring forces are ready to respond at varying levels of intensity. Finally, NATO must recognize that true defense requires a blend of both defensive and offensive actions—striking enemy launch sites and systems preemptively when necessary to blunt potential attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;AIR COMMAND AND CONTROL SYSTEMS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To support this evolving approach, NATO is making significant investments to enhance interoperability across its air command and control networks. This includes a renewed emphasis on standardization agreements to ensure common protocols and procedures across member states. Interoperability efforts also focus on bridging national air command and control systems, enabling seamless cooperation during joint operations. A modular approach to software development is replacing traditional monolithic systems, allowing NATO forces to rapidly integrate new technologies and tools. Additionally, intuitive user interfaces are being prioritized to reduce training burdens and increase system accessibility for operators. Supporting all of these initiatives is the cultivation of an agile development ecosystem that draws on multiple suppliers, fostering innovation and resilience across the alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;drone-warfare&quot;&gt;Drone Warfare&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DEMOCRATIZATION OF AIRPOWER&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stringer noted that drone technology has democratized airpower, allowing actors with limited resources to perform traditional airpower roles (air superiority, strike, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), and lift) at a fraction of the cost. This presents both challenges and opportunities for NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;HIGH-LOW MIX APPROACH&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While high-end military systems continue to grow more expensive, drones and related technologies provide opportunities for a “high-low mix” that can multiply effectiveness: Packaging cheaper drone systems with high-end weapons can reduce the number of expensive munitions needed, creating an effective increase in mass and weapons effectiveness&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BEYOND PLATFORM GENERATIONS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stringer argued that NATO should shift away from discussing generations of platforms (e.g., fifth-generation F-35) and instead focus on what sixth-generation warfare looks like—emphasizing integrated systems and combined capabilities rather than individual platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;future-of-nato-air-doctrine&quot;&gt;Future of NATO Air Doctrine&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;INTEGRATION AND UTILITY OF LEGACY SYSTEMS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both speakers emphasized that while new technologies are important, existing platforms can maintain utility through continuous upgrades of systems, imaginative employment strategies, and incorporation into broader, integrated force packages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CAPABILITY DEVELOPMENT THROUGH EXPERIMENTATION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO’s Allied Air Command is placing greater emphasis on capability development with new methods including weapons and tactics conferences (the first was held in 2023), high-end air exercises like Ramstein Flag, and synthetic training environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DETERRENCE THROUGH CREDIBILITY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effective deterrence requires forces with technical capability, sufficient capacity and numbers, and the credibility to win in a fight. Stringer emphasized integration across domains (multidomain operations) and providing a range of deterrent options that avoid a “cliff edge” between conventional and nuclear responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-takeaways-4&quot;&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Air superiority remains essential to prevent conflicts from devolving into costly attritional warfare.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Integration of kinetic and non-kinetic effects is becoming increasingly critical on the modern battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Greater use of autonomy and human-machine teaming is reshaping air operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Operating at machine speed through AI and advanced systems is now a necessity for maintaining an edge.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Continuous experimentation and validation are vital.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Stringer emphasized, NATO must relentlessly iterate and adapt to stay ahead of adversaries: “You’re never going to get to the place of perfection here. You have to be continually iterating what you’re doing so your opponents know that you are serious.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;space-and-data-domain-lessons-from-russia-ukraine&quot;&gt;Space and Data Domain Lessons from Russia-Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This panel discussion explored how space capabilities, data technologies, and commercial services have transformed warfare during the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Speakers were Giorgi Tskhakaia, adviser to Ukraine’s deputy prime minister and minister of digital transformation and innovations; Dr. David Gauthier, chief strategy officer of GXO Inc. and senior associate with the CSIS Aerospace Security Project; and Aaron Jaffe, senior vice president at Palantir. The discussion was moderated by Krista Auchenbach, CSIS visiting fellow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;digital-transformation-and-technological-adaptation&quot;&gt;Digital Transformation and Technological Adaptation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s Ministry of Digital Transformation has played a crucial role in the country’s resilience against Russia’s invasion. Established in 2019 to create a “government on a smartphone,” the ministry quickly adapted to wartime needs. The Diia app became essential for Ukrainians, providing digital passports that were recognized at international borders. The e-Enemy app allowed citizens to send valuable intelligence directly to the military, creating a crowdsourced intelligence network in the early days of the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the war began, Russia held superiority in conventional warfare aspects, including electronic warfare capabilities, ISR, artillery, and drone technologies. Ukraine compensated through technological innovation, moral superiority, and international support. Ukraine formed a cyber army of both professional and volunteer “ethical hackers” to defend critical infrastructure against Russian cyberattacks. Tskhakaia emphasized that “this is the war of technologies, of the minds,” noting that the character of the war continues to change dramatically every six months as new technologies emerge and countermeasures develop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;commercial-space-and-data-capabilities&quot;&gt;Commercial Space and Data Capabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war demonstrated how commercial satellite imagery could be effectively used for tactical battlefield operations rather than just strategic intelligence. Gauthier described how the U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency initially faced “bureaucratic challenges” and “cultural challenges” in providing direct, real-time satellite imagery to Ukrainian forces. The agency eventually established alternative dissemination paths through private industry companies, allowing raw imagery to flow directly to Ukrainian forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Radar imagery proves particularly valuable, enabling detection of Russian convoys through clouds and at night. Companies like Ursa Space use radar imagery to continuously monitor evacuation routes, check road clearance, and map damage to Ukraine’s electric grid infrastructure, supporting both military and civilian needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Radio frequency collection capabilities from firms like HawkEye 360 allow near-real-time mapping of GPS interference, helping Ukrainian forces identify and counter Russian electronic warfare activities. When Russia attempts to deny or attack remote sensing systems, private industry demonstrates remarkable resilience, finding ways to persist and adapt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;private-sector-partnerships-and-innovation&quot;&gt;Private Sector Partnerships and Innovation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panelists emphasized the critical importance of private sector partnerships in supporting Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jaffe highlighted how Palantir’s technologies, particularly AI features and computing power, significantly enhanced Ukraine’s capabilities. Palantir had to “evolve incredibly, incredibly quickly” to support changing on-the-ground conditions, he said, focusing on building meaningful common operating pictures by fusing disparate information, moving at the speed required by the dynamic intelligence and operational environment, and rapidly incorporating AI for imagery analysis and logistics automation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starlink’s deployment in Ukraine represented a “gamechanger” in the conflict, according to Tskhakaia. After Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov directly requested assistance from Elon Musk, the rapid response and deployment of Starlink terminals provided Ukraine with superior communication capabilities. This is one of the few areas where Ukraine has maintained a technological advantage over Russia, enabling reliable battlefield communications, coordination, and data flow throughout the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other companies like Amazon, Google, and Oracle have also provided valuable support. The panelists noted that private companies demonstrate greater flexibility and agility than government sectors in responding to Ukraine’s needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;technological-evolution-and-innovation-cycles&quot;&gt;Technological Evolution and Innovation Cycles&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One striking observation concerned the accelerated pace of technological innovation in Ukraine: From the onset of the war, Ukraine’s defense industrial base ballooned to over 500 companies producing various kinds of military equipment, including drones, unmanned ground vehicles, ammunition, and rockets. The Ukrainian government facilitated this growth by reducing regulatory requirements, creating tax incentives for military equipment producers, and enabling increased profit margins from 1 percent to 25 percent (above the 17 percent NATO average) to encourage risk-taking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tskhakaia noted that technological innovations in this conflict are typically replicated or countered within 6 to 12 months. This rapid cycle requires continuous innovation to maintain a battlefield advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;decisionmaking-and-the-ooda-loop&quot;&gt;Decisionmaking and the OODA Loop&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conflict has highlighted the critical importance of accelerating the “OODA” loop—observe, orient, decide, act. As Gauthier explained, commercial imagery and algorithmic warfare have significantly accelerated this cycle, allowing an “underdog” military to effectively counter a superior force relying on traditional doctrine and mass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jaffe emphasized that the primacy of decisions has shifted from incremental improvements to “one, two, three orders of magnitude faster” decisionmaking. Two key themes have emerged in this evolution:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integration:&lt;/strong&gt; Networks, warfighting functions, and supply chains are increasingly combined to bring stakeholders, information, and components together.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI incorporation:&lt;/strong&gt; AI is now used to improve detections, evaluate data, and make decisions at “the speed of relevance.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;shifting-the-power-dynamic-in-modern-warfare&quot;&gt;Shifting the Power Dynamic in Modern Warfare&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russia-Ukraine conflict has demonstrated that traditional military advantages like superior numbers of tanks or infantry are becoming less decisive. As Tskhakaia stated, “If you are not innovating constantly, you are going to be losing anyway.” The conflict has shown that technology and innovation are key factors in modern warfare, with data superiority providing significant advantages in decision quality and speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian experience of having a “transparent battlefield” has shifted the advantage from “hiders to finders,” creating a new dynamic in warfare. Drones, commercial satellite imagery, and advanced data analytics have fundamentally altered how military operations are conducted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;logistics-and-sustainment-are-warfighting-systems&quot;&gt;Logistics and Sustainment Are Warfighting Systems&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukraine conflict has underscored that logistics and sustainment systems are not merely administrative functions but critical warfighting systems. Jaffe noted that these systems directly constrain operational capabilities, making them “exceptionally integral” to operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Logistical networks challenges include&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;network interoperability issues across partner nations;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;disparities between advanced intelligence capabilities and basic sustainment systems;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;need for automation in logistics to enable “push” rather than “pull” models; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;importance of integrating the entire supply chain from frontline expenditure back to industrial base production.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-takeaways-5&quot;&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panelists concluded by sharing their main takeaways from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and implications for future wars:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information advantage and decision speed:&lt;/strong&gt; Commercial imagery and algorithmic warfare have enabled Ukraine to achieve tight decision cycles (OODA loops) against a superior military force. In future conflicts, systems designed to improve the quality and speed of decisions rather than simply processing information will gain an edge amid faster decision cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Direct delivery vs. curated intelligence:&lt;/strong&gt; Providing raw intelligence capabilities directly to frontline forces rather than curating solutions has allowed for innovative tactical use and adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Innovation cycles:&lt;/strong&gt; Technological advantages typically last at most a year before countermeasures are developed, requiring constant innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comprehensive integration:&lt;/strong&gt; Integration across networks, warfighting functions, and supply chains is essential and requires treating everything from the front line to the industrial base as one integrated system.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI as a force multiplier:&lt;/strong&gt; AI is transforming all domains from intelligence to logistics. Tskhakaia predicted that within a year, we’ll see “drones flying purely on AI” and AI-driven decisionmaking.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transparency and narrative control:&lt;/strong&gt; Commercial imagery helped Ukraine document Russian actions, bringing the reality of the conflict into living rooms worldwide and garnering international support. Despite technological shifts, the moral high ground remains a critical factor in sustained resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom-up innovation and user-centric design:&lt;/strong&gt; Providing tools directly to frontline forces enables innovative tactical solutions that would not emerge from top-down approaches, particularly when they can be easily adopted on smartphones with minimal training.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukraine conflict has become a testing ground for military technologies and operational concepts, accelerating innovation cycles and demonstrating how smaller nations can effectively counter larger adversaries through technology, adaptability, and international partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whole-of-society-resilience-lessons-from-russia-ukraine&quot;&gt;Whole of Society Resilience Lessons from Russia-Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This panel, which examined whole-of-society resilience lessons from the Russia-Ukraine War, featured Iryna Nykorak, Ukrainian member of parliament and founder of Arm Women Now; Kathleen McInnis, director of the CSIS Smart Women, Smart Power Initiative; and was moderated by Lieutenant Colonel Scott Murphy, CSIS military fellow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;bottom-up-resilience-the-foundation-of-ukraines-defense&quot;&gt;Bottom-Up Resilience: The Foundation of Ukraine’s Defense&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most significant insights highlighted throughout the discussion was that Ukraine’s successful resistance stemmed from a bottom-up approach rather than top-down government directives. Nykorak emphasized that Ukraine’s resilience came from its people, not its institutions: “This war has taught us many lessons, but perhaps the most important is this: Resilience is not built in institutions alone; it is built in people.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, thousands of Ukrainian civilians immediately volunteered for military service, while others supported the war effort as volunteers. Businesses donated supplies, and ordinary citizens found ways to contribute. This organic mobilization demonstrated a powerful will to fight that surprised many international observers who had predicted Ukraine would quickly fall due to Russia’s overwhelming military superiority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panelists noted that this grassroots, population-centric approach to national resilience represents a crucial lesson for other nations. Traditional security frameworks often focus on top-down, authority-directed preparations, but Ukraine’s experience suggests the importance of cultivating resilience at the population level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;womens-role-in-defense-and-the-evolution-of-military-equipment&quot;&gt;Women’s Role in Defense and the Evolution of Military Equipment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A substantial portion of the discussion centered on women’s contributions to Ukraine’s defense capabilities. Nykorak shared some remarkable statistics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ukraine has the largest number of women in combat positions globally.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over 70,000 women serve in the Ukrainian Armed Forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Approximately 50,000 women hold full combat positions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As of early 2025, about 25,000 women were actively serving at the front line (up from 5,000 in early 2024).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nykorak emphasized that “women are as capable as men of taking up arms and fighting” and have demonstrated high levels of efficiency across various combat roles, from combat medics to drone pilots to intelligence operatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion highlighted how women’s involvement is driving innovation in military equipment design. Nykorak demonstrated a specially designed female body armor that addresses anatomical differences and provides better protection while being lighter (weighing just 5 kilograms, compared to the standard 12-kilogram armor). This equipment is not just beneficial for women—it represents an advancement in human factors engineering for all soldiers, as male soldiers have also requested the lighter, more ergonomic equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This innovation also points to broader lessons about adapting military equipment to the evolving nature of warfare. As Nykorak explained, the war has transformed from traditional combat to a “war of drones,” where 96 percent of injuries come from shrapnel rather than bullets, necessitating different protective approaches for all soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;indigenous-production-and-economic-resilience&quot;&gt;Indigenous Production and Economic Resilience&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another remarkable achievement highlighted in the discussion was Ukraine’s ability to maintain and even grow its industrial base during wartime. In the face of the full-scale invasion, Ukrainian manufacturers have developed high-quality military equipment domestically, including uniforms, boots, and body armor, creating what Nykorak called a “win-win story”: These manufacturers employ internally displaced people, particularly women who have lost their homes and livelihoods due to the war. This approach simultaneously strengthens Ukraine’s military capabilities while providing economic opportunities for displaced citizens, demonstrating how whole-of-society resilience extends beyond military defense to include economic sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-arm-women-now-initiative&quot;&gt;The Arm Women Now Initiative&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nykorak described her organization, Arm Women Now, which advocates for equal opportunities and proper equipment for women serving in Ukraine’s defense and security sectors. The initiative has provided free equipment to more than 12,000 women defenders at the front line and works to amplify Ukrainian women defenders’ voices internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work demonstrates how civil society organizations can complement government efforts, especially in areas where bureaucratic systems may be slow to adapt. As Nykorak noted, as representatives of civil society, organizations like hers can move quickly to address immediate needs while advocating for systemic changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;implications-for-future-security-and-deterrence&quot;&gt;Implications for Future Security and Deterrence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion concluded with reflections on the broader implications of Ukraine’s experience for global security. McInnis emphasized that whole-of-society resilience should be considered a critical component of deterrence strategies: “When we’ve talked about deterring Russia, we talk about porcupine strategies, we talk about mutually assured destruction . . . whole-of-society resilience really does need to be a component of this broader suite of strategies necessary to convince Russia to not cross the line.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She noted that deterrence is fundamentally a psychological calculation, requiring a convincing demonstration of will and capability to resist. Ukraine’s experience shows that this will to fight—bolstered by whole-of-society resilience—can be decisive even when facing a numerically superior adversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nykorak added that “Putin understands only a language of power” and emphasized the need for both strong will and adequate military capabilities to deter future aggression. She characterized Ukraine as “a wall of security to all European countries,” suggesting that Ukraine’s resistance has broader implications for European security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-takeaways-6&quot;&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom-up versus top-down resilience:&lt;/strong&gt; Ukraine’s experience demonstrates that national resilience emerges from a population’s will to fight rather than solely from government or military directives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inclusive defense forces:&lt;/strong&gt; Integrating women into combat roles has significantly expanded Ukraine’s military capabilities, with tens of thousands of women serving effectively in frontline positions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human-centered equipment design:&lt;/strong&gt; The war has driven innovations in military equipment that account for human factors and anatomical differences, improving effectiveness for all soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Domestic production capabilities:&lt;/strong&gt; Even during wartime, Ukraine has maintained and developed its industrial base, producing high-quality military equipment domestically while creating employment opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Civil society complementing government:&lt;/strong&gt; Organizations like Arm Women Now demonstrate how civil society can address needs quickly while advocating for systemic changes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whole-of-society deterrence:&lt;/strong&gt; Ukraine’s experience suggests that whole-of-society resilience should be considered an essential component of deterrence strategies, complementing traditional military capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evolving nature of warfare:&lt;/strong&gt; The transition to a “war of drones” requires adaptations in equipment and tactics, highlighting the importance of flexibility and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This discussion offers valuable insights for other nations considering how to build societal resilience in the face of potential threats, emphasizing that military hardware alone is insufficient without the corresponding will to fight and whole-of-society mobilization capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike most Taiwanese Lunar New Years, which traditionally commence with quiet family gatherings, in 2025 the Year of the Snake started with nationwide mobilisation as citizens took to the streets. They began gathering signatures for petitions to recall as many as 50 lawmakers from a total 111 seats in the Legislative Yuan (LY)in a fight for the survival of the island’s democracy. The “Recall War”, led by Robert Tsao – a chip billionaire who forsook retirement abroad and moved back to Taiwan, staking his personal fortune to establish the paramilitary Kuma Academy whose sworn aim is to prevent the “Hong Kong-isation of Taiwan” – is the latest battle in the silent war for Taiwan’s future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stress-testing-the-legislative-yuan-power-grabs-budget-blocking-and-the-recall-war&quot;&gt;Stress-testing the Legislative Yuan: Power Grabs, Budget Blocking and the Recall War&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The immediate trigger for the Recall War was budget-blocking and swingeing cuts imposed by the LY. The cuts froze NTD 207.5 billion – equivalent to approximately £4.83 billion and comprising up to 34% of total Executive Yuan spending – without accounting for the total elimination of a $100bn subsidy. The subsidy, paid to the Taiwan Power Company was designed to shield consumers from a spike in prices caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The annual budget, which should have been approved by 30 November 2024, was hurriedly passed in politically fraught circumstances after only two days of review on 21 January 2025. Budget slashing was in turn preceded by an abortive attempt by the Kuomintang (KMT)-dominated LY to fundamentally reengineer the balance of power in Taiwan’s political system by passing legislation to arrogate vast powers from the executive and judiciary and dismantle checks and balances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking the cat even further back, that constitutional coup was launched in May 2024 a month after the KMT’s chief whip Fu Kun-chi led a 25-member delegation to Beijing to meet with Wang Huning, Xi Jinping’s ideologue-in-chief who, officially number four on the CCP hierarchy, heads the United Front and is in charge of Taiwan policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If polarisation between natives (benshengren) and the rump of the KMT that fled to Taiwan in the aftermath of China’s civil war (waishengren) is the root of almost all political disputes in Taiwan, the proximate cause of this constitutional crisis is the hung parliament delivered by the electorate in 2024. Despite winning the presidency and more votes than any other party in the LY elections, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) only won 49 seats in the LY, whereas the KMT took 54 with the balance of power being held by the Taiwan People’s Party’s (TPP) nine legislators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That result partly reflected Taiwan’s complex hybrid electoral system, disaffection with the DPP who have been in power since 2016, as well as established voting patterns whereby the electorate tends to vote according to national security considerations in the presidential elections and along economic lines in LY elections. Significantly, TPP supporters voting for Taipei’s techno-populist former mayor Ko Wen-je comprise a young demographic primarily motivated by economic factors such as house prices and job creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While divided government is not new for Taiwan’s resilient democracy – Chen Shui-bian’s two administrations from 2000-2008 mirrored the present insofar as the DPP and KMT respectively controlled the executive and legislature – then-leader of the LY Wang Jin-pyng was a consummate deal-maker who frequently reached across the aisle to find common ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In lieu of such a parliamentarian, today the incumbent Speaker is Han Kuo-yu, the former firebrand mayor of Kaohsiung whose credentials to run for President in 2020 were questioned by his own party members. They alleged alcoholism, gambling, womanising and a distinctly lacklustre work ethic. In that election Han enjoyed a large lead in the polls over Tsai Ing-wen until the brutal crackdown in Hong Kong, during which Han made a politically-disastrous, high-profile visit to demonstrate solidarity with the HKSAR government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other key difference is the subversion factor: during the KMT Administration of Ma Ying-jeou from 2008-16, comprehensive Cross-Strait engagement enabled the United Front Work Department (UFWD) and China’s intelligence services to comprehensively penetrate the ganglia of Taiwanese society, including political and military elites and right down to organised crime and grass roots organisations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the term “fifth column” is not currently used in PRC doctrine, it frequently appears in memoirs of underground CCP operatives who infiltrated the KMT and perhaps turned the tide in China’s civil war. More recently, former deputy director of the Taiwan Affairs Office and PLA Maj Gen (ret.) Wang Zaixi floated the “Beiping Model”, a reference to a month-long siege of Beijing in 1949 culminating in the encircled KMT commander’s surrender following secret talks that were facilitated by his wife and secretary, both of whom were underground agents of the CCP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allegations of subversion are necessarily difficult to prove. However, a report published by the National Security Bureau in January highlighted an uptick in convictions, increasing fourfold in as many years, two thirds of which were of retired and serving military personnel. Previously hypothesised links between politicians and the UFWD are now supported by evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, an undercover documentary exposing how Taiwanese influencers are targeted with junkets and hospitality in Xiamen included a visit to the offices of a UFWD newspaper adorned with personal calligraphy professing the wisdom of Han Kuo-yu. That documentary also revealed as many as 200,000 PRC passports had been covertly issued to Taiwanese; and informal conversations with intelligence officers confirm that there is active monitoring and investigations of LY members suspected of being agents of Beijing and holding PRC passports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is beyond any shadow of a doubt is deep-blue members of the KMT are following a deliberate strategy to paralyse the LY in their bid to undermine the Administration of Lai Ching-te. Thus there is a clear convergence of interest between elements of the KMT and China, which is the main beneficiary of legislative chaos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should be assessed in the context of well-known linkages between these elements and the Chinese Communist Party. Moreover after Xi jettisoned the ambiguity of the “One China Respective Interpretations” (yi zhong ge biao) formula in 2019, leaving space only for “peaceful reunification” under Hong Kong-style One Country Two Systems, the architect of the 1992 Consensus pivoted to become a key proponent of the “America Scepticism Theory” (yi mei lun) propagating “abandoned chess piece” narratives which insinuate the US cannot and will not defend Taiwan in event of a PLA invasion under any circumstance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-things-might-play-out&quot;&gt;How things might play out&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The KMT-TPP legislative power-grab has largely failed. In October 2024 the Constitutional Court ruled that most aspects of the reforms enacted were unconstitutional, including empowering the LY to summon the President to answer questions, conferring on the LY the power to set up “investigative committees” (beyond the scope of pre-existing legislative committees). These were endowed with vast powers to inquire into government agencies and impose criminal penalties on uncooperative witnesses and criminal sanctions for “reverse interpellation”, meaning government officials cannot express disagreement, request clarification or disagree with the interrogating legislator; and the power to extensively question nominees before approving or rejecting their nomination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The grounds cited by the Court for ruling the foregoing unconstitutional were the separation of powers. The subtext of this decision being that the proper way to drastically remake Taiwan’s political system would be through constitutional amendment (a mathematical and political impossibility at present). In response to the ignominy of defeat, the KMT has renewed rhetoric of “green terror”, refused to process the nominations for seven of the 15 grand justices whose term expired in November 2024 and passed (likely unconstitutional) legislation requiring a majority of 10 grand justices for all Constitutional Court decisions, effectively paralysing the Judicial Yuan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One interpretation of this spectacular overreach might be that a similar UFWD playbook was deployed successfully in Hong Kong to consolidate CCP authority over the legislature and courts. However, a key distinction – apart from the formidable capabilities of Taiwanese counter-intelligence – is that in Hong Kong after 1997 the PRC wielded a de facto veto power over the courts through article 158(3) of the Basic Law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This short-circuited the rule of law by vesting the power of final interpretation in the National People’s Congress Standing Committee, and through a judicial appointment system whose members included government officials and were legally gagged from discussing deliberations. Thus, a system was created that was ripe for infiltration, manipulation and abuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, PRC objectives in Hong Kong were limited by comparison. They merely sought to silence political dissent in a city over which Beijing already exercised military control. The maximalist goal of PRC grey zone activities in Taiwan is to take over an entire independent island with its own armed forces and backed by an international coalition of powerful allies. Besides, in Taiwan the ability of PRC agencies to infiltrate the fabric of society is manifestly not matched by their grasp of the niceties of constitutional law, hence the magnitude of this miscalculation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As regards the ongoing Recall War, the aim of which is for the DPP to clawback a legislative majority in the absence of a mechanism to dissolve parliament, this is unlikely to succeed due to procedural barriers that effectively require petitions signed by 11% of the relevant electorate, followed by a majority in a referendum with a turnout of at least 25%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outcome will probably not be known before September 2025, however, of the first 28 from 50 cases, 19 have passed, all of which were initiated by the DPP. Nine KMT petitions failed because too many signatures were invalidated. Notably, in New Taipei City hundreds of signatures were from dead people, most of whom had passed away before signing the petitions, implying forgery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications-for-cross-straits-stability-and-policy-recommendations&quot;&gt;Implications for Cross-Straits Stability and Policy Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While legislative brawls have been a feature more than a bug of Taiwan’s rambunctious democracy for almost three decades (to which political scientists have dedicated monographs), this latest twist has serious implications for Cross-Strait stability, perhaps no more so than in respect to budget cuts and freezes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against the backdrop of Trump Administration officials calling for Taiwan to spend as much as 5-10% of its GDP on Defence, pro-China groups within the LY have a coordinated strategy to drive a wedge between Taipei and Washington, the calculation being to impose a dilemma on the Lai Administration by making it impossible to increase defence spending. This dilemma could turn abandonment by the United States into a self-fulfilling prophecy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, despite proposing to continue the past decade’s increase of defence spending to NTD 647 billion (around 2.5% of GDP), in fact the LY cut spending by 3% in 2025. Substantively, several key programmes instrumental to the island’s defence are impacted: 50% of the Indigenous Defense Submarine programme has been frozen; as has 50% of the budget of the Aerospace Park in southern Taiwan, a private sector collaboration to manufacture dual-use drones; and the Ministry of Digital Affairs’ cyber resilience budget has been slashed by 56% to NTD 300 million, increasing Taiwan’s vulnerability to hybrid warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although fear of abandonment looms large in Taiwan’s public psyche following Washington’s switch of diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979, the strategy of strangling the LY may still backfire. Firstly, political support for the king-making TPP is collapsing following the jailing of its charismatic leader on corruption charges in December 2024. Ko Wen-je himself is a technocrat who never discussed Cross-Strait relations during his election campaign. His platform while presiding over the Shanghai-Taipei forum as mayor of Taipei was simply to have a good working relationship with Beijing so that Taipei could focus on the economic issues that younger voters cared most about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, in coalition with the KMT the TPP’s populist vote for Ko has been hijacked; and notably a number of TPP members had originally defected from the KMT going back to the 9-in-1 local elections in 2022, which raises questions about infiltration. It remains to be seen whether the TPP will continue to support the KMT, especially as the Lai Administration enhances counter-intelligence as through the recently announced17 measures; if the legislative tide turns, in addition to reintroducing military courts, Lai will likely heed calls from experts such asPeter Mattis to increase prison sentences for espionage-related offences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, Taiwan’sdefence spending is not low in absolute terms (in fact it is more than Singapore’s) or as a proportion of overall government spending (15% comparable to South Korea and Israel). There is significant scope to increase it further through taxation and borrowing; Taiwan’s tax burden is only 9.2% of GDP, which is very low by OECD and even Asian standards, and its borrowing is 24.2% with scope to increase up to 40.6% of GDP averaged over three years under the terms of the Public Debt Act. In other words, were the KMT-TPP coalition to continue its lawfare campaign in the LY until the next election in 2028, mechanisms exist to enable the Lai Administration to continue to fulfil the defence commitments it has pledged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is scope for like-minded partners and allies to shore up peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific through strategic communications pushing back against narratives of abandonment. Given the Trump Administration’s suspension of Voice of America and Radio Free Asia broadcasting, the BBC and DeutscheWelle could revive their dormant capacities. Diplomats can communicate to Washington the underappreciated impact of an attempted constitutional coup akin to Hitler’s 1933 Reichstag Enabling Act that snuffed out the democratic flame of the Weimar Republic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With respect to counter-subversion assistance, liaison relationships could be deepened by embedding Western officers in Taiwan’s national agencies who would be able not only to contribute deep professional expertise but also would stand to learn from frontline deployments about how to tackle CCP subversion at home. In the face of supply-side issues with US arms sales, like-minded partners and allies might consider selling weapons to Taiwan and there is significant untapped potential for thinking more creatively in terms of military assistance and financing structures for arms deals. Beyond the geo-strategic and economic implications of Taiwan being annexed by the PRC, ideationally, extinguishing the sole remaining beacon of Chinese democracy would feed the fallacy that China is unsuited to democracy and render the prospect of political liberalisation that could stabilise strategic competition even more remote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the period direct Iranian and Russian intervention in the Syrian civil war (2015-2024), evidence started emerging of less than frictionless cooperation between the two allies. There were reports of clashes between militias and military units aligned with Tehran and Moscow, and disagreements over the reform and restructuration of the Syrian armed forces. Researcher Mahmoud Alloush later talked of “competitive cooperation,” explaining that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is a strategic intersection of interests between the two countries in supporting the regime during the Syrian revolution, but competitive factors have become more dominant in shaping this relationship after the course of the war and military operations turned in favor of al-Assad…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, while friction between Russia and Iran, and between Iranian and Russian proxies and allies, was widely reported, the drivers of this friction were never analyzed in detail. That friction occurred at multiple levels – in the field, within the bureaucracy, within the diplomatic sphere, over economic affairs – and had multiple drivers. This paper focuses on Iran and Russia’s competition for influence in Syria as a major source of friction in security and economic affairs. Why is this important now that the Assad regime has collapsed? A granular analysis of that competition tells us a lot about the relationship between Russia and Iran, about their intervention strategies, about their strategic cultures and about their state-building approaches (or lack thereof).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper therefore seeks to answer two main questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why did Russia and Iran end up competing so much in Syria?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What factors hampered efforts to cooperate more smoothly?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper is organized into four sections. The first section details the evidence of friction between Iran and Russia over the Syrian military and the Syrian economy and discusses the two countries’ efforts to coordinate nonetheless. The following section looks at the impact (in terms of generating friction) of Iran and Russia’s favoring two very different approaches to fixing the crisis in the Baathist state in Syria. The third section discusses the struggle for influence over the Syrian armed forces. Finally, the fourth section looks at how this competition ended, with Iran emerging as dominant but ultimately lacking the resources to keep the Assad regime afloat at the end of 2024, when what turned out to be the final, victorious offensive of the opposition forces was launched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researching this topic required a number of methodological compromises, given that conducting primary research in Syria was extremely difficult until 2024. There are other obvious limitations to the research methodology adopted, with research by necessity mostly limited to oral sources, with support from the literature and news reports, but no access to primary written sources: the body of data collected is inevitably incomplete; gaps abound; and following up on specific themes was often impossible. The analysis contained in the paper inevitably reflects this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the oral sources proved to be quite approachable. The risk inherent in this type of research is not obtaining access. There are other risks as well: that interviewees might be affected by a social-desirability bias, resulting in overstating their achievements, capabilities and/or resources; or by reverse causation, leading them to provide prejudiced information about rival organizations. Mitigation measures are discussed below. The research methodology was a hybrid of investigative journalism and ethnographic interviews. The questionnaires were adapted to each interviewee; there were, in fact, as many different questionnaires as there were interviews. The questions evolved as knowledge of ongoing trends and developments expanded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interviews were commissioned to local researchers. All of them have a background in journalism and/or research, had participated in previous research projects with a similar typology of interviewees and were trained to undertake research with a similar methodology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The risk that respondents might use the interviews to influence external observers or misrepresent the facts, or both, was assumed from the start. It was mitigated by consulting different types of interviewees – such as government officials and military officers, Iranian and Russian officers and diplomats, and members of militias – who represented contrasting points of view; by interviewing individuals separately and without their being aware of other interviews taking place; and by inserting questions to which the answer was already known, in order to verify responses. It proved particularly helpful to present interviewees with information gathered from other sources. Public-domain sources, such as media reports and analytical studies, were also used, where available, to check the credibility of interviewees. Researchers were chosen who did not know each other to avoid the risk of researcher collusion to manipulate the content of interviews, for example, by inventing content to produce whatever they might have believed the project team wanted to hear. This is always a risk when interviews are carried out by field researchers as part of a remotely managed project. The field researchers were also informed that the purpose of the effort was simply to ascertain facts and that there was no premium placed on specific findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interviewees were told that their answers would be used in an open-access publication, the type of which was not specified. The interviews were carried out in part face-to-face and in part over the phone – some interviewees were in locations that were difficult to access. All the interviews have been anonymized and all data that could lead to the identification of interviewees has been removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In total, the paper relies on 48 interviews carried out between 2016 and 2024. Of these, 10 were with Syrian military personnel and militiamen, eight with members of foreign militias fighting for the Assad regime, eight with Syrian officials, seven with Russian diplomats and military advisors, and 13 with Iranian advisors from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and army or Iranian diplomats, plus one local notable in Aleppo and one journalist working for the Syrian regime’s media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;evidence-of-friction-between-iran-and-russia-in-syria&quot;&gt;Evidence of friction between Iran and Russia in Syria&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;armed-clashes-among-proxies&quot;&gt;Armed clashes among proxies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is significant evidence of serious friction between Iran and Russia in Syria. The media (largely hostile to the Assad regime) regularly reported clashes between different militias identified as proxies of Russia and Iranand even direct clashes between IRGC and Russian military police. The first reports of clashes between pro-Iranian and pro-Russian factions date back to 2015. In December 2015, for example, regime regular forces reportedly engaged in armed scuffles in Homs with fighters loyal to a fiercely pro-Iranian commander of Quwat al-Ridha, a group within the National Defense Forces (NDF) backed by Hizbullah and the IRGC. The media sources and foreign diplomats are not neutral, however, mostly sympathizing either with the opposition or with regional powers opposed to Assad. This section will focus on evidence from Iranian, Russian and pro-regime Syrian sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example involved the Tiger Force, which became Russia’s client militia of choice in the coastal area, due to the local NDF unit being too close to Iran. The Russians favored the expansion of the Tiger Force by offering generous pay deals to recruits, in the hope of counterbalancing the power of the militias linked to Iran and to favor the Force’s expansion. Friction between the Tiger Force’s leader, Sohail al Hassan, and President Assad’s brother Maher is confirmed by a Syrian intelligence officer, who put at 37 the number of those dying. The direct cause of the clash was Maher’s jealousy at al Hassan emerging as one of the towering military leaders on the regime’s side. As the Tiger Force grew, its commander al Hassan came into conflict with Maher al-Assad:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Maher al Assad, as all members of the al-Assad family, doesn’t like to see any strong and popular officer or leader who is not one of them. […] General Maher al-Assad wanted and still wants to destroy General Suheel and his Tiger Forces / 25th Special Task Division, but the Russians prevent this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sources aligned with the regime or with Russia confirmed that other armed clashes had happened. A Russian officer acknowledged that clashes between Iranian-backed groups and Russian-backed groups were relatively frequent and mentioned a major clash in Deir ez Zor between the Russian military police, the 5th AC and Liwa al Quds on one side and Iranian-backed groups such as Hezbullah and Fatimiyun on the other. He also mentioned other major clashes in Aleppo over Al Nayrab airport, in Daraa and in Al-Zuhra – always over territorial control. The clashes in Aleppo were confirmed by a source in Liwa al Quds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one point, according to a Russian officer, following a particularly bloody clash between militias linked to Iran (Hezbollah and Fatimiyun) and others linked to Russia (Liwa al Quds, Baath Brigades and Nosur al Zawbah), in which the pro-Iranian former lost 60 killed and after which the Iranians were about to end their relationship with Russia for good. The Russians, however, managed to get negotiations going to resolve issues and reportedly succeeded. This clash and the ensuing verbal exchanges show that direct clashes between armed formations were not the only form of friction and that clashes among Iranian and Russian proxies and allies did not leave the two powers indifferent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;direct-iran-russia-friction&quot;&gt;Direct Iran-Russia friction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russians used the leverage deriving from their air power quite ruthlessly. Already in the aftermath of fighting in Khan Touman in early May 2016, Iranian officers and media complained about Russia’s failure to deploy their air assets in support of IRGC units and pro-Iranian militias. According to one source, the Russian and Syrian air force allegedly refused to provide air support to the Fatimiyun Brigades and other militias operating under direct IRGC command even on later occasions. According to a Russian adviser, the Russians asked the Iranians to encourage at least the militias they did not directly control to merge into the Syrian army (SAA), but the IRGC refused. In retaliation, the Russians suspended any support not long before the war in Ukraine started, in particular close air support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russians also had financial and diplomatic leverage, which they did not hesitate to use. They were clear that they were ready to stop financial and diplomatic support to Syria if they lost too much influence over Damascus. The Syrian regime had to yield to Russian pressure. One IRGC officer confirmed that the regime, spurred on by the Russians, warned homegrown regime-aligned militias not to cooperate with Iranian-backed militias carrying out operations outside of the chain of command of the Syrian Ministry of Defense (MoD).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another IRGC officer believed that it was the Russians advising Assad to get pro-Iranian militias out of Aleppo and replace them with the Syrian army. This source was frank about the competition with the Russians: “We want to have our groups here in Aleppo and […] Russia did not win the war in Syria, Iran did. […] We are trying to override the Russians.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IRGC, meanwhile, put pressure on Damascus by pulling its militias back from the front line, forcing the regular SAA to take on the brunt of the fighting. The IRGC wanted to expand the ranks of the militias and get its friends appointed to senior positions in the government, in response to Russian pressure to marginalize its Syrian clients. It is unclear how effective this was in counterbalancing Russian pressure, but after the Russians deployed their air force to Syria, Damascus is likely to have been keener on keeping air power than Iran’s foreign militias.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2019 cooperation between the Russians and Iranians had become brittle. Significantly, the center for coordinating advisers, which brought together Iranians and Russians, was closed in March 2019. Moreover,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Some time ago, they were working jointly with the Syrian military, but now when one (i.e., either Russian or Iran) is there in training, the other is not joining them, and this clearly shows major differences between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The differences in approach between Russian and Iranian advisers affected planning and operations, according to a senior official of the Syrian government speaking in 2017:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;They have problems with and hostility toward each other, […] when one side is giving an opinion, the other side is showing opposition, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were also tussles over who would commander specific operations, Russia or Iran, such as in Deir Ez Zor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems clear that the military effort was negatively affected by this friction, even if the impact of Russian air power was so important that the trend remained largely positive for the regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two-models-for-syria-irans-parallel-network-and-russias-resurrected-central-state&quot;&gt;Two models for Syria: Iran’s parallel network and Russia’s resurrected central state&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What caused the high level of friction among nominal allies? One factor is that Iran and Russia intervened in Syria with very different military, strategic and state-building cultures. The Russians at the start thought the key to stabilizing Syria was rebuilding a strong Baathist state, starting with the SAA. In addition, the Russians were in favor of depoliticizing the SAA (at least to some degree) and, after reconciling elements of the armed opposition, incorporating them into the army. As the Russian approach has been described in some detail elsewhere, here the author will focus on the Iranian approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;irans-approach&quot;&gt;Iran’s approach&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IRGC saw clearly that the Russian advisers in Syria had a different conception of fighting, based on creating a maneuverable force as the centerpiece of the military strategy. The Iranians instead thought in terms of establishing an ideologically motivated force, essentially by building a structure parallel to that of the remnants of the old Baathist state. Initially the intent was to support the crumbling structure of the old Baathist state, but eventually the new parallel structure was to share power with it, similar to the Iranian model. The Iranians advocated the creation of an IRGC-, Basij- or Hezbollah-like structure alongside (or even in place of) the existing Syrian MoD forces, which they deemed to be beyond repair and incapable of being brought back to the strength required to save the regime. Getting their protégé militias to participate in the establishment of new, partially depoliticized and centralized armed forces, as advocated by the Russians, had no appeal to the Iranians. Quite the contrary, the Iranians even seemed to be preparing to create political parties based on the pro-Iranian militias, following the Iraqi model. The formation of SAA units out of reconciled rebels was so strongly opposed by the Iranians that the Syrian government feared there could be armed clashes between them and the new brigades of reconciled opponents, such as the 8th Brigade. The Iranians alleged that the former rebels were “Wahhabis” who still maintained relations with Turkey and the Gulf monarchies and thus saw them as competitors of the pro-Iranian militias.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the longer term, the IRGC did not hide its ambition to turn the Syrian Shi’a militias it sponsored into entities that could be deployed outside of Syria, as happened with Iraqi and Lebanese groups. As Mahmood Shoori has noted,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For Iran, of course, the government [of Syria] is not everything. The experience of working in the Middle East has taught Iranian leaders that playing an active role in regional developments requires multiple choices. Iran’s advisory presence in Syria over the past few years has provided an opportunity for Iran to engage effectively with various religious and social groups and build capacity to prevent the formation of threat centers against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An IRGC commander was even more explicit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As we brought people from Afghanistan as part of Fatimiyun and as we brought people from Pakistan as part of Zaynabiyun, we would do the same with Syrian militias if we needed them in a different country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Once complete victory was achieved,” said an Iranian diplomat in early 2017, “the foreign volunteer militias should be allowed to remain in Syria.” Iran also intended to settle Shi’a militiamen on land it bought in southern Syria. None of this appealed at all to the Russians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mutual-rejection&quot;&gt;Mutual rejection&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already in 2016, the Iranians were getting nervous that the Russian plans to fold the militias into the SAA were turning into a serious point of disagreement. According to an IRGC commander, the Iranians pushed back on the Russian plans, and the main argument they used was that the decay of the SAA was irreversible:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We told the Russians at the beginning that these policies would not work as most of the militias […] were not interested in being part of the regular army, so the Russians spent loads of money and physical energy reorganizing the army, but it was not enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another IRGC source called the militias the “Basij military,” referring to the Iranian paramilitary force controlled by the IRGC, and explained that “If they merge with the army, then the army will not fight very well […]. Separate is good.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IRGC did not just complain; it took action. After the plans to fold the militias into the SAA was approved by the Syrian MoD over Iranian opposition, the IRGC tried to sabotage the effort by strengthening its and Hezbollah’s control over the largest militias, such as the NDF and the Local Defense Force (LDF), and by severing the chain of command of many militias with the Syrian MoD. It also tried to blackmail the Assad regime by suspending its funding to the NDF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iranian criticism of the Russian effort to bring the militias under the chain of command of the MoD was not unwarranted. Anton Mardasov and Kirill Semyonov endorse some of the Iranians’ points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The failures accompanying the formation of the 4th Corps […] were also due to the Russian military having failed to take into account local specifics: few of the militia groups wanted to lose their independence and be incorporated into the organizational structure of the SAA as military personnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian-sponsored military reforms were hampered by Syria’s political and social realities. Mardasov further elaborated (with regard to folding militias into the SAA) that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Most militias were reluctant to lose their autonomy, abide by the personnel and organizational rules of the Syrian army and be integrated into it, with the militants to be granted the status of official servicemen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Syrian official spoke frankly, essentially endorsing the abovementioned arguments of Mardasov and Semyonov, noting that “most of these militias” were involved in criminal activities, while they enjoyed power locally and were benefiting from the Iranian presence in Syria, so they had no interest in joining the army and losing these advantages. While the Russians were highly skeptical of Iran’s approach and claimed that the pro-Iranian militias were in practice nowhere near as effective as the Iranians were touting, one Russian diplomat acknowledged that given the “state of affairs” and Iran’s active opposition to plans to rebuild the SAA, the chances of Russia’s plans succeeding were very low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, the Iranians argued, the IRGC- or Hezbollah-like structure that they proposed, based on hybrid forces that were to be adaptable and capable of fighting asymmetrically, would be more cost-effective and could also protect Syria from external challenges (read: Turkey and Israel). The Syrian government always openly rejected the Iranian plan. Syrian critics argued that the militias supported by Iran performed poorly on logistics and coordination, pointing out essentially that the Iranians never came close to forming anything resembling a Syrian Hezbollah or Basij and that the Syrian militias sponsored by Iran often suffered from the same issues as the SAA, including corruption. The regime remained formally committed to the rehabilitation of the SAA. It might have been worried about Iranian influence more than anything else. Meanwhile, even an IRGC commander acknowledged that Iran’s plans for creating a Syrian Hizbullah or IRGC were never very realistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Syrian government is not accepting that […] they have a weak army; they say we have a strong army, and they are totally against making an army like Hizbullah and Sepah Pasdaran, […] and they are saying that Syria will not let any kind of militia run part of the government now or in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-struggle-for-the-syrian-armed-forces&quot;&gt;The struggle for the Syrian armed forces&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran and Russia did not just subscribe to different concepts of the state and to different approaches to fighting and state-building. There was at least another and possibly more important source of friction between Iran and Russia in Syria: the desire to expand their influence within the Syrian armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russian-and-iranian-narratives&quot;&gt;Russian and Iranian narratives&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian narrative explaining the poor performance of the Syrian armed forces was that the Syrians had promoted “a lot of useless people in the army.” According to a Russian adviser, the Russians pushed for what they deemed to be capable military leaders from militias such as Liwa al Quds, Liwa Zainabiyoun, Mukhtar army, Liwa Abu Al Fadhal Al Abbas and Liwa Al Imam Al Hussein to be appointed to the army, but the Syrians refused to do so. Note that apart from the Palestinian Liwa al Quds, the other militias named are all Shi’a militias linked to Iran. The source therefore implies that the Russians were not trying to get their own cronies appointed but actually sought to promote meritocracy. Following growing Russian pressure, according to the source, the Syrians agreed to restrain the tendency to promote incompetent cronies, which to some extent they reportedly did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Iranians, by contrast, framed their resistance to expanding Russian influence in 2015-2019 in terms of the sacrifices made from 2011 onward, which entitled them to a dominant position:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Iranians believe that they were the ones who sacrificed a lot in Syria, and therefore, they are trying to take over the army and foreign affairs of the Syrian government. […] At the beginning, we had several meetings with the Iranian Sepah Pasdaran, and even the Russian authorities met Qasim Sulimani at that time. Even Qasim Sulimani […] used to say, “As long as I am alive, I will take as much advantage as possible of our sacrifices in Syria.” So, yes, of course, the Russian authorities are irritated by the attitude of the Iranians all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Iranian sacrifices were real. By March 2017, they had lost over 800 killed in Syria, including some senior officers. The total cost of the war up to that point was over $20 billion, causing discontent in Iran, where according to an Iranian diplomat “Except for the Pasdaran, no one else wants to be engaged in fighting in Syria, Iraq and Yemen. If Iranian Government does not stop fighting, big, big protests might start.” In February 2017, a Syrian delegation visited Teheran, asking for even more support. Not long before, another delegation, headed by Ali Mamlouk, had visited Teheran with the same aim. The Iranian government had granted an extra $2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Iranians clearly resented Russian demands as prevarication. In November 2017, an IRGC commander was so upset with the Russians that he stated&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If we had understood at the beginning that Russia would reach such levels, we would have kept them out. Russia is trying to […] make Iran weaker [in Syria], [and] this is not acceptable to us. We are talking to Russia to get them to decrease their influence in Syria and do not create any problems for our strategies there. If Russia does not agree, then we are ready to react against Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russians, however, rejected the Iranian narrative, as they felt that having been dragged into the Syrian conflict by the Iranians themselves, they were entitled to a dominant position due to the decisive role they had played.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-struggle-for-influence-beneath-the-narratives&quot;&gt;The struggle for influence beneath the narratives&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever the actual reasons for their efforts to maintain their influence in Syria vis-à-vis Russia, the Iranians clearly aimed to stay in Syria for the long term, no matter what Russia might say. The Iranians’ arguments against folding the militias into the SAA were not purely technical (see Two models above). Faced with the Russians’ insistence that the NDF should be integrated into the army (because NDF units had the tendency not to respond to the MoD chain of command and were involved in numerous ceasefire violations), the Iranians retorted that they had invested massive sums in getting the militias up to scratch and were not going to see that investment lost. Iran’s opposition to integrating militias into the SAA was instrumental to its ability to out-network the Russians (and Damascus). As a Syrian officer put it,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Iranians know that if [the militias] join the army, it would be hard for them to control them, and that will cause a lot of problems for them, even for them to lose their influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, an IRGC source openly acknowledged that the Iranians refused to have reconciled opposition fighters integrated into the NDF (as proposed by the Russians), for fear that they could dilute Iran’s influence. The Russians viewed the Iranians as disingenuous when they claimed that militias were the key to winning the war and that Iranian control over the militias was necessary to ensure their proper functioning. The Russians noted that the Iranians were also intent on building influence at the top level of Syria’s military and intelligence apparatus, and especially with Assad’s brother Maher, despite their claims that the SAA was doomed. Once complete victory was achieved, said an Iranian diplomat in early 2017, the Syrian militiamen linked to the IRGC would get jobs in Syria’s ministries and armed forces. This would translate into Iranian influence over the Syrian state as a whole. The IRGC undoubtedly was leaning heavily on the Assad regime to have Syrian officers promoted and demoted, as both Syrian army and IRGC sources acknowledged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas the Iranians were quite transparent about their priorities, according to Ambassador Michel Duclos, the Russians were saying off the record that reestablishing a strong Syrian army would be the best guarantee against Iranian influence and pro-Iranian militias. Mardasov wondered whether the entire stated Russian policy of building up the SAA at the expense of the militias was not rather an attempt to expand Moscow’s influence at the expense of Tehran. The fact that the Russians were also sponsoring some of the militias and continued to sponsor new ones well into the reform period would seem to undermine their “centralist” argument in favor of the SAA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;two-strategies-for-gaining-influence-and-a-turning-point-in-russias-favor&quot;&gt;Two strategies for gaining influence and a turning point in Russia’s favor&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the Russians deployed to Syria, Iran’s influence was predominant largely among the militias, by virtue of its early engagement with them, while Russia had stronger influence among SAA generals, most of whom were trained in Russia and Soviet Union, as well as over Syria’s air force, which the Iranians were not in a position to support. From the very start, when the Syrian Air Force Intelligence Directorate established the first Shabiha militias, Iran’s relationship with the entity was well developed. The Iranians also brought their own allied militias from Iraq, Lebanon, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Almost all the foreign militias were aligned with Iran, or at least not with Russia. Instead, Russia reportedly relied on Soviet-era contacts established within the Baath party and in the SAA for spreading influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to sources within the Syrian armed forces, the first turning point in the race for influence between Iran and Russia was around 2017-2019. As of October 2017 most of the Iranian military advisers were with the Shi’a militias, and their number was declining, due to relations with the Assad regime being in decline, while the number of the Russian ones was increasing. By May 2019, according to a Syrian intelligence officer,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Now the Russians have the upper hand in Damascus. I mean Russian influence increased significantly in Syrian government military and civilian institutions. The reason is that Iranians are feeling weak due to their financial crisis. They’re no longer able to provide funding to the people who were linked to them some time ago. Now those people are aligned with the Russians because the Russians are providing support to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The external perception was the same: the Russians were gaining influence in the military and security apparatus, managing to impose in 2019 a series of appointments of senior officers and officials of their liking. During this period, Assad followed Russian recommendations in making appointments, such as of Salim Harba as SAA chief of staff, establishing new units under its influence, such as the 5th Corps and 25th Division, and restructuring the Syrian army staff. There were also reports of arrests of pro-Iranian Syrian activists by Syrian security forces, “ordered by Russia.” Although there were Iranian advisers in the SAA, the Russians were absolutely predominant there after 2015. According to Russian military expert Semyonov, “There are Russian military advisors in almost every brigade and division of the Syrian army.” And although some Syrian army units were under stronger influence of Iran (4th Division, Republican Guard), even in the 4th Division and in the Republican Guard the Russians were said to have a “large say”: “The Russians interfere at the command level, in major security issues, and in major disputes between the army and the militias supporting it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By May 2017 the Russians had already reshaped the influence map considerably. Assad regime sources say that the General Intelligence Directorate was still under Iranian influence, as both its head, Mohammed Din Zaitoun, and his deputy Zouheir Hamad had close relations with Iran. The Military Intelligence Directorate was also under Iranian influence. Meanwhile, the Air Force Intelligence Directorate (the most powerful of the three intelligence directorates) had shifted closer to Russia. The Political Security Directorate was also somewhat close to Russia, despite Iran having some influence in it, as well. As of May 2017, the National Security Office was split between Russia and Iran, with six of its members (Ahmad Diyab, Abdel Fatah, Jawdat Salibi Mawwas, General Nasr Al Ali, Commander Mohammad Ibrahim and Ali Hassan Turkmani) considered to be linked to Russia and another five believed to be close to Iran (Ali Mamlouk, Lina Kenaya, Lula Al Shebal, Naji al Ahmad and Abdul Abdul).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russians did invest relatively significant human resources in training and advising militias: as of early 2018, a regime source counted 200 Russian trainers and advisers there. However, the effort looks puny when compared to Iran’s: 1,800 trainers and advisers, supported by 450 from Hezbollah. Russia’s influence among Syrian militias was limited to a few of them, such as the ISIS Hunters. Some Russian-sponsored militias were ad hoc and did not represent a long-term investment. For example, to reduce the risk of Iranian-sponsored efforts to disrupt new local reconciliation deals, the Russians sponsored the creation of a temporary militia known as the Armed Unified Command-Unit in eastern Qalamoun. The unit was meant to gather reconciled opposition members, until the time was ripe for the SAA to move in and take over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Iranians were sufficiently dominant at the local level that they could strengthen their influence by simply creating new militias. In early 2018 the IRGC sponsored the creation of new militias in southern Syria, possibly because it hoped to circumvent the ban on expanding the ranks of existing militias, exploiting Assad’s desire to consolidate his position in the south. At least three new militias were formed in the south, one with direct IRGC support (Battalion 313) and two with Hezbollah support (Companions of Imam Mahdi 313 and Katain Al Imam). The Iranians remained totally predominant among foreign militias, although Russia developed close links to the Palestinian Liwa al Quds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even after the first turning point in the competition for influence, there were always relatively minor fluctuations in the spheres of influence. For example, in later years, the General Intelligence Directorate and the Military Intelligence Directorate were reported to have edged closer to Russia. Similarly, Russia established relatively strong influence over 5th and 4th Assault Corps when they were formed in 2015-2016, but Iran and Hezbollah later managed to build up substantial influence within both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, the Iranians seemingly competed with Russia even for influence in the regular armed forces, while still pursuing its strategy with the militias. Similarly, the Russians focused on the regular armed forces but also sought to establish a foothold among the militias. The Russians committed limited resources (human and financial), while exploiting opportunities as they arose. For example, Moscow sought to exploit Iran’s rivalry with Israel by attracting militiamen into the Russian-controlled 5th Corps from pro-Iranian militias that had allegedly been weakened by repeated Israeli airstrikes on their positions. Local sources indicated that the risk of Israeli airstrikes was making the Iranians unpopular in Deir ez Zor. Similarly, it was reported that the Russians asserted control over the Damascus and Aleppo airports as Israeli strikes on IRGC positions there made Iranian control unpractical. Another example is that of Liwa al Quds. The Palestinian militia was initially supported by the IRGC and Hezbollah before falling under Russian influence, due in part to sectarian Shi’a-Sunni tensions, until Iranian influence started asserting itself again at the time of Russia’s deepening preoccupation with Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where the Iranian and Russian approaches differed was the type of Syrian counterparts they chose. Even when Iran and Russia were well past the peak of their presence on the ground, the Russians had more advisers to the regular Syrian forces than the Iranians, who only had 47 in total. Nonetheless, these few IRGC advisers were quite active, regularly visiting the MoD and being present at the tactical level as well, still taking part in operations in 2023-2024. In general, the Iranians seemed more determined than the Russians to work at the grassroots level. The Iranians main stronghold in the SAA was Maher al Assad’s 4th Division.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russians held the advantage in terms of access to the top levels of the MoD and of the state, as they were able to provide, in the words of one Syrian officer, “more competent” military advisers, who in fact ended up doing much of the SAA’s planning. The IRGC advisers were less able in this regard, which is not surprising given the IRGC’s specialization in asymmetric and nonconventional operations. This aligns with a comment by a Russian diplomat that “Iran is unable to advise the Syrian government on a global scale,” drawing a contrast with the Russians. The Russians focused on high-ranking officials, such as the president of Syria, heads of intelligence and high-ranking generals, while the Iranian advisers operated at lower levels. The Russian diplomat also agreed that “Most of the time, the Syrians feel more comfortable with the Iranians on a daily basis.” A kind of uneasy division of labor came to develop, at least as far as the work of the advisers was concerned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-ukraine-conflict-a-turning-point-in-irans-favor&quot;&gt;The Ukraine conflict: A turning point in Iran’s favor&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second key turning point in the competition for influence between Iran and Russia was in 2023-2024, when Russian influence collapsed, to the benefit of both the Syrian government, which took control of both 5th Corps and 25th Special Task Division (STD), and the Iranians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian presence in Syria declined after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. Russian support for the Syrian armed forces also declined, especially from the end of 2023, probably more due to the efforts of the Assad regime to assert its control over SAA units and militias previously patronized by Russia, than to the engagement in Ukraine. Inevitably this translated into reduced influence. Most of the militias once linked to Russia started turning to the Assad regime, which, however, lacked resources, and to the IRGC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Iranians saw Russia’s entanglement in Ukraine as an opportunity for further expanding their influence over the militias:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If the Russians do not support the armed forces, and if the Russians are not there for the militias, it is clear enough that the Islamic Republic of Iran would have a greater chance of [exerting] influence over Syria as the Syrian government and militias both would need our support. […] The decline of Russian influence is a positive development for Iran’s point of view. […] The Islamic Republic of Iran would be happy if the Russian influence in Syria declined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to one of its commanders, the IRGC in 2024 allocated an extra $100 million of funding to militias in Syria for this purpose. The IRGC even sought to establish its influence over such a key Russian client as the 8th Brigade, whose creation it had once so bitterly resisted. This did not come easy, but the IRGC reportedly managed to establish relations with some 8th Brigade commanders, having spent $10 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the Iranians, the militias remained the primary focus, as they remained distrustful of the capabilities of the SAA. However, during 2024 the IRGC was very active trying to get “their people” in the Syrian armed forces promoted, reversing years of Russian gains. Iran’s growing influence was confirmed by a Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs official:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While the Russians are busy carrying out the special operation in Ukraine and losing their influence in Syria, the Iranians, on the other hand, are getting closer and closer to the armed forces by providing funds and supplies, and at the same time, the Iranians are getting closer to the Syrian government, as there is enough of a gap now between the Russians and the Syrian officials. […] The Iranians are trying and doing more to influence the Syrian government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two Syrian military sources acknowledged that Iranian influence was growing as a result, especially among the militias. After the start of the Gaza crisis, moreover, the IRGC started reinforcing its own presence in Syria as well. Even a Palestinian militiaman, despite his group’s closeness to Russia, expected Iranian influence and power to keep growing as long as Russia was engaged in Ukraine, with the Gaza conflict only magnifying Iran’s role. One source regularly in contact with regime officials noted at the end of 2023 that around 10 different sources and interviewees all confirmed to him that Iran was expanding its influence and power among Syrian governmental forces, militias and security departments after Russia got involved in Ukraine. The Iranians also benefited from the fact that after the war in Ukraine started, the Russians gave up on lobbying the Iranians on behalf of Damascus, asking the Syrians instead to deal with the IRGC directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023 Russian sources were clear that there was resentment among the Russians that the Iranians were becoming very assertive in trying to advance their interests in Syria, even though Russia still contributed significantly more than Iran did to supporting the regime. This tension was reduced after the Russians, distracted by the war in Ukraine, largely gave up on Aleppo, which had been a focal point of intra-militia and Russia-Iran confrontation. In Deir Ez Zor, Russian influence was sustained after the war in Ukraine started, but in Aleppo it nearly vanished. As a Syrian official put it in late 2023, Russia accepted Iranian influence in Syria and was no longer trying to eradicate or contain it; the Russians were now seeing Iran as a key ally. As the Russians were no longer interested or able to compete effectively with the Iranians, cooperation between the two countries on Syria actually became easier (see Condemned to cooperation below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-the-long-struggle-for-influence-ended&quot;&gt;How the long struggle for influence ended&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;condemned-to-cooperation&quot;&gt;Condemned to cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of the Russian intervention in Syria, cooperation between Iran and Russia was described as good by Syrian and Iranian sources. A center was established to facilitate coordination between the Russian, Iranians and Syrians. There was also coordination between Russia and Iran at the ministerial level and operational level and among senior officials. Airstrikes were coordinated, as were logistics, operations and intelligence. An IRGC source confirmed in February 2016 that Russia was also providing arms and support even to Hezbollah in Syria. In early 2016 the assessment of an IRGC colonel claimed that “There is great coordination between Russian advisers, our advisers and Assad’s advisers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gradually, even Syrian and Iranian sources started acknowledging that the relationship had become more competitive. Relations between Russia and Iran and their proxies deteriorated as they competed for influence – on the ground and with the Syrian regime. However, efforts to foster collaboration between Russian and Iranian proxies and allies were never abandoned. A conflict resolution commission was set up by Syria, Iran and Russia to ease friction from within the ranks of the alliance. It was composed of special representatives appointed by each side. Coordinating was hard work, however. Liwa al Quds again provides an example of this. Tension over the group kept escalating for years. It was kept out of the LDF, although it cooperated closely with it for a period, under the coordination of the intelligence services. In 2016, however, the Russian advisers took over and told Liwa al Quds to stop cooperating with the LDF, presumably to keep the group away from the increasingly Iran-influenced LDF. A senior figure in Liwa al Quds pointed out that the Russians, Iranians and Hezbollah initially agreed in a meeting over the transition to hand control over to the Russians. However, this deal collapsed when the tension and conflicts between the Russians-backed groups, Iran’s IRGC and Hezbollah-backed forces emerged, centering on the partition of territorial control in Aleppo city and Deir Ez Zor in 2019. At that point, Maher al Assad had to mediate between the Russians, Hezbollah and IRGC. One commander in Liwa al Quds stated that the clashes with pro-Iranian groups were due to sectarian tensions, with Shi’a groups accusing Sunni ones of disloyalty, but he acknowledged that competition over territory was also a big issue. A new understanding was reached, according to a senior member of the militia, and by 2022 neither the IRGC nor Hezbollah objected anymore to Russian support for Liwa al Quds (weapons, funds or training). However, alongside the Russians, Iranian advisers were still posted with Liwa, as were Hezbollah’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian commentators criticized the August 2018 military cooperation agreement between Iran and Syria as bound to lead to more Syrian dependence on Iran and more direct Iranian influence inside Syria. These attitudes betrayed a high level of sensitivity about Iranian influence. In reality, as Mardasov and Semyonov noted, Russia’s influence over the “Syrian power apparatus” and its ability to replace Iranian influence with its own was “nothing more than an outright exaggeration.” Russia did not want to occupy a dominant position in the power structures in Damascus or contain Iran’s influence in Syria, because either option would be too expensive financially and politically. On the Iranian side, according to a commander in an IRGC-linked militia, it was acknowledged that it had been primarily the Russian advisers who worked to get the SAA back on its feet. The IRGC was the least keen to admit the degree to which the Russians and Iranians were interdependent – as late as March 2023 one IRGC representative stated that “We do not like the Russians at all, because they are bad for our future and our interests,”but even heacknowledged that the Russians were crucial to Syria: “They continue to assist the Syrian air and ground forces directly, offering better military strategy, better combat tactics and better political training to the army.” Iranian, Russian and even Hezbollah advisers often worked side by side in the same units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither Russia nor Iran aimed to crush each other’s influence and assert a monopoly over the Assad regime. The two sides were testing the opportunities for expanding their influence. According to a Russian military adviser, there was always the option of falling back to a partition of zones of influence between Russia and Iran, with the Russians focusing on the SAA and air force, and the Iranians on the militias.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conditions for fuller cooperation came into place when it became clear that Russia was deeply entangled in Ukraine, by 2023-2024. Indeed, despite all the competition and the frictions, the Russians, Iranians and Syrians tended to agree that the two allies of the Assad regime by 2024 were again working together, even describing each other as “good allies.” A Russian diplomat in January 2024 described Russia’s plans for the coming months as including cooperation and intelligence sharing with Iran. Another Russian diplomat agreed in October that coordination never stopped and explained that while the Russian and Iranian governments had different views, they were good allies with distinct objectives. A Syrian intelligence officer assessed that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;They still have arguments, and they both still have their own goals, but at the end of the day, they both have the same goal in Syria; they both have to win in Syria. Therefore, their relations are not that bad, and most of the time they are supporting each other and working together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Syrian army officer described the relationship as one of competition within Syria and of effective cooperation against external threats, with regular coordination meetings between the Iranians and Russians in Syria. The improvement in relations between the Iranians and the Russians was likely both due to the realization of the growing risk of instability and due to Russia’s pragmatism. It turned out, however, that Iran was not up to the task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;irans-failure-to-fill-the-gap&quot;&gt;Iran’s failure to fill the gap&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all of the IRGC’s optimism about expanding its influence in the wake of Russian downsizing in 2023-2024, the Iranians clearly did not have sufficient resources available. As a result, the Iranians had less success with the SAA than with the militias, and some units, like the 25th STD, remained impermeable to their influence, despite the Russians losing control over it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Russian diplomat, a Syrian military intelligence officer and an SAA officer all believed that the IRGC’s claims were overstated and that Russian influence, while declining, would not wither completely, noting that the Russians still had advisors and were still providing money and logistics. That was likely true, but mainly because the IRGC’s extra resources, as discussed above, were an order of magnitude smaller than Russia’s cuts. The Russians by 2024 had cut their financial commitments by $1.7 billion, while Iran, as discussed above, added $100 million. The Iranians did not deploy much extra manpower either. As the collapse of the regime approached, one year after the beginning of the Gaza crisis, the IRGC had only 1,500 men in Syria. Despite talks of remobilization of the foreign militias, as of July 2024, there were (according to a Syrian military source) 7,000 men in the ranks of Hezbollah, 3,000 men in the Afghan Fatimiyun, 1,000 in the Pakistani Zainabyun and some 2,000 Iraqis and Yemenis of various groups, for a total of about 13,000 men. This was a major reduction compared to the peak years of the civil war, when the foreign militias reached a peak manpower in Syria of 37,400 men in April 2018, according to a source within the Assad regime. The Iranians’ attempts to increase numbers were hampered by Hezbollah cutting its own numbers in Syria due to the confrontation with Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the rather unanimous assessment of Iran steadily expanding its influence at the expense of Russia did not signify optimism. The Syrians were doubtful about the regime’s ability to survive a crisis without extensive Russian support. Moreover, a Russian officer noted that some militias were behaving increasingly autonomously, not only in relation to Russia but also to Iran, and warned that problems should be expected in and around Latakia. As of late 2023, the Assad regime was already experiencing renewed friction with Iran and Hezbollah about the militias, since its leverage vis-à-vis Teheran had been reduced by Russia’s retrenchment. In the words of a Syrian general, we find signs of disappointment for Russia’s declining commitment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Russians have nothing to give, so they cannot gain ground among Syrian officers, particularly the Alawite ones. Two years ago, the Russians were talking about getting the Iranians out of Syria and control the country alone, but now the Russians need support and help from Iran and its militias in Syria and even in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Iran-Russia coalition in Syria appears to have been formed haphazardly in 2015. Its improvised character is apparent from the lack of agreement on any strategic plan beyond the commitment of Russian air power to the conflict. Perhaps this was inevitable, given the big gap separating the countries’ strategic, military and political cultures. The Russians arrived with their own state-building plan, centered around rebuilding the SAA. That might have been neither realistic nor sound, but the Iranian plan was no less dubious: it involved creating a network of armed groups that Iran would help mold into a kind of Syrian Hezbollah before forcing the Baathist state into a new ruling coalition, deeply reshaping the pre-2011 Syrian regime. By 2024, there was little sign that a Syrian Hezbollah was even at an embryonic stage of development. As one Russian interviewee noted, it would have been conceivable for Russia and Iran to agree on separate spheres of action so as to minimize friction. But that was not done until 2023-2024, and even then mainly because the Russians were dramatically downsizing their contribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russians showed greater pragmatism than the Iranians. Once it became clear that their original plan – pregnant with assumptions about what a proper Syrian state should and could look like – could not work, they shifted toward an approach that looked much like Iran’s, that is, building up a network of armed groups and military leaders. Unlike the Iranians, however, it does not appear that the Russians were under any illusion that this approach was a route to state-building of any kind. The Russians tried other routes to end the conflict, such as diplomacy and political reconciliation, which have not been discussed here. As all those seemed to falter, Moscow might have started seeing the Assad regime as a burden unlikely to yield more than the preservation of Russian bases in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran’s own plan for state-building failed rather dramatically in Syria. The Iranians proved quite effective at network building, which is not surprising given their past experience in Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen and given their arrival on the Syrian scene years ahead of the Russians. The Russians proved quite resilient competitors, however, not least thanks to their superior resources. When the Russians gave way from 2023 onward, the Iranians failed to make any progress toward their end goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know, of course, how it all ended. The Russians had virtually no assets on the ground at the end of 2024, but the Iranians and their foreign militias had almost 15,000 battle-tested men, not counting Syrian groups linked to the IRGC. The size of the attacking opposition force was by all accounts not much larger. Efforts to bring reinforcements from Iraq failed, and the Iranians and their allies gave up on the fights early on – during the fighting for Aleppo, which they had contested first with the opposition and then with the Russians for long years. Perhaps the lesson to be drawn is that while the Russians and Iranians spent a lot of energy competing with each other, their undoing was their failure to figure out a way to address the crucial weaknesses of the Assad regime.&lt;/p&gt;

With cyber products and services more in demand today than ever before, a combination of resulting factors has thrust the concept of Responsible Cyber Behaviour (RCB) further up government agendas.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Non-state actors – especially private companies – are a core part of cyber security services and infrastructure provision. As such, the need to understand and promote responsible behaviours (i.e. the production and selling of cyber capabilities for state use) has never been greater. But, despite the Cyber sector emerging as one of the fastest growing industries with broad capabilities that could risk national and shared interests, discussion of what it means to be a responsible industry player when developing cyber services and products is still relatively underdeveloped.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The necessity to understand and promote responsible behaviours within the Defence and Cyber sectors (i.e. the production and selling of cyber and defence capabilities for state use) has never been greater. The challenging global landscape coupled with the increasing velocity of modern warfare capabilities has highlighted a strong demand for responsibility in the production and distribution of both cyber and military services. Despite the Cyber Security sector emerging as one of the fastest growing industries with broad capabilities that could risk national and shared interests, discussion of what it means to be a responsible industry player when developing cyber security services and products is still relatively underdeveloped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Defence sector, including companies including BAE Systems, have integrated cyber security as a core part of the commercial offering. Additionally, Defence contractors are well-positioned to consider questions of responsible cyber behaviour, because they have historically had to deal with and reflect on many questions concerning responsible and irresponsible use of military, and more recently, cyber capabilities. These provide us with strong parallels in the potential for misuse, proliferation and harm to individuals, society and governments. While the possible harms of cyber are not as clear cut as military capabilities, the interconnectedness of the global landscape and reliance on digital products in everyday use presents a different opportunity, but just as vital for Defence primes, to develop and continue practises from the Defence industry into Cyber markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper also examines the use of legal and non-legal mechanisms in the Defence industry compared to the Cyber sector. Legal tools, including legislation and export control regimes, demonstrate the government’s role in ensuring strong regulation and enforcement of compliance through accountable measures: the backbone of responsible behaviour. Non-legal tools, including ethics and business standards, are also essential to ensure that the private sector can create common practices of good governance – along with increased transparency to eliminate ambiguity and reduce the risk of irresponsibility. Current discussions, including the Pall Mall Process, highlight an ambiguity around corporate responsibility that emphasises the need for collaboration across industry, government and academia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Definitions of responsible behaviour are likely to evolve and mature to reflect the times. Legal and non-legal mechanisms can promote robust concepts of responsible behaviour into cyber discussions and, in turn, codify into coherent and broadly applicable business practices.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-introduction&quot;&gt;1 Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;11-about-the-responsible-cyber-behaviour-project-and-publication&quot;&gt;1.1 About the Responsible Cyber Behaviour project and publication&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malicious activities by state and non-state actors in cyberspace present a continuous threat to international peace, stability and security. Geopolitical tensions often tend to favour a polarised view of what responsibility means in cyber and tech security, thus leaving out the important nuance as to how different regions and stakeholders perceive it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) launched the Global Partnership for Responsible Cyber Behaviour (GP-RCB) – a platform for research and dialogue comprised of over 80 scholars from countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, North America, the Middle East and Africa, and the Indo-Pacific. The GP-RCB is a global research hub designed to enable evidence-based action on cyber policy and cyber security issues within international multilateral organisations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better inform practical steps that unblock the international debate on the application of rules, norms and principles in cyberspace, the GP-RCB focuses on understanding and identifying the varying approaches to cyberspace and technology taken by states in an increasingly fractured geopolitical landscape. The network responds to a notable fragmentation and knowledge gap in the global research community on Responsible Cyber Behaviour (RCB), marked by an inconsistent understanding of mechanisms, concepts and interpretations of responsibility, alongside a lack of clarity on what RCB means in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;12-research-aim&quot;&gt;1.2 Research Aim&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The malicious use of information and communications technologies is far more complex than it was twenty years ago when the first set of cyber norms on responsible state behaviour were agreed by states at the UN. Non-state actors – especially private companies – have become a core part of cyber security services and infrastructure provision. Therefore, from both a multilateral and threat-based perspective, this is an appropriate time to consider how the debate about responsible behaviour in cyberspace not only extends beyond the remit of national governments and multi-lateral organisations but most importantly, how different parts of the industry understand responsible cyber behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This research paper investigates the potential role of Defence companies in shaping responsible behaviours as a complement to the behaviours of nation states. To support fresh policy thinking on RCB, specifically drawing on BAE Systems’ experience as a Defence prime, it seeks to identify parallels and lessons from the Defence sector that could inform both private sector and governmental approaches to responsible behaviours in the adjacent Cyber sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;13-approach&quot;&gt;1.3 Approach&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Defence sector offers a number of parallels to the Cyber sector – a term used in this paper to encompass the UK Cyber sector and includes businesses that provide products or services that enable the protection of internet connected systems and their users, as well as cyber capabilities that might be used by states in cyber operations that advance strategic interests. Defence and Cyber share several similarities, such as the use of advanced technology, common suppliers, customer markets, export regulation, and a need to control the use of goods and services due to the potential for misuse. Defence also offers Cyber the chance to learn from the far greater domestic and international history of reflection and codification of responsible behaviour across the Defence sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper draws on several data collection methods including academic literature review, desk-based research, and interviews with those working in the Defence and Cyber sectors, academia, and government. Those contributing did so on condition of anonymity and so remarks have not been attributed to any individual organisations. The views expressed, therefore, should not be seen as representing the position of any single entity or that of the Defence or Cyber sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper’s focus is limited to exploring the primary factors that drive responsible behaviour in the Defence industry – chiefly domestic and international legislation, regulation, and commonly agreed principles (such as military ethics) – when it comes to the development and sale of capabilities. To make the most meaningful comparison between Defence and Cyber, this paper does not explore the impact of military culture and its model of leadership or exercising as part of the definitions of responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the paper is not focused on how Defence firms promote cyber security governance and practices throughout the development of their military platforms and tools (i.e. product security). The paper focuses on the production and distribution of cyber and defence capabilities and seeks to provide insights into the Cyber-Defence industrial nexus that can inform future research and policy reflections on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Defence and Cyber share several similarities, such as the use of advanced technology, common suppliers, customer markets, export regulation, and a need to control the use of goods and services due to the potential for misuse.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-background&quot;&gt;2 Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;21-why-now&quot;&gt;2.1 Why now?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has been produced at an inflection point of Cyber’s evolution and its place in the current political domain. As the UN Open Ended Working Group on Cyber (OEWG) ends this year, and initiatives like the Pall Mall Process continue discussions on the proliferation and irresponsible use of cyber capabilities, it is timely to understand what Responsible Cyber Behaviour means for a range of actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cyber sector – including offensive and defensive capabilities – sits at a complex interplay of heightened geopolitical tensions and an increasingly challenging landscape. Cybercrime is projected to cost $13.82 trillion globally by 2028 and the proliferation of offensive cyber capabilities has increased the pressure on states to continue to invest and develop. Cyber capacities and capabilities provide an easy route for malicious actors to cause harm by exploiting vulnerabilities across organisations, supply chains, sectors and national borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s Defence budget rose to £59.8 billion in 2025/26, with plans to increase to 2.5% of GDP by April 2027. The UK also continues to build its vision as a global cyber power. The National Cyber Security Centre is playing a leading role in cyber security at home and overseas while the National Cyber Force provides cyber operations in support of national security interests, collaborating with allies to ensure strategic cooperation as well as designing principles for responsible cyber operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In parallel, under the Digital Europe Programme for the period 2021-2027, the EU committed €1.6 billion to cyber security capabilities and established the European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology and Research Competence Centre. This highlights a growing effort and investment to ensure that cyberspace can be secured, with regulation where appropriate, to manage the diversity of cyber capabilities not previously recognised. Now more than ever, it is useful to reflect on non-state actors, such as the Defence industry, to understand what responsibility means to the private sector, how it should be employed, and the intersection between military and cyber services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;22-the-defence-and-cyber-marketplaces&quot;&gt;2.2 The Defence and Cyber marketplaces&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has one of the world’s leading Defence industries with orders worth £14.5bn in 2023, dominated by aerospace products and services. The UK’s Defence industry is shaped by government priorities and military requirements. It includes large private sector contractors and manufacturers building equipment, hardware, advanced electronics, communications, surveillance and cyber security solutions – all underpinned by a global supply chain. Looking more broadly, the US is dominated by a handful of major Defence primes while, as an economic zone, Europe comprises a more diverse – albeit fragmentated – market with around 15 major Defence primes and thousands of small and medium sized enterprises. Barriers to entry into the Defence sector can be high, requiring significant capital investment, complex and lengthy development and procurement processes, strict national and international regulatory frameworks (primarily relating to export and compliance), and international collaboration. Firms tend to be large and well established; some have thousands of government security-cleared staff. With long-term contracts and dependence on government procurement cycles, growth tends to be stable; until 2022, UK exports were primarily destined for the Middle East. Now they are concentrated on Europe and likely to grow further in this region, which will shape the demand and production of future military platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many large companies straddle both sectors, providing defence and cyber products and services. In the UK, for example, this includes BAE Systems, Rolls Royce, Leonardo, QinetiQ, Thales UK, Atos UK, and Babcock International. The broader Cyber sector is more diverse, with a myriad of small and medium sized businesses. The sector has grown rapidly since the 1990s, with rising demand for digital services. Initially focused largely on cyber security (such as antivirus software and firewalls), the market has expanded significantly over the last 15 years in line with the mushrooming use of the internet, social media, cloud services, and the dynamic threat landscape to include intrusive and offensive cyber capabilities. That said, cyber security still dominates the UK market, representing roughly 65% of total UK security export revenue in 2023. Due to the similarities in relation to national security between cyber operations and defence products including developing capabilities in offensive cyber, this paper will focus on this subsection of the Cyber sector in order to establish a comparison of how responsible behaviour has and will continue to develop in this space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though highly competitive and dependant on access to scarce expert resources, entering the Cyber market is simpler than becoming a Defence company. Upfront costs are lower, technology development is faster, and as the market is wider than government there are fewer barriers to entry (at least when compared with the Defence sector, where legal prerequisites are required to obtain government contracts, such as the Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations 2011 (DSPCR). UK security exports have risen rapidly from £4.3bn in 2016 to £11bn in 2023. Similar to defence exports, the majority of UK cyber exports by destination region were for Europe and North America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;23-defining-responsible-behaviour&quot;&gt;2.3 Defining responsible behaviour&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responsible Cyber Behaviour (RCB), as defined in RUSI’s RCB guide, refers to the collective expectations of state and non-state actors regarding how they should behave in cyberspace. Behaviour comprises the values, norms, policies, practices, and technologies that are intended to protect and secure cyberspace. These expectations are highly contested and differ across the globe. RUSI’s RCB guide allowed a basis for comparing the Cyber sector with the Defence sector and the associated domain of armed conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Core principles relating to armed conflict have long been embedded in international humanitarian and human rights laws, treaties and conventions, given effect via national legislation and regulation to control the development, sale, export and use of military and dual-use goods. Underpinning these core principles is the importance of necessity, proportionality and need to minimise harm to civilians and civilian property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviewees engaged in our research highlighted that export control was one of the biggest drivers of responsible behaviour. Export control regimes and compliance offer a useful litmus test for what is deemed responsible practise in the development and distribution of capabilities, and what is deemed irresponsible and the appropriate penalties involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst export control is a key factor in defining responsible behaviour, this paper recognises that other factors are also relevant, and proposes that responsible behaviour in the Defence industry should be understood through the following mechanisms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regulation&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Rules that are robust and broad enough to outline what the Defence sector must do to be compliant, with distinctions for what is deemed irresponsible in relation to the national interests and international obligations capabilities are subject to.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enforcement&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Clear and proportionate enforcement of regulation, in which national governments set out penalties for non-compliance including the publication of fines and charges for violations of regulation that can include “consent agreements” covering remedial measures.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Transparency&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Defence contractors must operate with transparency when conducting their business, including in their operational frameworks and protection of sensitive information. This goes beyond simply compliance with regulation and includes ensuring accountability of all parties involved, such as the supplier, the customer and any third party.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Governance&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Ensuring that firms have robust internal frameworks to govern responsible behaviours – necessary to ensure both regulatory compliance and responsibility more widely, e.g. relating to ethical standards of conduct.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Collaboration&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To stay relevant in an environment of technological advances and geopolitical changes, high level multi-stakeholder collaboration (including government, industry and academia) is essential to grow the discourse on how customers, trade bodies, policymakers and contractors remain responsible in the product lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though recognised as an important issue at the turn of the millennium, international efforts to define cyber operations and establish common views on responsible behaviour only slowly gained traction after 2010. It took a series of cyber incidents against Estonia in 2007, the Republic of Georgia in 2008 and Iran (discovered in 2010) to demonstrate the destructive potential of cyber operations. It was at this point that the international community started to take the risk of cyber breaches and their consequent impact seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, discussion of Responsible Cyber Behaviour has grown in line with the development of cyber capabilities. Huge steps have been taken to codify thinking on this topic – notably via the UN framework of responsible state behaviour in cyber space, agreed in 2015, and via a swathe of international and national legislation that gave effect to norms designed to protect human rights in cyber space by placing increased protections on the privacy of personal information, such as the EU’s GDPR in 2016. A year after the devastating WannaCry ransomware attacks, the 2018 “Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace” represented the first major multi-stakeholder initiative that sought to involve private companies and civil society organisations in producing principles of expected cyber behaviour. Focused primarily on establishing a defensive posture (e.g. protecting intellectual property, supply chains, electoral systems, the domain name system, infrastructure and individuals) these initiatives also included calls to promote international norms and the non-proliferation of intrusive cyber capabilities – developed further by the 2024 Pall Mall Process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;24-responsible-behaviour-in-the-defence-sector&quot;&gt;2.4 Responsible behaviour in the Defence sector&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Challenges associated with defining responsible behaviour in the Defence sector have persisted despite extensive discourse and legislation. The Defence sector evolves with the development of modern warfare, producing more complex technologies and reflecting expenditure on land, maritime, air and cyber capabilities. The Defence sector has also increased in interoperability, reflecting the need to collaborate with other nations in theatre. The Defence sector today is heavily regulated and focused on compliance – concerning the production and exporting of military capabilities. This is not without reason. In relation to defence exports, violating regulations can lead to massive fines, reputational damage and even imprisonment for those found responsible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The core challenge of defining cyber responsibilities reflect similar trade-offs to those in the Defence sector historically: competing interests of the faster-paced private sector in meeting increasing market demands versus establishing robust governance of responsible practices over a longer stretch of time.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-analysis&quot;&gt;3 Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;31-how-the-defence-industry-embeds-responsible-behaviour&quot;&gt;3.1 How the Defence industry embeds responsible behaviour&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand how the Defence industry demonstrates key lessons that could apply to the Cyber sector, we must examine how this industry has embedded responsible behaviour. The Defence industry helps governments protect sovereignty and respond militarily to threats to national and international security. The volume of arms trade has increased throughout the 20th century. Public perception of the Defence industry is nuanced, influenced by global events and ethical dilemmas; sometimes garnering patriotic support during wartime or conversely public outcry, particularly over increasing advancements of capabilities and their potential misuse. Legal controls have grown in line with the landscape of war, in order to ensure appropriate constraints on how industry and governments are able to operate. Corporate responsibility has been supported by the close nature of Defence work between sovereign primes and their national governments – Defence contractors work within the authority of government-issued requirements. As a result, a breadth of precedents and regular practices underpin how the Defence industry can promote responsible behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irresponsible behaviours in the Defence industry can stem from non-compliance with export control regulations, supply chain risks, mishandling of sensitive information, and – in more severe cases – corruption or bribery. Though the US Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) does not often issue consent agreements, it nonetheless provides a significant route to highlight violations of the US International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and penalise defence companies. Consent agreements can be issued for unauthorised exports of goods and information, unauthorised selling and production without licences, or violation of classification and jurisdiction. They provide a means to hold companies to account for improper handling of contracts and are helpful in letting industry know what irresponsible behaviour looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the combination of the nature of the Defence industry, the harm to life that military capabilities can pose, and the processes to penalise irresponsible behaviour, industry and government have prescribed strong business practices that are ingrained into regular activities of both the customer and Defence supplier. In the UK, the Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations 2011 (DSPCR) outlines the special rules and environment in which contractors must align with national security interests and meet requirements for procurement. These regulations set a baseline for contractors in establishing robust business practices. If contractors fail to develop appropriate infrastructure to handle sensitive information, ensure compliance with legislation and licencing requirements, they may not be considered for future contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One interviewee judged that there were wider benefits to responsible behaviour that influence business behaviour. Ensuring compliance with legal requirements and contractual obligations is not just about maintaining a licence to operate, but is vital to maintaining shareholder and public trust while safeguarding international and national security. This is likely to be applicable to cyber companies as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following sections consider how legal and non-legal tools, as well as international cooperation, can influence and promote responsible behaviour in Defence, and – where possible – draw out potential implications for the Cyber sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;32-legal-approaches-to-influencing-responsible-behaviour&quot;&gt;3.2 Legal approaches to influencing responsible behaviour&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on how the Defence industry has been regulated and considers how the Cyber sector can be influenced by the same legal tools. Both Defence and Cyber regulations are underpinned by a breadth of legislation within the UK, as well as international norms and standards. This provides the foundations for defining what responsible behaviour looks like for government and industry. Much of the legislation extends responsibility to companies on misuse and non-compliance, adapting over time to broaden what is acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand how definitions of responsibility are promoted within the Defence and Cyber sectors, it is worth considering the range of major legislation and agreements, both in the UK and internationally:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/xaSydeJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding legislation across Defence and Cyber is important when determining the motivations for placing protections on developing and using capabilities. Legislation pertaining to Defence – namely the use and misuse and development and sale of defence capabilities – has evolved with the changing landscape of war (including the use of nuclear and chemical). Internationally, UN Security Resolutions have kept pace with the geopolitical landscape of capability development, while state-based policies have ensured that businesses develop and sell responsibly. As a result, there is a breadth of domestic and international legislation which underpinned the nature of military capabilities, seeking to reduce harm to civilians and oppression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK Cyber legislation is also multi-faceted. It is underpinned by the right to data privacy and, via regulations such as the NIS Regulations (Security of Network &amp;amp; Information Systems), the protection of essential services through the safeguarding of data confidentiality, integrity and availability. This drives both the requirement for robust cyber security on electronic devices and systems and the misuse of cyber tools to violate privacy, including ransomware and intrusion capabilities. Businesses are held to account for how they handle data and manage interactions across cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyber security regulation serves to mitigate risks on businesses and individuals in handling data, while misuse – such as unauthorised hacking – is prohibited under national law. The Computer Misuse Act 1990 serves as the foundation for preventing cyber intrusion in the UK. Firms operating in both sectors noted, however, that it is difficult to ensure Responsible Cyber Behaviour – in its broadest sense – through legislative means alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enforcement and penalties for non-compliance with Cyber regulation can also be costly and risk reputational damage to providers and services. Like Defence-related legislation, Cyber regulation is designed to protect the availability and integrity of technologies – particularly in critical sectors. In the UK, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) controls not just the use of personal data, but also the transfer of information and mishandling. Coupled with the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR), cyber service providers must ensure compliant security infrastructure. Fines for mishandling data, violations of network security laws and breaches of GDPR are not uncommon across all industries, with Meta topping the list with a $1.3 billion fine for illicit transfers of personal data from the EU to the US in 2023. Amazon also faced a $877 million fine for breaches of GDPR for using personal data to run targeted advertisements to users. While these were corporate violations of cyber regulation, these penalties serve as precedent for cyber services operating in the public sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other legal mechanisms also help us understand how states view Responsible Cyber Behaviour. One example from 2021 involved information gathering software called Pegasus, in which malware produced by the NSO Group was used to hack into smartphones resulting in the leak of personal data from 50,000 phone numbers. After a lengthy investigation, the NSO Group was found liable and subject to sanctions, including being placed on the US Commerce Entity List for acting “contrary to the foreign policy and national security interests of the US”, thereby restricting its access to US technology. The Pegasus case highlights how governments can enforce more severe penalties beyond fines, ensuring effective sanctions in absence of clear breaches of Cyber regulation. The Pegasus case, alongside the numerous penalties faced by larger service providers, highlights the necessity for clearer controls on the handling of cyber capabilities in line with those in the Defence industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While the impact can be severe, the enforcement of regulations serves to change behaviours and highlight the need to be transparent about both responsible and irresponsible behaviours as a precedent for the industry.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;33-the-role-of-export-control-in-driving-responsible-behaviour&quot;&gt;3.3 The role of export control in driving responsible behaviour&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One approach to understanding responsibility in the use, misuse, development and sale of cyber and defence capabilities is through an examination of export control regulation. Necessary to ensuring responsible selling, end use and destination of exported products and services, export control enables strict enforcement of compliance and clear penalties for misuse. The UK – like the US and EU – upholds an extensive set of export control regimes to ensure that the sale of capabilities (including dual-use items, weapons of mass destruction and other military equipment) does not violate international law or undermine UK national security. In 2017, global arms exports rose to $32 billion, the highest since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Critical to this is the issuing and monitoring of licences. Exporters must apply for licences to develop and export new capabilities and ensure they are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Preventing unauthorised exports of defence articles, including technical data&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Preventing unauthorised exports of sensitive information to foreign employees&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ensuring goods and services are supplied to their intended destination, for the intended end use&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Complying with international obligations, including foreign policy and diplomatic agreements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breaking export control licensing rules can result in serious penalties, including sanctions, consent agreements and fines. Interviewees for this paper noted that robust enforcement drives accountability and strong controls to prevent violation. They also noted that the loss of public reputation, financial repercussions and distrust with government stakeholders incentivise reforms by Defence companies to minimise the risk of future export control breaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US ITAR has been used to serve penalties for irresponsible trading in the Defence sector, which can include billion-dollar charges to resolve bribery and control violations. Such penalties centre accountability on sovereign states and create controls for industry in developing capabilities in line with international human rights laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development and distribution of cyber capabilities are also subject to a set of complex export control regulations. Cyber products can be utilised by a wider base of state and non-state end users, so ensuring that their export is legally underpinned is paramount for suppliers. The Export Control Joint Unit operates a “catch and release” process to support the issue of export licences for cyber products, where cyber products are subject to catch-all controls if they could involve breaches of international law. Exemptions are then issued to elements of capabilities that do not pose risk as the technology is consolidated, for instance, whether the physical goods the product is embedded in is subject to controls is dependent on its encryption and other factors. Furthermore, the robust regulation around CMA and its complementary regulation serves as a strong mandate for organisations to remain responsible in producing cyber products, and common practices for handling data on their infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;34-the-limitations-of-export-control-as-a-means-of-regulation&quot;&gt;3.4 The limitations of export control as a means of regulation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relationship between Defence companies and their customers is also dependent on export control regulations, especially for end use jurisdiction. Differing export control regimes present different jurisdictional requirements for firms to meet. Though clear on what can and cannot be exported and where, UK export licence controls do not include end use monitoring or approval for third-party selling once it has been exported. This presents additional considerations for Defence companies in developing and exporting a product, particularly concerning potential misuse. One interviewee noted that to manage the challenge of assessing risk posed by misuse and the likelihood of onward transfer, some Defence companies have established clear guidance to staff and an exceptions process that involves additional scrutiny in more complex cases (e.g. those involving a new capability or market) to help identify factors of international humanitarian law that might be affected by a new licence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By comparison, exporting cyber capabilities – including issuing of licenses – can also be complex when determining end use jurisdiction. One interviewee noted that determining the impact of a cyber capability can be uncertain, especially in transfers of technologies. To combat some of this ambiguity, one firm interviewed for this paper uses a distributor system to ensure localised awareness of end destination and end use, providing them with additional expertise to maintain compliance. This external support can help firms to manage multiple compliance regimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein, ambiguity surrounding jurisdictions is present within cyber export control. Navigating differing encryption and data handling requirements is key to maintaining responsible production of cyber capabilities. The approach of “catch and release” in cyber export control is inherently different to the Defence model, where there are clearer definitions of what is controlled from the outset. This approach is understandable given the speed at which cyber capabilities are developing. But nonetheless, it creates challenges in understanding what does and does not require an export licence. The private sector is regularly called upon to assist in placing export controls on cyber capabilities, utilising technical expertise to support judgements on licences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future of cyber export control is still largely undetermined, with questions of ambiguity around dual-use and open source technology. The problem of accountability across multiple jurisdictions is also present in Cyber. For example, relicensing software products creates some ambiguity over data protections and compliance checking. Consideration by the Pall Mall process of multi-stakeholder and multi-jurisdictional challenges associated with enforcing control over offensive cyber product sales should help bring much needed definition here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to reach the maturity of defence export control, the Cyber sector must have a defined scope of controlled services and capabilities, particularly in defining prerequisite security and controls for technology transfers that incorporate sensitive data. Ambiguity within cyber export control – namely for intrusive cyber tools – may lead to violations, whether intentional or unwittingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;To combat this ambiguity, effective stakeholder collaboration involving industry, government and academia can help to share learnings from the Defence industry to support responsible behaviour in cyber export control.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;35-non-legal-approaches-to-influencing-responsible-behaviour&quot;&gt;3.5 Non-legal approaches to influencing responsible behaviour&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethics, transparency measures, and collaboration play central roles in responsible behaviour in the Defence industry. These approaches have been shaped by historical events, non-legal doctrines, politics and public sentiment. As societal standards continue to evolve, ethical considerations increasingly influence how the public view the actions and ethos of both private and public Defence organisations. Change can be driven through unwritten cultural perceptions or through socially accepted standards such as war theories, military doctrines and international agreements, as well as the risk to organisational reputation. While the legal system reflects ethical viewpoints which delineate Defence industry conduct, it does not remove grey areas that divide public opinion, regardless of legality. In addition, organisational standards, policies and guidelines within the Defence sector can be utilised to address gaps in the law. As a result, organisations use non-legal tools beyond legal requirements to uphold transparency and accountability of Defence contractors, to maintain responsible behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following table captures some non-legal tools discussed within this paper:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ZUSVuEO.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;the-role-of-ethics&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The role of ethics&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Theories and doctrines have evolved over the course of history to define moral conduct in traditional warfare. Though cyber operations are relatively new compared to kinetic tools, their impact is being considered with reference to a similar set of ethical principles. In Defence, Just War Theory addresses “the justification of how and why wars are fought,” in which the rules of just conduct are assessed through the “two broad principles of discrimination and proportionality.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Similarly, the British Army has developed military doctrines which codify “best practice, based on enduring principles (…) from history and validated lessons from experience and operations” highlighting the importance of applying ethical values through lessons learned. In relation to cyber operations, the UK’s National Cyber Force determines that the “strict adherence to robust legal and ethical frameworks” is also vital. NATO’s Doctrine for Cyberspace Operations requires Law of Armed Conflict principles of “military necessity, humanity, proportionality” to be applied, with “interference with critical infrastructure or functionality, severity and reversibility of effects” considered. This parallels traditional warfare ethical standards of proportionality and legitimacy.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;collaboration-across-industry&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Collaboration across industry&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Research conducted through interviews for this paper suggests that large Defence organisations typically do not distinguish between defence and cyber tools when considering aspects of responsible behaviour. Some industry interviewees questioned whether firms without a long history of export control compliance followed the same approach. Potential reasons that were posited for differences in approach might include company size and experience – with larger Defence firms arguably able to access more resources to invest in regulatory expertise, compliance functions, and company-wide training and oversight than smaller Cyber start-ups. Others questioned whether international regulators had the capacity to drive consistent standards and noted that some firms could use the disparity in common practices to their commercial advantage, such as by operating from national jurisdictions judged to have more permissive export control regimes. One approach to support smaller firms is the use of trade bodies and sharing of best practices. TechUK has created a network of Cyber and Defence firms to connect and discuss practical solutions to barriers in the industry, going as far as establishing committees to build common frameworks of corporate responsibility.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;This valuable initiative highlights how the private sector can work collaboratively to establish common practices that engrain responsibility across the industry – with more experienced organisations willingly sharing their learnings to benefit the sector as a whole.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;the-importance-of-transparency-and-public-opinion&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The importance of transparency and public opinion&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Brand reputation is crucial in an age when “86% of consumers believe authenticity is vital in deciding which brands they like and support.” While government-to-government agreements underpin the international Defence industry, and investors typically care about where companies are based and who they sell to, reputations built on responsible practices can set an organisation apart. Linked to this, Defence companies are aware that a product ending up in the hands of an unintended or controversial third-party can lead to irresponsible use, damage company reputation and impacting share prices in an already specialised market. While defence capabilities are not sold to the public, public and investor perceptions of the Defence industry impacts share price. As well as influencing government policy and investor sentiment, a reputation for ethical conduct also has a significant impact on recruitment and retention – vital to long-term commercial success.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Events shape public perception, both for the Defence and Cyber sectors. For Defence companies, conflict may heighten awareness of what capabilities are developed and their end use. Whether this perception is positive or not, the Defence sector remains vital due to the necessity of a strong defence versus potential human rights violations. For the Cyber sector, much of public perception is intertwined with the impact of cyber and digital capabilities in global civil society. Following the Pegasus case, the NSO Group’s share price was deemed “valueless” by investors, highlighting the public reaction over irresponsible use of cyber capabilities. This presents an interesting comparison, wherein the growing Cyber sector may seem more volatile to shifts in public opinion, however it reflects the societal value shifts present in defence too. As the Cyber sector and public understanding of its capabilities continues to grow, similar discourse surrounding the critical role of Defence in national security interests may be reflected into Cyber.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;embedding-standards-in-business-operations&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Embedding standards in business operations&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While legal requirements define business activities and conduct in the Defence sector, such as the export of military platforms and capabilities, organisational standards, policies and guidelines address gaps in the law and reduce potential ambiguity and confusion for individuals who work under the remit of laws regarding the Defence sector. Interviewees noted that creating and maintaining clear and accessible standards, policies and processes that reflect societal ethics and organisational values provides clear expectations for staff. Supported by training, individuals can utilise these tools to embed responsible behaviour and accountability in daily operations.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;As well as complementing legal requirements, organisational processes and policies also help address staff expectations of their employer; with a more ethically aware workforce many employees do take into consideration the impact their work has on the local community and wider public. Company processes and guidance are also relatively simple to update and so can also help firms adjust dynamically to changes – e.g. to accommodate technological advancements within company policies – more quickly than regulation.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;a-structural-approach-to-responsible-behaviour&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A structural approach to responsible behaviour&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Defence organisations also use resources like collaboration groups, ethics committees and end-destination assessments to guide their approaches to capability development and exports. Through assessing the risks associated with end use and destination, ethics committees can evaluate potential misuse and reputational concerns before conducting sales. Lawful products may be rejected if they breach ethical principles, regardless of whether the sale is lawful and requested by the customer. Defence organisations interviewed as part of this paper utilise export control committees or governing bodies to review how trading principles are applied, to both comply with legal requirements and to abide by ethical principles set out by the organisation.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Companies may utilise second-party distributors to ensure export control requirements have been met. This is especially critical considering the challenge Defence organisations face with differing ethical perspectives and freedoms across the international landscape. National and international collaboration fosters responsible behaviour; transparency between industry partners through knowledge sharing and open communication with the aim of developing the Defence industry in turn encourages the adoption of new practices and ethical changes. Training and awareness events with small to medium enterprises, whose users are twice more likely to encounter threats than at large organisations, promote knowledge exchange between organisations of various sizes – each serving different perspectives by managing different customer types.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Finally, Defence organisations collaborate closely with government, notably the Export Control Joint Unit (ECJU) and wider government bodies such as the Department for Business and Trade (DBT).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Incorporating experts from industry, policymakers and academia to create a forum to share best practice may encourage more meaningful dialogue and collaboration to understand what it means to be responsible.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-what-lessons-can-we-learn-from-defence&quot;&gt;4 What lessons can we learn from Defence?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development of principles and processes in the Defence sector to govern the sale of military capabilities has been largely influenced by legal and non-legal mechanisms, setting the precedent for Defence contractors to establish concepts of responsible behaviours. While this process is not perfect, the large and evolving discourse and the high barrier to entry to secure business in this sector have influenced the concept of responsibility over time. These influences can be adopted into a wide framework of responsible cyber, particularly in offensive cyber, and to tackle proliferation of cyber intrusion capabilities that violate national and international privacy laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Significant work has been invested in defining cyber norms at an international level, and – in the UK – making clear that Responsible Cyber Behaviour means avoiding indiscriminate harm in cyberspace, building public trust through effective cyber security practices, transparency, and safeguarding data, and working collaboratively to build a global consensus. Despite this, it seems likely that further effort is required to help firms understand how to create business governance and structures that embed responsible behaviour to support the responsible production and sale of capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through our review of the Defence sector, this paper suggests that the following lessons relating to the mechanisms that define responsible behaviour are worth considering in the cyber context:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regulation&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;International agreements have shaped common principles of responsible behaviours, but ultimately domestic legislation is vital to enforce accountability. The industry experts engaged as part of this research are aware of the potential impact of cyber goods and services, their potential for misuse, and the value of controls, but cautioned that the nature of cyber means the fast-paced changes raise questions as to whether export control regulation covering cyber is agile enough to keep pace. Ambiguity could easily create scope for intentional or unwitting violations, and so guidance must continue to be updated to ensure regulation remains aligned. Incorporating Responsible Cyber Behaviour into education and training could help to build understanding of potential violations, and how to capture the correct controls into technologies. A sharing of common irresponsible actions could support the growth of industry code of practise.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enforcement&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Through the continuing enforcement of regulations – including fines, sanctions and consent agreements – commercial understanding of responsible behaviour will continue to grow. As well as publicising violations, which have both a deterrent and educational effect, enforcement bodies could collect and publish statistics on the nature and frequency of violations. This could help firms prevent common avoidable mistakes and grow understanding of the nature and extent of cyber capabilities covered by export regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Transparency&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As a consequence of enforcement action, public and parliamentary scrutiny, and an awareness of the value of public, academic and third sector engagement, numerous Defence firms publish details of their business practices. As well as building confidence, this helps firms understand and reinforce commercial norms. From examining the frequency of consent agreements issued for Defence firms in failing to control the movement of goods and sensitive information, we conclude that ensuring transparency through operational and business practice is key. Building transparency so that users and industry understand regulations and misconduct is an important lesson for Cyber, including through responsible cyber capacity building and cyber security infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Governance&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Effective governance structures are key to conducting responsible business. Stakeholder interviews noted that larger firms have more capacity to build these governance structures that embed due diligence. Smaller organisations potentially have less capacity to build a suitable corporate ecosystem through training, compliance and auditing. The integrated nature of the Cyber sector and larger firms’ inevitable reliance on smaller Cyber firms, creates a mutual incentive to increase the cross-pollination of best practice across established players and younger organisations. This can be supported by industry bodies able to facilitate sharing and the development of strong governance mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Collaboration&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Standardisation of responsible behaviour beyond legal compliance has yet to be established within the Cyber sector. Positive steps have been made – including through recommendations in the Pall Mall Process. Setting standards for conduct within industry through utilisation of a wide arena of actors is essential for building an open, peaceful and stable cyberspace. Recognising that Responsible Cyber Behaviours contribute to the health of civil society, it is necessary that regular collaboration across the multi-stakeholder landscape – involving industry, government and academia – continues to keep up with the evolution of Cyber. Academia can help evaluate emerging risks and provide ongoing analysis, while industry has real-world experience of the current threat landscape and government owns the operational requirements. The creation of a forum for the sharing of challenges and exchange of good practice within and across both the Defence and Cyber industry could further contribute to the development of appropriate corporate norms for each sector. Amidst increased geopolitical tensions and competing interests, significant impact could be achieved through the adoption of a common framework developed by and agreed upon by the above parties to define responsible corporate behaviour in this arena.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engagement with industry experts as part our research showed that while some firms have defined responsible behaviour in their business policies, others have not. The summary below attempts to capture common factors that can help drive responsible behaviour raised in interviews and identified during research for this paper.&lt;/p&gt;

To capitalize on this opportunity, the United States should continue to support RISC-V for future chip innovation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RISC-V architecture is an open, international standard governing how software interfaces with hardware in a computer. It serves as a shared language that sets the parameters for communication and interoperability. Open standards provide a means for industry participants to collaborate and develop technological solutions that can help accelerate innovation and limit misuse of intellectual property (IP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some policymakers fear an open standard could threaten U.S. national security and competitive advantage. However, the openness of the standard does not by itself pose a risk. Indeed, RISC-V does not contain sensitive IP, nor does its cooperative development require firms to divulge IP. Firms compete on technologies developed using this platform, not on the platform itself. RISC-V enhances the competitiveness of U.S. chip design firms by creating a flexible, low-risk, and low-cost platform for collaboration. To capitalize on this opportunity, the United States should continue to support RISC-V for future chip innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;risc-v-in-the-isa-landscape&quot;&gt;RISC-V in the ISA Landscape&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, there are two leading semiconductor instruction set architectures (ISAs) covering most of the market: x86 (from U.S.-based Intel/AMD) and ARM (from United Kingdom–based Arm Holdings, which is majority owned by the Japanese SoftBank Group). There are two primary kinds of ISAs—complex instruction set computers (CISCs) and reduced instruction set computers (RISCs)—which are organized differently and operate at different efficiencies; x86 is based on CISC principles, and ARM is based on RISC. x86 ISAs are used in most laptop and desktop computers, while ARM has almost complete market share in the mobile world. ARM and Intel/AMD ISAs are proprietary standards, so other companies and designers can license ARM IP or buy and use processors based on Intel/AMD IP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/wCiAe9j.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, the newest entrant to the field is RISC-V (pronounced “risk five”), an open-standard ISA based on RISC principles that chip design teams can access and implement for free across various use cases without restrictions on licensing. In other words, RISC-V allows for easy customization with a royalty-free license and no license restrictions on modifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Global Platform:&lt;/strong&gt; Initially developed at the University of California, Berkeley’s Parallel Computing Laboratory in 2010, RISC-V is now managed by the Swiss nonprofit standards body RISC-V International. The nonprofit attracts a diverse community of 4,600 members across 70 countries, and includes firms, universities, community organizations, and individuals who collaboratively develop the RISC-V ISA and its extensions. RISC-V International’s Technical Steering Committee includes U.S. entities (e.g., Google and Qualcomm), as well as Chinese organizations (e.g., Alibaba and Huawei). Of RISC-V International’s 24 premier members, which span startups to VC firms to hyperscalers, 12 are based in China, 9 in the United States, and 1 each in Taiwan, Brazil, and Spain. The board and overall membership composition is split among the United States, China, and Europe, with the United States slightly leading in numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexibility and Accessibility:&lt;/strong&gt; RISC-V’s flexibility and accessibility make it an attractive ISA with growing momentum. Early use cases are in the embedded system market, with potential applications in high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI), as well as consumer electronics and wearables. There are currently over 2 billion RISC-V-based chips, a number that is projected to grow to 20 billion by 2031. RISC-V International, which has grown in membership from 236 members in 2019 to over 4,600 in 2025, seeks to capitalize on this support. In late 2019, escalating geopolitical tensions prompted the RISC-V International governing body to move from Delaware to Switzerland, citing its mission to ensure that universities, governments, and companies outside the United States could access and develop its technology. Since then, the nonprofit has been building out tools and opportunities for collaboration in the ecosystem, with 68 new specifications and over 80 working groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Low-Cost, High-Control Platform:&lt;/strong&gt; Many firms that currently buy x86 or license ARM ISAs are helping to develop RISC-V so that they can have another option for semiconductor architectures without incurring expensive licensing fees. This allows engineers to build their own implementations on top of the ISA, enabling them to maintain greater control over their technology and take advantage of software compatibility across the RISC-V ecosystem. For example, Nvidia began transitioning away from its proprietary microcontrollers to RISC-V-based cores in 2015, just five years after the open-standard ISA was introduced. Other industry giants such as Google, Qualcomm, and Samsung have made similar moves. A customizable, low-cost ISA option is also attractive for smaller firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Secure IP Environment:&lt;/strong&gt; It is important to note again that RISC-V does not contain sensitive IP, nor does its cooperative development require firms to divulge such IP. RISC-V standard-setting does not require U.S. firms to share confidential information with other firms. Corporations’ sensitive IP is only used in their implementation of RISC-V, not shared through the RISC-V platform itself, and firms can license their RISC-V implementation. Startups like SiFive and Tenstorrent, for example, use the RISC-V ISA and then license their implementations of it as IP. Furthermore, some argue that open-source ISA designs are more secure than closed designs because they allow members of the technical community to locate vulnerabilities collectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;RISC-V standard-setting does not require U.S. firms to share confidential information with other firms. Corporations’ sensitive IP is only used in their implementation of RISC-V, not shared through the RISC-V platform itself, and firms can license their RISC-V implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-business-case-for-risc-v&quot;&gt;The Business Case for RISC-V&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid Industry Adoption:&lt;/strong&gt; According to BCC Publishing, market revenue for RISC-V technology is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 33.1 percent from 2022 to 2027. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) supported RISC-V multicore processor development in 2018. As of 2025, many U.S. firms are rapidly investing in RISC-V-based software implementations, from microcontrollers in GPUs from Nvidia to 5G mmWave RF in Samsung and HDD controllers in Seagate. Indeed, in May 2023, industry leaders and startups cooperatively launched the RISC-V Software Ecosystem (RISE) Project, which intends to expedite the incorporation of RISC-V software into consumer electronics, data centers, and automotive products. RISE’s 13 premier members and 10 general members include Google, Intel, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Red Hat, Rivos, SiFive, Ventana, Samsung, Mediatek, Bytedance, and Tenstorrent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large industry players have also publicly described the expanding role of RISC-V architecture in AI applications and scaling. In 2018, Google helped found OpenTitan with the aim of developing an open-source, root-of-trust chip, which has been enabled by community members and partners in industry and academia. Qualcomm uses RISC-V cores in some of its Snapdragon processors and has shipped over 650 million such cores in its devices. Nvidia revealed in October 2024 that its custom CUDA cores rely on the RISC-V ISA standard. The company has developed at least three RISC-V microcontroller cores so far and, as of October 2024, expected to ship a billion across its products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greater Technical Flexibility:&lt;/strong&gt; Why are so many firms investing in RISC-V? The answer comes down to flexibility and cost, primarily in terms of supply chain and customizability. Licensing requirements are expensive and limiting, not to mention legally complicated. Furthermore, RISC-V is currently more flexible on the technical side than earlier ISAs. x86, for example, has been iterated upon for a long time, accruing extensions and complications, making it hard to work with for new applications. RISC-V-based cores do not have legacy issues from prior generations, and they can be more easily tailored for performance benefits or higher computation densities. As a spokesperson for Ventana Micro explained, “Addition of an instruction in RISC-V is a relatively straightforward process of coming up with an instruction definition, providing the needed justification for the instruction and driving it through the RISC-V International Technical Steering Committee.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the recent growth of RISC-V offers advantages, its newness also means that it does not have the same technical and customer support network as proprietary ISAs. While ARM’s proprietary technology comes with support and liability coverage, RISC-V International is currently trying to build up that ecosystem. As a spokesperson for Ventana Micro explained, “The goal is always to drive all new instructions/extensions through RISC-V International to prevent fragmentation in the industry. That said, you can always quickly blaze ahead to incubate an acceleration idea on top of the common base if you really need to get something done. That is what is bringing a lot of AI applications to RISC-V.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;growing-adoption-of-risc-v&quot;&gt;Growing Adoption of RISC-V&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RISC-V is not just a competitor to x86 and ARM but rather represents a breakthrough alternative in chip design for a wide range of current and potential applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Applications:&lt;/strong&gt; So far, RISC-V has been adopted mostly in embedded tech, with market possibilities in the wearable, global automotive, and HPC/AI industries on the horizon. Chips from the fabless company SiFive, an early proponent of RISC-V high-performance chips, are found in Google data centers and NASA’s High-Performance Spaceflight Computer. RISC-V has also been tapped to build flexible chips that could power wearable healthcare electronics, smart package labels, soft robotics, and other inexpensive items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future Applications:&lt;/strong&gt; While RISC-V won’t be competitive with x86 and ARM in mainstream consumer electronics applications for at least 10 years, leading firms are already using RISC-V to develop future capabilities. Alibaba is developing RISC-V chips for edge computing, and Hong Kong–based DeepComputing has released the world’s first RISC-V laptops, though their performance currently lags behind that of laptops using proprietary ISA counterparts. In 2024, engineers from Intel’s Advanced Architecture Development Group established AheadComputing Inc., a startup focused on developing RISC-V core IP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need for Infrastructure:&lt;/strong&gt; Crucially, for RISC-V to become a major force in mainstream devices, there needs to be a robust ecosystem of tools, support systems, and resources built to attract chipmakers and manufacturers. One key sign of progress was RISC-V International’s October 2024 ratification of the RVA23 profile, a standardized set of ISA extensions compatible with RISC-V, though much remains to be done to support its development ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-international-risc-v-landscape&quot;&gt;The International RISC-V Landscape&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The United States&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the United States is the leader in chip design, meaning that U.S.-designed chips lead the global market in performance, energy efficiency, sophistication, and market share. The emergence of RISC-V—as an alternative platform that allows all countries, firms, and individuals to design chip architectures—raises concerns about the ability of U.S. firms to sustain this leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enabling China’s Progress?&lt;/strong&gt; In late 2023, some members of Congress expressed concern over the national security implications of Chinese firms’ involvement in developing RISC-V. These policymakers worry that Chinese firms will use the RISC-V architecture to bypass U.S. export controls, potentially using RISC-V in high-performance chips in the future. Those who urge caution point out that open-source software helped enable the rise of Chinese companies like ByteDance and Tencent, and that RISC-V could similarly aid Chinese firms in the hardware space. In this regard, Serge Leef, a DARPA microcontroller product manager, has argued that it is “not unlikely” that RISC-V could be “giving China a leg up on all these technologies because they can now save 20 years of engineering and catch up to Western technology overnight.” In response to such concerns, the Department of Commerce announced in April 2024 that it was reviewing the national security implications of RISC-V.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Or an Opportunity for U.S. Innovation?&lt;/strong&gt; In contrast, major semiconductor firms see RISC-V as a significant opportunity for innovation. Many are considering basing future designs on RISC-V, reducing dependence on ARM, and expanding their markets. For example, last year, Business Korea reported that Samsung Electronics established an Advanced Processor Lab in Silicon Valley dedicated to RISC-V-based AI chip design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Excluding U.S. firms from the standards process would likely not stop global development, however, which means U.S. firms would be forced to develop technologies that fit different ISAs, license expensive proprietary standards, or adopt less efficient technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limited Options:&lt;/strong&gt; Whatever concerns some U.S. policymakers may have, regulatory options over RISC-V are limited because RISC-V International operates outside the United States. In fact, the organization moved overseas to avoid potential breaches of U.S. sanctions against Huawei and other Chinese companies, which are RISC-V members. This means that the United States cannot restrict the publication of RISC-V standards or determine which other countries participate in the process. The only immediate, but not necessarily effective, option would be to restrict U.S. firms from participating in RISC-V standards development. Excluding U.S. firms from the standards process would likely not stop global development, however, which means U.S. firms would be forced to develop technologies that fit different ISAs, license expensive proprietary standards, or adopt less efficient technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;China&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In seeking greater technological autonomy and self-sufficiency, China is looking to RISC-V as an alternative to licensing IP blocks from Western firms such as Intel and Arm. As one Chinese media article puts it (translated by the authors), “You cannot build a house on someone else’s foundation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflecting a longstanding commitment to reducing dependence on U.S. technology, the Chinese government is incentivizing the use of RISC-V architecture in chip design, primarily among firms based in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen, and more recently in Wuhan. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The RISC-V Industry Alliance convened local startups in a collaboration that had grown to 173 companies by mid-2023.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2023, nine leading chip design firms, including Alibaba’s chip unit (T-Head) and Baidu-backed StarFive, formed a patent alliance for RISC-V to enable the sharing of IP and licensing to third parties to promote a “healthy” (i.e., Chinese centric) open-source environment and the “rapid development” of RISC-V technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2023, Alibaba’s chip design subsidiary, T-Head, launched a RISC-V-based controller chip, Zhenyue 510, for applications in artificial intelligence training, online transactions, and big data analysis. A T-Head executive said that his company was launching an initiative to encourage 150,000 developers to learn about and secure international credentials with respect to RISC-V.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Beijing Open-Source Chip Research Institute, a group of research centers that includes members from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and hyper-scalers Tencent and Alibaba, is developing indigenous chip design architecture based on RISC-V. Scientists at the academy released a RISC-V-based processor called XiangShan and aim to produce a commercial version in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alibaba’s research arm, Damo Academy, launched the next generation of its RISC-V XuanTie processors for applications in 5G communications, robotics, and financial services in February 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China has invested heavily and incentivized engagement in standards-setting processes, seeking to exert more influence over the development and use of technology standards—raising important questions about its impact on the broader networks of innovation, competition, trade, and security. Reflecting its strong endorsement, in March 2025, there were reports that China plans to issue guidance to encourage RISC-V chip use.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Europe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the European Strategy and Policy Analysis System, the European Union’s share of global chip revenue dropped from about 20 percent in the 1990s to less than 10 percent in the 2020s. The European Processor Initiative (EPI), launched with European Commission and, later, European Chips Act support, seeks to reduce Europe’s foreign-chip dependence and grow its own processor industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even as these initiatives aim to reduce Europe’s reliance on U.S. and Asian suppliers for critical technologies, RISC-V has “opened the possibility for anyone in the world, including Europe, to make processors,” according to Mateo Valero, director of the Barcelona Supercomputing Cluster. Aiming to create a “Design Valley” in Spain, the Barcelona Supercomputing Cluster has worked on RISC-V technology since the 2010s. In 2023, the cluster presented Sargantana, the latest generation of open-source indigenous chips. Other smaller European firms using RISC-V include Gaiser, Esperanto Technologies, Semidynamics, and Codasip, with growing momentum in the embedded systems market. The Barcelona Supercomputing Cluster is also helping coordinate the new Digital Autonomy with RISC-V in Europe (DARE) Project, which brings together 38 tech players to try and create three chiplets. The six-year project is backed by €240 million from the EuroHPC public-private partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some European stakeholders caution against unrealistic expectations of complete chip sovereignty and, as in China, call instead for strategic collaboration within the RISC-V framework. Indeed, the EE Times reported in early 2024 that Nordic Semiconductor, Bosch, NXP, Agile Analog, and Semidynamics are among the European semiconductor industry players contributing to the rise in RISC-V-centered collaborations to reduce dependencies on other firms: “the community is anxious not to repeat the mistakes made with Arm.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;new-entrants-are-investing-in-risc-v-based-systems-due-to-speed-of-development-and-lower-costs&quot;&gt;New entrants are investing in RISC-V-based systems due to speed of development and lower costs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;India&lt;/em&gt;: The Indian government is investing in developing a series of indigenous processors, with significant work from the Shakti program at IIT-Madras. National investment programs, such as the Digital India RISC-V Program in academia and industry, aim to support the development of a RISC-V-centered innovation hub in Bengaluru.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brazil&lt;/em&gt;: The Brazil Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation is a premier member of RISC-V International. Institutions like the Eldorado Institute and the Wernher von Braun Advanced Research Center are focusing on RISC-V projects, including an international collaborative partnership with the Barcelona Supercomputing Center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;risc-v-as-strategic-opportunity-for-us-standards-innovation-leadership&quot;&gt;RISC-V as Strategic Opportunity for U.S. Standards Innovation Leadership&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the rapid adoption of the RISC-V platform and its benefits for enhanced interoperability and collaboration, what are the options for U.S. policy? Recent analyses have highlighted RISC-V policy considerations for U.S. policymakers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Need for a Better Understanding of RISC-V:&lt;/strong&gt; A 2024 commentary pointed out that RISC-V has not been well understood by policymakers—in particular the fact that chip competition occurs at the implementation level, not at the standards level. This means that each firm implements the ISA uniquely, adding their proprietary innovations independently. In short, RISC-V does not involve transfers of sensitive technology, and companies typically do not give away their IP during standards discussions—so, in principle, China’s participation in RISC-V does not grant access to advanced semiconductor technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Importance of Continued Engagement with RISC-V:&lt;/strong&gt; Efforts to force U.S. firms out of RISC-V would be dysfunctional in that they would not stop the use of RISC-V by Chinese and other firms but would in fact cede innovation to Chinese firms. Indeed, some U.S. firms would still need to use RISC-V but would lose influence over its development. This could lead to a fragmented RISC-V ecosystem, potentially disadvantaging U.S. firms that would have to develop multiple RISC-V systems without being able to influence the ecosystem’s trajectory. Moreover, there are good commercial and technical reasons for U.S., European, and other firms to support RISC-V. It enables them to avoid dependency on a single proprietary standard and to benefit from a low-cost, adaptable, widely adopted standard that continues to improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Constraints on Regulatory Approaches:&lt;/strong&gt; A 2024 CSET article highlighted how U.S. regulatory options over RISC-V are limited because RISC-V is managed by a Swiss standards body; the only real possibility would be to restrict U.S. involvement in RISC-V standards. But such a move would be counterproductive for U.S. firms (which may leave the United States so that they can use RISC-V in other countries) and could harm U.S. tech leadership and competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A major advantage of RISC-V is that it is a low-cost standard that can be leveraged by researchers, taught and used in universities, and adopted by small startups as well as large companies. . . . Importantly, RISC-V is a means to bring the innovative ideas of a new generation of researchers to the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “The Promise and Paranoia of RISC-V” section of a 2021 Foreign Policy Research Institute report takes a longer-term view: RISC-V presents a lot of opportunities in terms of its adaptability and implementation, the report asserts, and the United States must invest in RISC-V at home to ensure that it is positioned to lead the field of open-source hardware. The report notes that though some fear the rise of this new standard, the United States has much to gain from it. While RISC-V would lower the price of chip design and lead to commoditization in some areas of the chip industry, it would also shift the key point of competition from capital to design creativity. This would play to the United States’ current strengths in design and underscores the need for more production (or acquisition) of high-end engineering talent and matching it with a supportive business environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly and challengingly, RISC-V has already begun to be embedded across the U.S. innovation ecosystem in projects throughout the public and private sectors in applications such as spaceflight computing at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Nvidia’s CUDA cores. A major advantage of RISC-V is that it is a low-cost standard that can be leveraged by researchers, taught and used in universities, and adopted by small startups as well as large companies. It represents a more easily accessible, low-cost path to new innovative products and greater competition. Importantly, RISC-V is a means to bring the innovative ideas of a new generation of researchers to the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-the-united-states-can-progress-toward-standards-leadership&quot;&gt;How the United States Can Progress Toward Standards Leadership&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, U.S. leadership in global standards-setting has promoted growth and innovation across technologies and their supply chains, with attendant advantages to U.S. firms. In recent years, this attention has waned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China now recognizes the value of active participation in standards-setting in developing its long-term competitive advantage. As highlighted in the China Standards 2035 plan, China is prioritizing investment and engagement in standards-setting bodies with an eye to gaining a competitive advantage for Chinese companies in a broad range of emerging technologies. It would not be prudent to cede standards leadership. In this context, the United States should move toward exerting active leadership in international standards-setting opportunities—including that posed by RISC-V. This will require both policy attention and greater resources for U.S. participation in standards bodies. The United States must recognize that China has changed the nature of the competition in standards, and the United States needs to adopt a constructive, but affirmative, response together with likeminded countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To progress toward standards leadership, the United States can leverage existing programs and mechanisms in the semiconductor innovation ecosystem. To support a pipeline of professionals fluent in RISC-V, the United States can further embed RISC-V training into engineering curricula and workforce development, such as the Research Scholars program funded through the Semiconductor Research Corporation. RISC-V can also be emphasized in federally funded regional initiatives like the Department of Defense Microelectronics Commons and Department of Commerce Tech Hubs, in cooperation with universities, startups, and industry. Specifically, government-supported projects provide an opportunity to support the physical infrastructure necessary to accelerate RISC-V development and validation across the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government needs to ensure that the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) can take an active role in the international standards process, including support for U.S. firms in standards-setting bodies such as RISC-V International. NIST can also promote standards education through workshops for government agencies and by convening industry leaders to better understand their interests and challenges. Stakeholders need to be provided the resources to collaborate internationally and develop strategies for standards that would best serve the interests of the United States and like-minded countries. NIST’s efforts need to be adequately funded and supported to ensure that U.S. firms, viewpoints, and citizens are represented in this ongoing, international standards-setting effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To meet this challenge, the United States should promote standards education and encourage research and development in this area, including in engineering curricula, and adequately fund U.S. participation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Encourage active engagement in standards-setting by U.S. firms in international standards bodies and support NIST with the federal resources necessary to balance China’s engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adopt programs to support RISC-V-based work in universities and industry, especially for students to be introduced to and trained in RISC-V. Invest in the physical infrastructure necessary to support RISC-V development, including R&amp;amp;D labs and testing facilities for validating RISC-V-based hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use existing mechanisms, such as proven programs from the Semiconductor Research Corporation, to support a pipeline of RISC-V-fluent professionals and programs, including RISC-V electronic design automation tools. Talent development will be key.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Emphasize RISC-V use and development in federally funded projects, such as the Department of Defense Microelectronics Commons and other Tech Hubs, as a means of connecting researchers from industry and academia with tools and training to grow RISC-V leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RISC-V presents a key strategic opportunity for the United States to exercise leadership and influence in the global chip design landscape in the decades to come, but the measures needed are immediate. The standards process is a moving train, and the United States need to build a coalition to help guide it by continuing to support the domestic design industry as a whole and support both investment and participation in RISC-V development.&lt;/p&gt;

The UK should support its likeminded ally and put the question of Canadian membership to the JEF at its Leaders’ Summit in Oslo on 9 May.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 28 March 2025, Mark Carney – a strong candidate to become the next Canadian Prime Minister today – declared that Canada’s old relationship with the US, “based on deepening integration of our economies and tight security and military cooperation, is over”. Just three months into his second term, President Trump has made unprecedented and repeated demands that Canada becomes America’s 51st state, even refusing to rule out the use of force to achieve this. Similar threats to acquire Greenland from the Kingdom of Denmark have shattered NATO harmony. His “Liberation Day” tariffs have directly challenged the North Atlantic Treaty’s Article 2 (Economic collaboration). For Canada, NATO’s protections are now less certain, and the country should look to Europe for alternative security and trade arrangements. Joining the Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) would be a valuable start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-now&quot;&gt;Why Now?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2013, Canada was among the first group of countries invited to join the JEF. The UK and Canada are closely linked, with a shared history, monarch, values and political system. Canadian soldiers fought alongside the UK, Denmark, Estonia and the Netherlands in NATO’s Regional Command South in Afghanistan – the hard fought experience which became the genesis of the JEF. However, Canada declined the offer of membership at the 2014 NATO Wales Summit and thought the door closed during Britain’s post-Brexit positioning and Danish concerns around traditional rivalries over Hans Island and Arctic cooperation. These issues have since eased and Trumpian pressure has reopened the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canadian, European and UK defence policy is increasingly aligning north to shore up the Arctic and High North to Russian challenge. Canada is a major actor in the JEF core regions of the Northern Atlantic, High North and Baltic Sea Region. It is also the lead NATO framework nation in JEF member Latvia, alongside JEF members Iceland and Sweden as contributing nations and thus is committed to defending the Baltic States through NATO’s new hardened defence posture. Therefore, Canada joining the JEF would enhance political and military cooperation in the north and make the JEF a true Euro-Atlantic framework, thereby increasing its presence, operational effectiveness and deterrence credibility. Moreover, the offer of Canadian membership can regain the lost momentum on JEF since the new UK government came to power and give the framework a new impetus in a deteriorating security environment. The situation is so extraordinary that some have even suggested that Canada join the EU. Joining the JEF could be a valuable stepping stone to closer European integration, just like Finland and Sweden joining the JEF in 2017 eventually helped them into NATO in 2023 and 2024 respectively and setting Canada on a different path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategic-shocks&quot;&gt;Strategic Shocks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration’s hostility towards Europe and rapprochement with Russia has galvanised NATO and EU countries to increase defence spending, revise economic strategies, and consider organic alternatives to US leadership. Fundamental shifts in Euro-Atlantic security are expected which will push Europe and Canada closer together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, NATO faces multiple challenges from US reprioritisation away from the Europe. There are reports that the US may choose to leave elements of the NATO command structure. Moreover, Trump, and multiple US Cabinet members, have suggested a new Alliance spending target of 5% of GDP. Creating stronger linkages between Canada and Europe will help bind NATO together as a Euro-Atlantic framework as US policy towards Europe evolves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, climate change in the North is rapidly enabling geopolitical change, with melting sea ice opening up more reliable – and valuable – trade and security routes between the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific. These emerging sea lines of communication could have significant geoeconomic benefits for Europe, Japan, South Korea and other Indo-Pacific partners. These changes will affect – and potentially benefit Canada and the JEF countries most. Canadian security and viability of the Northwest Passage would be a valuable alternative for European shipping to risk relying on Russia for safe piloting and navigation of the Northern Sea Route to Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These shorter trade arteries will need to be secured. With limited benefit to US wealth generation and growing demands for increased burden sharing from Washington, DC, these new sea lanes will likely have to be protected by Canada, European Allies and Indo-Pacific partners without US support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin has acknowledged that Trump was serious about Greenland and that the Arctic was, “a springboard for possible conflicts.” As Russia seeks new resourcing opportunities, whilst opening new bases across the Arctic, the US rhetoric towards long-term allies threatens traditional patterns of generating consensus through NATO, the Arctic Council and international maritime law. More concerning, the US and Russia might collude to create a duopoly in the Arctic as a way of stabilising the region and coming to a grander bargain on Euro-Atlantic security, than just peace in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, uncertainty – and shock – over US leadership has pushed Europe and Canada to consider novel options to finance rearmament and defence resilience. Rebuilding Europe’s defence industrial base is seen by some in Brussels as a prerequisite to ween the continent off US security, while cooler heads point out that the US is still critical for the defence of Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with significant increases in defence spending, it will take 15-20 years to replace the US nuclear and conventional deterrent in Europe. Therefore, Europe and Canada’s own liberation day from US leadership is a long way off. However, alternative groupings of likeminded nations are needed to step up in the meantime to bolster assurance and burden sharing. Complementary groups such as the JEF are therefore becoming more important for regional cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strength-in-numbers&quot;&gt;Strength in Numbers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canada is not the only NATO ally that has attracted Trump’s ire. Denmark – a founding member of NATO, the Arctic Council and the JEF – finds itself in a similar position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite criticism from the US Vice President, Denmark has already expanded its potential defence and economic investment into Greenland and its naval forces in the north. Denmark’s pragmatism has paid off already through EU support. Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, pushed the Danish government to hold a referendum on reversing the 30-year-old opt-out clause relating to defence initiatives under the EU’s Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) – that hosts its own mutual defence clause (Article 42.7 of the Treaty of the European Union). Two-thirds of Danish voters backed the government to reverse the opt-out and fully cooperate on EU defence. But it needs more support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Denmark bridges every defence club and has a well-established Joint Arctic Command 2-Star Headquarters in Nuuk, Greenland, which is available for national, JEF, CSDP, or NATO operations. JEF operations do not always need to be UK-led and the UK can plug into other JEF member command and control structures - something that would appeal to Canada too. Moreover, belonging to the JEF provides access to UK strategic enablers, extended nuclear deterrence, and the UK’s own pragmatism in trans-Atlantic diplomacy. The opportunity to embrace these pragmatic bridges to Europe and the US must be appealing to Canada, particular as the Danes assume the 6-month EU Council Presidency in July 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stepping-up-on-defence&quot;&gt;Stepping Up on Defence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canada would need to significantly step up on defence to match the JEF members and be a net contributor. Canada currently spends just 1.37% on GDP defence - well below the current NATO target of 2% - placing the country 27th of 31 allies (Iceland are not included in NATO spending figures). In 2024 Canada’s spending profile represented a real terms increase of 57.75%. In the same timeframe, the JEF members have delivered an average real-terms increase of 150% and are continuing to rise rapidly. Membership would help Canada position its spending on capabilities which are optimised for the High North and would bring 10 NATO allies to its side when renegotiating NATO Planning targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fund the required increases, Canada should follow Europe in exploring new financial mechanisms, such as the Defence Security and Resilience Bank (DSRB). This new institution is complements developing EU initiatives and can be accessed by all of Europe (including UK and Norway as non-EU nations) as well as democratic partners across the world, including Canada, Japan and South Korea. It expands access to Canada, not clearly covered the non-paper recently circulated by the UK, which looks like an attempt to help fund a purely UK-EU Defence Pact. The UK can help enable Canada’s economic and security bridging in to Europe by helping it join the JEF and by hosting the DSRB in the City of London, providing a win for the new Canadian leadership who are already noting the DSRB as one tool for financing Canadian rearmament. Countries that commit capital to join the DSRB can use this overall national balance sheet asset as part of their overall GDP contributions to defence spending and would be the quickest way to get Canada to 2% and higher as the target increases to match American expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept is also attractive to JEF countries who would make ideal initial members of the DSRB that has – in part – it origins in the idea of establishing a “JEF Bank”. Therefore, JEF members - alongside Canada – are in prime position to present the concept for agreement at the JEF Leaders Meeting in Oslo in May 2025, a few weeks ahead of the June 2025 NATO Summit in The Hague, which would allow a third of NATO members to collectively position themselves ahead of facing expected additional demands from the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oslo provides the first opportunity for Canada to join the JEF and embrace a highly innovative new way of funding defence for all European nations and Canada. Finally, Canada holds the Presidency of the G7, the DSRB could conceivably make it onto the agenda at the next G7 Finance Ministers meeting in Alberta on 22 May 2025, ahead of the G7 summit is mid-June. A suitable reciprocal act in May from a likeminded JEF ally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;oceans-11&quot;&gt;Oceans 11&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canadian membership of the JEF makes geopolitical, geoeconomic, and defence regeneration logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has a critical role to play, through encouraging Canada’s rearmament and re-emergence as a North American power who wants to lead and rapidly enhance Canada’s defence credibility in a more dangerous world. However, the UK must also step up. King Charles – as Canada’s Head of State – warmly received Carney as his first overseas visit since taking over leadership of the Liberal Party. However, Sir Keir Starmer and his government have been near silent on support for Canada and Denmark under Trump’s increasing pressure. French President Macron and outgoing German Chancellor Scholz have been far more vocal in their support for Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will also vastly strengthen Arctic security – a key UK interest – making six of eight members of the Arctic Council part of the JEF, frustrating Russia who will face a vanguard of JEF and EU CSDP security beneath the steel of NATO deterrence, underpinned by US and UK nuclear capability – creating another valuable layer of assurance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canada is therefore set to become the most important ally the JEF never had. The JEF enables Canada’s move towards northern European cooperation and interoperability, and in turbulent economic times, puts Canada on point as a good ally towards likeminded nations. The time is right for Canada to join the JEF as a full member. It should be offered in May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the 2025 Space Threat Assessment by the Aerospace Security Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). This resource for policymakers and the public leverages open-source information to assess key developments in foreign counterspace weapons. Drawing on eight years of collected data and analyses, this series describes trends in the development, testing, and use of counterspace weapons and enables readers to develop a deeper understanding of threats to U.S. national security interests in space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the publication of the 2024 Space Threat Assessment, there have been few headline-grabbing counterspace developments. No nation was known to have tested or used kinetic anti-satellite missiles, commonly called direct ascent anti-satellite (DA ASAT) weapons. There was no public indication that any nation tested or used counterspace weapons such as laser dazzlers or directed energy weapons. While Russia’s pursuit of a nuclear anti-satellite capability topped the news last year, no information has publicly surfaced revealing how close Russia might be to launching this system, though the United States and its international partners remain concerned that Russia could decide to deploy such a weapon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a closer look reveals that the past year, from the perspective of counterspace developments, has been anything but uneventful. Rather than entirely new developments, the past year mostly witnessed a continuation of the worrisome trends discussed in prior reports, notably widespread jamming and spoofing of GPS signals in and around conflict zones, including near and in Russia and throughout the Middle East. Chinese and Russian satellites in both low Earth orbit (LEO) and geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) continue to display more and more advanced maneuvering capabilities, demonstrating operator proficiency and tactics, techniques, and procedures that can be used for space warfighting and alarming U.S. and allied officials. Finally, U.S. companies providing a commercial space service to government users, particularly defense and military ones, remain squarely in the crosshairs of nation states, with Russia in particular vocal about its intention to consider commercial assets used by the U.S. military as legitimate targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past year also saw the growth of commercial and military dual-use technologies that could be modified to serve a counterspace purpose. Companies working on in-space servicing and debris removal reached important milestones, demonstrating their ability to conduct rendezvous, proximity, and docking operations, techniques that could be used by anti-satellite weapons. The behaviors of commercial satellites pursuing in-space servicing, inspection, debris removal, and other business use cases could easily be confused for counterspace operations, creating risks of misunderstandings and possibly unintended escalations in a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though this report has not historically covered U.S. counterspace capabilities, it would be difficult to assess the global counterspace landscape without noting the evolving U.S. posture toward counterspace weapons and operations. In response to China’s rapid buildup of military space capabilities in all orbital regimes, U.S. Space Force senior leaders have repeatedly emphasized over the last year that the United States is prepared to conduct offensive and defensive space operations and intends to field more counterspace capabilities. This report also does not typically address unintentional debris creation in orbit, but this year the assessment includes a discussion on the latent risks to space operations posed by accidental debris-causing events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a common thread throughout this year’s report is how space fits into the future of warfare. The normalization of space as a military operational domain and its integral role in joint operations mean that space is fair game during conflict. Warfighting will happen in, through, and from space, meaning that a future peer-on-peer conflict may very well bring disruption and destruction to space on the same scale that it would bring to other places closer to Earth. Counterspace threats should be viewed within the broader context of efforts by adversaries to degrade the ability of the United States and its allies to fight and win a war and disrupt the economy and day-to-day life on Earth, not merely as efforts to degrade a space capability. Overall, space is likely becoming a more dangerous place and woven ever more into both peacetime and wartime activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;counterspace-weapons&quot;&gt;COUNTERSPACE WEAPONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter provides an overview of different types of counterspace weapons and a useful taxonomy to classify and differentiate them. Counterspace weapons vary significantly in the technical methods they use to create effects against space systems, in how they are deployed, and in the level of technology and resources needed for their development and fielding. For the purposes of this report, counterspace weapons are organized into four main categories: kinetic, non-kinetic, and electronic weapons and cyber operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kinetic weapons are defined here as those using physical, material means such as bombs, bullets, missiles, and other munitions. All kinetic weapons are considered as meant to destroy or damage. This category includes weapons that target spacecraft, such as DA ASAT missiles outfitted with conventional warheads, and projectile attacks launched from one on-orbit satellite to another. It also includes weapons that target terrestrial space infrastructure, such as ground stations, launch sites, rocket and satellite factories, and space monitoring infrastructure. Orbital grappling satellites are another form of kinetic weapon. Such a grappler physically handles a target spacecraft to do it harm or attaches itself to a spacecraft and maneuvers it to another location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-kinetic weapons are defined as those that use radiated energy to destroy, damage, or interfere with space systems. This energy can be directed, such as with laser or microwave energy, or distributed through nuclear detonations or electromagnetic pulse (EMP) events. High-powered lasers and dazzlers and high-powered microwave ASAT systems are included in this category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/XMn3SMd.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: COUNTERSPACE WEAPONS OF CHINA, RUSSIA, IRAN, AND NORTH KOREA AS OF MARCH 2025&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dazzlers are intended to temporarily blind an optical satellite, although they may also unintentionally damage targeted satellites. Nuclear detonations in the upper atmosphere or space are included in this category because these attacks primarily damage electronics through the resulting EMP and lingering radiation that gets trapped by Earth’s magnetic field. Other nonnuclear weapons that create EMP events in space would also be included in this category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electronic weapons use the electromagnetic spectrum to deny or interfere with a target’s ability to use space services and capabilities. These weapons cannot destroy; they only impart temporary effects for as long as the electronic system engages its target. This category includes jamming and spoofing of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and satellite communications (SATCOM) signals. Spoofing, sometimes also called signal hijacking, is a form of electronic attack where an attacker tricks a receiver into believing a fake signal produced by the attacker is the real signal it is trying to receive. Also included in this category are any electronic attacks to jam space-based radar and the reception of radio frequency (RF) signals by the user of a satellite service on Earth, the satellite itself, or the ground station of a space system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final category, cyber operations, includes any offensive activity in cyberspace that targets space systems, including ground infrastructure, satellite terminals, spaceports, and spacecraft. Cyber operations can destroy or permanently disable a targeted system, although they can also be used to temporarily disrupt it or to conduct espionage, including gaining access to proprietary or sensitive technical information on a target network. A network exploitation can be a beachhead for any of these purposes, as a cyber operation’s intent is often ambiguous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of these counterspace capabilities depend on robust space situational awareness (SSA) and intelligence information from both terrestrial and space-based platforms to target space systems and verify attack success. In order to attack a satellite on-orbit, an aggressor would need to know its precise location and where it is moving. The aggressor will also want accurate battle damage assessments. For example, if a satellite is targeted through a cyberattack that allows the attacker to disable its controls, SSA or intelligence insights will be necessary to determine if the attack was successful by monitoring the satellite’s movements and network activity. Although this report tracks counterspace weapons trends, it is important to acknowledge the critical data needed to develop and employ many of these weapons against their targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;china&quot;&gt;CHINA&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing’s actions over the last year point to an ever-increasing emphasis by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) on the military use of space. Since the publication of the last threat report, continuing past trends, China demonstrated dual-use, highly maneuverable satellites in orbit and the tendency to maneuver and use fuel seemingly without regret. These activities point to growing operator proficiency and maturing space tactics, techniques, and procedures. Beijing also reorganized its armed forces, creating a specific force oriented around space operations. Though China has continued its aggressive cyber operations, few seem to specifically target space systems. Additionally, PRC officials and academics are more willing to publicly criticize U.S. behaviors in space, pointing to examples of where they claim the United States engages in the same space activities for which it criticizes China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last year, the most concerning development to U.S. observers should be the launch and operation of increasingly advanced Chinese satellites. China continues to launch and operate highly maneuverable satellites, demonstrating an advanced level of technological and operational acumen that, if not already deployed for such purposes, could enable a formidable on-orbit counterspace arsenal. Through the use of these satellites, Chinese operators are gaining experience in developing tactics and procedures that can be used for space warfighting, to include both defensive and offensive advanced space operations. Additionally, China is dramatically increasing its space launch capability, with several commercial providers coming online in the next few years. Each year, the PRC is launching more and more satellites, making characterization of those satellites more challenging year after year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CHINA CONTINUES TO LAUNCH AND OPERATE HIGHLY MANEUVERABLE SATELLITES, [WHICH] COULD ENABLE A FORMIDABLE ON-ORBIT COUNTERSPACE ARSENAL.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/tXT5o3U.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 3: CHINESE SATELLITE SERIES THAT OFTEN EXHIBIT RPOS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing trends described in prior editions of Space Threat Assessment, U.S. experts and military officials expressed concerns in December 2024 about unusual and potentially threatening behaviors of Chinese satellites in GEO. According to an expert at ExoAnalytic, these behaviors demonstrate China’s proficiency in conducting sophisticated satellite maneuvering and willingness to expend fuel to conduct rapid maneuvers. To emphasize these points, the expert also noted that the Chinese satellite TJS-2 was tracked during the last year maneuvering at 44 meters per second, which is unusually high and uses significantly more fuel than the more standard range of 0.5–1 meters per second for repositioning satellites in GEO. The expert further described how another satellite, TJS-4, maneuvered to position itself between a U.S. space surveillance satellite and the Sun, creating a disadvantageous geometry for imaging the Chinese satellite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following three Chinese satellite programs usually feature prominently in each edition of Space Threat Assessment, and this year is no exception. There is often little public information about these spacecraft capabilities or specific missions, outside of official Chinese government statements, which are almost certainly designed to conceal the true purposes of military satellites. Most public information about the activities of Chinese satellites in GEO, documenting the sophistication and frequency of Chinese satellite maneuvers, was provided by SSA companies sharing their observations on social media platforms. Integrity ISR, a space and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) training company, and LSAS Tec, a company providing support services for space operations, released a video on YouTube documenting several TJS-10 maneuvers in May 2024 that eventually brought the satellite to within 25 kilometers (km) of another Chinese satellite in GEO, TJS-3, on May 16, 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2025, China launched SJ-25, which official sources claim will be used for testing satellite fuel replenishment and life extension service technologies. After launch, according to analysis from COMSPOC and Integrity ISR, SJ-25 entered a coplanar orbit with SJ-21, a satellite which in 2022 attached to and moved a defunct Beidou satellite from its position in GEO to a graveyard orbit, suggesting SJ-25 may intend to refuel SJ-21. Additionally, in January 2025, suspected Chinese GEO inspector satellite TJS-3 moved to within one degree latitude of SJ-21, possibly suggesting a supporting role for TJS-3 in an upcoming refueling attempt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On two occasions in the last year, Integrity ISR published an analysis on the behaviors of SY-12-01 and SY-12-02, a pair of satellites launched in December 2021 whose purpose is described by Chinese media as “spatial environment exploration and related technical tests.” At the time of publication for last year’s Space Threat Assessment, these satellites had been drifting in opposite directions across the entire GEO belt. They continued to drift this year. According to the Integrity ISR assessments, in November 2024, SY-12-02 reached its turnaround point of 17.3 degrees east (over central Europe) and began a new eastward journey. In September 2024, SY-12-01 reached its turnaround point of 178.9 degrees east (over the Pacific Ocean) and began a new westward journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to its progress in GEO, over the last year China has demonstrated the ability to execute increasingly complicated spacecraft maneuvering in LEO. In May 2024, the Shenlong space plane released, maneuvered with, and possibly captured an object before returning to Earth in September 2024, after having been in orbit for over 260 days, according to analysis by Slingshot Aerospace. The space plane had previously released six other space objects soon after it launched in December 2023. In January 2024, three satellites believed to be technology demonstrators—SY-24C-01, SY-24C-02, and SY-24C-03—conducted corkscrew maneuvers around SJ-6-05B, believed to be another technology demonstrator with potential signals collection capability, as described in an analysis by Integrity ISR. Additionally, in March and April 2024, SY-24C-03 and SJ-6-05A conducted rendezvous and proximity operations (RPO), with each satellite maneuvering and the closest approach distance less than 1 km—essentially face-to-face for satellites traveling at around 17,000 mph—on April 22, 2024, according to analysis by s2a solutions, a Swiss company. In March 2025, a senior Space Force official characterized these behaviors as “dogfighting” in space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While continuing to advance its abilities to conduct sophisticated maneuvering in both LEO and GEO, according to a study released by the China Aerospace Studies Institute (CASI) in September 2024, China is also monitoring and assessing U.S. space-based SSA capabilities and is more willing to publicize the results of its assessments. The CASI report details the increasing number of Chinese academic publications that analyze the patterns of life of U.S. Geosynchronous Space Situational Awareness Program (GSSAP) satellites, including publicly naming the satellites most visited by GSSAP. China likely obtains data on close approaches from its own sensors, the Russian-led International Scientific Optical Network (ISON), and publicly available information from U.S. and European SSA databases. The PRC’s SSA capabilities rely on domestic ground-based infrastructure, foreign datasets, and at least 10 spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From an operational standpoint, China’s attention to the patterns of life of U.S. spacecraft has likely influenced how Chinese satellites respond when approached by suspected U.S. space surveillance satellites. Notable examples of such behavior in GEO include how SY-12-01 and SY-12-02 responded to the approach of USA 270 in late 2023 and TJS-4 behaviors described by ExoAnalytic and noted earlier in this section. Integrity ISR and LSAS Tec published information about maneuvers over several months in late 2024 by LDPE-3A, a U.S. satellite characterized as a “freight train” for experiments to GEO, that placed it about 25 km from and with favorable lighting conditions for viewing Chinese satellite SJ-23, which in this case did not maneuver in response. China is likely increasingly willing to publicly discuss observed GSSAP behaviors to influence international opinions, probably aiming to portray the United States as having a double standard—engaging in the same activities for which it criticizes China as being unsafe and unprofessional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is little public information on new Chinese cyber or electronic warfare activities since the last Space Threat Assessment. During the last year, experts expressed concerns about the impacts of Chinese-attributed Salt Typhoon cyber operations on space infrastructure. More detailed information was officially released on another PRC state-sponsored cyber group targeting satellite services and other sectors, Volt Typhoon, including descriptions of the actor’s techniques and recommended remedies. Additionally, public threat reporting from September 2024 indicated that an unknown cyber threat actor tied to Chinese-speaking groups has focused on supply chains for defense-related industries, with a particular focus on drone manufacturers, in Taiwan. It would be reasonable to assume these Chinese-speaking groups were affiliated in some way with China. It has been mostly quiet on the electronic warfare front, as there were only sporadic reports of Chinese jamming or spoofing of GPS or other satellite signals over the last year. Though there is not much cyber or jamming news this past year, based on findings presented in prior editions of Space Threat Assessment, China undoubtedly maintains advanced cyber and electronic warfare capabilities that can affect space systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CHINA IS LIKELY INCREASINGLY WILLING TO PUBLICLY DISCUSS OBSERVED GSSAP BEHAVIORS TO INFLUENCE INTERNATIONAL OPINIONS.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reorganization of China’s armed forces during the last year points to a focus on warfighting in space, as well as in cyberspace and the information operations domain, that cuts across and supports the service branches. Specifically, in April 2024, China announced the reorganization of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) into four services—the PLA Ground Force, Navy, Air Force, and Rocket Force—and four cross-cutting arms—the PLA Aerospace Force, Cyberspace Force, Information Support Force, and Joint Logistics Support Force. Though the Joint Logistics Support Force has existed since 2016, the Aerospace Force, Cyberspace Force, and Information Support Force are new organizations, created by dividing up the responsibilities of the now defunct Strategic Support Force, which had previously handled space-based intelligence, reconnaissance, electronic countermeasures, signals intelligence, information warfare, and communications. The Aerospace Force is responsible for managing all PLA space-based capabilities, including counterspace weapons, and PLA space launch facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the last year, Chinese scientists published several research papers on military technologies, including high-powered microwave and laser technologies, that—though not described as counterspace weapons in the papers—could be applied to counterspace weapons developments. However, there is no new publicly available information on specific military programs aimed at developing or testing these technologies. As noted in Space Threat Assessment 2024, the PRC has already fielded ground-based laser weapons capable of blinding or damaging satellites and conducted research on mobile high-powered microwave weapons for general military applications. China also maintains the same wide range of both fixed and mobile electronic warfare systems that can interfere with satellite communications links, GNSS signals, and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) intelligence-gathering satellites, as described in the 2024 report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, it has also become clear that Beijing assesses a military threat posed by LEO systems like Starlink. Researchers at East China Normal University and the PLA-affiliated National University of Defense Technology have written about the military and strategic implications of Starlink satellites, arguing that SpaceX’s relationship with the U.S. government may have lasting security implications. Three articles, published in Chinese journals focused on intelligence and international security studies, outline concerns of broad deployment of Starlink satellites by the United States and Starlink’s ability to transmit data that may be used for new combat styles, citing the impact Starlink had on the battlefield in Ukraine. Importantly, these assessments overstate the capabilities of Starlink and assume the satellites have been integrated into U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) architectures and intelligence missions. Further, as one U.S. scholar observes, a “clear PRC concern that emerges from these articles is that China’s counterspace capabilities will be less effective against a U.S. satellite constellation composed of a mix of proliferated constellations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early 2025 it was reported that Chinese scientists have run artificial intelligence-created simulations of targeted attacks on Starlink satellites to disrupt services. A Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics team published a study that alleges 99 Chinese satellites could disrupt 1,400 Starlink satellites within a 12-hour period, targeting not individual satellites, but large sections of the Starlink constellation. Inspired by how whales hunt in teams and direct large swaths of fish into their mouths in open water, the study describes Chinese satellites “hunting” Starlink satellites by using directed-energy weapons, such as lasers and microwaves. Notably, Nanjing University has been called one of the “seven sons” of China’s national defense, founded by the Chinese Ministry of National Defense and sanctioned by the United States and Taiwan for its involvement in developing military technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russia&quot;&gt;RUSSIA&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the past year, Russia has engaged in several provocative counterspace activities, in addition to allegedly working on a nuclear space-based anti-satellite weapon, according to revelations that first surfaced in February 2024. In May 2024, the United States accused Russia of launching a counterspace weapon, assessing it had “characteristics resembling previously deployed counterspace payloads” in 2019 and 2022. Not long after launch, the Russian satellite, designated Cosmos 2576, proceeded to enter into a coplanar orbit with a U.S. government satellite, USA 314, maneuvers the U.S. government justifiably viewed with concern, as such actions could signal the positioning of a counterspace weapon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of late February 2025, Cosmos 2576 was no longer operating in a synchronized orbit with USA 314, having begun maneuvers to raise its orbit in mid-February 2025, possibly coinciding with the thaw in U.S.-Russian relations. In February 2025, Russia launched Cosmos 2581, Cosmos 2582, and Cosmos 2583, acknowledged by Moscow as belonging to the Ministry of Defense, but little else is publicly known about their mission. Since then, Cosmos 2581 and Cosmos 2582 have moved in formation, coming as close as 100 meters apart on March 5, 2025—by any measure, a very close approach for two satellites. Though Cosmos 2583 has yet to maneuver since reaching orbit, it did pass as close as 0.5 km to Cosmos 2581 and Cosmos 2582 on March 7, 2025. Additionally, as it has done since its launch in August 2022, Cosmos 2558—a satellite that the U.S. Space Force asserts is also a counterspace weapon—remained in a coplanar orbit with USA 326.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AS OF LATE FEBRUARY 2025, COSMOS 2576 WAS NO LONGER OPERATING IN A SYNCHRONIZED ORBIT WITH USA 314.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Russia’s Luch (Olymp) satellites have continued to prowl the GEO belt. Since the publication of the last Space Threat Assessment, Luch (Olymp) 2 has spent time near Eutelsat Konnect, RASCOM-QAF 1, Astra 4A (originally Sirius 4), Thor 7, SES 5, Intelsat 3-F7, Thor 6, and Intelsat 10-02, according to data from Slingshot Aerospace. These satellites provide communications and broadcast services to a wide range of areas, including Africa, Europe, the Middle East, and South America. Some analysts assess that Luch (Olymp) 2 may have come as close as 5 km to Thor 7 in July 2024 and less than 1 km from Intelsat 10-02 in January 2025. Believed to be a signals collection satellite, it is not surprising that Luch (Olymp) 2 loitered near satellites providing data and broadcast services over Europe, consistent with past Luch behavior. Prior to the arrival of Luch (Olymp) 2 near Astra 4A in March 2024 (providing internet services across Europe), Astra 4A signals were jammed—likely by ground-based Russian jammers—interfering with Ukrainian broadcasts. Though unlikely mere coincidence, the specific relationship between the two events is not clear. Since 2023, Luch (Olymp) 1 had been parked near Intelsat 37e at 342 degrees East latitude, though in March 2025 it moved slightly lower than the geostationary belt, starting an eastward drift of about half a degree per day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though revelations that Moscow is developing a space-based nuclear anti-satellite weapon were covered in last year’s assessment, this issue continued to develop throughout last year and remained a significant counterspace headline in 2024. Not long after the first reports surfaced in February 2024, U.S. officials publicly addressed their concerns that Russia was developing a “troubling” anti-satellite counterspace weapon with alleged nuclear capabilities. A breach of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty (OST), which prohibits signatory nations from stationing nuclear weapons in space, such a weapon would disable or destroy hundreds—if not thousands—of satellites in LEO through radiation effects or the resulting EMP. The United States not only publicly condemned the development of this new weapon but also sought to apply international pressure through the United Nations. To date, Russian officials continue to deny accusations that Russia is even pursuing such a weapon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On March 14, 2024, the United States and Japan introduced a draft resolution to reaffirm states’ obligations under Article IV of the OST, calling on nations not to develop nuclear weapons specifically designed to be placed in orbit around the Earth. The draft resolution underwent a series of negotiations and redrafts leading to a vote on April 24, 2024. While 65 member states cosponsored the draft resolution, Russia cast a veto, and the draft resolution failed to be adopted. China abstained from the vote. The United States and Japan released a joint statement expressing their disappointment and continued commitment to ensuring countries cannot deploy nuclear weapons in space. Soon after, Russia and China circulated their own resolution calling on broad international prohibitions on space weapons. As it has done when Russia and China raised such language in the past, the United States opposed this resolution, previously calling the Russian and Chinese proposal fundamentally flawed and noting that it lacks a verification mechanism and does not address ground-based ASAT weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Piecing together statements from U.S. officials and other publicly available sources, it appears that Russia has not yet launched an anti-satellite weapon with a nuclear payload. However, it was disclosed that Moscow’s efforts have been years in the making, with a senior U.S. official shedding light on the intended orbital regime for such a counterspace weapon and connecting a “scientific” satellite currently in-orbit “in a region not used by any other spacecraft . . . of higher radiation than normal lower-Earth orbits” to the effort. Satellite trackers deduced that the satellite is likely Cosmos-2553, a satellite launched in February 2022 into a 2,000 km orbit that the Russian ministry of defense stated was a “technological spacecraft . . . equipped with newly developed onboard instruments and systems for testing them under the influence of radiation and heavy charged particles.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While reports claim this satellite carries a “dummy warhead,” U.S. officials stress that, should a nuclear weapon be detonated at a 2,000 km altitude, the effects would be “indiscriminate” and render LEO unusable “for some period of time,” perhaps a year. The only other satellites in orbits near Cosmos-2553 are one nonoperational Russian satellite and 10 nonoperational U.S. satellites. According to one expert, if the satellite is testing new technologies, it may have been placed in such a remote orbit because there would be less risk of affecting other satellites and it would be difficult to monitor. Based upon persistent radar monitoring by LeoLabs of Cosmos-2553, there is high confidence it has been tumbling since mid-November 2024. This observation strongly suggests the satellite is no longer operational.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to its counterspace efforts in space, Russia engages in jamming and spoofing GPS signals on Earth. Russian efforts to interfere with GPS signals stretch from the Baltic and Nordic nations, through Ukraine and Russia itself, to countries in the Black Sea region. Though efforts to jam and spoof GPS in Ukraine, including around Crimea in the Black Sea, have been ongoing since the start of the war, those efforts mushroomed to include many other regions in mid-2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Hm290o8.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: TIMELINE OF RUSSIAN NUCLEAR ASAT THREAT AND RESULTING DEVELOPMENTS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;RUSSIAN EFFORTS TO INTERFERE WITH GPS SIGNALS STRETCH FROM THE BALTIC AND NORDIC NATIONS . . . TO COUNTRIES IN THE BLACK SEA REGION.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GPS interference in the Nordic and Baltic regions is not new. For example, in the fall of 2018, Norway accused the Russian military of jamming GPS signals in the Kola Peninsula during NATO’s largest military exercise since the Cold War. However, the past two years have seen a surge in reports of GPS interference in these regions, as noted by the Finnish transport and communications agency Traficom, which saw roughly 2,000 reports filed in 2024 compared to 239 reports in 2023. While it is difficult to point to a clear explanation for Russia’s interest in jamming and spoofing GPS signals across these regions, the growth of GPS interference in Russia itself is a response to Ukrainian attacks on Russia using GPS-guided drones and missiles as point defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has also tried to interfere with Ukrainian television broadcasts from satellites, including attempting to jam signals from one of the Amos satellites in August 2024. Additionally, television signal jamming and hijacking affected Ukrainian broadcasts on Eutelsat’s Hotbird in March and April 2024. In response to increased jamming over the last year, a number of European countries lodged complaints with the International Telecommunication Union in June 2024, which then condemned Russian interference with GPS and television signals. Russia has on at least one occasion during the last year employed electronic warfare activities outside of Ukraine that affected more than GPS and television signals. In March 2024, when flying near Kaliningrad, a UK military aircraft returning a senior official to the United Kingdom from a visit to Poland experienced GPS and communications interference for about 30 minutes. It remains unclear whether the official’s flight was the specific target of the jamming attack, with UK officials publicly noting that it is not uncommon for aircraft to experience GPS interference near Kaliningrad. Russia also continues to pursue capabilities designed to defeat Starlink, having announced in December 2024 the development of a new monitoring system called Kalinka that can identify and locate Starlink terminals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it has done in prior years, Russia threatened the private sector for supporting the U.S. national security mission in space. In March 2024, a spokesperson for Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that Russia is “aware of Washington’s efforts to attract the private sector to serve its military space ambitions,” and that such systems “become a legitimate target for retaliatory measures, including military ones.” Russia also complained during the UN General Assembly in October 2024 that the United States and its allies use civilian and commercial space infrastructure for military purposes, arguing that such activities jeopardize the peaceful use of space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;others&quot;&gt;OTHERS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;iran&quot;&gt;IRAN&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of last year, Iran has continued to increase its proficiency in space launch, successfully launching satellites in January 2024, September 2024, and December 2024 from Iranian launch sites. The December 2024 launch placed three satellites into orbit. Iran claimed one of those three satellites was a space tug, called Saman-1, that could reposition other satellites in orbit, a capability with obvious counterspace uses. In November 2024, Russia launched two Iranian remote sensing satellites, called Kowsar and Hodhod, which Iran claims are the first two satellites operated by its private sector. Russia has launched other Iranian satellites before, including Iran’s first satellite, Khayyam, in August 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran has pursued cyberattacks against aerospace and satellite infrastructure, among other targets, over the last year. Microsoft and Palo Alto Networks published reports in March and August 2024, respectively, that provided more details on the Peach Sandstorm incidents. Both reports assessed that this cyber campaign was directed by the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as part of ongoing efforts to gather intelligence and conduct social engineering attacks. According to Microsoft, this same Iranian cyber threat actor has conducted prior attacks targeting the aerospace, construction, defense, education, energy, financial services, healthcare, government, satellite, and communications sectors in multiple countries. In February 2024, Mandiant reported on malicious cyber activity, aimed at espionage, linked to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps that targeted the aerospace and defense sectors in the Middle East and possibly Turkey, India, and Albania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;north-korea&quot;&gt;NORTH KOREA&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s only space launch attempt in 2024 ended in failure when a rocket carrying the country’s second reconnaissance satellite exploded after liftoff in May 2024. North Korea continues to operate its Mallygyong-1 satellite, which was launched in November 2023, and executed maneuvers to raise the satellite’s altitude in February and June 2024. It was reported that North Korea successfully tested a new ballistic missile in October 2024 and new intermediate-range hypersonic missile in January 2025, which followed a prior test in April 2024. Though none of these developments specifically relate to counterspace weapons, they demonstrate increasing North Korean proficiency with space, missile, and rocket technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the past year, South Korea repeatedly raised concerns about North Korean efforts to jam GPS signals around the Korean Peninsula and near the border between North and South Korea. Without providing more specific information, in January 2025, then–U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned that Russia was close to sharing “advanced space and satellite technology” with North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2024, the FBI and other partners issued a joint cybersecurity advisory warning of North Korean cyber espionage activities targeting defense, aerospace, nuclear, and engineering entities around the globe with the goal of advancing North Korea’s military and nuclear capabilities. Mandiant identified a cyber threat group in June 2024 with probable ties to North Korea that conducted phishing attacks pretending to be from an energy company and aerospace industry entity while targeting other entities in those sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;india&quot;&gt;INDIA&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2025, the Indian Space Research Organisation’s Space Docking Experiment (SpaDeX) mission successfully demonstrated India’s ability to conduct rendezvous and proximity operations and docking activities. Though not publicly associated with a military program, such capabilities have clear counterspace uses. As of December 2024, India may be in talks with Russia to acquire a ballistic missile early warning and space surveillance radar with a 6,000-km range for placement in southern India. Such a system may be intended for monitoring missile launches from Pakistan, though it could also play a role in monitoring satellites and space objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;israel&quot;&gt;ISRAEL&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though Israel has not featured prominently in past editions of Space Threat Assessment, it is hard to ignore this year due to its efforts to interfere with GPS in the eastern part of the Mediterranean Sea, Syria, Lebanon, parts of Egypt, and Israel itself. No doubt aiming to protect itself from missile and drone threats launched by Iran, Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis, Israel conducted markedly more widespread, persistent GPS jamming and spoofing, specifically around April 2024, when it was expecting Iranian retaliation to an Israeli strike in Syria that killed two senior Iranian officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel continues to develop and refine directed-energy weapons, such as Iron Beam, for use in missile defense. While it does not appear that Israel intends to use these weapons for a counterspace purpose, Israel effectively maintains a latent anti-satellite capability, particularly when paired with its satellite detection and tracking knowledge. Israel likely conducted an exoatmospheric missile intercept in November 2024 when it shot down a Houthi ballistic missile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;europe&quot;&gt;EUROPE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only two countries in Europe made counterspace news over the last year—France and Germany—with both countries publicly describing new counterspace initiatives. These would involve deploying satellites capable of performing inspection and space domain awareness (SDA) missions, as well as roles protecting other satellites from attack, possibly using lasers or other non-kinetic weapons. The new French program, called Toutatis, would include two LEO satellites: Lisa-1, performing an SDA mission, and Splinter LEO, a highly maneuverable satellite capable of tracking hostile satellites and potentially positioning itself between a hostile satellite and the target satellite. Germany plans to launch the German Inspector Satellite for Multiple Operations. The satellite, publicly revealed in 2024, would be equipped with robotic arms and be capable of inspecting other satellites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;featured-analysis&quot;&gt;FEATURED ANALYSIS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;gps-jamming-and-spoofing&quot;&gt;GPS JAMMING AND SPOOFING&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year’s space threat assessment noted that GPS jamming and spoofing were becoming ubiquitous across parts of the world, particularly in areas of active military conflict. This past year saw a continuation and growth of that same trend. Many regions of the world, from the Arctic through Eastern Europe, to the Middle East and parts of South Asia, have been affected by GPS jamming and spoofing nearly every day since the publication of last year’s report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though difficult to measure, the societal and economic impacts of such long-term disruptions to GPS service are significant, and no doubt compounded by ongoing conflict and political strife affecting many of these same areas. Qualitatively, however, GPS interference disrupts the lives and work of millions of people and in some cases (such as civil and commercial aviation) poses significant risks to public safety. Several UN agencies have also emphasized the harms of jamming and spoofing, noting that interference with satellite navigation signals is a threat to air and maritime safety and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/MLF5w2T.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: NORMAL GPS RECEPTION VS GPS JAMMING AND SPOOFING&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But GPS jamming and spoofing have produced—at least in part—the desired military effect, as munitions and drones that rely on GPS to find their targets have been made significantly less effective in GPS-denied environments. That said, there is no sign that GPS interference is an air defense magic bullet. It is the many layers of modern integrated air defense systems, including jamming and spoofing, that have demonstrated effectiveness at blunting, for example, air threats to Israel and Russian drone and missile attacks on Ukraine. Likewise, the United States and European countries are implementing technical measures and operational techniques to mitigate such effects on their weapon systems. Employing such GNSS jamming and spoofing systems to protect military and other critical infrastructure from attack—whether in Israel, Ukraine, or Russia—demonstrates the increasing tactical battlefield utility of counterspace weapons, and it is a trend that is expected to continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most complete public picture of GPS interference around the globe at any point in time comes from maritime automatic identification system (AIS) and Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) aircraft transponder signals. Aircraft pilots and drone operators have also been able to report instances of GPS jamming and spoofing through the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) Aviation Safety Reporting System and through a dedicated portal for reporting GPS anomalies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The International Air Transport Association also operates databases containing information about instances of GPS interference: the Incident Data eXchange, a tool for reporting flight security and safety concerns, and the Flight Data eXchange, a global flight data repository. NOTAMs (originally called Notices to Airmen), issued by national aviation authorities to warn pilots about possible GPS interference, can also provide clues about the location and timing of GPS anomalies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until the last five years, though not entirely uncommon, GPS jamming did not have a widespread or persistent impact on global aviation. Although other instances undoubtedly went unreported, between 2013 and 2017, only 90 reports of GPS jamming worldwide were logged in the Aviation Safety Reporting System. On the whole, these reports describe localized, ephemeral events. For example, in 2015, one of these incidents involved intermittent GPS interference near a regional airport in Philadelphia that Federal Communications Commission agents attributed to a jammer being used by a driver to disable the tracking feature on his truck. Several other reports in 2014 and 2015 related to GPS disruptions near a Mexico City airport that could have been caused by jamming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until 2017, when several ships reported GPS spoofing in the Black Sea, documented incidents of spoofing were still rare and mostly corresponded to transient events, such as the protection of traveling high-level government officials in Russia. As recently as the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, widespread reports of GPS spoofing were mainly confined to the Middle East. But Ukrainian drone attacks into Russia provoked an increase in spoofing by Russian forces not just in Ukraine, but also across western Russia. Russian spoofing of GPS in the Baltic Region is harder to explain as a Russian force-protection measure due to its distance from Ukraine. It is instead likely an example of Russian use of hybrid warfare directed at NATO’s newest members, as the rise in spoofing responds to the timing of their ascension to the alliance in spring of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Russian efforts to spoof GPS signals extend from the Black Sea to the Arctic, with impacts to several NATO members, and include many major cities and regions in Russia itself. Additionally, the start of Israel’s war in Gaza in October 2023 coincided with a massive increase in GPS spoofing incidents in the eastern Mediterranean Sea and Middle East. At the time of this report’s publication, over twenty countries experienced endemic GPS interference over all or parts of their territories. That interference can include both GPS jamming and spoofing, as jamming a real GPS signal can make spoofing more effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Er9Cvbh.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 3: TIMELINE OF NOTABLE GPS SPOOFING AND JAMMING ATTACKS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, a jamming signal is broadcast at sufficient strength to overpower legitimate GPS signals, alongside a spoofing signal slightly more powerful than the jamming one, leading a GPS receiver to lock onto the spoofed signal. A spoofing signal is meant to appear like a legitimate GPS signal, but the spoofing signal transmits incorrect positional information. Though criminals, terrorists, and other nonstate actors may still find it easier to acquire and use GPS jammers, nation states that have access to powerful long-range electronic warfare capabilities have clearly found that spoofing can be more effective than jamming alone because GPS receivers often do not realize they are being spoofed but easily recognize when a GPS signal is blocked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/IEn4Bjt.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 4: LOCATIONS OF SIGNIFICANT GPS INTERFERENCE EVENTS BETWEEN APRIL 2024 AND MARCH 2025&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to publicly available data, estimates for the number of worldwide commercial flights experiencing spoofing increased from 500 or fewer per day between January and mid-March 2024 to a peak of nearly 3,000 flights in April 2024, before leveling off at between 1,000 and 1,500 affected flights per day for the following several months. Most of these spoofing incidents occurred in the Middle East and were likely attributable to Israel as part of its efforts to combat threats from Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran. The greatest spike in spoofing incidents over the last year, in mid-April 2024, followed Israel’s airstrike on April 1, 2024, targeting senior Iranian commanders in Syria, while Israel awaited possible Iranian retaliation, which ultimately came on April 13, 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, around April 2024, the Black Sea region and Russia experienced a surge in the number of flights daily reporting GPS spoofing, with these activities plausibly attributed to Russian efforts to defend against missiles and drones launched from Ukraine. This time frame coincides with a drone attack deep into Russia from Ukraine, a major drone attack on a Russian airbase, and stepped-up drone attacks on other important targets inside Russia. Over the next several months, Ukraine continued to launch drone attacks on Russia, executing one of its largest drone strikes on Moscow in August 2024. Up until early 2025, Ukraine had maintained a steady cadence of drone attacks on targets in Russia, likely prompting Russia to continue GPS jamming and spoofing as part of an integrated air defense campaign to defeat drones. In August 2024, Ukraine destroyed an abandoned offshore gas platform in the Black Sea that Russia had been using for GPS spoofing operations, though it is not clear how the rig’s destruction impacted Russia’s spoofing capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of the Middle East, Russia, and Baltic and Black Sea regions, several other regions experienced significant GPS interference from January 2024 to April 2025, when this report was published. These areas include the region between Lahore, Pakistan, and New Delhi, India, particularly along the countries’ shared border, and Myanmar. In Myanmar, GPS interference is a response by Myanmar’s military to the rise in drone attacks carried out by armed groups affiliated with the opposition party in the country’s ongoing civil war. Some GPS spoofing was observed near the border between North Korea and South Korea throughout 2024, peaking around June. There were also some reports of sporadic spoofing in Beijing in May 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hUeL8AB.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 5: DAILY NUMBER OF AFFECTED FLIGHTS PER SPOOFED-TO AREA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, there are no indications that diplomatic pressure or condemnation has discouraged any nation state from deploying GPS jamming and spoofing systems in and around conflict zones or within their own national territories. Neither broad warnings from the International Telecommunication Union, the UN agency charged with facilitating international coordination on spectrum use, nor directed complaints from affected countries have altered Russia’s behaviors. Even though the International Civil Aviation Organization, the United Nations’ civil aviation agency, admonished North Korea for repeatedly jamming GPS signals near its border with South Korea in May and June 2024, GPS interference was still being reported around the Korean Peninsula as of February 2025. In spite of complaints about its efforts to disrupt GPS, Israel continues to spoof signals throughout the region, with the eastern Mediterranean region widely affected during the past year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-drip-drip-of-cyberattacks&quot;&gt;THE DRIP-DRIP OF CYBERATTACKS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing trends noted in past reports, there has been no shortage over the last year of cyberattacks targeting government, critical infrastructure, and other sectors, including space. But developing a way to accurately tally and characterize certain key aspects of cyberattacks, such as attacker motivations and objectives, is a challenge. The presence of a persistent cyber threat actor on a network may be discovered without revealing the hackers’ aims, leaving questions about the actual target of the attack. For the authors of this report, this ambiguity makes it difficult to determine which cyberattacks qualify as attacks on space systems and related infrastructure and, thus, deserve attention in this report. For example, a threat actor might be detected on the servers of an academic research institute with an aerospace engineering department. Was this attacker targeting space systems (i.e., worth mentioning in a report on counterspace threats)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, because some cyberattacks are only made public by the attackers with no confirmation from the victim organization, it can be difficult to understand the full impact of hacks or even know for certain whether an attack took place. Frequently, hackers publicly post screenshots or other evidence of a successful cyber exploit, to demonstrate data theft, to claim credit for the hack, or in the case of ransomware attacks, to pressure victims to comply with financial demands. But hackers, particularly ones motivated by geopolitical or ideological aims, could also theoretically claim credit for attacks that never took place or exaggerate the scope of their exploits for propaganda purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND THE FULL IMPACT OF HACKS OR EVEN KNOW FOR CERTAIN WHETHER AN ATTACK TOOK PLACE.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/mrncjf5.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 4: REPORTED CYBER INCIDENTS IN 2024 IMPACTING THE SPACE SECTOR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the challenges in understanding hacker goals, positively identifying the physical location of hacker groups can be difficult. For example, experts do not yet know who is behind the IntelBroker hacker group, which has targeted aerospace related entities in the last year, with some indications it may be a lone-wolf actor from Serbia, and others that it might be affiliated with Iran. This lack of clarity on affiliation and physical location of a hacker group complicates attribution, making it hard for the United States and other victims of attacks to calibrate their response to hacks. It also makes it difficult to predict where such hackers may strike next and who should be particularly on guard for attacks from mysterious groups like IntelBroker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all these reasons, the authors of this report have found it hard to count year-by-year the number of cyberattacks targeting space systems. Though their numbers differ, some organizations try to keep tallies of cyberattacks by the type of entity and sector targeted, among other criteria. According to the European Repository of Cyber Incidents (ERCI), a free database containing reports of worldwide cyberattacks, there were about 720 reported incidents across all sectors in 2024, with roughly 57 percent of incidents targeting critical infrastructure. Of that total number, the database lists five attacks as specifically targeting the space sector in 2024, approximately the same number of attacks that targeted the space sector in 2023, according to ERCI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cyberattack documented by ERCI targeting Maxar Space Systems in October 2024 provides few insights into the motives or aim of the attackers. At the time of discovery, hackers had only gained access to employee data on Maxar’s networks. There is no public indication of whether personal information was the goal of the hack or whether gaining this limited access was the first step in a broader effort to breach operational or other systems specific to Maxar’s satellites or space systems. The hackers may very well have been targeting Maxar because it is a space company, but it is equally plausible that Maxar’s servers were just one IP address on a long list of unrelated entities, ones for which they merely found an exploitable vulnerability. That there were only five reported cyber incidents affecting the space sector in 2024 according to the ERCI dataset may leave some readers of this report scratching their heads, as there is a widespread perception that space systems face constant cyber threats. In June 2024, the head of the Space Information Sharing and Analysis Center (Space ISAC)—a nonprofit organization set up in 2019 to improve threat sharing and mitigation for space systems and comprised of over 100 members across the public and private sectors within the United States and internationally—said that the organization records over 100 instances of cyberattacks targeting “infrastructure related to space systems” each week. Though on the surface these numbers are clearly at odds with the rather low number of cyber incidents targeting the space sector according to the ERCI figures, the Space ISAC figures include attempted intrusions and hack claims made by attackers and not only, as the ERCI records report, successful attacks publicly acknowledged by hack victims. Additionally, the Space ISAC statistic speaks to the number of attacks targeting infrastructure related to space systems, which seems to include more types of networks than are included in the term “space sector” used by ERCI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/N9OQuBT.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 5: CYBERATTACKS IN 2024 IMPACTING THE SPACE SECTOR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In yet another attempt to tally cyberattacks targeting space systems, ETH Zurich, a Swiss university, published a report in October 2024 that documented over 120 publicly known cyber operations, between February 2022 and September 2024, targeting the space sector in the context of the war in Ukraine. The report identified 12 pro-Ukrainian and 19 pro-Russian cyber threat actors who made claims to have targeted space systems. Of the attacks assessed in the report, the vast majority—65 percent—were distributed denial of service attacks, with 11 percent identified as network intrusions and 9 percent listed as leak operations. A further nine categories of hack types were specified in the report, including credential theft, data breach, malware, software cracking, and data breach extortion, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One final observation is that, though the available data points to attempted and successful cyberattacks targeting systems associated with the space sector, there are no public reports in the last year that these cyberattacks have specifically targeted spacecraft or satellites in space. References to satellite hacking usually relate to attacks on ground infrastructure, the user terminal only, or the companies and institutions involved in satellite development and operations. This does not mean that cyber threat actors have not compromised satellites in space, only that there is no open-source indication of such efforts in the last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;rpos-benevolent-or-cruel-intentions&quot;&gt;RPOS: BENEVOLENT OR CRUEL INTENTIONS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though space has never been a static environment—relative to the center of the Earth, the orbital speed of GEO satellites is 7,000 miles per hour and LEO satellites around 17,500 miles per hour—most spacecraft have generally tended to stay away from other space vehicles to avoid potential collisions. However, government-owned and commercial satellites are becoming more maneuverable and flying closer together, conducting rendezvous and proximity operations, or RPOs, and docking with other spacecraft on an increasingly regular basis. In 2024, there was strong private sector interest in developing satellites to perform maintenance, repair, assembly, manufacturing, and inspection missions. Government agencies continue to work on systems that use orbital maneuvering, RPO, and docking capabilities, such as space planes, crewed spacecraft, and scientific missions. Additionally, no matter a satellite’s specific function, it may need to maneuver to avoid collision with another satellite or a piece of space debris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the variety of use cases for maneuvering one spacecraft around another, it can be difficult to characterize a spacecraft’s purpose using only data about its behaviors in space. Some spacecraft exhibiting RPO behaviors may be counterspace weapons or testing technologies for use on such weapons. Other spacecraft may have peaceful reasons—or, at least, reasons that do not involve the use of a weapon—to move closer to another active satellite. A spacecraft may even have a non-hostile reason to conduct RPO and docking operations near a noncooperative space object, such as a defunct satellite or piece of space debris—this is the business case for companies like Astroscale and Clearspace. But a U.S. observer noting a Chinese or Russian satellite shadowing or moving closer to one of its own satellites would reasonably view that behavior as threatening. Chinese or Russian observers probably have the same reaction when a GSSAP satellite approaches their spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue is that the United States and its allies rightly do not take Russian or Chinese statements about the purposes of maneuvering spacecraft at face value and find little assurances from Russian or Chinese assertions of peaceful intentions in space. But analyzing behaviors alone does little to clarify what their spacecraft are actually doing. Knowledge about a satellite’s capabilities and context—for example, that it has a grabber arm or device capable of latching onto another satellite or that it “birthed” a smaller object in proximity to a U.S. government satellite—can help more fully assess the purpose of a satellite exhibiting RPO behaviors. Some of these satellites displaying RPO behaviors are probably designed as counterspace weapons, meaning they have capabilities intended to blind, jam, damage, or destroy other satellites. Other satellites are possibly performing a space surveillance mission or are testing on-orbit satellite servicing technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coincidentally, the U.S. government and U.S. companies are fielding more space systems aimed at some of these purposes. Broadly speaking, the U.S. Space Command (USSPACECOM) is increasingly focused on using satellites that are designed for frequent orbital maneuvering. The Space Force operates GSSAP, whose purpose is to collect SSA data. The Space Force is also investigating a next-generation constellation of scout satellites in GEO. U.S. company True Anomaly is planning to operate its own satellites carrying out inspection operations, having launched its first and second missions in 2024. Another company, HEO, is using sensors on satellites to collect data about other space objects in LEO, though HEO’s approach is to use naturally occurring flybys rather than active maneuvering to obtain data. Beyond near Earth, the Air Force Research Laboratory is developing two satellites designed to obtain SSA data from cislunar space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no indications that any of the aforementioned U.S. satellites are weapons, though their maneuvering signatures and behaviors may mirror those of on-orbit counterspace weapons. The perception that satellites like these are weapons could increase the risk of miscalculation, a risk compounded as more and more satellites are launched with missions that include orbital maneuvering. But some maneuverable satellites, including those operated by U.S. allies and some planned by the United States itself, are intended as counterspace weapons. France, for example, publicly stated in 2024 that it plans on building LEO satellites that can actively defend against attacks in space, having already announced plans for a similar GEO capability, called YODA, in 2021. The Trump administration’s January 2025 executive order on “The Iron Dome for America” (now Golden Dome) includes direction to develop and deploy space-based interceptors to defend the U.S. homeland against advanced missile attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on satellite behaviors alone, there is hardly a way to distinguish between a surveillance tool and a weapon, though arguably, the same satellite could perform both roles. Though the United States should view attempts to surveil its satellites by Russia and China with concern, it would undoubtedly respond with considerably more restraint to a surveillance satellite approaching one of its own satellites than a counterspace weapon exhibiting the same behaviors. Greater transparency and awareness about specific satellite capabilities is a possible way to delineate between a weapon and surveillance capability. But a lack of trust between the United States and its allies on one side and Russia and China on the other would impede efforts to increase transparency, since both sides likely mistrust each other’s ability to be truthful about the purpose of their satellites. The U.S. Space Force is building up its space intelligence collection, analysis, and targeting to enable a deeper understanding of foreign capabilities and to support commanders’ operational needs. Meanwhile, researchers from LeoLabs, the University of Bern, and Maxar are developing characterization methods that combine radar measurements, information from ground-based optical telescopes, and non-Earth imagery data to provide new insights that can be used for assessing a spacecraft’s purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a distinction between surveillance assets and weapons aids the United States and its allies in calling out unsafe, irresponsible, and escalatory behaviors, especially when adversaries target surveillance assets as they have done in other domains. For example, in 2019, Iran shot down an unarmed, unmanned U.S. Global Hawk surveillance aircraft operating over international waters, and both China and Russia continue to harass U.S. and allied airborne ISR assets operating in international airspace over the South China Sea and Black Sea, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is further danger in this lack of distinction and transparency. Given that the U.S. government and private sector, as well as allied nations and geopolitical competitors, operate satellites with space surveillance and SSA missions, considering maneuverable surveillance satellites as threats akin to counterspace weapons could expose U.S. satellites doing those missions to increased Russian and Chinese counterspace risks. In addition, grouping satellites with counterspace weapons into the same category as surveillance satellites will make it more difficult for spacecraft operators to identify and calibrate responses to real threats that could damage, degrade, or destroy their space systems. Grouping both types of space systems together also increases the risk of misunderstanding and miscalculation between geopolitical competitors in space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, satellites conducting RPOs can still pose a security threat and safety hazard to others. For example, the revelation in March 2025 that PRC satellites had practiced “dogfighting” maneuvers in space should be concerning. The authors could imagine scenarios where adversary satellites maneuver against a target (like a U.S. government satellite) as to force it to move, expend fuel, and degrade its mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, the authors of this report assert that satellites designed solely for obtaining SSA data or performing space surveillance roles should not be considered counterspace weapons but, understandably, satellites conducting RPOs without a clear understanding of capability and intent may still be viewed as threats depending on the circumstances. As in other domains, the United States, Russia, China, and other countries should eye warily but expect their adversaries and geopolitical competitors to conduct surveillance and intelligence collection against their space assets. Surveillance activities in space should not provoke the same reaction as deployment and use of actual counterspace weapons. Creating a public expectation that inspector or surveillance satellites are a hostile threat to be treated as weapons puts U.S. companies with business plans around doing those very same things more into the crosshairs of U.S. adversaries than they would likely already be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that satellites conducting surveillance on other satellites to understand their purpose and capabilities serve a military and intelligence purpose. But they can also help to prevent misunderstandings, ensuring that deci- sionmakers can better discriminate between satellites that are weapons (i.e., threats) and ones that are not. They also can play an important role in space safety for both government and commercial space operators, helping to build a comprehensive picture of what is happening in the space environment and understand which satellites are truly counterspace weapons threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;points-of-instability-unintentional-space-debris-generation&quot;&gt;POINTS OF INSTABILITY: UNINTENTIONAL SPACE DEBRIS GENERATION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several debris-fragment-generating events in space have taken place since the publication of the last Space Threat Assessment, though there is no indication that any of these were intentional or caused by counterspace weapons. Previous editions of this threat assessment have not specifically addressed accidental debris-causing incidents; however, this report will discuss them, as they have the potential to create geopolitical complications and instability. Catalogued and tracked debris fragments pose risks to space safety and, should debris produced by a satellite of one nation cause harm to satellites operated by other nations, can lead to increased international tensions. Debris-producing events that generate no public alarms, uncatalogued debris fragments, and inadequately characterized debris clouds create even more risks, adding an unnecessary and avoidable element of surprise to the calculus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For inexplicable reasons, certain debris-causing incidents are widely covered in the media, while others go entirely under the radar, without widespread public coverage. Though USSPACECOM often makes public announcements of debris-generating events, it did not issue statements for all events in the last year. However, commercial SSA entities often make public announcements of such events, as will the Office of Space Commerce once its Traffic Coordination System for Space (TraCSS) is operational. Additionally, it can sometimes take weeks if not months before the Space Force enters new debris fragments into Space-Track. In many cases, private sector SSA organizations announce they are tracking far more pieces of debris than are either announced by USSPACECOM or logged by Space Force in Space-Track. Especially when the debris-generating incident is caused by a spacecraft associated with the U.S. government, Russia’s Vimpel space object catalog is sometimes updated to reflect new debris fragments quicker than Space-Track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DEBRIS-PRODUCING EVENTS THAT GENERATE NO PUBLIC ALARMS . . . CREATE EVEN MORE RISKS.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the last year, USSPACECOM only publicly announced five debris-causing breakup events, yet this section describes eight such events. Furthermore, for each event acknowledged by USSPACECOM, this report highlights the differences between the official Space-Track numbers of cataloged debris fragments, as well as the timeliness of their cataloging, and other space-object-tracking options. One reason for the discrepancies may relate to the Space-Track fidelity standards, which relate to how well an object is understood before it is or is not cataloged. But no matter the cause, delays and inconsistencies in adding debris fragments resulting from spacecraft breakups and energetic events to Space-Track create avoidable space safety risks and may affect the credibility of the United States in the eyes of other international partners during discussions on norms of behaviors and rules of the road for space activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resurs-P1 (Russia):&lt;/strong&gt; Russia’s Resurs-P1 broke up on June 26, 2024. Launched in 2013, Resurs-P1 was a commercial remote sensing satellite in LEO that operated until 2021, when it was deactivated upon its replacement by Resurs-DK1. USSPACECOM noted that the breakup generated over 100 trackable debris fragments, while LeoLabs stated that it was tracking about 180 pieces of debris immediately after the event. Though not confirmed, experts speculate the breakup was caused by improper or incomplete passivation efforts upon the retirement of the satellite in 2021. As of early March 2025, 18 pieces of debris were included in Space-Track. Due to the low altitude of the breakup, all other fragments have likely already decayed and burned up in the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upper Stage, Long March 6A (China):&lt;/strong&gt; Most likely caused by residual propellant, the upper stage of a Long March 6A broke up in LEO, creating several hundred pieces of trackable debris—according to LeoLabs, potentially as many as 900 debris fragments—on August 6, 2024. By early March 2025, over 650 fragments were logged in Space-Track. This rocket had been launched by China on that same day carrying satellites for the Qianfan (“Thousand Sails”) LEO broadband satellite constellation. This was not the first time that the upper stage of a Long March 6A rocket broke up in orbit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Centaur Upper Stage, Atlas V (United States):&lt;/strong&gt; On September 6, 2024, the Centaur upper stage of an Atlas V rocket broke up in a geotransfer orbit. The upper stage had been passivated after launching a U.S. government weather satellite in March 2018. As of early March 2025, Space-Track contained no debris fragments associated with this breakup, though an outside expert identified over 950 debris fragments by that time. This is the fourth breakup of a Centaur upper stage, with two other breakups in 2018 and another in 2019. The cause of all four breakups is not known.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intelsat IS-33e (United States):&lt;/strong&gt; Intelsat IS-33e broke up on October 19, 2024, due to unknown reasons. Prior to the breakup, the satellite had been a telecommunications satellite in GEO, launched in 2016 with a planned service life of 15 years. Immediately following the breakup, USSPACECOM announced that it was tracking around 20 pieces of debris. The number of debris fragments eventually reached at least 500, according to ExoAnalytic. Space-Track, however, only listed 18 pieces of debris associated with this breakup event by early March 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) F-14 (United States):&lt;/strong&gt; Probably due to a battery explosion, a defunct DMSP F-14 weather satellite in LEO generated a number of fragments on December 19, 2024. Space-Track did not list any debris associated with this event by the end of December 2024, but both LeoLabs and Slingshot Aerospace were tracking debris fragments resulting from this event. Since 2004, three other DMSP and two NOAA satellites using a similar design have all experienced similar malfunctions attributed to battery explosions. In early March 2025, Space-Track started listing debris from this satellite, with 19 fragments cataloged by March 10, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blue Ring Pathfinder/Upper Stage, New Glenn (United States):&lt;/strong&gt; Though not publicly reported by USSPACECOM, Blue Origin’s New Glenn upper stage, to which the Blue Ring Pathfinder mission is attached, probably experienced a debris-generating event upon passivation in HEO on January 16, 2025. Though originally thought to be ice and other effluent, which should have naturally dissipated, the debris fragments are probably a combination of thermal control materials and other unknown objects. As of early February 2025, over 50 pieces of debris remained in orbit, with about 67 logged in Russia’s space object catalog. As of March 2025, there are no debris fragments associated with this event in Space-Track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Garpun 11L (Cosmos 2473) (Russia):&lt;/strong&gt; On May 28, 2024, a nonoperational Russian military communications satellite in GEO, Garpun 11L (Cosmos 2473), experienced some kind of energetic event that raised the satellite 5 km and produced at least one new space object, identified in Russia’s space object catalog. Launched in September 2011, Garpun 11L has not been operational since experiencing an on-orbit malfunction in June 2020. USSPACECOM did not make any public announcements about this event and there is no indication of debris from this event in Space-Track as of April 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fregat RB/Cluster 2 Upper Stage, Soyuz-U (Russia):&lt;/strong&gt; An experimental Russian upper stage, called Fregat RB/Cluster 2, of a Soyuz-U rocket launched in March 2000, experienced an energetic event on April 8, 2024, resulting in a 3-km change in the object altitude and some kind of residual propellant outgassing. Though USSPACECOM has not provided a public notification of this event or listed any resulting debris fragments in Space-Track, the Russian space object catalog lists more than 300 pieces of debris generated by this event. There is no indication of debris from this event in Space-Track as of April 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-coming-collision-of-commercial-and-counterspace&quot;&gt;THE COMING COLLISION OF COMMERCIAL AND COUNTERSPACE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last decade, space has become increasingly commercial, and the past approach of sectioning space off into different military, civil, and commercial segments has become much more difficult. While space has traditionally been dominated by government activity and specialized defense contractors, the last decade has witnessed the growth of a diverse commercial space sector. Today, commercial companies act independently, with goals and actions to implement separate from government strategies or contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the rapidly advancing domain of space exploration and satellite technology, commercial space companies have become integral players, providing services ranging from satellite communication and Earth observation to space tourism and lunar exploration. As these companies expand their activities in LEO and beyond, they face an increasing risk of being caught in the crossfire of geopolitical tensions and the growing arms race in space. The impact of commercial space capabilities has been well documented in the war in Ukraine, where commercial services such as imagery and broadband communications were widely distributed in the early days and weeks of the conflict and largely continue today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;THE IMPACT OF COMMERCIAL SPACE CAPABILITIES HAS BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED IN THE WAR IN UKRAINE.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments around the globe have seen the impact that a space industrial base has on programs and economic bolstering, so commercial companies are being encouraged in most spacefaring nations to innovate alongside or outside of government priorities. The U.S. Department of Defense and Space Force have each released commercial integration strategies, and other nations around the globe are investing heavily in a commercial space sector, hoping to integrate innovative technologies into all facets of government capabilities. Multilateral organizations are also noting the importance of commercial capabilities, and NATO will reportedly publish a commercial space strategy in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rise of satellite companies offering critical services to governments, businesses, and individuals means that these private sector players are now directly in the crosshairs of geopolitical competitors and adversaries. As noted earlier in the report, in 2024, a Russian official indicated Russia would consider companies supporting U.S. “military space ambitions” as legitimate targets for retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond current capabilities such as communications or Earth imaging, commercial companies around the globe are testing technologies that could have counterspace applications. French company Dark plans to “forge the space armory” by building advanced defense systems to place on orbit to protect other satellites from being targeted. Further, the Dark website states that space has already become a battlefield. The company is developing a platform called Interceptor, launched from a plane that would travel to LEO to move or deorbit satellites or pieces of debris. The company’s CEO has described Dark as aiming to be the “S.W.A.T. team of space,” and the Interceptor capability as ready to operate on call, akin to air defense missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other technology developments are not as blunt, but could be considered a counterspace technology. Commercial companies are developing on-orbit servicing capabilities that are designed to extend an assets’ life on orbit. But with capabilities like robotic arms and grapplers, these technologies have the potential for nefarious use. For example, Japanese company Astroscale is partnering with BAE Systems to test in-orbit servicing technology, in a contract funded by the European Space Agency to service a test satellite. The Astroscale satellite would do this servicing by conducting proximity operations to get close to the test satellite, then using a robotic arm to take a part off of the test satellite and replace it with a new part. European space company Airbus, through its Surrey Satellite Technology Limited subsidiary, demonstrated a debris removal concept releasing a net and pencil-sized harpoon to capture space debris. While the objective of these test missions is civil in nature, similar technologies could be used in the future for harming or disabling an adversary satellite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development of dual-use technologies, with both commercial and potential counterspace applications, underscores the delicate balance between actors in the space domain today. In an arena traditionally dominated by government agencies, private enterprises are now not only shaping the future of space exploration but also becoming entangled in geopolitical and security concerns. As these companies expand their capabilities and develop technologies that could have both peaceful and defensive applications, the lines between civilian, commercial, and military activities in space are becoming increasingly blurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-to-watch&quot;&gt;WHAT TO WATCH&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;distinguishing-between-peacetime-norms-and-wartime-actions&quot;&gt;DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN PEACETIME NORMS AND WARTIME ACTIONS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Senior administration and Pentagon officials have repeatedly made clear that the U.S. military intends to be a responsible, good neighbor in space. To meet that goal, the secretary of defense published a memo in 2021 outlining DOD tenets of responsible behavior in space. Those tenets specify that DOD will operate in, from, to, and through space with due regard to others and in a professional manner; limit the generation of long-lived debris; avoid the creation of harmful interference; maintain safe separation and safe trajectory; and communicate and make notifications to enhance the safety and stability of the domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2023, USSPACECOM proposed eight specific behaviors, which map to the five tenets, for DOD space operations, which USSPACECOM notes complement broader U.S. efforts to establish space norms and best practices. Additionally, the United States has tried to discourage the testing of destructive DA ASAT weapons, which have the potential to generate space debris. In April 2022, the United States declared a moratorium on its testing of DA ASAT weapons. And in December 2022, along with several other nations, it introduced a UN resolution calling nations not to conduct destructive DA ASAT testing. The resolution was supported by over 150 countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tenets and eight behaviors are clearly applicable to day-to-day space operations and establish sensible norms for peacetime space activities, which apply to military space operations just the same as civilian and commercial ones. The moratorium on debris-generating destructive DA ASAT testing is a de facto peacetime restriction, as the preponderance of weapons testing would surely happen prior to a war or conflict. What is less clear is how these rules apply to wartime actions, though they have probably influenced the apparent U.S. emphasis on low-debris-causing and non-kinetic counterspace weapons, and how efforts oriented around space sustainability and safety, like the tenets, relate to the law of armed conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general aims of the universal laws of war, including international humanitarian law, are to protect those not fighting and those no longer able to fight, which includes avoiding harm to civilians or things that are essential to their survival. Though certainly open to interpretation, the operation of satellites in space is undeniably less essential than, and several steps removed from, the provision of things like food, water, medicine, and clothing to noncombatants. Except for humans on the International Space Station or China’s Tiangong station, operations in space are unlikely to directly harm civilians. Operations on land, sea, and air are far more likely than those in space to harm people or cause disruptions to the delivery of the essentials of life. Yet the United States assigns the space domain a special set of tenets—though one-sided, since neither China nor Russia have agreed to these restrictions—for responsible behaviors that do not directly correlate to the expectations placed on combatants by the laws of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than self-imposed tenets, applicable to one side and not the other, a better approach to space operations, particularly U.S. operations vis-à-vis China and Russia, could be one modeled on the 1971 agreement between the United States and Soviet Union on incidents on and over the high seas. The goal of this agreement was not to cover wartime actions, but to prevent peacetime incidents from becoming more serious. The lessons from this approach for space operations are twofold. First, it could help establish norms of behavior for space that could improve overall space safety for military, civilian, and commercial operators. Second, it could help reduce the risk of misunderstanding between the United States, China, and Russia for space activities such as RPOs and other on-orbit behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This model also implicitly acknowledges that wartime actions are entirely different from peacetime behaviors, with guardrails placed around wartime behaviors established by the law of armed conflict, which is domain agnostic. Given the frequency of both Chinese and Russian RPOs and U.S. emphasis on space norms, a concerted U.S.-led effort over the next year to establish a space equivalent to the 1972 U.S.-Soviet agreement on incidents on and over the high seas would be beneficial both to U.S. interests and to the overall chances of success for the growth of the space economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;making-more-counterspace-weapons-public&quot;&gt;MAKING MORE COUNTERSPACE WEAPONS PUBLIC&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, U.S. officials have shared little publicly about U.S. counterspace capabilities and operations. To date, the only publicly acknowledged counterspace weapons operated by the Space Force are the Counter Communications System and the Remote Modular Terminal, both electronic warfare capabilities. The United States has emphasized these are defensive capabilities—not dissimilar from the use of GPS jammers and spoofers for force protection in Ukraine, Russia, and Israel described earlier—drawing a distinction between offensive and defensive space and emphasizing the U.S. intention to use space for deterrence and not aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next year, the United States may want to consider publicly revealing more, though not all, of its counterspace capabilities—as France and Germany are already doing—because acknowledging some U.S. counterspace weapons, beyond just jammers, can be used to deter hostile action in space or other domains. Additionally, talking more publicly about counterspace weapons means the U.S. military can more easily partner with space companies already working on commercial technologies, such as servicing, debris removal, hypersonics, and atmospheric reentry, that could be transformed into new military space capabilities. For classified projects, the military also cannot tap into innovative space startups, as these companies often do not have the right security clearances to even know what the government wants to buy, let alone bid on the work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;THE UNITED STATES MAY WANT TO CONSIDER PUBLICLY REVEALING MORE, THOUGH NOT ALL, OF ITS COUNTERSPACE CAPABILITIES.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;development-of-bodyguard-satellites&quot;&gt;DEVELOPMENT OF BODYGUARD SATELLITES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted in this report, China has demonstrated it can operate highly maneuverable satellites in both LEO and GEO and track and synchronize orbits with U.S. government satellites. China also remains the only country to conduct a noncooperative capture of one satellite by another in GEO, when SJ-21 moved a defunct Beidou satellite into a graveyard orbit in 2022. These capabilities should be seen as ominous signs of the potential for China to develop, if it has not already done so, sophisticated on-orbit counterspace weapons against which U.S. satellites have limited, if any, defenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, France is the only country that has consistently talked about building and deploying on-orbit satellite systems designed to guard, defend, and protect high-value satellites. However, in May 2024, the European Commission announced that the European Defense Fund included €6.5 million ($7 million) for an “Autonomous SSA Bodyguard Onboard Satellite” that would perform SSA and threat detection, but also “counteract [threats] with a robot or laser.” It remains to be seen how the public acknowledgment of such initiatives will influence counterspace weapons trends, though one likely response from countries like China and Russia would be to develop new counterspace systems. This cat-and-mouse game between offensive and defense space capabilities will likely make space operations more expensive for both government and commercial operators, as space operators will likely want to invest in systems and methods that protect their space assets. It will also raise questions about what commercial operators are legally allowed to do to protect their satellites, similar to the issues raised in cyberspace about whether cyberattack victims can “hack back” against their attackers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking to the future, the United States and its allies, beyond just France, will want new on-orbit technologies—like bodyguard satellites—to protect against on-orbit counterspace threats. Such systems could employ non-kinetic weapons, such as jammers and lasers, or kinetic weapons, such as projectiles or grappling capabilities, to disable attacking satellites. There is no reason to delay efforts to develop such capabilities and no reason to make such efforts secret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;generation-of-debris-fragments&quot;&gt;GENERATION OF DEBRIS FRAGMENTS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though experts frequently warn of increased risks of collisions and creation of space debris resulting from the deployment of large satellite constellations, most debris-generating incidents over the past year have nothing to do with operating satellite constellations. Of the eight debris-causing events described earlier in this report, only one involves an active satellite (e.g., Intelsat IS-33e). Further, while concern has focused on the risk of collisions in congested LEO orbits, only one related to LEO constellations, and even that connection is tangential because the event relates to the launch vehicle, the Long March 6A upper stage, and not the satellites themselves. Additionally, most of these events were caused by defunct spacecraft that were at least 10 years old, or rocket bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as the operation of large satellite constellations to date has not caused a commensurate rise in space debris, neither has testing or use of kinetic counterspace weapons. Most debris from the U.S. military’s shoot down of a defunct U.S. satellite in 2008, called Operation Burnt Frost, deorbited within days. Additionally, the Russian ASAT test in 2021 created around 1,800 catalogued debris fragments, yet only around 9 tracked pieces remained in orbit by March 24, 2025, according to Space-Track. The glaring exception is China’s test of a DA ASAT in 2007. Because of the altitude of that test, around 800 km, nearly 70 percent of resulting debris remains in orbit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though not directly related to the operation of large constellations, one trend to watch is China’s tendency to date of leaving the upper stages of Long March 6A and 8 rockets used to launch its LEO broadband constellations at altitudes near 800 km. At that altitude, the rocket bodies could remain in orbit for more than 100 years, creating increased collision risks and the potential for debris-generating collisions or other events. With plans to launch thousands of satellites for these constellations, unless China takes a different tack in the future, the risks from these rocket bodies will grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact is that most space debris fragmentation events result from breakups involving old satellites and incidents involving spent rocket bodies. These objects are ticking time bombs, which have a tendency to regularly and spectacularly go off, creating the vast majority of debris-generating incidents since the publication of last year’s threat assessment. But so far, little is being done by the United States or other countries, including China and Russia, to address these main causes of increasing space debris. Though most breakup events are not caused by nefarious acts, debris-generating breakups pose just as much risk to the space environment as the counterspace weapons regularly chronicled in this report, and debris-generating breakups will continue to do so in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MOST DEBRIS-GENERATING INCIDENTS OVER THE PAST YEAR HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH OPERATING SATELLITE CONSTELLATIONS.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;countering-proliferated-satellite-constellations&quot;&gt;COUNTERING PROLIFERATED SATELLITE CONSTELLATIONS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alarming news of 2024—that Russia is pursuing a space-based nuclear anti-satellite weapon—brought the first signs of active development, including on-orbit testing, of a counterspace weapon believed to be designed to counter proliferated LEO (pLEO) constellations en masse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments and commercial operators alike have embraced pLEO constellations: from first-mover Starlink, to the U.S. government through its investment in hundreds of satellites for ISR and missile detection and tracking, to China and its ISR and SATCOM system expansion. These architectures offer clear advantages: enhanced persistence, higher technology refresh rates, lower per unit costs, and greater resilience. Russian efforts to interfere with Starlink in Ukraine have been largely stymied by the sheer number of satellites still able to connect with ground terminals and SpaceX’s ability to rapidly update its systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, no advantage is permanent and, as previous editions of this report have cautioned, adversaries will seek new methods to erode it. Both this report and previous ones have drawn attention to PLA-affiliated research into attack simulations that could wipe out planes of LEO satellites, cyber penetrations of satellite networks and infrastructure that could impact satellite command and control, and high-altitude nuclear detonation (HAND) effects on satellites. Further, Moscow is signaling new redlines with threats that commercial satellites, like Starlink, supporting military operations are legitimate targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors fully expect to see more counter-pLEO threats in the years to come, a reminder that proliferation is but one means of enhancing resilience. The United States must figure out how to deter and defend against such attacks and minimize their catastrophic potential. At the same time, as countries like China utilize pLEO constellations to close their own “space-enabled kill chains,” the United States will also seek ways to erode their capabilities. The distinction for Washington will be to do so in ways that do not lay waste to orbits for all who use them to advance commerce, science, and security in contrast to Moscow’s approach and even those hinted by Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;space-and-missile-defense-nexus&quot;&gt;SPACE AND MISSILE DEFENSE NEXUS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this report does not describe U.S. counterspace weapons, it is impossible to ignore the counterspace implications of the “Golden Dome” missile defense initiative announced by the White House in January 2025. Specific details remain scarce, but the executive order points to the centrality of space for missile defense—encompassing space-based sensors for missile detection and tracking, data relay networks, and renewed interest in space-based interceptors (SBIs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historical analyses suggest that thousands of SBIs in low Earth orbit would be necessary to intercept ballistic missiles in their boost phase, before countermeasures or maneuverable reentry vehicles are released. These SBIs are certain to become high value counterspace targets. Russian officials have already accused the United States of undermining “Russian and Chinese strategic deterrence capabilities” with its Golden Dome plans. Adversaries may well gravitate to nuclear ASATs or other wide area-effects weapons to neutralize such orbiting systems at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, though intended as a missile defense system, SBIs also have utility as counterspace weapons. An SBI equipped with a kinetic payload, laser, or microwave device could be used as a bodyguard satellite or to degrade an adversary’s space systems. It also could be used to entirely cut off access to space, as it could be capable of destroying any attempted space launch withing minutes of a rocket leaving the launch pad, challenging an adversary’s ability to reconstitute satellite systems damaged in a conflict. Taking a step further, SBIs may very well open the door to a broader conversation among policymakers on how to unlock the full military potential of the space domain for warfighting, including capabilities that operate “in, from, and through” space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The years teach much which the days never know.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-ralph-waldo-emerson-from-essays-second-series-1844&quot;&gt;— RALPH WALDO EMERSON FROM ESSAYS: SECOND SERIES, 1844&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That this report chronicles no new spectacular counterspace developments does not mean nothing interesting or noteworthy happened. To understand the events, and the significance, of this past year, one must look at the trends over a wider time horizon. Doing so reveals patterns that illuminate the direction of U.S. adversaries, as well as of the United States and its allies in space. China and Russia, as well as, to a lesser degree, Iran and North Korea, are actively working to test new technologies and concepts of operations in space that have clear applicability and use for counterspace weapons capabilities. Meanwhile, building on trends noted in past years, jamming and spoofing GPS signals has become ubiquitous in certain regions of the world, and cyber operations targeting space systems continue to take place and are uncovered on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, the United States has not publicly revealed its own counterspace-specific capabilities beyond two electronic warfare capabilities. Of its allies, only France has routinely acknowledged its intent to develop on-orbit counterspace capabilities that could perform defensive and offensive missions. From what is publicly known, the United States and its allies appear to be developing a much narrower range of counterspace weapons than their potential adversaries. This imbalance is possibly attributed to the commonly held assumption that the use of kinetic counterspace weapons in conflict is incompatible with maintaining a usable space environment for military space operations and somehow in conflict with the law of war. But the United States is reevaluating these assumptions, talking about kinetic counterspace weapons and space-based missile interceptors as part of the Golden Dome initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Russia and particularly China are demonstrating sophisticated counterspace capabilities in orbit, as well as deploying cyber and electronic warfare capabilities targeting space systems. Iran is growing more capable in space, deploying more satellites and having greater success with indigenous space launch capabilities. The United States has, to date, constrained its counterspace emphasis to non-kinetic capabilities and publicly expressed no interest in developing bodyguard satellites or other systems to defend against attacking satellites in space. But the United States is shedding those restraints. Additionally, the secrecy that surrounds U.S. counterspace capabilities has to date limited its usefulness for deterrence purposes. In this complicated and increasingly threatening space environment, to retain its edge in space, the United States will need all the counterspace tools it can get its hands on, including bodyguard-style satellites. It should also be more public about the U.S. arsenal, ensuring that these systems can be used to the maximum extent for deterrence as well as warfighting.&lt;/p&gt;

This paper aims to understand the operational and strategic logic of why states may use military force against nuclear installations, as well as the consequences, and identify approaches for reducing related risks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has centred concerns on the threat that militaries pose to nuclear installations. While Ukraine’s situation is unique, the threat of military strikes on nuclear facilities predates the war in Ukraine, with military force having been used – or seriously considered – against and in the vicinity of nuclear installations on multiple occasions before that. As more countries become interested in pursuing nuclear energy as a source of clean and sustainable power, and as non-proliferation norms are increasingly challenged, the probability that nuclear installations will find themselves the targets – or unintentional victims – of the use of military force could increase. Such military activity should not be normalised; however, political and military leadership must be ready to anticipate, mitigate and respond to potential future military attacks on nuclear installations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper aims to understand the operational and strategic logic of why states may use military force against nuclear installations, as well as the consequences of such attacks, with the intention of identifying approaches for reducing related risks. It presents five contexts in which military force may be used or threatened to be used against nuclear installations. These are: as a counterproliferation tool; for energy disruption purposes; for area denial; to generate escalatory, deterrent or coercive effects; and when a nuclear site is encountered on an axis of advance or during a broader military operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military force has been used or seriously considered against nuclear installations on numerous occasions in the pursuit of counterproliferation aims. This is despite historical cases pointing to significant limitations of military attacks as an effective counterproliferation tool. The use of military force in a counterproliferation context may seek to achieve a range of objectives – from the elimination of an adversary’s programme altogether, to limiting its progress, or simply as a way of sending a signal of displeasure and resolve to counter the perceived threat. Depending on the proliferation pathway a state may be pursuing, counterproliferation strikes may be carried out against a range of installations across the nuclear fuel cycle, each presenting unique risks to civilian populations and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s military advance on and occupation of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, in contrast, appear to have been driven, at least in part, by an intention to disrupt and eventually co-opt the energy generating capacity of the plant. The targeting of enemy energy generation and distribution infrastructure is well established in the military doctrine of many alliances and states – including those of NATO, Russia and China. The expected growth of the importance of nuclear power in the global energy mix in the coming decades may increase the likelihood that future armed conflict will see greater targeting of nuclear energy infrastructure. This may not necessarily entail direct attacks on nuclear reactors but rather assaults on auxiliary systems – such as water and electricity supply to nuclear power plants – under the erroneous assumption that such attacks carry limited risk to nuclear safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attacks on nuclear facilities may also be carried out with the express intention of releasing radioactive or other toxic material as an area denial strategy. Radiological or chemical contamination of territory complicates and delays an adversary’s military operations in the affected area. However, most militaries have at least some ability to shield against CBRN (chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear) hazards and to continue operations in a contaminated environment – particularly if a mission is critical. As such, ultimately, the effectiveness of radiological or chemical contamination for area denial is likely to be limited. Furthermore, the unpredictability of the dispersion of a contaminant from an attacked nuclear facility creates significant risks of contamination to friendly populations and forces and this contamination might expand and escalate a conflict if toxic material reaches the territory of a third country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the psychological salience of radiological hazards among the general population, attacks and threats of attack on nuclear installations may be used for escalatory, deterrent or coercive purposes. States may threaten attacks on nuclear facilities and the release of radioactive material from these installations as a “half-step” between the use of conventional weapons and a nuclear weapons attack, despite the differences in effect and normative significance of nuclear safety incidents and nuclear weapons attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Short of attacking nuclear installations as a primary target of a military operation, militaries may also encounter and need to contest nuclear facilities on an axis of advance during a land invasion or may be required to carry out air campaigns against territory where nuclear sites are present. Militaries – supported by relevant national authorities – must therefore ensure they have the necessary expertise and capabilities and have conducted the necessary operational planning to be able to safely operate around nuclear facilities if this becomes necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on analysis of operational and strategic drivers for the use of military force against nuclear installations, the paper proposes a number of considerations and recommendations to manage and mitigate related nuclear safety risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthening understanding of, and compliance with, existing international legal principles and norms that restrict the use of military force against and near nuclear installations.&lt;/strong&gt; This may include developing additional guidance on the operationalisation of existing legal provisions and considering how legitimate military objectives may be pursued while maintaining maximum respect for nuclear safety. Reiterating commitments to existing legal provisions and broader norms, and calling out states that do not respect these, is important for making sure that the use of military force that threatens the safety of nuclear installations and poses a risk to civilians is not normalised.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Considering options for strengthening passive defences around nuclear installations and auxiliary systems and equipment which support the safe operation of nuclear facilities (including water supply systems and electrical infrastructure).&lt;/strong&gt; Passive defences may need to be supported with active defence measures in the instance of an active conflict, including the deployment of layered and distributed air defence, as well as specialised C-CBRN (counter-CBRN) ground capabilities. The introduction of any passive and active defences needs to be balanced against limited resources and other priorities that are likely to emerge during an active conflict and should be commensurate with assessed risk in a given context. The deployment of military capabilities near to nuclear installations may also have the unintended consequence of increasing the risks to facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating redundancy in and decentralising nuclear installations and related network.&lt;/strong&gt; This may help shift the cost–benefit calculus for an attacking state by increasing the number of targets that need to be attacked to have meaningful effects on a system and reducing the effects of single strikes. In the context of nuclear energy generation, this may include a shift away from large gigawatt-scale reactors towards the deployment of small modular reactors. However, decentralisation may have the unintended consequences of increasing the risks of hazardous material release and harm to civilian populations by increasing the number and distribution of facilities containing toxic materials.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improving whole-of-society resilience to nuclear safety incidents, including through efforts to raise levels of emergency preparedness, risk awareness and education on nuclear safety among the public and political leadership.&lt;/strong&gt; This should involve the pre-emptive formulation of risk and crisis communication strategies, as well as tools for countering disinformation and misinformation, which prioritise the establishment of trust between the population and authorities, and offer clear information and instructions. Any such efforts must be commensurate to the risk facing a given state and population, and will have to be balanced against the need to avoid alarmism and the risk of inciting unnecessary anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;States have used force against nuclear programmes for nearly as long as humans have known how to split the atom. Between 1942 and 1943, Allied forces carried out a series of operations against the Vemork heavy water production plant in Norway. They suspected – rightly – that the facility was part of a German effort to build a weapon “a thousand times more potent than any in use to-day”. The destruction of the plant and the stocks of heavy water that it was producing thus took the highest priority. The facility was ultimately destroyed in a bombing raid in November 1943.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since those attacks, states have directed military force against other states’ nuclear programmes on multiple occasions. Iraqi strikes on Iran’s Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant (at the time still under construction) during the Iran–Iraq War, the Israeli attacks on Iraq’s Osirak reactor in 1981 and Israel’s bombing of Syria’s Al-Kibar reactor in 2007 are some of the better-known cases. In numerous other instances, attacks were considered but not carried out, including: Egyptian and Soviet deliberations over striking Israel’s nuclear facility at Dimona (during the 1960s); US as well as Indian and Israeli plans, in the 1970s and 1984 respectively, to attack Pakistan’s nuclear facilities at Kahuta; and US plans under multiple administrations for military strikes against North Korea’s nuclear programme. Russia’s plans for a potential conflict with Japan and South Korea also included plans to target the countries’ nuclear energy infrastructure. Meanwhile, Iran’s continued advancement of its nuclear programme and concerns from the US, Israel and others over its weaponisation potential have once again brought to the fore the debate over the utility of military force for addressing the threat of nuclear weapons proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Counterproliferation objectives have historically been a prevalent driver for the use of military force (and its serious consideration) against nuclear facilities. However, it has not been the only one. Russia’s military seizure and subsequent occupation of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) in 2022 have highlighted the broader range of risks posed to nuclear infrastructure from military activity. As nuclear power is expected to become an increasingly important source of energy globally, as conventional conflicts persist in multiple parts of the world, and as non-proliferation norms continue to be challenged, it is likely that military threats to nuclear facilities will persist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper is a contribution to ongoing work on identifying ways to reduce the risks that military force can pose to nuclear installations. It aims to supplement existing analysis – which has, in large part, focused on ways to strengthen legal prohibitions against attacks on nuclear installation and to improve nuclear safety and security measures in times of crisis – by distilling the strategic and operational logic of the use of military force against nuclear facilities. In other words, the paper poses the questions: What may cause militaries to target nuclear facilities? And what does that mean in terms of reducing the risk to nuclear installations posed by military operations? While such military activity should not be normalised, it is important that those working to reduce risks to nuclear sites understand its logic and the risks it may present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology-sources-and-limitations&quot;&gt;Methodology, Sources and Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper builds on existing literature on military threats to nuclear facilities and nuclear safety in conflict zones. It draws on, among others, Bennett Ramberg’s seminal monograph Nuclear Power Plants as Weapons for the Enemy: An Unrecognised Military Peril (first published in 1984), the work of Matthew Fuhrmann and Sarah E Kreps on military attacks on nuclear facilities as a counterproliferation tool, and research and analysis on nuclear safety in conflict zones and related international legal frameworks conducted by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, the Nuclear Threat Initiative, the Vienna Center for Disarmament and Non-Proliferation, and RUSI. This paper aims to update and complement some of the analysis presented in these and other works. In part, it does so by integrating lessons learned from Russia’s occupation of Ukrainian nuclear sites and its broader assault on Ukraine’s energy system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the research for this paper was conducted during field study in Ukraine in July and August 2024. This aimed to capture and learn from Ukraine’s experience in managing the safety and resilience of its nuclear installations and the broader energy grid since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion. The research included interviews with Ukrainian energy and nuclear safety experts, nuclear operators, nuclear plant workers, legislators and military personnel in Kyiv, Zaporizhzhia and the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone (CEZ). In particular, the fieldwork helped to inform some of the analysis presented in this paper related to the targeting of nuclear facilities for energy disruption, for coercive purposes and when encountered on an axis of military advance. The research also relied on a review of other historical cases of military attacks on nuclear facilities to inform the analysis. Cases were examined in varying degrees of detail, due to time limitations and discrepancies in the availability of information. Cases were identified and studied through review of existing literature, archival documents, and interviews with subject matter experts (SMEs). A list of the cases considered for this research is included in the Annex; this is unlikely to be a comprehensive list of all instances in which nuclear installations were targeted or found themselves in the vicinity of military operations. Furthermore, the precise reason for the use or threat of use of military force against nuclear infrastructure in individual cases was not always possible to ascertain, due to sometimes limited information on an attacking state’s decision-making and the presence of confounding drivers and factors. However, the review of cases allowed for a general sense of the likely motivations, desired effects and other considerations that appear to have driven past attacks. The identified drivers and other relevant considerations were subsequently tested, refined and expanded through semi-structured SME interviews and the review of primary and secondary sources. This included consultation of materials on: national risk and resilience assessments; military targeting doctrine; energy grid design and resilience; chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) hazards and emergency response; international law relating to attacks on nuclear infrastructure; and nuclear safety and security regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-1-legal-considerations-and-limitations&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 1. Legal Considerations and Limitations&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While the paper generally foregoes a legal analysis of military attacks on nuclear facilities in various circumstances, it is worth stressing that such military activity exists in highly contested and nuanced legal territory.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The use of military force against civilian infrastructure is generally prohibited under international humanitarian law (IHL), although exceptions may be made if the target is determined to be contributing significantly to an adversary’s military operations and if an attack is deemed militarily necessary. However, the bar for determining military necessity is set high and attacks still need to abide by principles of IHL that require – among other considerations – the effects on civilians of an attack to not be disproportionate to the military advantage being sought. Attacks that cause undue harm to civilians or are intended primarily to terrorise the civilian population are prohibited under international law.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The dual-use nature of many of the activities and materials in a nuclear fuel cycle can complicate the distinction between civilian and non-civilian sites. In a broader military conflict, discerning the extent to which nuclear power installations support military activity can also be difficult. The presence of toxic materials at many nuclear installations makes it difficult to argue that attacks on those sites will not pose a serious risk to civilians and the environment. Yet, the likelihood and extent of the risk and its proportionality in relation to the expected military effects and resulting military advantage can be difficult to assess.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The reliance on individual states’ interpretations and applications of IHL also means that – in instances where a state has decided that another state’s nuclear installations pose a critical threat – the state will likely find ways of justifying the use of military force against a nuclear site. The desire to preserve the use of military force against nuclear installations as a policy option – namely, in the pursuit of non-proliferation objectives – has prevented the introduction of more extensive legal prohibitions and is likely to do so in the future. Russian behaviour in Ukraine also demonstrates that some countries will remain indifferent to their IHL obligations.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;As such, while finding ways to strengthen compliance with existing legal restrictions should be part of the effort to minimise risks, measures to make these facilities less attractive targets, to reduce the consequences of any future attacks and to prepare militaries to operate safely around these facilities are equally important.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author conducted semi-structured research interviews with more than 30 SMEs and practitioners (including military personnel and government officials) by telephone, video conference and in-person between July and November 2024. Some responses to questions were also collected by email. The interviewees’ areas of expertise spanned the fields of nuclear safety and security, nuclear power plant operations, nuclear non-proliferation, strategic security dynamics, nuclear risk reduction, energy grids and energy security, military targeting practices and other military doctrine, military engineering, CBRN emergency preparedness and response, and radiological medicine. Interview questions were tailored to the individuals’ area of expertise and experience and therefore varied considerably across the sample. Interviewees had the option of remaining anonymous or being identified. Those who preferred to remain anonymous have been assigned an alpha identifier alongside a general description of their role and/or area of expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviewees were selected based on their areas of expertise and experience and were identified through the author’s professional networks. The sensitive nature of the subject matter and its direct relevance to countries’ national security imposed limitations on the information that could be shared during interviews on matters pertaining to vulnerabilities and defence of nuclear infrastructure. The author was also limited somewhat by geopolitical constraints in the perspectives that could be captured for this research: attempts were not made, for instance, to identify Russian or Chinese interviewees to query their countries’ perspectives on the targeting and defence of nuclear sites, as such attempts were likely to prove fruitless in the current geopolitical climate. Insights into these countries’ attitudes were drawn, where possible, from public statements, policy documents and observable behaviour – but were ultimately limited in this analysis. As such, the sample of experts interviewed for this paper is not representative of the full range of perspectives on the subjects discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scope-and-definition-of-concepts&quot;&gt;Scope and Definition of Concepts&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The terms “nuclear facilities”, “nuclear sites”, “nuclear installations” and “nuclear infrastructure” are used interchangeably throughout the paper to refer to “nuclear facilities” in the broadest definition offered by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Nuclear Safety and Security Glossary: “A facility (including associated buildings and equipment) in which nuclear material is produced, processed, used, handled, stored or disposed of”. The paper also considers attacks on sites that are meant to host nuclear material but to which nuclear material has not yet been introduced; this would have included Iraq’s Osirak reactor at the time of the 1981 Israeli attack as well as Iran’s Bushehr nuclear power plant, which was under construction when it was repeatedly struck by Iraqi forces. Nuclear facilities vary significantly in their purpose, construction and levels of protection, as well as the radioactivity and other hazards they have the potential to release if they are damaged. As such, where analytically necessary, this paper discusses considerations related to specific types of facilities (for example, nuclear reactors, uranium enrichment plants, spent fuel storage facilities, and so on).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military attacks also vary widely in their scale, the methods they employ and the context in which they are carried out – including whether they take place as part of a larger military operation (for example, a ground invasion or a protracted air operation) or as one-off strikes outside a broader state of war. The term “military strike” is used in the paper to refer to a hit (or intended hit) on a target using military force – irrespective of the kind of military force used, whether the strike took place in the context of a broader military operation or was a one-off hit, or the ultimate effect on target. The term “military attack” is used to refer broadly to military operations aimed at or conducted near nuclear facilities (which may not include a direct strike on a facility). Defining what constitutes “use of military force” and distinguishing it from other “sub-threshold” activities that states may use against an adversary is challenging and the subject of academic and legal debate. For the purposes of this paper, reviewed cases and analysis were limited to instances when kinetic action was conducted by a state’s military. The paper therefore excludes instances of sabotage operations, cyber attacks, assassinations or intelligence-collection activities. The logic, practicalities, effects and countermeasures for these types of activities are likely to differ considerably from attacks using military force – even if carried out in the context of a broader military operation. As such, these activities deserve separate consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The focus of this paper is the use of military force by states and therefore this paper does not consider attacks against nuclear facilities by non-state actors. The non-state threat has received much greater attention – analytical, regulatory and legal – in the nuclear safety and security space, compared with that given to state threats. Furthermore, the motivations, resources and constraints of non-state actors looking to attack a nuclear facility are likely to differ significantly from those of state militaries. As such, they require separate consideration. As with defining “use of military force”, drawing a clear line between state and non-state actors can sometimes be difficult. For the sake of clarity, this paper has limited itself to an analysis of attacks carried out by state militaries. Nevertheless, state-sponsored non-state actors have threatened nuclear infrastructure in the past and may do so in the future. The interplay between state and non-state motivations, resources and restrictions, and the impact on approaches to defence against such attacks is worth exploring in future research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-drivers-and-effects-of-military-attacks-on-nuclear-infrastructure&quot;&gt;I. Drivers and Effects of Military Attacks on Nuclear Infrastructure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In certain contexts, the driver for targeting nuclear infrastructure may be much the same as that for military attacks on other forms of critical national infrastructure (CNI) – for example, the interruption or seizure of energy production (to impede military industry and/or to degrade a population’s morale and will to resist). Nuclear facilities may also be targeted for their intrinsic economic value, just like any other part of large-scale industrial or other infrastructure. However, nuclear facilities have a number of particular characteristics which may present unique strategic and operational opportunities and challenges that influence states’ thinking on whether and how to carry out military activity against or near nuclear infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most relevant particularities of nuclear facilities as a target set are the dual-use nature of some nuclear technology and the presence of material at some nuclear sites which – if dispersed – may pose a radiological danger to human health and the environment. The threat posed by radiological release presents the potential for both physical and psychological harm. Meanwhile, when nuclear sites form part of a nuclear weapons programme – or are suspected of contributing to a state’s nuclear weapons ambitions – they are also likely to be imbued with a level of symbolic significance. Such significance relates to a state’s perception of its own place on the world stage, technical prowess and strategic security, and can exist independently of the actual tactical or operational value of the facilities and the capabilities they may host. The relatively high baseload of nuclear power plants – compared with other energy production facilities – can also present a much larger and centralised energy disruption target for attacking militaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above-listed characteristics of nuclear facilities as targets are the departure point for the analysis that follows of why and how states may carry out attacks against nuclear infrastructure. These characteristics of nuclear facilities, and related consequences of attacks, may be key to why these sites are targeted. For instance, a nuclear installation may be attacked because of, rather than despite, its dual-use nature or the likelihood of radioactive release, as this may be the desired strategic or operational effect. Alternatively, these characteristics and consequences may act as undesirable or unintended consequences of attacks, which may or may not deter or make less attractive attacks on nuclear sites. For example, strikes on other parts of an electrical grid may be carried out despite the risk of creating a nuclear accident at a power plant and the consequent release of radioactive material; alternatively, strikes on the grid may be deterred when the collateral risks are determined to be excessive. This paper attempts to capture both these dynamics in analysing how these unique characteristics have an impact on the operational and strategic considerations for attacks on nuclear sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter discusses five overarching operational and strategic drivers of military attacks, and threats of attack, on nuclear facilities: counterproliferation; energy disruption; the release of radioactive material for area denial and defence; escalation of violence in the course of a conflict, or the threat of doing so for deterrent or coercive purposes; and encountering nuclear facilities on an axis of advance or during a broader military operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These broad categories were articulated based on a review of historical cases of attacks on nuclear facilities and data collected through research interviews, in which SMEs were asked to consider the range of possible drivers for military attacks on nuclear sites. The drivers identified in this paper are unlikely to be exhaustive and are not mutually exclusive; a decision to attack may be informed by several of these factors simultaneously. The following discussion aims to be a starting point for policymakers, militaries and international organisations looking to understand why militaries may consider attacking nuclear infrastructure and when or how influence can be exerted to reduce risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chapter first provides an overview of the effects of radioactive and other toxic material release from nuclear installations, before moving on to a discussion of some drivers of military attacks on nuclear facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;effects-of-nuclear-material-release&quot;&gt;Effects of Nuclear Material Release&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nature of the materials released from nuclear facilities and their practical impact on human health and the environment depend on many factors. These include, but are not limited to: the nature of the material at the facility; the extent and effectiveness of material containment; the quantity of material released; meteorological conditions (such as wind speed, wind direction and precipitation); the availability of protective measures and emergency response; proximity of population centres; and the nature of the environment in the vicinity of the attacked facility (including the presence and type of vegetation and animal life, water sources and the type of soil). Furthermore, nuclear facilities can contain a range of radiotoxic materials, comprising various nuclides and isotopes. Differences in the types of radioactivity the materials release, their half-lives and masses dictate the nature of the threat posed by the various nuclides that may be released from a given facility as a result of an accident or strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The state of current prohibitions on the use of military force against nuclear facilities, as well as the historical trajectory of efforts to strengthen protections against such attacks, have been outlined at length elsewhere. While a detailed summary is not provided in this paper, it is worth briefly outlining the key parameters (an inexhaustive list) of existing international and multilateral protections from military attacks on nuclear installations:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Geneva Conventions (Additional Protocols I and II):&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Various provisions of the Geneva Conventions require militaries to take the necessary precautions to avoid harm to civilians; these include, but are not limited to, prohibitions on attacks against facilities containing “dangerous forces” (including nuclear electrical-generating stations).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;

In a 2009 General Conference decision, the IAEA noted that armed attacks against peaceful nuclear facilities constitute “a violation of the principles of the United Nations Charter, international law and the Statute of the Agency”. In September 2023, the IAEA General Conference adopted a resolution expressing concern over Russian military activity at the ZNPP and reiterating the importance of ensuring nuclear safety in armed conflict.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;

The resolution did not introduce any new binding prohibitions. In July 2024, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution recalling the 2009 IAEA General Conference decision and condemning the Russian seizure of the ZNPP.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

The 2022 NPT Review Conference draft outcome document (not ultimately adopted) also expressed “grave concern” at attacks and threats of attack on peaceful nuclear facilities.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facilities at the front end of the nuclear fuel cycle – namely, uranium mines and mills, uranium conversion sites, uranium enrichment plants and nuclear fuel production facilities – present primarily a chemical rather than radiological risk. Natural uranium and unirradiated uranium compounds (triuranium octaoxide, uranium dioxide and uranium hexafluoride) are not significant sources of radioactivity (with enriched uranium hexafluoride slightly more radioactive than natural uranium). However, these materials can pose a serious chemical risk, primarily from inhalation. For instance, uranium hexafluoride reacts with water vapour present in the air to produce the highly toxic uranium fluoride and, through further reaction, uranyl fluoride, another toxic substance. The threat posed to life from these chemicals again depends on a range of factors, with the most serious effects likely to be fairly localised – although dispersal of some material through wind or groundwater contamination may produce some hazard for populations further away from the site of release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Release from facilities involved in the service period and back end of the nuclear fuel cycle – namely, nuclear reactors, spent-fuel storage sites and spent-fuel reprocessing facilities – pose significant risk of radiological harm, due to the composition of the irradiated nuclear fuel at these facilities, which contains – in addition to uranium and plutonium – unstable radionuclides especially harmful to human health, which are not present in fresh (unirradiated) fuel. The precise isotopic composition of the irradiated fuel at a given facility (and therefore the nature and volume of harmful isotopes present) depends on the initial make-up of the fuel, its burnup, and, if the fuel is no longer in an operational reactor, how long it has been cooling. As with the chemical hazard discussed above, the extent of the radiological hazard depends on (among other factors) the nature of the facility in question (including the extent of physical protection afforded to the radioactive material), the facility’s operational state at the time of the incident, the nature of the incident itself, the abilities and responsiveness of the facility’s personnel and emergency responders, the proximity of the facility to population centres, and the nature of the ecosystem in the vicinity of the site. The consequences of incidents can vary widely depending on these factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extent to which radioactive material is physically protected from any direct strike or dispersal has an important impact on the likelihood and extent of dispersal following various safety incidents or the use of various weapons systems and munitions. Most nuclear installations benefit from reinforced containment structures or vessels. As discussed in greater detail in the section of this paper on strengthening passive and active defences of nuclear facilities, these protections are meant to protect nuclear installations against a range of threats and to prevent release of hazardous material in case of an accident. However, facilities are not generally designed to withstand military assault or operate under wartime conditions (with the exception of some facilities which may be part of an effort to develop nuclear weapons and/or are expected to face serious military threats from adversaries – for instance, Iran’s underground enrichment sites). The extent of protections also varies across countries and facilities. For instance, many of the Soviet-built reactors still operating in Russia are not under a reinforced concrete containment structure; this includes the reactors at the Kursk nuclear power plant, which caused some concern as Ukrainian armed forces advanced into Russia’s Kursk oblast in summer 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;physical-and-psychological-effects&quot;&gt;Physical and Psychological Effects&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on the amount and nature of the exposure to various kinds of nuclear material, effects on the human body will vary. Acute exposure to significant amounts of radiation may result in acute radiation syndrome (ARS), affecting the bone marrow, the gastrointestinal system, and the cardiovascular and central nervous systems. ARS can generally be expected at a dose of 700 millisieverts (mSv) (the equivalent of receiving about 70 full-body CT scans, or 140,000 dental X-rays, or eating 7 tonnes of Brazil nuts). Symptoms vary in severity and duration and may include – depending on the severity of exposure – nausea and vomiting, fever, confusion, haemorrhaging and even death. Cutaneous radiation injury may also result in damage to skin and hair loss. Changes in blood cells can be readily observed at lower doses, of about 100 mSV (the equivalent of 10 full-body CT scans, 20,000 dental X-rays or 1 tonne of Brazil nuts).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, the impact of radioactive release on human health and the environment – especially long-term effects – can be notoriously challenging to track; the effects of any excess radiation may develop over years and decades and may be challenging to isolate from confounding acute and long-term factors. The data on the impact to human health of the 1986 Chornobyl and 2011 Fukushima-Daiichi accidents (which tend to serve as worst-case scenario references in public commentary) is largely inconclusive – with some exceptions. According to the UN Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) – whose findings have been contested by other sources – of the 600 workers on the site at the time of the Chornobyl accident, 134 suffered from radiation sickness, 28 of whom died in the first three months after the accident. Some subsequent deaths may also be attributable to radiation effects. A marked increase in thyroid cancer among children in Belarus, Ukraine and affected parts of Russia, as well as increased rates of leukaemia and cataracts among those workers that had suffered from radiation sickness, has been recorded in the decades since. However, the UNSCEAR report notes that significant changes in other rates of cancer have not been observed, and a general upward trend in mortality across the area of the Soviet Union and improvements in reporting make it difficult to isolate and accurately assess the long-term health impacts of the accident. After the Fukushima-Daiichi accident, no acute health effects attributable to radiation exposure were immediately reported. The UNSCEAR report on the impact of ionising radiation following the accident did not expect a discernible increase in most cancer occurrences among the Japanese population, although it did note the possibility of increased thyroid cancer rates and a potential (likely not discernible) increase in occurrences of leukaemia among children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Environmental impacts of the accidents have also been debated. The CEZ – which stretches out to a 30 km2 radius around the Chornobyl nuclear power plant – remains contaminated and largely without permanent inhabitants. Yet, the site remains operational and – prior to the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine – was open to public visitors, with remaining radioactive isotopes “at tolerable exposure levels for limited periods of time”. Mutations and other adverse effects on animal and plant species in the CEZ were reported in the years after the accident. Today, the area has been rewilded and become a wildlife sanctuary; however, there is also data to suggest that species diversity remains impacted by radiation. Despite the spread of radioisotopes from the accident to other parts of Europe and subsequent contamination of animal products and plants, the increased exposure of radiation is not believed to have had a direct impact on cancer rates outside the affected Soviet republics. At Fukushima-Daiichi, some areas around the plant remain exclusion zones; many have been deemed safe enough for residents to return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assessing the consequences of a given radiological release is particularly challenging for long-term and generational effects of radiation exposure, but this can be true for immediate effects as well. In an interview with the author, Robert Peter Gale – an expert on radiation health effects, who was a leading figure in the medical responses to the 1986 accident at Chornobyl, as well as the 1987 radioactive incident in Goiânia, Brazil, and the Tokaimura and Fukushima-Daiichi accidents in Japan – noted that, immediately following an accident, for victims in close proximity to the event, it may be difficult to tell apart the effects of radionuclide exposure from those of regular burns or exposure to chemicals also released in the accident. This complicates identifying the most appropriate course of immediate treatment for victims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the physical impacts on human health, concerns over exposure to radioactive materials – whether harmful exposure actually took place or not – can have significant psychological effects on populations. The particular propensity of CBRN incidents to incite fear among the public is a well-studied phenomenon and was raised repeatedly by experts interviewed for this project. Interviewees contrasted the fear of an attack on a nuclear site with reactions to attacks on other energy and strategic targets, such as coal and hydro plants, which do not tend to generate the same levels of panic among the general population. Scholars who have studied the subject of risk communication in response to CBRN incidents (namely, CBRN terrorist attacks) have noted that “CBRN releases score highly on all characteristics that trigger fear and anxiety”. The factors that make CBRN a particularly anxiety-inducing threat include relatively low levels of understanding of nuclear technology and the effects of radioactivity, the ability of CBRN incidents to induce “severe and unusual medical conditions”, the unpredictability of the threat, and its manufactured nature (as opposed to “acts of God”). As some of the experts interviewed for this paper pointed out – and as has been well-documented in literature – the public anxiety caused by radiological release is likely to be incommensurate with the actual physical danger. This may, in turn, create additional challenges and risk as the “worried well” overwhelm emergency response services and potentially engage in unnecessary and possibly harmful remedial action (for instance, unnecessarily evacuating their homes or self-medicating).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his conversation with the author, Gale pointed to the panic that spread to Kyiv and Tokyo after the Chornobyl and Fukushima-Daiichi disasters respectively, despite the fact that the disaster sites were a considerable distance away from these cities and, in Gale’s assessment, did not pose a significant radiation threat to the cities’ populations. Instead, he noted that the subsequent evacuations from surrounding areas, as well as precautionary measures taken out of fear of the effects of radiation exposure, may have caused greater collateral harm. Gale pointed to the increase in induced abortions after the Chornobyl accident, as a result of misguided advice from doctors on the effects of the radiation on foetuses. Studies conducted in the years following the disaster found no evidence that children exposed to radiation in utero showed any neuropsychological differences from the control sample.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evacuations following a nuclear accident can also have harmful secondary effects on the displaced population. Gale and others have highlighted the risks of disruptions to healthcare, particularly for the older population, caused by evacuations from around the Fukushima-Daiichi plant after the 2011 disaster. Such evacuations appear to have had a greater direct health impact than radiation exposure from the accident. In its report on the levels and effects of radiation exposure after the accident, UNSCEAR reported on the “immediate aggravation of the condition of already vulnerable groups: for example, more than 50 hospitalized patients were reported to have died either during or soon after the evacuation … upwards of 100 elderly people may have died in subsequent months because of a variety of conditions linked to the evacuation”. The influx of people into neighbouring regions and countries also has important social, political and health implications as public services, including healthcare, must stretch to accommodate the new arrivals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intermediate- and long-term psychological effects of radiological release incidents have also been well-documented. Studies have found increased levels of depression, anxiety and “medically unexplained physical symptoms” among survivors of the Chornobyl disaster than in control samples. A 2006 World Health Organization study also reported that distress among victims was also often the result of subjective perceptions that they, or their children, had been affected by the radiation release at Chornobyl. The study noted expert consensus that, “The mental health impact of Chernobyl is the largest public health problem caused by the accident to date”. Research conducted on the Fukushima-Daiichi accident also reported psychological distress among individuals who felt they had been affected by radiation. Similarly, following the Goiânia accident, more than 112,000 people sought assistance related to symptoms of radioactive exposure; however, only 260 people appear to have been actually contaminated, with four deaths reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;counterproliferation&quot;&gt;Counterproliferation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the Second World War Allied attacks on the Vemork heavy water production plant, military strikes – and more covert means – have been used repeatedly to target nuclear programmes that are believed to pose a risk of weaponisation. Counterproliferation has, historically, been a leading driver behind the use of military force (or its serious consideration) against nuclear infrastructure. Other instances include: repeated strikes on Iraq’s nuclear facilities – by Iran in 1980, Israel in 1981, and the US in the 1990s; and Israel’s strike on Syria’s Al-Kibar reactor in 2007. As mentioned earlier, there are also multiple instances in which strikes were considered but not carried out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Logic of Counterproliferation Attacks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The definition of operational success in the context of military strikes as a counterproliferation tool varies on a case-by-case basis and may range from a limited roll-back of a nuclear programme to completely disabling (at least in the immediate term) a country’s ability to continue its pursuit of nuclear weapons. In their work on military strikes as a counterproliferation tool, Kreps and Fuhrmann have proposed that attacks on nuclear facilities may have an impact on the host country’s proliferation activity in four ways: by delaying the production of relevant materials and components through the destruction of chokepoint facilities; by forcing a change in the target country’s approach to fissile material production (shifting from the production of plutonium-using reactors and processing facilities to the production of uranium in easier-to-conceal enrichment facilities); by discouraging foreign suppliers from providing materials and assistance to the programme; and by increasing international inspections of the target country’s nuclear sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military strikes on facilities can also serve a signalling purpose – demonstrating the attacking state’s resolve to do what is necessary to prevent the emergence of a nuclear weapons capability. Israeli strikes on nuclear facilities in the Middle East are a good example of this dual effect. Israeli military action against nuclear facilities has had the effect of physically eliminating or degrading programmes perceived to be a proliferation threat while also reinforcing the so-called “Begin Doctrine” – Israel’s policy of not permitting its regional adversaries to acquire WMD and its preparedness to use “all the means at [its] disposal” to this end. An Israeli nuclear expert interviewed for this paper noted that military attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities may become necessary, not just to physically degrade the programme, which can be reconstituted with some time, but to signal Israeli (and/or US) resolve to continue striking the programme until Iran decides to abandon any nuclear weapons ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practical terms, the effectiveness of military strikes as a counterproliferation tool is the subject of considerable debate and depends on a variety of factors. The prevalent opinion among counterproliferation experts tends to be that military force is limited in its effectiveness as a counterproliferation tool and – in isolation – is best-suited to delaying, rather than outright eliminating a state’s nuclear ambitions. However, when accompanied by a large-scale military operation aiming to achieve broader strategic security objectives and/or the installation of permanent IAEA inspectors with the requisite authority to destroy nuclear material – as was the case in the Gulf War and the subsequent approach to dealing with the threat of a nuclear Iraq – it may be able to achieve more lasting results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel’s 1981 attack on the Osirak reactor and 2007 attack on the Al-Kibar reactor are often lauded as examples of successful counterproliferation strikes. Yet, this is a misguided reading of the facts. After the Osirak attack, the Saddam Hussein government only doubled down on its nuclear ambitions; as Ramberg has pointed out in his work on the use of military force as a counterproliferation tool, “Baghdad, which had committed 400 scientists and $400 million to the nuclear program before the attack, enlarged its nuclear staff to 7,000 and upped its budget to $10 billion”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the attack, Iraq also reportedly turned to the Soviet Union for guidance on how to make nuclear facilities more resilient to attack: “Specifically, the KGB taught them how to disguise and disperse industrial facilities, using techniques such as blocking heat sources from being detected by strategic reconnaissance. They also taught the Iraqis how to build in ‘blow-away’ walls to new structures, such that if the building is hit the structure is left sufficiently in place to permit rapid reconstruction.” The Israeli strike on the reactor followed an earlier Iranian attack on the site in 1980, and it was not until US attacks on Iraq’s nuclear sites during the wider Gulf War air campaign that the programme ultimately ended. While the 2007 Israeli attack on Al-Kibar did seem to eliminate Syria’s nuclear proliferation efforts, some accounts attest that Damascus may have considered reconstructing the reactor after the attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel also did not stop at the 2007 military attack and appears to have continued its use of lethal force as a counterproliferation strategy: in 2008, its special forces assassinated General Mohammed Suleiman who had been in charge of the construction of the Al-Kibar reactor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, despite these limitations, states have repeatedly resorted to – or seriously considered – military force for counterproliferation objectives. In a 2010 journal article, Fuhrmann and Kreps conducted a statistical analysis of counterproliferation attacks and serious considerations of attack to determine the factors that increase the likelihood of states resorting to military force as a counterproliferation strategy. They found that threat perception in relation to the nuclear programme in question, above all else, drives states’ decision-making on whether to carry out a counterproliferation strike. The authors concluded that decisions to use military force for counterproliferation aims are driven primarily by a fear on the part of the attacking state that the proliferating state “might use nuclear weapons or engage in other offensive behaviour”, not diplomatic recrimination or even retaliatory strikes by the latter. Fuhrmann and Kreps identify three factors that appear to have a particular influence on threat perceptions: the prior existence of militarised conflict; the presence of an autocratic proliferator; and divergent policy interests between the attacking state and the proliferator. Their analysis finds no statistically significant correlation between a decision to carry out military strikes and risks of reprisal or diplomatic recrimination. The authors argue that “states are willing to accept substantial costs in attacking if they believe that a particular country’s acquisition of nuclear weapons poses a significant threat to their security”. Israel’s experience is instructive in this instance; despite considerable concerns among the Israeli decision-makers over the diplomatic backlash the country may have faced in response to its decision to strike Osirak in 1981, the attack went ahead. The decision to resort to military action in the face of possible diplomatic recrimination was informed by a perception among Israeli leadership that there was no other way to prevent an Iraqi nuclear weapon; diplomatic efforts with Iraq had failed and the reactor was about to be loaded with fuel, which would have greatly increased the risk of collateral damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Likely Targets and Effects&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on the objective of a counterproliferation attack and the nature and state of the programme, a range of facilities and assets may be targeted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the purpose of a strike is to cause material damage to a state’s capability to develop nuclear weapons (and not just signal resolve), in instances where a country may be pursuing a uranium weapon, the front end of the fuel cycle is likely to be of greatest relevance for an attacking state. Targets may include uranium mines and mills, conversion facilities, enrichment plants, enriched uranium storage sites and centrifuge production plants. In cases where a state is suspected of pursuing a plutonium weapon, it is more likely to be relying on heavy water reactors, graphite-moderated reactors or fast breeder reactors to accumulate plutonium. These may be dedicated plutonium production reactors or may double as research reactors or power-generating reactors. Light water reactors can also be used for plutonium production, although they tend to be less efficient, as light water reactor fuel tends to contain relatively high levels of Plutonium-240, making it less suitable – although still useable – for the production of nuclear weapons. A reprocessing facility is also required to extract the plutonium from the irradiated fuel. Counterproliferation attacks against plutonium programmes are therefore likely to target reactors or reprocessing facilities – which can pose a serious radiation hazard if material is released. A country may of course host facilities that allow it to pursue either pathway; for instance, Iraq pursued both the uranium and plutonium pathways following Israel’s 1981 attack on Osirak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any sites that may be hosting weaponisation-related activities and expertise – such as research reactors and centres or various laboratories – may also be targeted, regardless of the weaponisation pathway a country may be pursuing. Such activities can often be obfuscated in small and non-descript facilities or at sites engaged in civilian or military research. As such, they may be much more difficult to identify for targeting than large enrichment facilities or reactors. Furthermore, weaponisation research sites and even enrichment facilities and centrifuge production plants can be placed deep underground, making them much harder to damage or destroy through the use of limited military force. Assassinations of nuclear scientists have also been a counterproliferation tactic deployed by Israel, as a way of eliminating proliferation-relevant expertise in a state. However, such activity falls outside the definition of “military attack” in this paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;energy-disruption&quot;&gt;Energy Disruption&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military strikes on energy infrastructure are an established aspect of waging war. Nuclear power plants thus risk becoming military targets when the disruption of energy production is an objective of a military operation. This is likely to have been a driver behind the Russian occupation of Ukraine’s ZNPP. No other cases examined by the author point to energy disruption as having been a key driver of a military attack on a nuclear facility. However, the case of the ZNPP is unlikely to remain an exception. As nuclear power is expected to play a greater role in the international energy mix, nuclear energy facilities may be targeted for the purpose of energy disruption in future conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth highlighting that the legality of attacks on energy infrastructure under international law is highly context-dependent. Energy infrastructure is, in many cases, a legitimate military target. However, as discussed earlier, attacks that cause disproportionate harm to civilians or are aimed primarily at terrorising the civilian population are prohibited under IHL. The potential for radioactive release means that attacks which risk the safety of nuclear power plants are particularly difficult to justify under international law since the potential effects of such attacks can lead to significant harm to civilians. However, this does not rule out the possibility that nuclear energy infrastructure and auxiliary systems may be targeted by militaries in the future. As such, it is worth examining the logic of such attacks and possible approaches to risk mitigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Logic of Energy Disruption Attacks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One prevalent approach to conceptualising military targeting priorities is underpinned by the idea that strategic objectives can be achieved through the degradation of an adversary’s key physical systems – or centres of gravity (COGs) – as opposed to aimless attrition or a singular focus on degrading an adversary’s military forces. Power generation and transmission infrastructure is a particularly important COG, as its destruction can significantly undermine the adversary’s ability to prosecute a war and incentivise concessions from the political leadership. Energy infrastructure is therefore often an explicit component of military targeting doctrines – including NATO’s Allied Joint Doctrine for Joint Targeting and the US Air Force’s Targeting Doctrine. During the 1999 Kosovo Air Campaign, NATO forces extensively targeted Serbian electrical infrastructure, reportedly destroying 35% of its electricity-generating capacity. The intended effect – ultimately successful – was to wear down the will to resist of the Serbian population and the elites, thus pressuring Serbian President Slobodan Milošević to comply with NATO demands. The US Air Force also targeted Iraqi electrical infrastructure, alongside other strategic targets, during both the Gulf War and the Iraq War. The aim was to incapacitate Iraq’s military while also creating the necessary conditions for the political overthrow of the Iraqi regime. The focus on the degradation of an adversary’s systems, rather than its armed forces, is also central to Chinese military thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian military thinking appears to be predicated on similar assumptions, with an apparent recognition of the fact that in modern wars, priorities for the application of force have shifted from the destruction of an adversary’s forces to the destruction of an adversary’s critical facilities. Energy generation infrastructure – including nuclear power plants – is one of the operational-strategic and strategic target categories captured by Russia’s doctrinal concept of Strategic Operation for the Destruction of Critically Important Targets. Strikes on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure have been a key aspect of Russia’s war on the country. Considering that over half of Ukraine’s energy-generating capacity in 2021 came from its four nuclear power plants, it was perhaps not surprising – but still alarming – that these facilities have been targeted. Russian war planning documents for a potential conflict with Japan and South Korea, dating from 2013 and 2014, also included plans to target nuclear power plants, among other energy and CNI targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As nuclear power plants tend to have greater baseload generating capacity per station (with the majority falling within the range of 1–4 GW of generating capacity) than other energy sources (although not always), they may be particularly attractive energy-disruption targets: an assault on a single large nuclear plant can cause greater disruption to a country’s energy generation than attacks on smaller hydro, thermal or other generating stations and related transmission infrastructure. In the case of these latter targets, the destruction of multiple targets may be required to produce energy disruption on a similar scale. The capture and shutdown of the ZNPP has had the single most important impact on the loss of Ukraine’s energy production capacity from the incapacitation of a single facility. Prior to the start of the full-scale invasion, the ZNPP had a total net generating capacity of 5.7 GW. The ZNPP is, of course, an outlier as it is the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. Still, its capacity is significantly higher than that of Ukraine’s second-largest power station, the Vuhlehirska Thermal Power Plant, a coal-fired facility with a generating capacity of 3.6 GW, which Russia captured in July 2022. According to some accounts, by summer 2024, Ukraine had lost 25.5 GW of generation capacity. Based on these figures, the loss of the ZNPP, which took the Russian forces less than a day, represented nearly a quarter of all generation capacity lost during the first two-and-a-half years of full-scale war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some coal or hydro power plants can rival the generating capacity of nuclear power plants. In such instances, militaries may opt to target these facilities rather than nuclear power generating stations to reduce enemy energy generation capacity and potential collateral effects – namely, the risk of radioactive release. However, the dangers to the population of the destruction of a hydroelectric facility may similarly have devastating consequences if it involves damage to a hydro dam. The breach of Ukraine’s Nova Kakhovka dam caused 58 confirmed fatalities – the actual death toll was likely higher, potentially in the hundreds, by some estimates. The flood affected 620 km2 of land, forced the reduction of energy output from hydroelectric stations along the Dnipro River, destroyed irrigation systems across the region, caused the leakage and spread of chemicals and other pollutants into waterways and soil, and displaced mines, causing a further hazard to human life. As mentioned earlier, attacks on hydro facilities and other power generating plants may, however, not carry the same psychological effect on the population and decision-makers as attacks – or threats of attack – on nuclear infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A high dependence on nuclear power for energy production naturally makes it more likely that a country’s nuclear infrastructure will come under threat should it become the target of a military campaign by an adversary. Few countries are currently as dependent on nuclear power as Ukraine. As of 2023, only France and Slovakia generated over half of their energy from nuclear power, with Hungary just below the 50% mark. Another five countries – Finland, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechia and Slovenia – relied on nuclear power for over a third of their energy generation in 2023. Should an adversary decide to incapacitate energy infrastructure in these countries in the course of a full-scale invasion or strategic air campaign, it is likely that their nuclear power plants or related transmission networks would be at risk. A military assault of that scale remains highly improbable in the aforementioned countries, even though there is concern in a number of them about the threat posed by Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The potential for nuclear energy infrastructure to be targeted in countries that face a clear and considerable threat of strategic military attack from regional adversaries is a greater concern. Countries that may face such threats include Armenia (which has one reactor, making up 31.1% of the country’s energy generation) and South Korea (26 reactors, making up 30.7% of the country’s energy generation). As more countries become interested in nuclear power as a sustainable and clean source of energy, the share of energy produced by nuclear power plants is projected to increase in the coming decade, including in countries that might face strategic-level military threats from adversaries – namely, Iran and South Korea. Concerns have also been raised over the potential for China to attack or otherwise disrupt the operations of Taiwan’s nuclear reactor at Maanshan, should open conflict break out. Taiwan’s ruling party has committed to shutting down the island’s last operating reactor in 2025, which will minimise both the energy security and nuclear safety implications of any future attack. However, Taiwan’s stores of spent fuel withdrawn from the decommissioned reactors will continue to pose a potential radioactive threat should China decide to target them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Likely Targets and Effects&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of energy disruption, nuclear installations that may be targeted include nuclear reactors and their support systems, as well as the transmission lines and substations that connect the reactors to the broader grid. The destruction of nuclear fuel production facilities, fuel storage facilities and other sites outside the operational stage of the nuclear fuel cycle – that is, the point in the cycle where energy is being produced – may complicate the operation of nuclear power plants in the long run. However, reactors are normally loaded with fuel that can supply power for years before needing to be replaced. Equally, nuclear fuel can be stored on-site – in cooling pools within reactor buildings – for several years before a shortage of space for spent fuel storage becomes enough of an issue that it impacts the operation of a reactor. Spent fuel pools may also be allowed to exceed their designed capacity if needed. As such, while disrupting the operation of these other facilities may have an impact on nuclear energy production in the long term, an immediate effect on energy generation would require attacks on reactors themselves, their support systems or their transmission infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Direct attacks on a reactor vessel are unlikely, if the sole purpose of the attack is to disrupt energy production. The risk of large-scale radiological release if the containment structure and core of a reactor are penetrated – for instance, by a missile strike – is exceptionally high. Instead, militaries aiming to disrupt nuclear energy production or distribution are more likely to target supporting systems and transmission infrastructure. This may be perceived by militaries and governments as a safer and easier alternative to achieving energy disruption objectives – posing fewer risks of a catastrophic nuclear safety incident, eliciting less fervent recriminations from the international community and requiring less firepower to inflict damage. This logic may have been playing out in Russian military assaults on Ukraine’s nuclear infrastructure, with strikes carried out primarily against supporting infrastructure – including water supply, power lines and substations connected to Ukraine’s nuclear power plants, as well as auxiliary buildings and infrastructure at the ZNPP. Ukraine’s reactors have, however, also been hit on a number of occasions – including direct drone strikes on one of the ZNPP’s reactor domes and a drone strike on the New Safe Confinement Structure at Chornobyl. Similar logic has been observed in campaigns targeting non-nuclear energy infrastructure. After receiving significant criticism for attacks on Iraqi energy infrastructure during the Gulf War, coalition forces reportedly limited their attacks during the Iraq War only to energy transmission infrastructure, rather than energy generation stations, as well as switching to weapons expected to be less harmful to civilians. The reduced firepower required to damage power lines and water reservoirs as opposed to reactor vessels (which would require the use of heavy and targeted munitions to penetrate the containment structure) also allows the attacker some credible deniability of responsibility, should diplomatic recrimination be a concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is only partially true that attacks on supporting and transmission infrastructure are lower risk: these systems are all critical for the safe operation of a plant. A loss of off-site power (LOOP) incident, a loss of coolant accident (LOCA) or a station blackout (SBO) (when the station loses access to both off-site power and emergency generators) can have catastrophic results for a nuclear plant. This is something that the IAEA has repeatedly drawn attention to in the context of the war in Ukraine. The IAEA has highlighted the risk to nuclear safety posed by the frequent disconnection of Ukraine’s nuclear power plants, and the ZNPP in particular, from off-site power supply and the risks of potential coolant loss following the draining of the Kakhovka reservoir. Off-site power and water supply are critical for the maintenance of a plant’s safe and secure operation. While nuclear power plants have on-site emergency diesel generators and alternative sources of coolant can be sought (for instance, through the drilling of wells), these cannot fully replace normal operating systems or be relied on indefinitely and may themselves be challenging to procure and maintain during a war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attacks on transmission networks rather than the generating facilities themselves may also be the preference when a military operation is aimed at the occupation of a country, rather than a purely punitive or coercive military campaign, when destruction rather than territorial gain is the primary objective. In such cases, the adversary may wish to minimise damage to CNI (to the extent that military operational necessity allows) and to prioritise instead targets that may be easier to rebuild following the end of hostilities. In the case of energy infrastructure, transmission lines and substations are much less costly, timely or complex to repair than generating stations. Damaging energy transmission – rather than generation – infrastructure also allows for the rerouting of energy infrastructure away from unoccupied territories and towards those that the adversary has managed to capture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disruption of energy production and distribution also has serious implications for both the safety and morale of civilian populations, and potentially also for military operations. Modern societies are highly dependent on reliable electricity supply to operate CNI and critical services – from the provision of water supply, sanitation services and heating to the operation of communication networks, health services, financial systems and government bureaucracies. Disruption of this infrastructure may lead to civilian deaths, at worst, and a decline in morale and willingness to continue with the war effort, at best. For instance, as mentioned earlier, NATO attacks on Serbia’s energy infrastructure elicited frustration among Serbian elites and the broader population that helped pressure Milošević into concessions. These disruptions to daily life may also drive internal displacement and refugee flows outside the targeted country, putting pressure on neighbouring states and potentially decreasing whatever political or military support these states are lending to the targeted country. The potential for renewed waves of refugee flows from Ukraine into Europe has been a concern in light of persistent Russian assaults on Ukraine’s energy system and Russia’s track record of weaponising refugee migration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;area-denial&quot;&gt;Area Denial&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Release of radioactive material may be an unintended consequence of a direct attack on a nuclear facility or of other military operations that result in a nuclear accident. However, it is also conceivable that militaries may target nuclear facilities – or threaten to do so – with the express intention of releasing radioactive material precisely because of the risk that such a release would cause to the surrounding environment, as a method of area denial. The author has not identified any instances of nuclear facilities having been expressly targeted for this purpose in the past. Any such attack would also almost certainly violate provisions of the Geneva Conventions and IHL principles more broadly, as it would be difficult to ensure or convincingly make the case that release of radioactive material as a result of attack would not place civilian populations at risk. Furthermore, nuclear facilities in the back end of the nuclear fuel cycle – for instance, spent fuel storage facilities – would have little military utility; attacks on such installations would be difficult to justify on the basis of military necessity. However, a number of experts interviewed for this paper agreed that nuclear sites could hypothetically be targeted by militaries for area denial purposes; as such, the possibility deserves analytical consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Logic of Area Denial Attacks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attacks to release radioactive material may be used either as part of an offensive operation – denying manoeuvrability and incapacitating an adversary – or as part of a defensive effort – placing radiation in the way of an advancing military. Radioactive or chemical contamination of a territory complicates and delays an adversary’s operations in the affected area and may lead to mission failure. Contamination can have an impact on a force’s freedom of movement, force personnel to operate in cumbersome protective gear, interrupt logistics and supply lines, and require the updating of risk assessments and the adjustment of mission plans. If radiation or chemical exposure is suffered by troops, this may also incapacitate personnel and impact the morale of those not directly affected. Levels of awareness of CBRN risks and how to manage them vary among and within militaries. Furthermore, specialised counter-CBRN (C-CBRN) units ultimately have limited personnel and capacity and may therefore struggle to provide the levels of support necessary to carry out large-scale or complex operations in a contaminated environment or one that poses the risk of a CBRN incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on the extent of the radiological or chemical dispersal, a broader emergency response may be needed to address risks to the broader population, thereby drawing on already-stretched civil and military resources. Meanwhile, forces of the attacking state which were previously tasked with holding the now-contaminated territory could probably be reallocated to bolster operations elsewhere on the frontline. Equally, stressing and even exaggerating risks to a nuclear site may be used as a way of deterring any attempts at contesting the territory near a nuclear facility or the nuclear site itself – both because of the actual risk of causing a nuclear accident and because of the diplomatic and public outcry that would accompany such a military operation. Militaries may therefore be incentivised to use these sites as defensive positions. The deterrent and coercive impacts of such threats are discussed in the next section of this chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these challenges of operating in a CBRN environment, there is some reason to doubt the ultimate operational impact and effectiveness of radioactive release as an area denial tool. Most modern militaries have procedures in place to respond to CBRN incidents and to maintain – to the extent possible, based on an assessment of risk to personnel and mission importance – operability in such environments. While radioactive contamination of a territory may delay and complicate a military operation, the adoption of protective measures and – depending on the importance of the mission – some acceptance of risk will likely allow operational objectives to be pursued, albeit with significantly greater difficulty and risk. The measures taken to minimise exposure are dictated by individual militaries’ doctrines for CBRN operations, the nature of the hazard, the availability of protective measures and operational requirements. Protective measures for operations in a contaminated environment include some combination of minimising exposure time, maintaining distance from the hazardous material and employing shielding materials. Trade-offs between the various protective measures may be necessary depending on operational requirements – for instance, foregoing protective gear to minimise exposure time. The degree of acceptable exposure is also dictated by how critical the mission is to achieving operational or strategic objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unpredictability of any radiological release and the impossibility of controlling the extent of contamination also make radiological dispersal a very risky area denial tactic – one which is likely to pose greater risk than benefit. Radiological dispersal does not discriminate between adversary and friendly forces: any territory denied to the adversary will be equally denied to friendly forces. This not only will complicate friendly force operations in the contaminated territory but – depending on the extent and nature of the contamination – can also make the territory uninhabitable following the end of hostilities. Depending on weather patterns and the nature and direction of the radioactive plume, the territories and civilian populations of the attacking state may also come to harm. The risk of contaminating one’s own territory and putting one’s own troops and civilians in harm’s way is highlighted in NATO doctrinal documents on CBRN operations and was raised repeatedly – alongside IHL considerations – by the military and defence experts interviewed for this paper as a major disincentive for the use of military force against or in the vicinity of a nuclear facility. The extent to which self-harm acts as a disincentive would depend on the attacking state’s concern for its own military personnel and civilians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The likely eventuality that radioactive contamination spreads to third states would also risk escalating the conflict by potentially invoking a response from countries not already directly party to it. In June 2023, amid rising concerns over the safety of the ZNPP, a bipartisan resolution was introduced in the US Senate calling for any attack on a nuclear facility that disperses radioactive material to NATO territory to trigger “an immediate response, including the implementation of article V of the North Atlantic Treaty”. The resolution was never adopted and the credibility of threats to invoke Article 5 in such an instance are debatable; however, it does highlight the escalatory threat that may be posed by such an incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An imperfect comparison can be drawn here with the long history of releasing other “dangerous forces” for the purposes of area denial – for example, flooding territory by breaching dams and dykes. Examples of this practice include the piercing of dykes by the Dutch to break the sieges of Alkmaar (1573) and Leiden (1574) during the Eighty Years’ War; China’s breach of the Yellow River Dam (1938) to slow the advance of the Japanese army during Japan’s invasion of China; the Soviet destruction of the Ukrainian DniproHES hydroelectric dam with the aim of slowing German advances during the Second World War; strikes on the Islamic State-controlled Tabqa Dam by US Special Forces, apparently for the purpose of “territory denial” and to destroy Islamic State garrisons in the walls of the dam; and most recently, Russia’s destruction of Ukraine’s Nova Kakhovka dam in June 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are of course notable differences between the risks posed by mass flooding and those posed by the release of radioactive material – namely, the much more persistent nature of radioactive contamination, the greater challenges of shielding oneself from radiation, the greater unpredictability of the direction and extent of a radioactive plume and, perhaps most critically, the psychological impact of radioactive contamination. However, as with radioactive release, mass flooding can also cause significant harm to civilian populations and have catastrophic and long-term economic, ecological and health effects – damaging farmland, destroying livelihoods, polluting groundwater and spreading disease. While past instances of mass flooding for area denial have produced some effects on the battlefield, there is a dearth of examples where its use has proven strategically decisive in a military conflict. In some cases, such tactics instead caused adverse effects for friendly forces. The ability of militaries to adapt, especially in pursuit of existential or other strategically important objectives, and the difficulty of controlling these “dangerous forces” makes them a suboptimal method of area denial. As has been noted elsewhere, conventional means – for instance, mines – can be used instead of CBRN or other dangerous forces to achieve area denial with much lower risks to one’s own forces, territory and populations and with lower risks of political castigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Likely Targets and Effects&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a substance to act as an effective area denial tool, it must be at once hazardous enough to impede safe operation in the contaminated area and persistent enough to stick around long enough to achieve the desired effect. In this way, the considerations on the use of radioactive material for area denial are similar to those for the use of chemical weapons for that purpose. The definitions of “hazardous enough” and “persistent enough” depend on the intended operational or strategic effects, the intended target (personnel or vehicles) and the resilience of the adversary – including shielding capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on these considerations, nuclear facilities across the nuclear fuel cycle that contain nuclear materials could in future be targeted for area denial purposes. Broadly speaking, the radiological hazard posed by attacks on facilities in the operational and back end of the nuclear fuel cycle may pose a greater shielding and decontamination challenge than the predominantly chemical hazard posed by materials released from sites in the front end of the nuclear fuel cycle. However, as discussed earlier, the actual risk depends on many factors, which will dictate the type of shielding that personnel wishing to operate in the affected area would require, as well as the amount of time and types of activities that personnel would be able to perform. For an extensive discussion of the physical and psychological effects of nuclear materials release, see the start of this chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;escalation-of-violence-deterrence-and-coercion&quot;&gt;Escalation of Violence, Deterrence and Coercion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the potential physical effects of assaults on nuclear facilities, and any consequent release of hazardous material, the threat of such attacks can also have an important psychological impact on populations and political leadership. The fear that radioactive release engenders in the popular psyche – discussed in greater detail at the start of this chapter – makes the psychological dimension conducive to weaponisation, particularly when public opinion and morale, or diplomatic pressure, are important for achieving a given objective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combination of the physical, psychological and normative effects of attacks on nuclear facilities means that states may conceive of them as a “half-step” in escalation dynamics between conventional war and the use of nuclear weapons by a nuclear weapons state. This is despite the fact that the effects of nuclear accidents differ considerably from those of nuclear weapons. The conflation of the effects of major nuclear accidents and nuclear weapons detonations sometimes observed in public debate can exacerbate the strategic impact of such threats. Such strikes and threats could be used to signal one’s willingness to escalate a conflict by inflicting – or threatening to inflict – radiological effects on an adversary’s troops, environment and population, without actually resorting to the use of nuclear weapons. The fear of radiological release also means that threats of attacks on nuclear facilities can be used for deterrent and coercive purposes. Threats to the safety of a nuclear site – whether explicit or implied – may be used to deter further escalation by the adversary elsewhere on the front line or away from the battlefield, as a source of leverage in diplomatic negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equally, non-nuclear weapons states may strike – or threaten to strike – the nuclear facilities of an adversary in the absence of a nuclear weapons capability for similar signalling and escalatory logic. Non-nuclear weapons states facing a nuclear-armed adversary may use such threats against the latter’s nuclear sites in an effort to compensate for an imbalance in deterrent capabilities. The ability and willingness to threaten to attack an adversary’s nuclear sites may have a significant effect on the deterrent balance between two non-nuclear weapons states and may help to address imbalances in conventional capabilities. One such attempt by a non-nuclear weapon state to bolster its deterrent capability against another non-nuclear weapon state may have played out during the escalation in violence between Armenia and Azerbaijan in 2020. In a statement from its defence ministry, Baku warned that Yerevan “should keep in mind that our armed forces have advanced missile systems in service, capable of conducting high-precision strikes on the Metsamor nuclear power plant, which may result in a huge disaster for Armenia”. Media commentary on the incident suggested that the threat may have been issued following a miscommunication between the two sides and highlighted the escalatory risk posed by such rhetoric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The possibility of placing adversaries’ nuclear power plants at risk – as a sort of “less apocalyptic” alternative to nuclear weapons deterrence – was raised in public discourse as early as 1978, in an article for Foreign Policy by Chester L Cooper, who was, at the time, assistant director to Oak Ridge Laboratory’s Institute for Energy Analysis. Cooper noted that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A high explosive bomb, when used against a nuclear target, would acquire some of the radioactive attributes of a nuclear bomb (although it obviously would not have the same blast effects). Thus the presence of nuclear power plants in a given country could effectively transform its enemy’s arsenal of conventional bombs into weapons with radioactive fallout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also pointed out that, while some attacks – for instance, those targeting only the electrical system of a nuclear power plant – would likely result in limited consequences that could be mitigated, “no national leader could be confident that an attack would not succeed in destroying the sensitive elements of a nuclear plant”, with catastrophic results. He concluded not only that the proliferation of nuclear power plants would lead to “a vast increase in energy supply for developing nations”, but also that nuclear power generating stations could actually improve relations among countries by introducing a dynamic akin to the concept of mutually assured destruction. Ramberg later built on Cooper’s observations in Nuclear Power Plants as Weapons for the Enemy: An Unrecognised Military Peril, noting that states could threaten to target an adversary’s nuclear facilities in response to being attacked. Ramberg also suggests that nuclear facilities – namely, spent fuel repositories – could be placed along a likely invasion route as part of a country’s defence strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as Ramberg also points out, the parallels of the deterrent, coercive or military effects of nuclear weapons and attacks on nuclear facilities are ultimately limited. The effects of nuclear accidents differ in a number of meaningful ways from those nuclear weapons detonations. For instance, even large nuclear accidents – such as the 1986 Chornobyl disaster – do not produce the fireball and blast waves that cause much of the immediate destruction following a ground burst nuclear weapon detonation. Nuclear weapons detonations also produce an electromagnetic pulse, which can disrupt and damage electrical equipment; this is not present during a nuclear accident. Comparisons between the radiation released from nuclear weapons detonations and nuclear accidents (both immediate radiation and fallout) are more difficult to draw, as in both instances the nature, extent and effects of radiation depend on a range of factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nuclear weapons and attacks on nuclear facilities also differ significantly in terms of their operational and strategic utility and significance. Nuclear weapons play a range of roles in countries’ nuclear doctrines and national security and defence planning, most of which cannot be replicated by radioactive release from a nuclear facility. For one, nuclear facilities are, generally speaking, immovable and therefore cannot be used to hold at risk a range of military, territorial or other targets of an adversary. This is further complicated by the difficulties, discussed above, in determining the scale and direction of any radioactive release from a nuclear facility. The immovability of many nuclear installations also makes them less effective for signalling – which a state may do through the deployment or removal of nuclear-armed delivery systems across its territory. As mentioned earlier, some signalling may nevertheless be possible through attacks on nuclear sites – for instance, the use of limited attacks on a suspected nuclear weapons programme to signal resolve to take military measures against the perceived threat, or an attack resulting in radioactive release to signal a willingness to escalate the conflict outside the strictly conventional realm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critically, just as attacks on nuclear infrastructure present unique psychological challenges and cross certain normative thresholds, so does the use of even low-yield nuclear weapons. Some have argued that, as a result of the non-use of nuclear weapons since 1945 and the devastation that nuclear weapons are understood to reap on society, a taboo has been established on nuclear weapons use. The breaking of this taboo and of the 80 years of non-use would cross a major normative and psychological threshold. Most of the experts that were asked about the existence of a similar taboo on attacks on nuclear facilities felt that a certain level of restraint, or even a conditional taboo on attacks that resulted in radiological release, does exist. However, they did not go as far as to suggest that the normative restraint on attacks on nuclear facilities reached that of nuclear weapons use. One expert that was interviewed also noted that for countries such as Russia – whose population is willing to accept considerable suffering for the pursuit of the state’s strategic objectives – the radiological threat of an attack on a nuclear facility would likely have limited deterrent effect. In fact, it may produce an inverse “rally around the flag” response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nuclear-facilities-on-the-axis-of-advance&quot;&gt;Nuclear Facilities on the Axis of Advance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, this paper has discussed some of the operational and strategic logic that may inform a decision to expressly target nuclear infrastructure. Yet, most militaries, in most circumstances, would not actively pursue such a target – both because of the radiological risks (and associated challenges) that such attacks pose and because of the legal prohibitions and broader normative restrictions on attacking nuclear sites. A number of military and defence experts interviewed for this paper, when asked to consider why a military may be asked to target a piece of nuclear infrastructure, stressed that they saw no justification or operational utility in deliberately targeting a nuclear object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, some of the military and defence experts consulted did assess as feasible a scenario in which a military may need to contest control of a nuclear site – or operate in its vicinity – if such an installation were to be encountered on a route of advance during a wider military operation. For instance, the CEZ, which was occupied by Russian forces in February 2022 when they crossed into Ukraine from Belarus, appears to have come under occupation primarily because it was on the route of attack for the Russian Army on its way to Kyiv. The site offers no benefit as an energy target and – relative to the ZNPP – would not have been the most effective target for the purposes of radioactive release considering its close proximity to the Belarusian border. The case of the CEZ is certainly not the first time that a nuclear installation has found itself on a military’s axis of advance. During the Vietnam war, a nuclear research reactor in Dalat ended up in contested territory and at potential risk from military hostilities, despite there being no indication that the facility was expressly targeted. The threat posed to Slovenia’s Krško nuclear power plant during the Yugoslav Army’s invasion in 1991 also does not seem to have been the result of express targeting of the facility (although overflights of the facility at low altitude by fighter aircraft were perceived as an intentional threat to the plant in subsequent accounts). As the number of nuclear power plants around the world is expected to expand in the coming decades, it will become increasingly likely that militaries will have to reluctantly contest or occupy nuclear facilities – be they power plants, fuel production facilities, or spent fuel storage sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerns over causing a nuclear accident is likely to constrain, complicate and slow a military’s operations in the vicinity of the facility. Should radioactive release occur, those challenges will of course multiply, as discussed in the section on radioactive release for area denial. As described earlier, most modern militaries have access to C-CBRN capabilities with the requisite expertise for conducting operations around facilities that may pose a hazard. However, conducting operations around a nuclear facility – or even occupying a nuclear site – is likely to require a greater number of specialised personnel than what may be available in most militaries, probably requiring operations to be predominantly carried out by unspecialised forces with some C-CBRN support. Furthermore, as already noted, the level of C-CBRN expertise, preparedness and capacity is likely to vary from country to country and may be quite low within some militaries – especially among non-specialist personnel. For instance, the fact that Russian soldiers dug trenches in contaminated soil in the CEZ during their occupation of the site suggests a certain lack of understanding within the ranks of the Russian military of best practices and standards of operation in a CBRN environment. Military activities may also pose an inadvertent risk to nuclear facilities if they include strikes – intentional or accidental – on other parts of a country’s infrastructure (for instance, the energy grid or water supply). Such strikes may not be intended to disrupt the safe operation of nuclear facilities but may nevertheless create nuclear safety risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occupation of a facility also poses a range of challenges for both military and political leadership. Ensuring the safety of an occupied facility would require extensive resources and expertise on nuclear plant operations and nuclear safety. The occupying state would face the challenge of potentially having to maintain nuclear safety in a conflict zone and all of the difficulties that this entails. Political leadership would also need to determine whether and how to manage the occupied facility under existing nuclear safety and security frameworks and who would be responsible for overseeing the operation of the facility in what may still be an active warzone. However, the risk of causing a nuclear safety incident will not always be sufficient to deter a military from contesting the area around a nuclear facility or occupying it, if a military judges that this can be done safely, if the mission is deemed critical enough, or if the threat of radioactive release is not well understood or is disregarded. This was certainly true for the Russian Army, which advanced on both the CEZ and the ZNPP despite the risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-reducing-the-risks-of-military-strikes-on-nuclear-facilities&quot;&gt;II. Reducing the Risks of Military Strikes on Nuclear Facilities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, the author has outlined some of the operational and strategic effects that militaries may pursue in attacking – or threatening to attack – nuclear infrastructure. As indicated, states may perceive a range of threats – as well as operational and strategic opportunities – that could lead them to use military force against or in the vicinity of nuclear sites. As noted in the introduction of this paper, the intention here is not to normalise the use of military force against or near nuclear installations, but to make clear the need to realistically assess the probability and nature of these risks and to prepare for dealing with them. This chapter considers a few approaches for reducing the risk of military attacks on nuclear facilities. In doing so, it examines the likely effectiveness of these approaches in responding to the various drivers of military attacks discussed earlier in this paper, as well as in mitigating against some of the likely consequences of attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risk-reduction measures must account for various trade-offs and resource limitations. Even in the most economically advanced or security-minded states, resources are not unlimited; this is likely to be especially true in the context of a broader military conflict, when already-limited sources must be allocated across a range of defence and security priorities. Furthermore, some preventive and mitigation measures may have unintended consequences that could, in fact, increase other undesirable consequences of attack or make attacks more likely. Additionally, an overly cautious approach to risk management – for instance, foregoing nuclear energy altogether out of a fear of possible military threat – may have other undesirable and unnecessary economic, environmental and political drawbacks. As such, the departure point for any risk-mitigation measures should be a realistic assessment of the precise nature and degree of risk that a given state’s nuclear infrastructure is likely to face from military threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strengthening-existing-prohibitions-norms-and-guidance&quot;&gt;Strengthening Existing Prohibitions, Norms and Guidance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine – and, arguably, before that – an important aspect of the debate on how to reduce military risks to nuclear facilities has focused on whether existing legal prohibitions on attacks are sufficient and whether and how they may be strengthened and expanded. Military and defence experts interviewed for this paper repeatedly noted that Western militaries would not attack nuclear facilities, with IHL considerations and existing restrictions on attacks under the Geneva Conventions repeatedly referenced. This awareness and commitment to existing restrictions is reassuring and suggests that these are likely to be sufficient to prevent attacks from states that are committed to respecting international law. Of course, some states may chose to disregard their IHL obligations or to find ways to justify their actions under IHL – even when such justifications are unconvincing or disingenuous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as the analysis presented in this paper has highlighted, there are instances when military force may be used against, or in the vicinity of, nuclear installations for the pursuit of legitimate military objectives. To ensure that such objectives can be pursued with minimal threat to nuclear safety, to civilians and to the environment, additional clarity and guidance on the operationalisation of existing relevant legal provisions may be useful. These may be developed by individual governments or groups of governments, or by international organisations, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross. Ensuring that these principles and their operationalisation are understood and respected at all ranks of a military force is also critical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussed, a potential scenario in which a military may find itself having to conduct operations around – or directed at – a nuclear facility is one where it encounters a nuclear site on an axis of advance and needs to contest control over or occupy the site. It is unclear to what extent various national nuclear regulators or militaries have thought through their country’s ability to carry out such operations, what procedures may have to be adopted and what stakeholders (military and civil) would need to be engaged to ensure the safe transfer of control of a nuclear site in the course of a military operation. Laying out such operational considerations should be integrated into military and civilian planning well in advance of any military operation that may involve such a scenario. Militaries would also benefit from wargaming possible scenarios in which they may be required to contest territory that hosts a nuclear facility – to develop operational options for doing so safely, assess readiness and identify challenges. For instance, one possible approach may be to quarantine the facility and cut off supply chains to any military units operating in its vicinity. Such an approach, however, must account for the need to continue to allow supplies and personnel to reach the nuclear site itself, so as to ensure its safe operation – a vulnerability which could in turn be weaponised by the military occupying the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, preparing to use force against or near nuclear installations cannot be normalised. Clear demonstrations of political commitments to existing restrictions and norms relating to attacks against nuclear facilities should be pursued to this end. As mentioned earlier, a limited taboo on attacks on nuclear facilities that result in radiological dispersal may exist or be emerging. Any such taboo should be strengthened. This can be done first and foremost by continued non-attack on facilities that may reasonably be expected to result in significant release of radioactive material, and the condemnation of any military action that presents such risks. Individual states may also wish to explicitly reiterate their own commitments to the relevant provisions of the Geneva Conventions in unilateral or multilateral statements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some have also argued that further NAAs, modelled on the India–Pakistan NAA, should be pursued. However, the relevance of the NAA as a model for future agreements is likely to be limited, due to the particular historical, political and security context in which it was concluded. The 1988 Agreement was concluded between two countries with advanced nuclear programmes; India had tested its first nuclear device 14 years earlier, while Pakistan was known to be pursuing a nuclear weapons capability at the time. The mutually perceived vulnerability of the two states, exacerbated by rising bilateral and global tensions but which had not yet escalated to armed confrontation, created the conditions for such a risk-reduction measure. A similar NAA would – of course – not be currently possible between Russia and Ukraine. An Iranian nuclear expert interviewed for this project rejected the possibility of a similar NAA in the Middle East, pointing to the perceived imbalance of vulnerability created by Israel’s undeclared nuclear weapons capability. An Israeli interviewee also rejected the possibility, arguing that Israel faces an existential threat from its regional adversaries and noting the historical propensity of regional actors – including Syria, Iraq and now Iran – to obfuscate their apparent pursuit of nuclear weapons. One possibility might be the conclusion of bilateral or multilateral NAAs between states with friendly relations – for instance, Argentina and Brazil. Such agreements might serve as an example-setting and norm-strengthening exercise; however, the practical effects of such agreements would be limited and their conclusion outside of any clear security need to do so may instead engender suspicion between parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are currently very few international standards for the safe and secure management of a nuclear facility in a warzone or under military occupation. The Seven Indispensable Pillars and Five Concrete Principles for Nuclear Safety and Security articulated by the IAEA since the start of the war in Ukraine offer a useful starting point for establishing best practices for nuclear safety and security in warzones. Yet, they ultimately fall short of offering concrete guidance and processes for nuclear safety and security in armed conflict. The technical guidance document on challenges in the application of the IAEA safety standards and nuclear security guidance during armed conflict (under development by the IAEA at the time of writing) is also expected to draw on existing IAEA guidance. The Agency’s consensus-based approach to decision-making, the need to maintain flexibility of response to address the unique challenges and needs of a given facility or attack scenario, and the general aversion of IAEA member states to any overly prescriptive standards on the operation of their nuclear facilities ultimately limit the Agency from going far beyond providing fairly high-level direction and ultimately drawing on existing nuclear safety documents. This should not, however, preclude individual states from ensuring that their nuclear regulators and operators, emergency response services and militaries have the necessary standards and operational plans in place to both respond to the threat of attack on their nuclear facilities (commensurate with the risk profile) and conduct military operations in the vicinity of nuclear sites in other countries, if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strengthening-passive-and-active-defences&quot;&gt;Strengthening Passive and Active Defences&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One option for reducing the risks of military strikes against nuclear sites may be to strengthen the physical protections of the facilities in question. Increased passive defences could help to reduce the likelihood of damage to systems and equipment – whether intentional or accidental – while also limiting the spread of toxic material should any be released. Decreasing the degree of damage an attacking state may be able to inflict on a given target (or increasing the costs of inflicting meaningful damage) may also act as a disincentive for attacking forces. This is likely to be particularly true when attacks on other, softer, targets may produce similar effects – for example, in instances of attacks carried out for the purpose of disrupting a country’s energy production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most nuclear power plants operating today are already protected by reinforced concrete containment structures, making them challenging, although certainly not impossible, to penetrate. Spent fuel storage normally also benefits from reinforced concrete containment and can withstand substantial force. More broadly, the IAEA requires national regulators to ensure that facilities across the nuclear fuel cycle, including conversion and enrichment sites, benefit from containment structures and other safety measures that are appropriate for a range of assessed risks. Such assessments are normally completed as part of the Design Basis Threat (DBT) process, which requires states to account for such threats as severe weather (including floods and strong winds) as well as terrorist attacks. Threats that fall outside what a nuclear regulator can reasonably be expected to account for are classed as beyond-DBT threats and are generally the responsibility of the state. This would include military attacks and occupation of facilities. Since the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, the need to update IAEA requirements and guides to account for the military threat has been the subject of considerable debate within expert and regulatory communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Constructing thicker containment structures over existing reactors that already benefit from reinforced containment would be a resource-intensive undertaking which would be incommensurate with the risk of an accidental strike and ineffective against an adversary determined to penetrate the reactor core to release radioactive material. Options for strengthening protections of spent fuel may include the construction of additional containment structures, moving dry spent fuel casks inside specially designed facilities (in instances where casks are currently stored outside) or moving storage underground. Conversion and enrichment facilities may also be moved underground or under reinforced containment structures if deemed necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all these cases, additional physical protection would be subject to cost–benefit considerations and would be dependent on the extent and nature of the threat faced by a given state. For instance, it may be reasonable to expect that Ukraine or even Finland would expend the necessary resources to strengthen the containment structures around their wet spent fuel storage facilities to withstand a determined large-scale kinetic strike (if current structures were assessed to be insufficient), considering the Russian threat. Similar measures would seem excessive for Canadian or UK spent fuel storage facilities, which are likely at more significant risk from cyber attack than missile strikes. Beyond-DBT and broader national-level risk assessments must therefore take into account the likelihood of potential military attacks on their nuclear sites by hostile states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the nuclear facilities themselves, states may consider strengthening the physical protections around auxiliary systems and equipment that ensure the safe operation of nuclear facilities and which do not normally benefit from similar levels of protection. As discussed earlier in the paper, in case of a military conflict, an adversary is likely to target this auxiliary infrastructure as part of a campaign to disrupt energy production and distribution. This may include infrastructure for the supply of water to the facility (such as water pipes and pumps) and parts of the power grid supplying and offloading electricity to nuclear plants and substations – namely, power lines and substations. However, such an approach is also not a panacea against a determined attacker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s experience of improving physical protections of electrical substations is instructive. The country has adopted a three-tier approach to the protection of CNI. Varying degrees of protection are offered to facilities depending on the assessed risk profile and size of the potential target, with the use of sandbags, gabions and netting around transformers to protect equipment from UAV attacks, and the construction of T-walls and other cement structures around individual transformers and whole substations to provide defence against missile attack. However, Ukraine’s experience also demonstrates the limits of this approach. The construction of passive defences is likely to be most effective in advance of a war, as such efforts run up against a number of challenges during an active conflict. First, defences – particularly large cement structures – can become costly to construct when resources are likely to already be tight. Resource constraints have reportedly slowed – and, in some instances, halted – Ukrainian construction of larger concrete structures around substations. Second, construction of such defences also takes time and is quite conspicuous, easily detected by an adversary’s reconnaissance. Defences can be destroyed before they are ever completed. Third, adversaries learn to adapt their methods of attack to counter constructed defences. In Ukraine, Russia has reportedly started fuelling its missiles with metal-corroding fuel to penetrate the passive missile defences the Ukrainians built around their substations. Finally, as with the containment structures around nuclear reactors, reinforced concrete structures will only delay and complicate – but not stop – the efforts of a determined adversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the perception that a site is not particularly vulnerable, or that an attack is unlikely to result in significant release of hazardous material, may, in fact, increase the likelihood of it being targeted in some instances. For example, a state may feel that – due to the presence of a reinforced containment structure – it can safely carry out UAV strikes against a nuclear reactor, for instance, to force the facility to shut down and thus stop generating power or to signal resolve to use military force against a suspected proliferation threat. Militaries may also generally be less worried about operating around facilities they perceive to be well-protected, possibly increasing the risk of military force being used near nuclear sites. Such action does, of course, run a high risk of miscalculation and may ultimately result in catastrophic effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;States may also be more willing to carry out counterproliferation attacks against sites which they do not believe pose a serious risk of toxic material release. For example, in conversation with the author, David Deptula – who was the principal attack planner for Operation Desert Storm during the Gulf War, which included attacks on Iraq’s Al-Tuwaitha complex – noted that considerations around the potential for the spread of radioactive material were a factor in targeting decisions. The operation ultimately went ahead, as the risk was deemed to be low because the facility was surrounded by a large sand berm. An Israeli nuclear expert interviewed for the paper, when asked about whether the risk of radioactive release from Iranian nuclear facilities would be likely to be factored into Israeli decision-making on whether to carry out military strikes against Iranian sites, confirmed that such consequences would likely be considered. However, they also noted that – in the case of strikes on enrichment facilities – the threat would be primarily chemical, not radiological, and the fact that some of the sites are underground and most are away from population centres would mean that the actual threat to civilians would be low – seemingly suggesting that this would likely not act as a major inhibitor to a decision to attack. Similarly, states may be incentivised to increase the potential health or political consequences of an attack – for instance, by introducing highly radioactive material into a facility under threat of attack – as a way of deterring attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, any increased passive defence of facilities may be combined with active defence efforts to improve effectiveness against attack. Active defence may include a combination of an increased military ground presence in the vicinity of key sites (either permanent or deployed in response to an active threat) and the deployment of air defence systems. Ground forces must include a meaningful C-CBRN presence and specialised forces trained to operate in complex environments – ideally, in sufficient numbers to not only provide advice to the units that may have to defend the plant but to play a leading role in any defensive operation. The same should be true for any military forces expecting to have to advance on territory where nuclear facilities and material may be present. As has been reiterated throughout this paper, military operations directed at or in the vicinity of nuclear installations should not be normalised; however, militaries need to be prepared to contest legitimate military objectives in the vicinity of nuclear installations in a way that minimises the risk of causing a nuclear safety incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air defence systems are likely to be the most effective active defence measure that a country can take to defend its nuclear sites. They are generally deployed near nuclear facilities by states likely to be at particularly acute risk of strikes on their nuclear infrastructure. Calls for additional Patriot systems and the perception that this is the only way to ensure the protection of the country’s nuclear facilities came up repeatedly in the author’s interviews with nuclear operators and policymakers in Ukraine. However, the provision of effective air defence for nuclear facilities is not a panacea and must consider a number of factors. Air defence systems are costly to field and limited in number, even for well-resourced militaries. As such, other potential targets – such as major population centres, key military assets and other CNI – may be prioritised over nuclear sites for air defence allocation, particularly if large-scale radioactive release from an attacked facility is deemed unlikely. Furthermore, providing point defence for individual facilities is complicated by the fact that a facility might be at risk from a variety of threats, which may include guided or unguided systems and everything from ballistic missiles to low-altitude cruise missiles and UAVs. Each threat requires different air defence capabilities. As such, effective air defence for nuclear facilities needs to be layered and distributed and is therefore likely simply to form part of a country’s broader air defence system. Ultimately, as with containment structures, air defence is not a guaranteed solution for defending against a determined adversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, as with increased passive protection, strengthening the active defence of a nuclear facility may risk having a counterproductive effect by increasing the likelihood that the site is targeted or that threats of attack may be used for deterrent or coercive purposes. Placing military personnel or equipment in the vicinity of a nuclear site for defence of the facility may draw fire on those positions, thereby also putting the safety of the facility at risk. States may also argue that the placement of military units or systems near a nuclear site by an adversary is intended to grant protection to the military assets, rather than the nuclear infrastructure – whether or not that is actually the case. The argument might then be made that the facility has lost its protections under the Geneva Conventions. This would be an erroneous reading of international law if an attack on the facility is expected to result in significant harm to civilian populations, yet this would likely not stop a determined attacker from making the argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;redundancy-and-distribution&quot;&gt;Redundancy and Distribution&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minimising the effects – and, by extension, the incentives – of attacks on nuclear facilities may be achieved by increasing redundancy in systems and distributing potential targets. Increasing the number of targets that need to be destroyed or seriously damaged for an attacking state to achieve a desired effect may help to disincentivise attacks on nuclear sites by tilting the cost–benefit calculus for the attacking state. Not only does the attacking state need to expend greater resources for a given attack, but also smaller facilities can be reconstructed quicker than larger ones and redundant systems can continue operating by relying on parts of the system that escaped attack. Furthermore, the scale of force needed to eliminate a highly redundant and distributed system poses a greater risk of the conflict escalating beyond what may be an acceptable threshold for the attacking state than a single strike on a centralised facility. Such an approach is likely to be particularly effective against military strikes carried out for counterproliferation or energy disruption purposes, when the intention is to have an impact on a programme or system as a whole, rather than to release (or threaten release of) toxic material – which can conceivably be achieved by attacking a single site. The practical challenges and escalatory risks of using military force to meaningfully degrade the Iranian nuclear programme, as well as the system-wide assault on Ukraine’s energy system (see Box 3), demonstrate the defensive value of decentralisation and redundancy well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-3-decentralisation-and-redundancy-of-ukraines-energy-grid&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 3. Decentralisation and Redundancy of Ukraine’s Energy Grid&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In response to Russia’s attacks on the country’s energy grid since the start of the full-scale invasion, the need to decentralise Ukraine’s energy system has become abundantly clear and is being prioritised. The use of emergency generators by businesses and private citizens has been one example of decentralisation – an organic adaptation by Ukrainian society to the disruption of the main energy system. But top-down initiatives to speed up decentralisation are also in place. The Ukrainian government is offering incentives to civilians, businesses and housing cooperatives for the installation of small-capacity local power generation. The US has also been working with municipalities across Ukraine to provide small and medium gas-powered cogeneration units.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;As the Ukrainian grid is reconstructed, the focus appears to be on the construction of greater numbers of smaller capacity energy generation systems. The greater integration of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind into the Ukrainian grid is also being pursued, both to meet European green energy generation standards and to increase resilience in the grid, which has historically relied heavily on nuclear power and – to a lesser extent – coal, gas and oil. Independent experts have also stressed the benefits of diversification and decentralisation for ensuring the resilience of Ukraine’s energy grid, through the introduction of microgrids, small modular gas turbines and renewable energy sources (solar and wind) as well as the use of batteries for energy storage.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relatively large generating capacity of nuclear power plants contributes to the centralisation – and therefore decreases redundancy – of an electrical grid. As mentioned earlier in this paper, this may make nuclear plants particularly attractive targets for incapacitation by an adversary aiming to disrupt energy production. Decentralisation in nuclear energy generation could be achieved by eventually phasing out traditional gigawatt-scale nuclear power plants in favour of the deployment of small modular reactors (SMRs). SMRs have generating capacities of less than 300 megawatts and are physically smaller in size. They may therefore be used to establish more decentralised grids while also being easier to build physical protections around or even build underground. SMRs can be designed to operate with accident tolerant fuels and to be passively cooled, meaning they would not require electricity to pump water for fuel cooling (although some non-SMR reactors may also be able to integrate similar features in their designs). However, the transition from traditional gigawatt reactors to SMRs will take time. SMR technology has yet to be deployed and many of today’s operational large reactors are due to continue operation for several decades, with many more being constructed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, while the decentralisation of nuclear programmes may decrease some risks of military strikes, it may exacerbate others. A greater number of smaller nuclear facilities distributed across a country might provide a larger target set for states that mean to intentionally target nuclear facilities – for instance, for area denial or coercive/deterrent purposes. It may also increase the likelihood of militaries coming into contact with a nuclear facility in the course of an operation, thereby exacerbating risks of unintentional damage to nuclear infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;whole-of-society-resilience&quot;&gt;Whole-of-Society Resilience&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important part of the effort to defend against, disincentivise and mitigate the consequences of attacks and threats of attack on nuclear facilities should be the strengthening of whole-of-society resilience against such attacks and threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such lines of effort can help to reduce the effects – and, by extension, some of the incentives – of military strikes on nuclear facilities across most of the drivers discussed in this paper. However, they are likely to have the greatest impact on reducing the effectiveness and consequences of attacks aimed at inciting public and political anxiety and/or degrading public and leadership morale – namely, energy disruption and coercive attacks or threats of attack. As discussed earlier, while disruption of nuclear energy generation may in part be intended to undermine military production as one of its objectives, it is more often than not meant to degrade the morale of the civilian population by direct denial of reliable energy and disruption of industrial and economic activity. The use of attacks – or threats of attack – for deterrent and coercive purposes may be primarily targeted at a country’s leadership; yet, the latter is likely to be influenced by public fears and demands (at least in a democracy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasing resilience within the population for dealing with the consequences of attacks on nuclear sites, or nuclear safety incidents more generally, may entail a few different lines of effort. This can include broader dissemination among the general population, local governments and emergency responders of information on dealing with the immediate risks of low-level radiation and chemical hazards (including sheltering in place without forced ventilation and simple decontamination measures such as the removal of contaminated clothing). Communities should also be prepared to deal with widespread and prolonged energy disruption, potentially with limited support from central government if the disruption is widespread across a country. This may include ensuring that communities – as well as individual households and businesses, where logistically feasible – are equipped with independent power generation and water sanitation capabilities. Promoting basic nuclear safety education – among both the public and political decision-makers – might help to combat susceptibility to panic and misinformed responses and improve resilience to the threat. It may also be appropriate to expand the number of medical service providers in a country that are trained to deal with large-scale radiological dispersal, to ensure that medical facilities outside of just specialised centres are able to provide support in case of a large emergency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with other risk-mitigation measures, it is important to ensure that public awareness-raising, preparedness and resilience efforts are commensurate with the actual risk faced by a state. Otherwise, one runs the risk of alarmism, inciting unnecessary anxiety among the population. This is likely to result in undesirable consequences, as discussed earlier in this paper. However, as Brooke Rogers has noted, communication of risks to the public need not necessarily result in a panicked public response and fears of the potential for the latter should not preclude efforts to responsibly and thoughtfully engage with the public on this subject. Avoiding alarmism and panic among the population requires the careful formulation of risk-communication strategies. As others have noted elsewhere, risk communication on CBRN threats must prioritise establishing trust between government and the public. This requires the formulation of a clear and unified message, an honest articulation of both what is known andwhat remains unknown, and actionable instructions on what measures to take. Ensuring that external-facing versions of national-level risk assessments – such as the UK’s National Risk Register – are made available and socialised in condensed and easily-digestible formats to the general population will help to socialise the risks at an appropriate level. To ensure effectiveness, communication on potential nuclear safety or energy disruption risks should not be restricted to crisis scenarios. Thoughtfully developed communication strategies should allow governments to sensitise populations to the nature of the risk and to appropriate risk-mitigation strategies at various stages – not just at the time of an acute crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another key aspect of raising societal resilience should be efforts to counter disinformation and misinformation which may be used to weaponise future nuclear safety incidents. Such efforts are particularly important in response to the rising prevalence of the broader weaponisation of disinformation by countries such as Russia and China. The unintentional spread of misinformation can have equally pernicious effects. For instance, frequent comparisons in media – and even sometimes by political leadership – between possible worst-case scenarios at the ZNPP and the 1986 Chornobyl accident are inaccurate and risk inciting panic among the general public and decision-makers. Such reactions are highly detrimental to sensible policymaking, as they grant Russia outsized leverage to practise extortion by threatening the facility’s safety. Similar disinformation and misinformation tactics might be leveraged to exacerbate the deterrent and coercive impact of threats against nuclear facilities in other contexts – for instance, in a potential future conflict between China and Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has brought public and policy discussion on the risks that military activity poses to nuclear installations to the fore. Ukraine’s case is, in many ways, unique. However, nuclear installations have been targets of military attack throughout the history of nuclear weapons and nuclear energy; they are likely to face similar risks in the future. While the use of military force against or in the vicinity of nuclear installations should not be normalised, considering the operational and strategic logic behind such military activity – as well as its likely consequences – can help political and military leadership prepare to defend against related threats and mitigate risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has aimed to contribute to ongoing efforts on the topic of nuclear safety in armed conflict by improving understanding of the strategic and operational drivers for the use of military force against and near nuclear installations. These include: counterproliferation; energy disruption; area denial; efforts to generate escalatory, coercive and deterrent effects; and military operations around or at a nuclear facility encountered on the axis of advance. As the number of nuclear installations around the world is expected to grow, militaries, national and international policymakers and regulators need to consider the possibility that militaries may increasingly run the risk of encountering and having to operate or contest control of nuclear sites in the course of military operations. Militaries that are determined to respect the principles of IHL and the safety of civilians and the environment more broadly, but which may find themselves in such situations, should have the necessary guidance and tools to pursue legitimate military objectives safely. At the same time, countries should be prepared to protect and ensure the nuclear safety of nuclear installations that may be targeted by states that do not share a similar respect for IHL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper has put forward a number of considerations and recommendations that may be helpful to informing ongoing efforts within multilateral organisations, among policymakers and in militaries for reducing the risks that military activity may pose to nuclear installations. These include: identifying opportunities to strengthen effective implementation of existing restrictions on attacks on nuclear facilities and reiterating political commitments to respecting these restrictions; considering options for passive and active defence of facilities and auxiliary systems during active conflict, including through the deployment of layered and distributed air defence and specialised C-CBRN ground capabilities; increasing redundancy and decentralisation of nuclear installations and related networks; and improving whole-of-society resilience to nuclear safety incidents, including through efforts to raise levels of emergency preparedness, risk awareness and education on nuclear safety among the public and political leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these risk-mitigation measures, of course, has to compete for limited resources, especially in the instance of an ongoing military conflict. Each also needs to account for unintended consequences, which may, in fact, increase the likelihood and consequences of attacks on nuclear sites in some instances. Thoughtful management of risk and corresponding trade-offs requires an understanding of the motivations for which an adversary may attack a given facility, to appropriately and effectively address the incentives for a potential attack. Considering which consequences of an attack are of greatest concern and the best approaches to mitigate them also helps with the prioritisation of risk-management efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

Losing MCC’s capabilities cedes ground to China.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) notified the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) that it would “shutter” the agency, instructing the MCC to terminate all its compact and threshold agreements with partner countries, terminate all contracts, and fire or retire its staff within 90 days. While this may seem aligned with President Trump’s executive order (EO) pausing U.S. international assistance to reevaluate aid effectiveness, the MCC does foreign investment, not foreign aid. Instead of shuttering, the administration can easily reform the MCC to meet its goals and eliminate wasteful spending. But shuttering the MCC will hinder—not help—better aligning investment with American interests and cost more than it saves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MCC’s ability to make deals via bilateral country compacts is unique in the U.S. government and ideal for advancing administration goals. The MCC method of developing investment packages provides tremendous political leverage with governments, and the programs have solid evidence of effectiveness. Terminating the MCC’s compacts and programs will provide China and other U.S. adversaries diplomatic and economic wins while leaving blighted, half-built infrastructure scarring both the landscape and minds of former U.S. partner countries and their citizens for a generation. If the Trump administration wants to reorganize and eliminate the MCC as an independent agency, at a minimum, it should transfer its capabilities and personnel, especially in blended finance, to the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) and allow it to administer existing compacts, agreements, and contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DFC already struggles to process its current transaction workload, and it lacks the ability to commit to contractually obligated disbursements. Eliminating the MCC without transferring its capabilities and qualified personnel will do the opposite of derisking engagement with developing countries and create unnecessary hardship and resentment, especially given how much effort developing countries invest in getting an MCC compact. Rather than shuttering the MCC, the administration has an opportunity to reassess the role of the agency in advancing an “America First” agenda and further moving international development assistance away from just “gifting” funds. To maximize the MCC’s value, the Trump administration should enhance its mission under the existing charter to better fit America First priorities by building on the agency’s core strengths—country ownership, conditional and performance-based funding, and a rigorous, evidence-driven model—while addressing procedural constraints that limit its agility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The administration can modify the MCC’s program parameters to prioritize investments in the national interest by adjusting the agency’s long compact development timelines, limited field presence, and risk aversion, all of which reduce its responsiveness and limit its untapped potential to engage with the private sector, particularly American businesses. These barriers, largely due to the complexity of the MCC’s current procurement process and timeline, can be addressed mostly without significant changes to its legislative charter. At the same time, the administration should work with Congress to update the charter for the modern era, including adding a provision to buy more American goods and services. Targeted reforms to improve the compact and threshold program development process, increase flexibility, shorten feedback loops, and modernize measurement tools would amplify the MCC’s value, identify opportunities for U.S. investment, and increase collaboration with co-financiers without compromising its credibility in some of the regions of the world most vital to American interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the first Trump administration selected many of the current MCC compact countries precisely for their strategic importance. The United States has spent years courting Nepal away from China’s orbit, and abandoning the country now would irreparably harm the United States’ reputation in the fraught neighborhood between China and India. Cote d’Ivoire provides one of the last remaining drone bases in Africa to counter ISIS. The Pacific Island states of Kiribati and the Solomon Islands lie astride trade routes and the undersea cables powering the digital economy; deserting them would allow China to ring-fence a close U.S. ally, Australia. Zambia anchors part of the critical Lobito Corridor for mines and minerals in Central and Southern Africa. Instead of abruptly terminating compacts and agreements that the first Trump and other administrations carefully put in place, this administration can preserve both diplomatic and financial capital with targeted reforms at the MCC or by transferring some of its specific capabilities to the DFC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-unique-value-of-the-mcc&quot;&gt;The Unique Value of the MCC&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MCC takes a unique approach that focuses on poverty reduction by creating economic growth through an evidence-based approach. Unlike other development organizations, the MCC executes a rigorous and transparent selection process for potential partner governments, providing eligibility-based funding to large-scale infrastructure or other high-priority growth sectors, all codeveloped and codified in a “compact” with recipient countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This government-to-government collaborative model directly involves local communities in project planning and execution, fostering national ownership (and therefore sustainability) of the projects while providing the United States with high levels of diplomatic leverage and influence. Future assistance and investment are always contingent on the terms in the compact and on a country’s implementation and policy performance. The time-bound nature of compacts, with clear start and end dates, also prevents them from becoming self-perpetuating, never-ending obligations. Because of this co-development process and commitment to understanding recipient country needs built around clear milestones, the MCC has a global reputation for credibility and impact in the countries where it has operated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MCC’s data- and evidence-driven programs focus on measurable outcomes, transparency, and long-term impact. The agency’s structure, unencumbered by mandates, budgetary line items, and reporting requirements, should allow the MCC to move efficiently while maintaining greater maneuverability. In practice, however, the MCC has a single-track, rigid approach to compact development, with a heavily defined process resulting in a three-to-five-year preparation period. The administration might modify this self-imposed process and create a dual-track approach that provides greater diplomatic leverage, ensuring that programs are developed and agreed upon in an accelerated fashion (e.g., 90–180 days) in direct alignment with U.S. geopolitical interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;immediate-reforms&quot;&gt;Immediate Reforms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MCC has significant room to evolve within its existing legislative charter and mandate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the Trump administration can revise the MCC’s internal processes for program development and the application and interpretation of scorecard metrics—adjusting or adding additional metrics more focused on America First factors (e.g., critical supply chains, minerals, and return on investment, or ROI) while retaining metrics for effective governance and management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do so, the MCC should prioritize flexibility, agility, and diplomatic leverage by adapting proven methods from the private sector for rapidly developing agreements and programs (e.g., “lean startup” methodology), which could shrink program development and due diligence in specific cases from three to five years to 90–180 days (or less).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the MCC’s flexible, data-driven model that supports country-led development has earned bipartisan trust in Congress, it has untapped potential to enhance U.S. diplomatic influence in a post-USAID era and in active collaboration with the DFC. The credibility of the MCC’s selection process reliably signals U.S. support to allies and emerging partners, and the compact model has the potential to retain greater diplomatic leverage because of its inherently contingent nature, wherein the agency can include provisions within the compact linked to diplomatic priorities but only if compacts are agreed upon within the life of a presidential administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of these reforms, the Trump administration can make the MCC engage the U.S. private sector earlier in compact development to live up to Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s call to make America more prosperous. Likewise, the MCC can also resolve policy-level decisions around scoring methodologies, compact allocation, or internal staffing and procurement flexibility within the agency’s current framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the Trump administration can adjust how the MCC evaluates which projects it funds by integrating national security or commercial impact into its economic rate of return (ERR) analysis. It can also modify the weighting or structure of scorecards, including the addition of a dual-track system, allowing simpler, more easily developed and verified programs to proceed while more complex programs are being finalized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the Trump administration should continue to grow its focus on hard infrastructure investment and broaden the structure of its sector-specific or corridor-based regional initiatives to include more sectors that align with America First priorities, such as developing natural resources, which the Biden administration effectively excluded from consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, the MCC should become the “investment origination and project preparation arm” of the DFC to create deals and reduce bottlenecks for U.S. strategic interests. This would require effective coordination, including the formation of joint DFC-MCC deal teams and private sector opportunity analysis to pick sectors with the most investment potential. It would also require countries to commit to further reforms or to facilitate U.S. investments. In this context, the DFC should use the MCC to build the trust and relationships necessary to cocreate more sustainable investments in these countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new approach to cocreating compacts would also allow for strategic alignment among several U.S. government entities looking for greater U.S. strategic investment globally. For example, the MCC, DFC, and Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM Bank) could collaborate on large-scale infrastructure projects. The MCC could facilitate enabling institutional and policy elements as well as initial investment analysis to enhance the DFC’s returns and ability to engage in a project based on its model. Further, given that the MCC can grant monies, it could take a portion of the capital stack of a mezzanine financing structure and absorb the pieces that do not meet the DFC’s ROI requirements, thereby allowing a structured trade project to proceed. The EXIM Bank could help crowd in U.S. companies with their financing supported by both the MCC’s grants and the DFC’s capital. While narrower in scope and focus from traditional compacts, this would also enable less complex compact design through a collaborative one-stop shop for financing and investing, improving America’s ability to counter competitors already aggressively investing in projects. Ultimately, this could easily lead to the merging of the DFC and MCC, in whole or in part, saving money and improving coordination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifth, the MCC should stop shying away from “third compacts.” Congressional stakeholders in the past have sought to limit the executive by capping MCC compacts to one or two per country. While the intent of not continuing failed investments should continue, the MCC should create standards for countries seeking a third compact. These criteria would allow continued engagement with countries that the president has decided provide a strong economic and strategic rationale for ongoing U.S. commercial engagement. This would also enable the MCC to better support the DFC, leveraging transactions for investment opportunities and deal origination on the ground and securing U.S. interests in strategic sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last, MCC leadership must foster a culture that supports calculated risk-taking. Risk aversion is deeply embedded in the MCC’s structure and culture, which constrains its ability to engage in more complex environments, larger-scale projects, or investments in strategic sectors. While individual staff may be willing to take bigger risks, the institutional culture prioritizes caution, fearing failure and reputational damage. The transformative, high-impact economic growth outcomes and projects most likely to provide political leverage will be rare if MCC leadership remains confined to low-risk environments. The MCC should focus on building a portfolio of viable and attractive investments, in partnership with the DFC, that advance U.S. strategic goals and create economic opportunity in MCC countries for both local and U.S. interests (including infrastructure investment, trade, supply chain security, market development, and employment).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;structural-reforms&quot;&gt;Structural Reforms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certain structural shifts would require congressional authorization, starting with expanding the pool of eligible countries. Under current law, the MCC can only operate in low- and lower-middle-income countries, limiting its reach and constricting its ability to coordinate with the DFC, which uses different eligibility criteria. In addition, creating a statutory national security waiver—allowing the MCC to work in countries that may not meet traditional governance benchmarks but that serve critical U.S. interests—would also require congressional approval. Congress should also consider expanding the MCC’s core financing model beyond grants to add blended finance options, ideally aligned with DFC mechanisms. Likewise, extending compact timelines beyond the current five-year structure would add administrative flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;selection-process&quot;&gt;Selection Process&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MCC’s country selection process should undergo significant changes to align with U.S. strategic interests to (1) address great power competition, (2) better align with U.S. economic interests, and (3) address critical regional supply chains. Much of this can be done without legislative changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better address great power competition and U.S. economic interests, the MCC should enhance its selection metrics. Historically, the MCC’s selection process emphasized “hard hurdles” like governance and corruption. The MCC should augment its metrics to incorporate new indicators that capture the growing importance of sectors like digital infrastructure, critical minerals, and critical supply chains for goods such as technology, pharmaceuticals, and natural resources. This would enable engagement with the U.S. private sector and international allies to help MCC countries improve their economic position and governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Congress could allow for a national security waiver that allows the MCC to partner with countries where projects have the ability to meet U.S. strategic interests despite scorecard shortcomings. In parallel, implementing a dual-tiered scorecard system, with a “gold status” for countries with strong governance and a “bronze status” for those that may not meet all criteria but hold strategic significance, would allow the MCC to extend support without compromising on governance standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States’ foreign policy challenges and interests increasingly cross borders. The MCC can help protect multi-country strategic supply chains by using some of its money for regional, not country-to-country, grants. Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) increasingly seek regional agreements to align their economic priorities with global demands in sectors like mining, digital infrastructure, energy, agriculture, pharmaceuticals, and ports—industries driving development and central to global supply chains and U.S. strategic interests. Focusing on interconnected programs—like the one mirroring the Lobito Corridor to better connect resources in Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Zambia to U.S. markets—would unlock commercial opportunity. Doing so requires Congress to revise eligibility criteria and the MCC to revise its selection criteria so that projects can be implemented in strategic sectors. The MCC’s current approach to regional compacts, however, suffers from several execution weaknesses. It should learn from these lessons and improve its ability to deploy regional compacts to support cross-border investments and transactions. For example, rather than create cumbersome and complex administrative arrangements through a full regional compact, the MCC could use the Zambia compact to support the Lobito Corridor through cross-border investments in countries that do not meet MCC criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;measuring-return-on-investment&quot;&gt;Measuring Return on Investment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration should assess the economic benefits of projects from both the perspective of the partner countries and the United States. Currently, the MCC primarily employs ERRs to compare a project’s benefits to its costs, requiring a minimum 10 percent threshold for investment. The MCC should develop a complementary measure of ROI for the United States to demonstrate how the MCC aligns with partner-country growth and with U.S. strategic and economic interests. This could include metrics like expanded access for U.S. firms, strengthened supply chains, and increased geopolitical leverage. The MCC should convene private and public sector economists to design an updated ROI formula that aligns with the administration’s “safer, stronger, more prosperous” pillars. Integrating an American ROI framework would align with the MCC’s commitment to ensuring that U.S. taxpayers receive a substantial ROI in international development and help the agency better communicate its value to the American people and their elected representatives in Congress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;involving-the-private-sector&quot;&gt;Involving the Private Sector&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Integrating the U.S. private sector earlier and more frequently into development projects, such as during geographic selection and design, would better align initiatives with U.S. strategic goals and local needs. Engaging U.S. small businesses offers specific value, as they often create scalable business models and serve as conduits for innovation and investment from global technology companies. Focusing on U.S. strengths, particularly in technology and innovation, by collaborating with U.S. small businesses and tech giants like Google, Amazon Web Services, Visa, MasterCard, Cisco, and Intel can drive technological advancement in developing nations while generating employment opportunities in the United States and in local economies. Leveraging corporate soft power, particularly in promoting meritocracy, can enhance global influence and strengthen strategic partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure the involvement of U.S. private sector interests in the long-term success of development projects, partnerships and grants should be structured to require crowding in follow-on investments from companies and investors. Adopting public-private partnership (PPPs) models (e.g., build-operate-transfer, leases, and concessions) can be highly effective, as they involve private entities in financing, constructing, and operating infrastructure and other economic assets for a specified period before transferring ownership, ensuring a balance of interests between the public and private sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enhancing coordination between government agencies, the MCC, and the private sector is essential for streamlining project implementation, addressing regulatory challenges, and crowding in blended finance. Educating U.S. companies about international bidding processes and involving them early to help shape projects can ensure they can effectively bid, offering better value and driving competition. Early collaboration with U.S. industry associations (e.g., chambers of commerce and trade associations) would create platforms for gathering feedback and tailoring MCC projects to better align with market objectives. Adjusting project criteria and speeding up development processes will help attract private investment and align funding with the private sector’s need for quicker returns on investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;procurement-reform-life-cycle-costs-and-buying-american&quot;&gt;Procurement Reform, Life-Cycle Costs, and Buying American&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Partner governments often prefer working with U.S. firms but are constrained by procurement rules or a lack of early engagement. A soft “Buy American” preference, with set-aside criteria for American small businesses, modeled after existing practices in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), could increase U.S. participation without undermining competition or local capacity building. Leveraging tools like non-reimbursable grants could de-risk investments, reduce financial burdens on partner countries, and further incentivize U.S. companies, advancing U.S. strategic and economic interests while preserving the MCC’s commitment to high standards and locally owned development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MCC should also address the inefficiencies stemming from the inherently distributed nature of procurement within individual Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) programs. Instead, the MCC should publish a consolidated business forecast for all MCA projects and house it prominently on its website to improve transparency and make opportunities more accessible, especially for American firms. Complementing procurement reform, the MCC should complete its transition to life-cycle cost analysis across its programs. This would move procurement beyond upfront pricing to consider the total cost of ownership, including maintenance, energy use, and long-term performance while avoiding short-term decisions that lead to unsustainable or low-quality infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lessons-learned-for-broader-international-development&quot;&gt;Lessons Learned for Broader International Development&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;apolitical-compact-with-local-buy-in-and-cocreation&quot;&gt;Apolitical Compact with Local Buy-In and Cocreation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than imposing predesigned U.S. programs, the MCC collaborates with partner countries from the outset to jointly identify development priorities, design interventions, and set measurable goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MCC’s use of time-bound, apolitical compacts that are cocreated with partner governments offers a strong model for broader U.S. development efforts. These agreements are intentionally insulated from short-term political pressures, allowing development investments to remain focused on evidence-based priorities rather than shifting political agendas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cocreation fosters strong local ownership, ensuring that investments align with national priorities and address context-specific challenges. Positioning governments as active participants and not passive recipients makes them more likely to contribute their own resources and remain committed to implementation after U.S. involvement ends. As a result, the United States generates diplomatic leverage to directly counter the influence of China’s Belt and Road Initiative. This model offers a blueprint for other development agencies to develop projects embedded in local systems that will yield lasting impacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;intra--and-interagency-coordination-with-the-dfc-and-other-us-government-entities&quot;&gt;Intra- and Interagency Coordination with the DFC and Other U.S. Government Entities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Central coordination, posting, and reporting systems across agencies would increase transparency, efficiency, and private sector engagement. It is critical to include the DFC in the early stages of compact design and scoping to ensure alignment of strategic and investment priorities. This system would create a competitive market for development contracting by allowing local and international firms to see what projects are open for bidding through a centralized business forecast spanning the whole international development sector, including the Department of State, MCC, EXIM, DFC, and the Trade and Development Agency. This approach lowers barriers to entry and ensures greater predictability across projects, improving cost-effectiveness and reducing opportunities for opaque contracting practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;blended-finance&quot;&gt;Blended Finance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blended finance—combining public, private, and philanthropic capital to fund development and stimulate investment—offers the potential to scale the MCC’s impact and attract private investment and philanthropy. However, blended finance has remained relatively niche, and efforts to scale it have fallen short because of the highly bespoke nature of blended finance transactions to date. Scale requires standardization, but what works for philanthropic actors, driven by mission and risk tolerance, rarely aligns with the needs of commercial investors, who operate with different timelines, risk thresholds, and expectations for returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MCC and the U.S. government could make better use of blended finance by addressing several cultural, procedural, and partnership barriers. Culturally, the U.S. government is accustomed to being the rule-maker, not the rule-taker, when it comes to financing deals. This, combined with desired requirements from other donors and investors, has kept blended finance models bespoke and limited in scale. Achieving scale requires a move toward standardization. The U.S. government and MCC should leverage their convening power to bring interested parties together and set standards, aiming for a “HUD-1 for blended finance,” with standard terms applicable to multiple transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, the MCC could play a convening and standardizing role in the use of concessional finance transactions, including zero-interest loans and reimbursable grants. Right now, multiple entities, including the DFC and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, have different rules on the use of these forms of concessional finance. The MCC could lead the charge, both within the U.S. government and with allied governments, to conduct a rapid review of the MCC’s own rules, the FAR, and related rules and regulations with foreign governments and large philanthropic donors to identify barriers and make appropriate recommendations. The MCC could also lead the charge in accelerating coordination with donor-advised funds (DAFs), a growing pool of philanthropic capital relatively untouched for blended finance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MCC should embrace a more flexible “parallel play” approach, where public and private entities operate alongside one another, each bringing their comparative advantage to a shared objective. By co-creating tailored financial solutions on a case-by-case basis, the MCC can better mobilize private capital without slowing deal-making or compromising its development mandate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the MCC evolves to look at how to counter China and other malign actors, it will increasingly need to take a regional view. The MCC should develop a systematic way of working with regional development banks at scale, as they rapidly add capacity without adding cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;prerequisites-for-commercial-investment&quot;&gt;Prerequisites for Commercial Investment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large-scale development projects, especially infrastructure with national security implications (e.g., an Arctic port requiring radar systems), or those that require having foundational infrastructure in place (e.g., roads, electricity, subsea cables, and other enablers) are often too risky and costly for commercial investors to handle alone. These investments require high upfront costs, long timelines for returns, or the inclusion of military assets, which includes incumbent added costs and political sensitivities that exceed typical private sector risk tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make them viable, public subsidies, new financing models, or hybrid approaches with targeted risk-sharing are necessary to cover non-commercial costs. Public actors, such as governments and philanthropists, must step in early to de-risk these investments and create the necessary conditions to attract private sector capital. There may be some MCC and DFC projects with national security implications, and those should receive support to determine financial risks. However, a risk management approach needs to be in place to ensure commercial viability and sovereign financial prudence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration and Congress should work together to reform—not shutter—the MCC. The costs of closing it far outweigh the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, the MCC drives foreign investment, not foreign aid, and if implemented, these reforms will help it even more effectively provide good value for money. If, however, the administration chooses to shutter the agency, it should keep the best elements of the MCC model and transfer its compacts, agreements, contracts, and select qualified personnel to the DFC. This would enhance the U.S. government’s ability to deliver for the American people by retaining the MCC’s strengths—country ownership, performance-based and conditional funding, data-driven and transparent discipline, and apolitical delivery. But to stay effective, the MCC model must embrace calculated risks and better align with U.S. economic and geopolitical goals. This includes refining its approach to better engage private capital, work regionally, and deliver sustainable value to both partner countries and the United States while updating how it selects countries and measures impact. With targeted reforms and a renewed focus, the MCC model—regardless of whether applied at the MCC or DFC—can drive U.S. global leadership and offer valuable lessons for the broader development community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and the world are safer, stronger, and more prosperous with the MCC model than without it.&lt;/p&gt;

Both technologies hold promise to transform the financial services industry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Financial services are a powerful driver of human well-being, enabling businesses to operate and raise capital and households to save, manage economic shocks, and invest in essential needs like education and health. However, across many developing countries, access to affordable and comprehensive financial services—which are key to promoting financial inclusion—remains out of reach for many people. A series of infrastructural, economic, regulatory, and social barriers limit the participation of millions of individuals in financial services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technological solutions have the potential to help overcome some of these barriers by lowering costs, promoting competition in traditionally concentrated markets, and better serving consumers’ varied and unique needs. The introduction of mobile phones in the early 2000s removed the need to use physical banking services and simplified onerous identification processes, granting access to payments and credit for many individuals who were previously unbanked. As a result of mobile telephony, today 3 billion people (57 percent of mobile subscribers) use mobile financial services worldwide. In addition, mobile telephony contributed to 5.8 percent of global GDP in 2024, and is projected to account for 8.4 percent of global GDP by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, innovative developments have come from cloud, mobile, and social technology. Developing countries have mostly seized the opportunity to build and strengthen their own digital public infrastructure, including by innovating with fast payments systems. However, given that those systems still rely on legacy infrastructure, the benefits behind fast payment systems have been primarily contained to domestic markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the next wave of borderless and truly digital innovations will likely be driven by emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and distributed ledger technology (DLT). Both technologies hold promise to transform the financial services industry by enabling faster cross-border payments, expanding access to credit, improving financial markets, and broadening retail investment opportunities. These market-based solutions allow for faster, safer, and lower-cost services, empowering individuals to claim a sense of financial autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI can streamline account opening and credit, as well as help deliver personalized financial advice and products tailored to individual needs. This technology can support individuals who either lack the skills or the experience to fully benefit from traditional financial services. Separately, by reconfiguring the traditional roles of intermediaries, in principle, DLT—a digital database to record transactions in a shared and secure way—could promote financial autonomy, expand access opportunities, introduce greater efficiency, and unlock liquidity globally. DLT’s inherently transparent, immutable, secure, and tamper-resistant architecture could thus help unlock a range of benefits at a wholesale and retail level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the above reasons, there is substantial enthusiasm surrounding the promise of both technologies in the financial sector. Most recently, the Trump administration has taken a new and more proactive approach to DLT with the appointment of a White House AI and Crypto Czar who has been tasked with developing digital asset regulations. In the U.S. Congress, representatives from the cryptocurrency industry are actively participating in hearings with lawmakers interested in establishing legal standards for digital assets. For example, a 2025 bill introduced by the Senate Banking Committee—the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act)—seeks to create a central regulatory body for stablecoins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DLT has made progress over the last 15 years, with increasing interest and early adoption across sectors. Still, challenges like fragmented governance, limited interoperability, and uneven regulation remain barriers to scale and broader impact. In addition, more evidence is needed to fully understand its benefits compared to the alternatives. Given the many developments taking place in the field of DLT, the body of scholarly work is steadily growing. This paper aims to unpack the main issues discussed in the literature and summarize recent trends in the sector. It examines how DLT could facilitate broader financial inclusion, particularly through the use case of asset tokenization, and explores the risks and challenges the technology brings. While DLT may disrupt the financial services industry, its precise impact remains uncertain: Will it complement or replace existing financial institutions and other proven technologies such as mobile money?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-distributed-ledger-technology-can-advance-financial-inclusion&quot;&gt;How Distributed Ledger Technology Can Advance Financial Inclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its core, DLT is a shared and safe database, similar to a shared Excel workbook. It is decentralized in nature, offering a secure way of conducting and recording transactions without the need for a central authority. DLT is “distributed” because multiple members of a computer network can contribute and sync copies of a single ledger. New transactions are added in a manner that is cryptographically secure, permanent, and visible to all participants in near real-time. DLT can record both static data, like phone numbers, and dynamic data, like digital assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional databases, this technology enables peer-to-peer (P2P) information flow, while eliminating added costs from middlemen in the process. In the financial services space, this translates into facilitating quicker and more affordable transactions and money transfers. In addition, DLT can improve transparency and build trust in financial products because transactions are unalterable and traceable back to their origin. This not only eliminates doubt about the integrity of financial data but also fosters trust between participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although DLT is often narrowly associated with digital financial assets like cryptocurrencies, the underlying technology possesses wider capabilities to accelerate transaction speeds, reduce costs, and expand consumer participation in financial services. There are several avenues through which DLT can impact the sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transparency, traceability, and auditability:&lt;/strong&gt; DLT enhances efficiency in tracking transactions and spending, helping to reduce fraud and corruption within economies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost efficiencies:&lt;/strong&gt; Compared to legacy systems, DLT can significantly lower record-keeping costs, leading to reduced service fees.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managing assets:&lt;/strong&gt; Digital wallets allow societies to rethink how assets are managed and how recordkeeping functions. Without the use of intermediaries, digital wallets allow financial services users more control over their assets, reducing risks in particular for women and other vulnerable populations and providing more secure and private means of managing assets for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Programmable money:&lt;/strong&gt; DLT enables the programmability of assets—transactions that automatically occur once certain rules and conditions are met—thereby allowing for automated processes and expanded use cases for money. For example, project funds can be gated based on milestones, cash disbursements can be restricted to specific uses, and stimulus payments can expire if not used.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Universal acceptance:&lt;/strong&gt; Digital assets (such as stablecoins) are increasingly being accepted worldwide. This “universalness” enables significant use cases like global payroll and payment for remote workers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/YLcdRyy.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: DLT Applications for Financial Inclusion.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS Project on Prosperity and Development.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the financial services industry, some of the most promising applications of DLT for advancing financial inclusion include streamlining the account opening and onboarding process, enhancing the efficiency of payments and remittances, improving individuals’ access to credit, and empowering individuals with greater control and ownership over their credit history (Figure 1). These innovations have the potential to make financial services more accessible and transparent for underserved populations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easing the account opening and client onboarding processes:&lt;/strong&gt; DLT can be instrumental to individuals and firms that want to access formal financial services for the first time. In this context, this technology can be applied in two key ways: (1) enabling digital identification, and (2) enhancing the client onboarding experience.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Over 1.1 billion people in the world lack sufficient proof of their identity. If people cannot prove who they are, they are often denied essential services, including financial services. The Global Findex Database 2021 found that a lack of documentation (e.g., an ID, proof of address, or proof of income) was one of the primary barriers to accessing banking services in low-income countries, with a staggering 27 percent of their population citing identification issues as a reason for remaining unbanked.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;DLT can help address identification barriers that keep people unbanked by providing a secure, verifiable, and decentralized digital identity authenticated through cryptographic proofs. For example, three quarters of Sierra Leone’s adult population do not have access to formal financial services due to a lack of identification and credit history. Thus, in 2018, the government of Sierra Leone partnered with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF), and online lending platform Kiva to launch a DLT-based platform to provide citizens with formal identity and give them more control over their own credit information. The Kiva protocol uses biometric data (such as fingerprints) and houses credit information of citizens collected through different means. Other examples where DLT is applied for identification purposes include Ethereum and WorldCoin—cryptocurrencies that use blockchain digital identities based on biometric data (e.g., voice and iris scans) to register, enroll, and authenticate customers.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In addition, DLT can be applied to make the customer onboarding experience more secure, efficient, and client friendly. Financial institutions need to verify who the customers are and understand their personal and business activities to better assess whether these entities carry risks related to fraud, money laundering, or financing terrorism (known as Know Your Customer [KYC] and Customer Due Diligence [CDD] checks). These processes can be time consuming for banks (since they must gather and analyze data for each customer) and are also subject to human error. Moreover, customers must undergo this same process every time they start a new relationship with a bank or financial institution. Using DLT technology, financial institutions could reduce the time and costs associated with these processes while also providing greater visibility to regulators and offering customers a more seamless onboarding experience. Since the information housed in the blockchain becomes a single source of customer data across all financial institutions in a jurisdiction, there is greater visibility and transparency about the activities of customers for regulators. Customers benefit from reduced onboarding times and the elimination of the need to submit duplicate information across multiple financial institutions. For example, in 2017, a consortium of banks in Singapore worked with the regulatory authority to use DLT for KYC processes, which resulted in a cost savings of between 25–50 percent to banks, while at the same time providing a clear audit trail to regulators and a better customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facilitating payments:&lt;/strong&gt; DLT can also be utilized to enable secure payments (including P2P, remittances, government-to-person [G2P], e-commerce, and humanitarian payments) without the use of a bank account. An individual living in a rural region with no nearby access to a bank can receive money instantly instead of waiting days for the money to process into an account. DLT can also be employed for cross-border payments, including remittances and humanitarian aid. International money transfers through traditional channels can be expensive to users given the many fees that banks and money transfer corporations charge. Moreover, several days can pass before the funds reach the beneficiary. Since DLT enables peer-to-peer transactions—allowing money to move across borders without relying on the corresponding banking system—it has the potential to cut the costs and increase the speed of money transfers. One example where DLT is applied for these types of payments is Everex, a blockchain-enabled remittance provider. The platform claims that it offers remittance services to Myanmar workers in Thailand faster and with lower fees than traditional money transfer services. Another example is Leaf (Leaf Global Fintech), a blockchain-based digital wallet developed in 2019. Leaf enables vulnerable people and refugees to store, send, receive, and exchange currencies on their phones, regardless of whether they are using a smartphone. The service covers users in Kenya, Uganda, and Rwanda and had reached 40,000 beneficiaries as of 2022. Due to its success, Leaf Global Fintech was acquired the same year by IDT Corporation, a global FinTech provider.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Access to credit and control over credit history and reporting:&lt;/strong&gt; Another promising application of DLT centers on credit services, offering new opportunities for individuals and businesses to secure financing in more efficient and transparent ways. For example, Grassroots Economics, a blockchain-based project based out of Kenya, worked with UNICEF and the Red Cross on an innovative credit line for communities that do not have collateral or credit history. Grassroots Economics developed the idea of Community Inclusion Currencies (CICs)—tokens that are backed by the goods and services provided by the community, including, for example, a town’s food and water supply, a carpenter’s labor, or a babysitter’s time. Kenyans can use these tokens to create a line of credit that is backed by their own work. In this way, farmers can build credit histories and get loans without using physical currency (Kenyan shillings) or going through a bank. The transactions of these tokens using feature phones are documented on a blockchain. In 2020, 58,400 users of Grassroots Economics carried out transactions worth $3 million in tokens.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;DLT can also be leveraged to enhance credit history management and reporting by providing a more secure, transparent, and efficient way to track and verify financial histories. If credit data were stored via blockchain, consumers would be able to directly access their own credit histories and reports, without having to rely on an outside agency. In the United States, in 2023, TransUnion (one of the largest consumer credit reporting agencies) started providing credit scores for individuals that apply for loans on blockchain-based protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New financial assets—unbacked cryptocurrencies, utility tokens, and stablecoins, among others—are being created in DLT for a variety of financial- and non-financial-use cases. Various unbacked crypto assets and tokens sold in secondary markets suffer from inherent volatility and the technology, in some cases, can be misused for illicit activities. Other assets, such as regulated stablecoins, enjoy much greater transparency and price stability as they are pegged to fiat currencies, such as the U.S. dollar. Stablecoins are known for unlocking a range of benefits, including faster, cheaper, and more efficient settlement. The market for these myriad assets has grown considerably and, as such, promoting regulatory clarity has been an objective shared by many jurisdictions around the world, with the United States most recently moving at pace to join these efforts and promote their safe adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-emerging-use-case-in-dlt-the-tokenization-of-assets&quot;&gt;An Emerging Use Case in DLT: The Tokenization of Assets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most prominent use cases of DLT technology—tokenization—has already garnered significant attention from the financial services industry and holds promise for greater financial inclusion. Tokenization is the process of converting real-world or digital assets into DLT-based tokens (or digital representations) that can be securely stored, traded, and transferred. These tokens represent ownership, rights, or access to assets such as currencies, securities, physical goods, real estate, intellectual property, or commodities. While financial assets have been represented on digital ledgers or financial databases for some time (e.g., as liabilities or assets on a bank’s balance sheet), the technological attributes of tokenization are unique and have the potential to transform how retail and financial actors interact with each other and among themselves (Figure 2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/cu1lSwb.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: The Tokenization Process of Real-World Assets.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: U.S. Federal Reserve Board.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A token can be used across sectors and protects all types of sensitive data, including bank transactions, medical records, criminal records, vehicle driver information, loan applications, stock trading, and voter registration. Tokenization can be applied to financial services, supply chain management, healthcare, real estate, media, and entertainment. Given its potential to transform several sectors, asset tokenization is projected to be a $16 trillion industry by 2030, representing 10 percent of global GDP, according to research conducted by the Boston Consulting Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since tokenization is built on blockchain technology, benefits to users include added efficiency, faster transfers, and increased transaction transparency. In addition, tokenization has unique features that can enhance the functioning of the financial services industry (Figure 3). Beyond operational efficiencies, tokenization has the potential to broaden investment opportunities as it allows investors to own a portion of an asset rather than having to purchase the entire asset, which can be prohibitively expensive. This fractional ownership gives investors access to asset classes that were previously out of reach. Furthermore, tokenization can provide more liquidity to illiquid assets (such as real estate or private equity), as well as enable easier and faster trading on a digital platform. Therefore, tokenization can open investment opportunities to a wider range of investors, including those who may not have the capital to invest in traditional illiquid assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/HdGlfT2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3: Potential Benefits of Tokenization.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: OECD.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relatedly, another way tokenization can positively impact emerging markets is by expanding financing options for businesses, thereby providing them with greater access to capital and new growth opportunities. This is particularly important in developing countries where many small businesses struggle to access fresh capital and loans. Tokenization can facilitate private capital flow to small businesses, allowing them to grow, employ people, and pay taxes to their governments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, asset tokenization holds the potential to significantly promote financial inclusion by democratizing access to investment opportunities, lowering transaction costs, enhancing operational efficiency, and bolstering transparency and security for users. This transformation could pave the way for a more accessible and equitable financial ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-challenges-of-large-scale-adoption-of-dlt-and-tokenization&quot;&gt;The Challenges of Large-Scale Adoption of DLT and Tokenization&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across regions, sectors, and institutions, there is significant experimentation and innovation using DLT technologies. A 2024 survey of global capital markets participants—including FinTech firms, banks, and fund managers—revealed that 39 percent of the surveyed institutions are adopting DLT mainly to improve internal operations through cost savings. On a regional level, 23 percent of respondents in the Middle East and Africa claimed that their DLT innovations are in the proof-of-concept stage, 25 percent in Latin America declared theirs to be in the development stage, and 44 percent of respondents from Asia and Europe stated that they are in the “live” stage. At the same time, the survey showed that many of these DLT initiatives are fragmented and siloed, involving a limited number of organizations and thus restricting their impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multilateral organizations are also developing DLT applications to enhance internal operations. At the same time, these institutions are launching initiatives and financing innovations for their clients in both the private and public sectors (Box 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-1-dlt-innovations-within-multilateral-organizations&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 1: DLT Innovations Within Multilateral Organizations&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Agencies within the United Nations— specifically UNICEF, UNDP Innovation, the UN Innovation Network (UNIN), and the World Food Programme—use an internal platform called The Atrium, which uses blockchain technology.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In 2019, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank launched a private blockchain called the Learning Coin. It is a quasi-cryptocurrency focused on research that does not have any real value but instead is intended to be used to educate users through access to content related to research materials, videos, and presentations. The users get paid in this quasi-cryptocurrency and can later redeem the coins for goods and other services instead of a monetized value.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Also in 2019, IDB Lab launched an initiative called LACChain, which was created as a public blockchain ecosystem to facilitate connections between the public and private sectors for users in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). This blockchain infrastructure was created to unite enterprises and the governments in using a compatible DLT platform.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The IMF has formally incorporated cryptocurrencies into their global economic data reporting in 2025. The organization published the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM7) on March 20, 2025, which highlighted the guidelines for the classification and recording of crypto assets like bitcoin, stablecoin, and token-based platforms like Ethereum and Solana. The intention of this manual is for member countries to implement these frameworks by 2029. The IMF will support this implementation by helping and guiding the countries to ensure the enforcement of these frameworks.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In addition, the World Bank launched the first public blockchain bond in 2018—bond-i (Blockchain Operated New Debt Instrument). This platform was launched through the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) and raised $110 million in its initial launch.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In March 2025, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) issued its first digital bond—HSBC Orion. This DLT platform uses the British pound as a denomination and is employed for NatWest’s and HSBC’s operations. It is a 15-month, £5 million (nearly USD $6.5 million), fixed-rate bond.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Latin America and the Caribbean, the Central Bank of Brazil launched a new blockchain pilot project called Drex Pilot (also known as the Real Digital) to develop a CBDC (central bank digital currency) in 2024. On the continent of Africa, South Africa is experimenting with blockchain technologies, including startups like Ice3x and Luno (both cryptocurrency exchanges), as well as Custos Media Technology, GeoPay, and Bankymoon (which use blockchains to address challenges such as international money transfers and online piracy). Moreover, central banks are testing the use of digital currencies as ways of fortifying financial inclusion in, for example, Ghana, Nigeria, and South Africa, all of which are running pilot projects. In Asia, there are government initiatives to develop DLT frameworks and regulations. One example is the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), which began utilizing blockchain and DLT for settlement and clearing systems. MAS is responsible for the Singapore Exchange (SGX), which successfully created a public digital bond using a DLT-enabled platform in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of tokenization, there is limited public data on these transactions globally, including the overall market size and more disaggregated information by different classes of tokens and their actual market growth. Although the first tokenization transaction happened in 2017, few assets have been tokenized aside from cash (in the form of stablecoins) and bank deposits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the significant innovation taking place and the clear institutional appetite for it, DLT has not yet reached the level of adoption necessary to be considered systemically significant. There are several barriers that hinder widespread adoption of these technologies (Figure 4). The most important barriers to support DLT at scale include regulatory uncertainty, a lack of standardization, and the need for interoperability (specifically between DLT platforms and traditional payment systems, and between different DLT platforms). There are also risks involving, for example, differences in the governance of the networks, cybersecurity, and legal ambiguity. As a result, DLT’s mass adoption has been slow, and its long-term success will depend on overcoming these barriers while taking actions to mitigate these underlying risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/JzVnr88.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4: Adoption of DLT at Scale: Barriers and Risks.&lt;/strong&gt; Sources: OECD, McKinsey &amp;amp; Company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of early 2025, the regulatory landscape for DLT and tokenization is still developing, with no single, universally accepted framework having emerged. Countries have moved at different speeds and have taken different approaches to regulating this nascent sector. In addition, there are no binding international standards in place. The inconsistency of global regulations creates unnecessary uncertainty and complexity for businesses. For example, some jurisdictions do not have policies that directly address the novel considerations DLT brings, instead relying on laws regarding the transfer of private information or payments and securities laws designed with traditional financial assets in mind. Due to differences in laws and policies that are tied to digital assets and activities associated with the technology, DLT deployment remains fragmented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the European Union and other advanced economies, such as Hong Kong and Singapore, have already introduced legislation aimed at standardizing legal frameworks, a majority of the developing world is still jurisdictionally fragmented. Assimilating the regulatory and legal policies between various jurisdictions would alleviate potential legal friction and promote greater adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Financial Stability Board (FSB), which has jurisdiction over all G20 economies, has been very active in producing guidelines and recommendation regarding blockchain and crypto activities. In fact, it just finalized its regulatory framework for crypto-asset activities in order to promote regulatory comprehensiveness and consistency. This is a major step toward a more globalized standard for token usage and could provide a regulatory framework for developing economies looking to flesh out their DLT strategies. Additionally, the FSB’s 2023 G20 Crypto-asset Policy Implementation Roadmap is a comprehensive strategy aimed at addressing the challenges posed by cryptocurrencies and is primarily centered around regulatory frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the current state of interoperability, which allows different DLT networks to connect and exchange information with each other without restriction, makes the implementation of the technology in the most needed areas extremely difficult. Unlike mobile technology, where a person can call or text another person without needing the same cellular network, most DLT applications lack interoperability both with each other and with legacy systems. Each DLT platform typically operates in isolation, which hinders the integration of services with other systems. As a result, DLT applications within the financial services sector remain fragmented and siloed, with many still at the proof-of-concept stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Integrating blockchain and tokenization technologies with legacy financial systems presents additional technical challenges. The current financial market infrastructure is not compatible with the decentralized and digital nature of DLTs and requires substantial investment in new infrastructure, as well as the acquisition of skilled talent and employee training. In the case of tokenization, institutions must invest in updating their middle- and back-office workflows to accommodate tokenized assets. Additionally, during the transition to new technology, institutions will need to run digital-twin operations (e.g., managing both digital and traditional settlement, and other functions) to mitigate operational and regulatory risks. These hurdles mean that institutions need a strong business case to justify making this transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dlt-adoption-in-emerging-markets&quot;&gt;DLT Adoption in Emerging Markets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is a flurry of experimentation and innovation surrounding DLT in emerging markets, significant disparities with advanced economies introduce additional complexities that hinder the widespread adoption of these technologies. A combination of economic, infrastructure, and social challenges—such as low levels of financial and digital literacy, limited access to essential digital and energy infrastructure, and potential risks to financial stability—pose unique barriers that must be addressed in order to scale DLT effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to weak digital and financial literacy, individuals in emerging markets do not fully recognize the risks and benefits of these technologies. Blockchain, in particular, is not well understood by the public and its benefits are not adequately documented and communicated to consumers. In a 2024 survey of 18 developing and advanced countries, most respondents did not get the definition of blockchain right, except for interviewees in Nigeria and South Africa. This skill and informational gap prevents individuals from engaging effectively in decentralized finance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, DLT is often confused with cryptocurrency, complete with the latter’s negative connotations. Media coverage frequently centers on examples of cryptocurrency misuse such as authoritarian regimes attempting to circumvent Western sanctions (e.g., Russia’s use of Bitcoin) or cryptocurrency scandals (e.g., the meme coin $Libra and the theft of nearly $1.5 billion in ByBit coins by the North Korean criminal organization known as Lazarus Group), instead of the benefits of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the previously mentioned challenges, DLTs require significant investments in hard infrastructure and can consume massive amounts of energy for computing power. As these technologies expand and the world faces an increase in demand for data centers and computing power, the financial and energy costs will only grow. However, many developing countries do not have access to affordable and reliable energy sources and, moreover, lack the resources to invest in digital infrastructure. As of February 2024, the energy demand generated by current crypto assets was between 0.4 and 0.9 percent of global energy usage. Bitcoin mining (the term used to describe the process in which bitcoins are validated and recorded) required the equivalent of about 50 days of power usage by the average U.S. household per bitcoin in 2022. With roughly 200,000 bitcoin “mined” per year, the energy needs are enormous. To put this in the context of expanding DLT and blockchain technology access, approximately 770 million people worldwide do not have access to reliable electricity, mainly in Africa and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, an additional consideration for developing countries is that DLT adoption without clear rules and standards has the potential to introduce new risks that could impact the overall stability of their financial systems. Although DLT fosters a more democratized financial system by offering consumers greater financial choices, it could present a complex trade-off between consumer choice and the country’s financial stability if its adoption is not managed appropriately. In the case of stablecoins, for example, there is growing popularity for using these digital assets as trading and settlement vehicles and as means of payments across jurisdictions, but lack of oversight (including of stablecoin issuers’ reserve backing model) may undermine the effectiveness of a country’s regulator over their financial system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is especially challenging for emerging markets, which must navigate a complex landscape of competing economic and social priorities. To offer guidance and help jurisdictions navigate these risks, the FSB has issued 10 recommendations aimed at ensuring consistent and effective regulation, supervision, and oversight of stablecoins across jurisdictions while also encouraging responsible innovation. Regarding the tokenization of assets, a 2024 FSB report highlighted the additional vulnerabilities the mass adoption of the technology could pose to the financial system, but concluded that it did not yet present significant risks to the stability of the financial sector given its small-scale usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-navigating-the-future&quot;&gt;Conclusion: Navigating the Future&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Innovative technologies will continue to transform the financial landscape. With DLT driving a shift of the industry to a broader democratization of finance, there is a significant opportunity to leverage this technology for better development outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As new developments emerge in this space, it is crucial to address the barriers and mitigate the risks while ensuring that the technology fosters equitable financial access and upholds the stability of the global financial system. The path forward is both challenging and exhilarating, with several key considerations warranting deeper reflection:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulators must balance innovation and regulation.&lt;/strong&gt; Like any new technology, DLT presents challenges to regulators who want to foster innovation while ensuring sufficient regulation to protect users, maintain financial stability, and prevent misuse. Striking the right balance is crucial—too much regulation can stifle innovation, whereas insufficient oversight can lead to fraud, market manipulation, and security breaches, to name just a few risks. As DLT evolves, regulators must remain flexible and adaptive, allowing for the rapid development of new applications while maintaining a framework that ensures transparency, accountability, and consumer protection. Effective regulation should support responsible innovation, promote trust, and allow the technology to reach its full potential without compromising financial stability or user safety.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The rapid global rollout of emerging technologies demands heightened focus on international cooperation to establish interoperability and standardized practices.&lt;/strong&gt; As new systems and technologies proliferate across borders, the need for a more cohesive approach has become increasingly apparent. Ensuring that various systems can seamlessly communicate with each other will require substantial investments in infrastructure, as well as robust international collaboration to set common standards and protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The benefits to users and market players are not yet widespread, and may even be unknown.&lt;/strong&gt; For users to fully embrace this innovation, they need to understand the value it brings in real terms—whether it’s in terms of cost-saving, increased transparency, or enhanced security. Stronger, more accessible case studies and practical examples are needed to demonstrate how this technology can drive real-world benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In international development, multilateral and bilateral organizations have a unique opportunity to integrate and promote this technology.&lt;/strong&gt; Multilateral institutions are already experimenting and applying DLT both for internal purposes and to help their clients. DLT could streamline and improve processes such as payroll systems, the disbursement of grants and loans, contractor payments, and the delivery of humanitarian aid in challenging environments. In the United States, given the foreign assistance reform taking place under the Trump administration, there is a valuable opportunity to leverage DLT not only to track funding but also to make the entire foreign aid value chain more efficient, transparent, and accountable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is essential to educate consumers on both the benefits and the risks of this technology.&lt;/strong&gt; Although DLT is rapidly evolving, educational institutions must improve their digital and financial literacy offerings so that students are better equipped to engage in decentralized finance. Financial institutions can also play a role in educating their clients, especially when onboarding customers. Media narratives need to shift toward DLT’s positive applications and transformative potential across various sectors, highlighting its benefits beyond the realm of cryptocurrency.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, will this technology complement or replace traditional banking and financial institutions?&lt;/strong&gt; This is a critical question for the future of financial ecosystems. The potential for DLT lies in its ability to both enhance and work alongside existing financial and banking structures. While it may not replace traditional institutions entirely, it could significantly transform and improve efficiencies, streamline operations, and offer new avenues for financial inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the adoption of DLT and other technological applications continues to expand, so too does the body of research exploring their impact on financial inclusion and financial stability. This rapidly growing field of scholarly inquiry is poised to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of the industry, offering valuable insights and evidence to guide policy development. This paper aims to summarize some of the key issues emerging in this area and hopes to inspire greater engagement from academics, policymakers, and leaders across various sectors to contribute to this critical conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 9 February 2023, the UK and US governments jointly sanctioned seven members of Conti/Trickbot, a ransomware group responsible for attacks against at least 149 UK individuals and businesses. The move marked the UK government’s entry into the ransomware sanctions arena. Over the years since, the ransomware sanctions regime has expanded and has become a core component of the UK’s counter-ransomware strategy. The government aims to use sanctions to expose ransomware criminals’ identities, undermine their ability to monetise ransomware, and degrade other criminals’ trust in key ransomware services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are significant challenges posed by designing, implementing and enforcing ransomware sanctions in a way that achieves the government’s goals. In this context, in February 2025, as part of ongoing work through its UK Sanctions Implementation and Strategy Taskforce, RUSI convened an online workshop to discuss the UK’s experience with ransomware sanctions to date. The workshop was jointly organised by the Centre for Finance and Security and the Cyber and Tech research group at RUSI. A select group of 35 expert stakeholders from the UK, US and Canada attended the workshop. Participants represented a diverse range of professional backgrounds. These included incident responders, ransomware payment brokers, cryptocurrency tracers, lawyers, academics, law enforcement officers and UK government officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first section of this report provides an overview of the discussion relating to the implementation of UK cyber sanctions. The second section focuses on the discussion pertaining to the sanction regime’s “theory of change”. The third section describes the impact of sanctions on ransomware threat actors. The fourth section articulates participants’ perspectives on the state of play with respect to compliance and enforcement. Finally, the report outlines policy implications for the UK’s role as a cyber sanctions proponent in a dynamic international context. None of the discussions at the event are attributable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-uk-cyber-sanctions-regime&quot;&gt;The UK Cyber Sanctions Regime&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first session began by outlining the context for the initial development and implementation of the UK’s ransomware sanctions regime. A representative from the UK government noted that the broader cyber sanctions regime was designed when the UK was still a member state of the EU. The UK’s regime, introduced in 2020, is thus modelled similarly to the EU’s. The participant also emphasised that the sanctions regime was an opportunity to collaborate with international partners, namely the US and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants discussed differences between the UK, US and EU approaches to implementing cyber sanctions. Participants described how there was a close alignment between the UK and US approaches, which prioritised operational impact by naming sanctioned individuals relatively quickly. Participants also recognised that there was a disparity in resources between the UK and US, with the latter being able to operate at greater speed and scale. Comparatively, while the UK’s regime was modelled in line with the EU’s regime, the EU was described as facing challenges in coordinating cyber sanctions across the 27 member states. The result of this in-built deliberation meant that decision making on sanctions implementation, prioritisation and information-sharing was relatively delayed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, it is of note that many countries do not have dedicated cyber sanctions regimes. Participants noted that the UK continues to push for broader international action, particularly through partnerships such as the Counter Ransomware Initiative. At the time of writing, no sanctions had been lifted by the US, but participants expressed uncertainty about whether cyber sanctions will continue to be a priority for the US under the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-theory-of-change-for-ransomware-sanctions&quot;&gt;The Theory of Change for Ransomware Sanctions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants from the government emphasised that the UK uses ransomware sanctions as part of a cross-government counter-ransomware strategy. This strategy is derived from the UK’s 2022 National Cyber Strategy and is coordinated by the cross-Whitehall Senior Ransomware Steering Group led by the Home Office. The workshop highlighted several different ways in which the UK government is using ransomware sanctions to try to further the three strategic objectives identified by participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the primary objective, authorities aim to change the behaviour of criminals by altering their calculation of risk and undermining their ability to monetise ransomware. There are two ways that sanctions might contribute to this objective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, sanctions enable law enforcement to “name and shame” individual criminals and remove their anonymity. The government hopes that this will deter ransomware threat actors and force them to operate in a more constrained environment. One workshop participant noted that for UK authorities, sanctions are the best means of attributing ransomware operators and affiliates, as prosecutors will not charge foreign hackers without a reasonable chance of prosecution. This is a contrast to the US, which has frequently indicted both intelligence officers from hostile states and foreign cybercriminals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, sanctions are part of a range of measures that law enforcement uses to attempt to disrupt criminal networks by sowing distrust. The ransomware ecosystem is a collection of individuals, groups and services that rely on some degree of trust to function effectively. Many of the most impactful ransomware strains are run as a service: operators develop ransomware, maintain infrastructure to run it and then sell access to it to affiliates for a cut of ransom payments. Some participants argued that sanctioning key ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operators may cause affiliates to lose trust that these services are safe. This was the premise of Operation Cronos, an operation led by the National Crime Agency (NCA) that compromised the infrastructure of cybercriminal group LockBit and sanctioned its main administrator. Participants also discussed the more recent sanctioning by US, UK and Australian authorities of ZServers, a Russia-based “bulletproof” hosting provider used by ransomware criminals to host servers and domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A secondary objective of UK authorities is to use sanctions to change victim behaviour and reduce the number of ransom payments made by UK individuals and businesses. One participant argued that sanctions inject “friction” into victim decision making because of the need to carry out due diligence checks before a payment is made. At the same time, several workshop participants noted that the government is keen not to “re-victimise” ransomware victims by completely removing their ability to pay. Participants highlighted that balancing these competing desires is one of the reasons US and UK authorities have designated individual criminals rather than ransomware strains. The latter approach would completely remove the ability of victims to make payments to designated strains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some workshop participants also suggested that the UK government is using sanctions as a mechanism for increasing reporting of ransomware incidents in the UK. One industry representative at the workshop highlighted that the guidance from the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI) on ransomware sanctions notes that reporting to the National Cyber Security Centre and NCA will be treated as a mitigating factor if a victim pays a sanctioned ransomware threat actor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, an underlying objective across the UK’s cyber sanctions mission is to enhance international coordination. Cyber threats are inherently transnational, requiring a collaborative approach to sanctions and enforcement among international partners. Participants highlighted that the UK has been working closely with allies such as the US and Australia to coordinate sanctions and intelligence-sharing efforts. The effectiveness of these measures is amplified when multiple nations align their policies and enforcement actions. However, international alignment efforts are hindered by the EU’s divergent approach; participants observed that in the EU, the use of cyber sanctions is viewed as a tool more for countering mis/disinformation than for targeting ransomware attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-impact-of-sanctions-on-ransomware-threat-actors&quot;&gt;The Impact of Sanctions on Ransomware Threat Actors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After discussing the theory of change for using ransomware sanctions, the workshop focused on the effects of sanctions on criminal behaviour to date. This discussion covered the impact of not only UK designations on threat actors, but also designations by the US Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC). There was broad agreement that sanctions have increased distrust in RaaS offerings and disrupted some individuals’ ability to monetise ransomware. Representatives from the public and private sectors at the workshop emphasised, however, that it remains challenging to accurately measure these effects and disaggregate them from both other counter-ransomware measures and internal strife in the ransomware ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants noted that it is likely that sanctions have sown distrust in some ransomware groups and services. This has two effects. First, one participant used the example of Conti/Trickbot and suggested that designating individual members has had a psychological impact and reduced their risk appetite for high-profile ransomware operations. Second, participants noted that sanctions and associated travel bans probably also cause designated individuals to reconsider travelling abroad to spend their profits. Although these measures do not change the central problem of Russia being a safe haven for threat actors, they do constrain the actors’ freedom. Even more significant, however, is the reputational harm that sanctions cause to criminal brands, both for individuals and RaaS strains. One participant argued that key members of Conti/Trickbot, Evil Corp and LockBit have all failed to recover their influence in the ecosystem since being designated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was widespread agreement that sanctions have affected designated individuals’ ability to monetise ransomware. Victims – and the third parties such as insurers, payment brokers and lawyers that support them – are less likely to pay sanctioned threat actors because of the fear of being punished by authorities. One participant highlighted reporting by Chainalysis, which shows that payments to LockBit dropped 79% in the second half of 2024 following Operation Cronos and the designation of LockBit’s core administrator. It is also likely that reputational harm caused to sanctioned RaaS and malware-as-a-service operators such as Conti/Trickbot has undermined their ability to attract new customers and affiliates. One workshop participant also noted that sanctioned ransomware affiliates (such as Evil Corp) may find it harder to access RaaS services because of increased scrutiny from administrators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop also highlighted that sanctions of both key individuals and cryptocurrency and money laundering services have made it challenging for threat actors to launder the proceeds of ransomware. This aligns with analysis conducted by Chainalysis in early 2025, which assessed that sanctions and law enforcement operations have resulted in “insecurity among threat actors where they can safely put their funds”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sanctions have probably also had broader effects on the ransomware ecosystem and the operating models and tactics of key groups and individuals. One workshop participant highlighted how Evil Corp had adapted its business model after being designated by OFAC in 2019: rather than running its own in-house ransomware operations, its members became affiliates of RaaS strains to evade the additional scrutiny and restrictions put on them. However, it is unclear if this dramatically affected its ability to monetise ransomware. Other participants argued that sanctions (along with other counter-ransomware measures) have contributed to the fragmentation of the ransomware ecosystem, with monopolistic RaaS strains like LockBit giving way to smaller players and more “lone wolves”. However, participants noted that an unintended consequence of this may be worse outcomes for victims, with less established threat actors less likely to provide reliable decrypters and more willing to use very aggressive extortion tactics. This may be because they are less constrained by the rules imposed by some RaaS operators and administrators. Additionally, third-party incident responders and ransomware negotiators are less able to draw on battlecards – intelligence and playbooks to guide engagement with different ransomware threat actors – and past precedent when handling incidents caused by splinter groups or groups with no name. This may create uncertainty and/or delays in the victim’s remediation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the workshop was broadly positive about the effects of sanctions on threat actors, it also highlighted that there is uncertainty and scepticism about the ability of law enforcement and industry to accurately measure those effects. Part of this challenge is due to a lack of visibility: as one participant highlighted, it is difficult to know when criminals feel vulnerable, even in cases when their communications may be compromised. It is also a methodological challenge: the effects of sanctions cannot be disaggregated from other counter-ransomware activities such as offensive cyber operations and arrests. However, since these measures are designed to complement one another, ultimately it may not matter if authorities are unable to assign specific effects to sanctions. This also emphasises that sanctions will probably be more effective if used in concert with other tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;compliance-enforcement-and-the-impact-on-ransomware-victims&quot;&gt;Compliance, Enforcement and the Impact on Ransomware Victims&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the final session, workshop participants discussed cyber sanctions compliance at length and in depth. The discussion also reflected on the impact that sanctions checks had on the ransomware victim experience and threat actors’ ability to monetise ransomware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a ransomware victim is considering a prospective payment of a ransom, they have a responsibility to make reasonable efforts to identify whether the payment may – either in part or in full – go to a sanctioned individual. Industry participants at the workshop explained that, in practice, the sanctions compliance checks are often undertaken by third-party firms – specifically, ransomware intermediaries, which are firms that facilitate ransom payments in cryptocurrencies to cybercriminals. This ransomware intermediary function, participants explained, may be a bolt-on to a wider cyber incident response and/or ransomware negotiation service. Some firms may also offer ransomware payments as a standalone service. Ransomware intermediaries are an attractive solution in part because they have the capability to procure or draw upon large sums of cryptocurrency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sanctions checks will be undertaken before a payment is signed off by the ransomware victim and, where applicable, their third-party support. This support may include an incident response firm, legal services provider and/or a cyber insurer. Previous RUSI research has identified that the decision to pay or not pay a negotiated ransom lies with the senior leadership at a victim organisation. This decision may be informed by advice and guidance from third-party support, but the decision ultimately rests with the victim organisation. Participants emphasised that, at present, a red flag from a sanctions compliance check is the only legal impediment to a prospective ransom payment in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to industry participants, there is significant scope for ambiguity with respect to ransomware sanctions checks. While ransomware groups are typically keen to establish and maintain the reputation of their “brand name”, they will obfuscate the personal identities of those in the group. However, the UK’s ransomware sanctions regime targets named individuals rather than groups. Contemporary ransomware payments are likely to go to multiple individuals within a given group. The prevalence of RaaS means that it is common for ransomware payments to be divided on a ratio basis between affiliates and operators. There is also a growing incidence of “lone wolves” operating without branding, as observed by private operators at the workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industry representatives at the workshop described that the entity responsible for sanctions compliance therefore has to try to ascertain whether there is a reasonable risk of a prospective ransom payment going to a named sanctioned individual. They will typically use a range of identifiers to make this judgement call. These may include but are not necessarily limited to: the cryptocurrency wallet address; IP addresses; Tox chat IDs; the computer code used to conduct the attack; and the language expressions used by the criminals in ransom notes and negotiations. One participant emphasised that each individual facilitator needs to determine their own risk tolerance. They argued that an ideal sanctions check would follow a typology using code, syntax and linguistic overlap. However, the judgement call on the degree of overlap is highly likely to be inconclusive and there is a risk of false positives and false negatives. Building on this point, participants described how the judgement call felt like “rolling the dice”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the workshop highlighted that ransomware sanctions checks are, at present, more of an art than a science, with, as one workshop participant put it, “no silver bullet for due diligence”. There is inadequate clarity on what constitutes a sufficient sanctions check. Guidance from governments including the UK’s was described as “intentionally ambiguous”. Participants explained how they had attempted to get clarity from government entities such as OFAC and OFSI, but that this was not forthcoming. Additionally, at the time of writing, there had not been any fine or censure for any ransomware sanctions breach that could provide further insights into what the regulator found to be insufficient checks, despite publicly known instances of alleged sanctions breaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workshop participants who offer ransomware intermediary services described how they took a “conservative approach” to sanctions checks and would clearly explain their risk assessment to clients. These participants noted that they had refused to facilitate payments that they believed carried a sanctions risk. One participant referred to a case that they had supported where they believed there was a high sanctions risk; they refused to make the payment, but the client then went to another firm who ultimately completed the transaction. In the participant’s view, the 80/20 RaaS payment split (80% to the affiliate; 20% to the operator) for that payment included money going to a sanctioned entity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants agreed that this anecdotal case highlights a challenge. The ambiguity in the sanctions regime enables ransomware intermediaries – and ransomware victims – to determine their own judgement call based on their own risk tolerance. This means that there may be a spectrum across the market, ranging from “conservative” approaches at one end, through to “permissive” approaches at the other. Previous reporting has also indicated the presence of extreme outlier practices, wherein intermediaries discreetly pay a ransom to the attackers and present this as an “IT solution” to the client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this means is that ransomware victims are, in the words of one workshop participant, able to “shop around for lower standards” so that they may ultimately be able to proceed with a payment. However, one participant noted that the workshop probably had an inherent selection bias; intermediaries who are moderated in their approach to sanctions compliance were more likely to attend a workshop on ransomware sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to emphasise that the workshop discussion did not label ransomware sanctions regimes as paper tigers. On the contrary, workshop participants emphasised that ransomware victims and ransomware intermediaries often have a genuine fear of the potential repercussions of breaching sanctions. Participants described how this fear had a tangible influence on the decision making journeys of ransomware victims by creating friction in the payment process. A participant described how it was good to create “inertia” and “make the victim jump through some hoops and think rationally about the situation”. Another participant agreed, noting that the introduction of the sanctions regimes had caused victims to “think twice” before proceeding with a payment. A ransomware intermediary participant suggested that they had seen increased “fear of OFAC” following the start of the Russia–Ukraine conflict, which had prompted increased demand for due diligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the workshop discussions indicated a mixed picture with respect to ransomware sanctions compliance. Participants outlined their approaches to sanctions compliance based on risk-averse practices. However, the obfuscated nature of ransomware forensics – combined with ambiguity in the sanctions regime – means that sanctions compliance is imprecise. Practitioners are having to rely, at least in part, on a subjective value judgement. Workshop participants argued that if clarity were needed, it would ultimately need to come from governments and regulators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-takeaways-and-policy-recommendations&quot;&gt;Key Takeaways and Policy Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop discussion highlighted that cyber sanctions have had several impacts on the ransomware criminal ecosystem, ransomware victim behaviours and the activities of ransomware intermediaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With respect to the criminals, cyber sanctions add some complexity to their operations – for instance, with respect to their conversion of cryptocurrency assets or their ability to travel internationally. There are also suggestions that sanctions carry a stigma for named individuals, which may foster consternation and distrust within RaaS communities. Where a figurehead of a ransomware group is named as a sanctioned entity, the whole group may become “unpayable” if there is a likely risk that a portion of any payment would go to the named individual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear from the workshop discussion that, even though no censure or fine has thus far been made against cyber sanctions breaches, the time lag of making a sanctions check and the fear of potential future penalties has added friction into the payment decision making process. Participants noted that the UK government is in an unenviable position of trying to sustain an impactful cyber sanctions regime while avoiding double-victimisation of victims of serious organised crime. This may, at least partially, explain the hesitancy for clarity from OFSI and the lack of censure to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, in the absence of effective prosecutions of international ransomware perpetrators, sanctions regimes are one of the few lighter-touch tools that the UK and like-minded countries can use to directly or indirectly affect known serious organised cybercriminals. However, at present, cyber sanctions are an imperfect tool. There may be opportunities for the UK and like-minded countries to refine their regimes. The workshop concluded with the identification of the policy considerations proposed below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhance transparency from OFSI.&lt;/strong&gt; Industry participants expressed frustration about the lack of transparency and guidance from governments and regulators. Participants described how they had proactively reached out to relevant government entities for clarity and had either received slow, nondescript and/or unhelpful responses, or no response at all. It is possible that this ineffective feedback risks disenfranchising well-meaning ransomware intermediaries and ransomware victims. The UK government should reflect on the status quo and assess whether the current approach is primed to achieve the government’s objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promote standardisation for sanctions checks.&lt;/strong&gt; Guidance should be calibrated to encourage more standardisation for sanctions checks. Outside of extreme cases, cyber sanctions checks are inherently inconclusive, with the risk of false positives and negatives. Two different sanctions compliance checkers – with differing experience and risk appetites – may come to opposing conclusions about the sanctions risk of a given ransomware payment. The government should consider how it can support increased standardisation for sanctions checks. This could include, for instance, clear guidance on which technical indicators should be used to make a check, and how they should be meaningfully assessed. Given that the UK government is currently proposing a “payment authorisation regime”, which would require victims to both request permission to pay a ransom and perform their own sanctions checks, spreading best practice and transparency on sanctions checks will become more important.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Designate more targets at a faster pace.&lt;/strong&gt; If ransomware sanctions do have tangible – if limited – impacts on the criminals perpetrating and monetising attacks, the UK government should be bold and implement more sanctions, more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upturn the bargain bucket.&lt;/strong&gt; Ransomware intermediary participants described how they were regulated as money service businesses, proactively sought external scrutiny through auditing, proactively reported incidents and shared information on request, and took a deliberately conservative approach to sanctions risk assessments. However, not all ransomware intermediaries proactively engage in such good citizenship. Some firms may adopt a “permissive” approach to sanctions compliance. Others may surreptitiously engage with the criminals, process a payment, and present this as a technical solution to a client. Research should be commissioned to understand the scope and scale of such behaviour among unscrupulous providers. Where such firms are based in the UK or like-minded partner countries, efforts should be made to scrutinise their activities and, where necessary, hold them to account.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthen alignment with international partners.&lt;/strong&gt; The UK has successfully collaborated with the US and Australia, but the EU has been less active in leveraging its cyber sanctions regime. The uncertainty about the prioritisation of cyber sanctions under the new US administration also raises concerns. The UK must ensure that international partners collaborate closely to enhance the effectiveness of designations and achieve consistent enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, while the use of sanctions was welcomed by workshop participants, their effectiveness has been limited by a number of shortcomings that could be addressed by some simple, focused actions.&lt;/p&gt;

As the United States shifts toward the Indo-Pacific and Russia continues to pursue its territorial ambitions, what might arms control look like after the war in Ukraine?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Inasmuch as arms control efforts seek to affect future events, we have to be conscious of the degree of our uncertainty about the future, in which we are instructed by our experience with surprise in the past. Perhaps an appreciation for this uncertainty will inhibit our choice of arms control objectives, but if so, that is simply the way the ball bounces.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-bernard-brodie&quot;&gt;– Bernard Brodie&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end of the war in Ukraine could present unique opportunities for arms control and reducing the risk of further instability in the Euro-Atlantic region. With the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) set to expire in February 2026, arms control as we know it is at risk of ending, with no clear successor to facilitate further cooperative efforts to reduce or limit strategic forces. Despite pressure for a peace settlement in Ukraine and follow-on arms control measures, Europe appears likely to remain a theater of instability due to increasing reliance on nuclear weapons, Russian territorial ambitions, and a weakening nuclear order. Additionally, the United States’ gradual shift away from Europe and toward the Indo-Pacific over the past decade has created the potential for a deterrence gap in the region. With these challenges in mind, what might arms control look like after the war in Ukraine?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CSIS Project on Nuclear Issues set out to explore prospects for arms control with Russia following the end of the war in Ukraine. The project developed four alternative futures and two black swan scenarios for the Euro-Atlantic security environment after the war in Ukraine ends and convened a series of scenario-based discussions with cross-generational U.S. and European experts. The alternative futures approach allowed the authors to avoid the perennial challenge of tracking a moving target and instead identify consistent trends, along with potential moments of opportunity, for strengthening strategic stability and arms control. The scenarios included bloc competition, strategic disadvantage, strategic advantage, disordered competition, a change of leadership in Moscow, and nuclear use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scenario-based discussions and analysis yielded two main findings: Competition with Russia is unlikely to end, and Europe is poised to emerge as an increasingly influential player in strategic stability and arms control in the Euro-Atlantic region. The project also identified findings from the black swan scenarios, including that arms control is personality agnostic and that a change of leadership in the Kremlin will not necessarily lead to a breakthrough in arms control in the short term. Additionally, the nuclear order—including the nuclear taboo—is weakening and requires immediate attention as part of any future arms control agenda. The implications of these findings are that future arms control efforts will have to work in tandem with geostrategic competition, and enhancing deterrence should be the top priority. As such, arms control mechanisms will need to be flexible, and creating time limits on agreements is one particular tool for facilitating cooperation in an era of strategic competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the project’s findings, the authors identified six opportunities for arms control after the war in Ukraine, which include specific recommendations for the United States, key actors within Europe, the P5 (the five recognized nuclear weapon states under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT]—China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States), and nonnuclear weapon states committed to strengthening norms of non-use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Trump administration should immediately pursue talks with Russia to agree to observe New START central limits for up to three years after the treaty expires in February 2026. This agreement should rely on national technical means for verification while establishing a standing arms control dialogue to provide transparency into its implementation and explore opportunities for a more permanent, long-term agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States should enhance its nuclear deterrent by preparing to upload warheads if Russia violates the three-year agreement, expanding capacity in the National Labs, and developing additional delivery platforms, including nuclear sea-launched cruise missiles and a new stand-off capability. All of these measures can be paused or rolled back in the event of a breakthrough in arms control.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Europe should develop a new strategy for deterrence and arms control that prioritizes flexibility. Specific steps for strengthening deterrence should include increased defense spending and a coordinated effort to increase defense production, such as by adopting a “comparative advantage” approach, in order to take on a greater burden-sharing role within NATO and to hedge against an uncertain future. Additionally, France and the United Kingdom should modestly expand their strategic arsenals—such as by reintroducing an air leg of the British deterrent—and France should join the NATO Nuclear Planning Group as an observer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Europe should remain open to nuclear arms control opportunities, such as time-bound cooperative efforts, and continue to promote the Vienna Document as a tool for conventional arms control and transparency building. Such efforts will not only create opportunities for engaging with Russia—and potentially China—but also demonstrate an enduring commitment to arms control and the NPT.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The NPT P5 process should establish a Crisis Stability Initiative to identify risks of nuclear escalation during the war in Ukraine through a series of dialogues aimed at sharing national perceptions throughout the conflict. The initiative should also develop a crisis stability tool kit, and the P5 should agree to a set of shared commitments regarding crisis communication and risk reduction.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;States from the Global South, or Global Middle Ground, should issue a joint statement in NPT and UN forums calling on all parties to continue to abide by the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the Outer Space Treaty. States Parties to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons should issue a joint statement in NPT forums condemning the role of nuclear threats in Russia’s war in Ukraine and stop treating all nuclear-armed states as a monolith. Instead, they should seize this unique and powerful opportunity for strengthening strategic stability by upholding norms of non-use.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This more flexible approach to arms control in an era of strategic competition admittedly comes with challenges. Any nuclear or conventional buildup could be perceived as escalatory by Moscow and Beijing. Europeans may struggle to develop a united, consistent, and coordinated strategy for deterrence and arms control. Additionally, a more competitive approach by the United States and Europe could become a self-fulfilling prophecy, undermining both prospects for arms control with Moscow and assurance among allies. It is essential, therefore, that Washington and European capitals consistently demonstrate an openness to arms control and dialogue, and put the ball in Moscow and Beijing’s court to meaningfully engage in strengthening strategic stability and ushering in a new era of arms control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is winter 2027. Europe has enjoyed two years of relative calm following a peace settlement between Russia and Ukraine in which Moscow secured territorial gains and imposed limits on Ukraine’s military forces. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been forced out of power in Kyiv. Immediately following the peace settlement, U.S. President Donald J. Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin secured an arms control agreement to maintain the central limits of the 2010 New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) for an additional five years after its expiration in 2026. The Trump administration is moving ahead with plans to withdraw the U.S. conventional military presence from Europe, and the credibility of U.S. nuclear guarantees to Europe is questionable. European governments are struggling to maintain public support for defense spending following the 2025 peace settlement. Intelligence now shows that not only has Russia ignored the agreed-upon limits on its strategic delivery systems, but it is also just weeks away from deploying a nuclear weapon in space, in violation of the Outer Space Treaty (OST). Additionally, Russia has begun amassing troops on its border with Moldova, in the contested region of Transnistria. What options does NATO have to respond?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This hypothetical scenario demonstrates the risk of chronic instability in Europe following the war in Ukraine. Russia’s regional ambitions and nuclear rhetoric, dating back at least to its 2008 invasion of Georgia, suggest that Moscow may not want stability in Europe. Instead, it is pursing instability and increasing nuclear risks to achieve its strategic objectives. The scenario also tests the limits of what is possible for arms control. In recent years, the United States has repeatedly approached Russia to re-engage in strategic stability dialogues, but Moscow has consistently refused. As a justification for suspending participation in New START in 2023, for example, Putin pointed to fundamental disagreements about Euro-Atlantic security and claimed, “They (NATO) want to inflict a strategic defeat on us and also to get to our nuclear sites.” When New START expires in February 2026, a rich historical legacy of strategic arms control could die with it, and there may be no returning to the status quo ante for arms control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CSIS Project on Nuclear Issues set out to explore prospects for arms control with Russia following an end to the war in Ukraine. The project developed four alternative futures and two black swan scenarios for the Euro-Atlantic security environment after the war ended and convened a series of scenario-based discussions with cross-generational U.S. and European experts. The alternative futures approach allowed the authors to avoid the perennial challenge of tracking a moving target and instead identify consistent trends, along with potential moments of opportunity, for strengthening strategic stability and arms control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across all six scenarios, which included variations in Russian military prowess and alliance unity, experts agreed that the United States and its allies should not assume that Russia’s territorial ambitions will be satisfied by a peace settlement with Ukraine. Instead, Moscow may actually be emboldened by the outcome of the war in Ukraine—whether favorable or unfavorable—and continue to increase reliance on nuclear threats. Another important finding was that a united Europe has the potential to become a major player in strategic stability and arms control. In her speech at the 2025 Munich Security Conference, European Union President Ursula von der Leyen said there was a “need for Europe not only to speak frankly but also to act accordingly. I believe that when it comes to European security, Europe has to do more.” Because of the interrelationship between deterrence and arms control, “doing more” may not only entail enhancing conventional deterrence but also playing a more influential role in prospects for strategic arms control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this means for the United States and Europe is that any arms control agreements will need to prioritize and work in tandem with enhancing deterrence, while allowing for flexibility in responding to an uncertain and dangerous geopolitical landscape. Historically, strategic stability has been defined in terms of the United States’ and Russia’s perception that they possess survivable second-strike nuclear forces. In 2023, the bipartisan Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States, or the Strategic Posture Commission, defined strategic stability as “A condition in which the political relations and military balance between states that pose an existential threat to each other is such that they perceive neither a compelling need nor a viable opportunity to use military force to advance their interests at the expense of the other state.” This definition allows for a broader approach to strategic stability, including nonnuclear capabilities, along with the underlying political incentives driving competition. However, to be sure, strategic stability remains a contested term. Arms control, as a tool for strengthening strategic stability, need not happen in the absence of competition, but rather can occur in a worsening security environment, between potential adversaries, without necessarily involving like-for-like exchanges. It might not even focus on capabilities but could instead facilitate communication in the midst of an ongoing rivalry. Another implication of the project’s findings is that while historically strategic stability has been a two-player game, increasing European strategic autonomy, along with the rise of China, requires rethinking what strategic stability looks like in a multiplayer game and how to strengthen it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report proceeds in three sections. First, it provides a brief summary and analysis of the six alternative futures and their implications for arms control. Second, it presents the project’s main findings. The primary findings from across the scenarios include enduring competition and a growing role for Europe, but other findings touch on the potential for arms control in the event of leadership changes and the health of international institutions and norms. Finally, the report provides an arms control agenda for the United States and Russia, Europe, the P5, and the wider international nuclear order. It identifies time-bound agreements as a likely tool for pursuing arms control in an era of strategic competition, while allowing for flexibility. The third section also identifies key questions for “player Europe” to address in considering its new role in the international system. It outlines various policy options for how Europe might pursue deterrence and arms control in tandem, ranging from extreme autonomy to bilateral alliances. The end of the war in Ukraine will not be the end of Russia’s destabilizing ambitions. The game is now on for Europe to rearm, coordinate a strategy for deterrence and assurance in the Euro-Atlantic, and embrace a more influential role in arms control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;arms-control-futures&quot;&gt;Arms Control Futures&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arms control and deterrence have worked in tandem at least since the 1967 Harmel Report, which recognized NATO’s “first function” as deterrence while also recommending a “balanced reduction of military forces” and concluding that “Military security and a policy of détente are not contradictory but complementary.” Stimson Center Co-Founder Michael Krepon’s definition of arms control, which includes a range of mechanisms—from legally binding treaties to informal agreements on crisis communication—directly ties it to deterrence: “Deterrence requires effective lines of communication, codes of conduct, tacit understandings, political compacts, and formal treaties to help prevent the battlefield use of nuclear weapons. We call these diplomatic methods of reassurance arms control. The fundamental purposes of arms control are to stabilize nuclear rivalries and reduce nuclear danger.” The end of the war in Ukraine may prove to be a unique opportunity for these arms control mechanisms, either as part of a peace settlement or in the aftermath of any political rapprochement. Given the rapidly changing state of play in European security, along with the tattered state of arms control, exploring opportunities for arms control presents a methodological challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project used an alternative futures methodology to develop scenarios for the Euro-Atlantic security environment in late 2027. The scenarios accounted for variations in adversary capabilities, along with cooperation between Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea, and for differences in NATO alliance cohesion—ranging from renewed NATO unity to the waning credibility of U.S. extended nuclear deterrence in Europe. The scenarios also incorporated a range of potential outcomes from the war in Ukraine, such as a peace settlement favorable to Russia and European security guarantees to Ukraine. The scenarios are captured in Table 1, with full descriptions provided in Appendix A, and are characterized from the perspective of the NATO alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/aCXPgXf.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Scenarios for Euro-Atlantic Security&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project also included black swan scenarios involving a change of leadership in Moscow and the use of nuclear weapons to account for significant developments that could shape the future of arms control but were not covered in the alternative futures. The scenarios were then discussed in a series of expert workshops with U.S. and European participants. Additionally, CSIS held a workshop with early-career researchers, which proved valuable in identifying a potentially important generational difference in attitudes toward institutions, as discussed below. For each scenario, participants identified (1) Russian, U.S., and European strategic objectives; (2) potential points of leverage to incentivize Russian participation in arms control; and (3) specific arms control opportunities. While the discussions largely focused on opportunities for nuclear arms control, conventional and non-kinetic capabilities were also considered in the scenario-based discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scenario 1: Bloc Competition.&lt;/strong&gt; In this scenario, NATO provides security guarantees to Ukraine as part of a peace settlement, but Russia continues to deepen its ties with China, Iran, and North Korea. The result is two competing blocs, each pursuing advanced nuclear and conventional capabilities. Russia remains determined to divide European allies, and the sustainability of U.S. support is questionable. In this scenario, the United States, Russia, and European states could be incentivized to participate in arms control for economic reasons, such as to free up resources for conventional rebuilding following the war in Ukraine. In scenario-based workshop discussions, experts assumed that Russia will use arms control to buy time and gain a strategic advantage over the United States and its allies, who will struggle to allocate the necessary resources to deter renewed Russian aggression in Europe, particularly due to a U.S. shift toward the Indo-Pacific. Attempts at nuclear arms control, however, will be challenging, as Russia continues to insist on the inclusion of French and British nuclear forces, while the United States similarly demands Chinese engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scenario 2: Strategic Disadvantage.&lt;/strong&gt; In this scenario, Russia has achieved a favorable peace settlement in the war in Ukraine and concludes that its nuclear saber-rattling had the desired effect. Moscow plans to continue relying on nuclear weapons for risk manipulation. With the war in Ukraine concluded, the United States shifts its focus away from Europe, and NATO becomes a fractured alliance struggling to uphold its security commitments. As a result, Europe is forced to become ruthlessly pragmatic and efficient in defense investments to fill a potential U.S. “deterrence gap.” Europe has limited leverage to incentivize Russia into arms control, aside from potential economic benefits. However, Europeans remain distrustful of Russia’s intentions and suspect that Moscow would use any arms control as an opportunity to build up its forces and achieve strategic supremacy in the region—potentially including further territorial aggression. In this scenario, there may be opportunities for a U.S.-Russia bilateral agreement, such as a time-limited extension of New START limits or a performative agreement similar to the 2002 Moscow Treaty. In the absence of credible U.S. nuclear guarantees, proliferation pressures increase for U.S. allies, putting the NPT at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scenario 3: Strategic Advantage.&lt;/strong&gt; The war in Ukraine ends on terms unfavorable to Russia, forcing Moscow to concede all territory gained since 2022 and weakening its partnerships with China and North Korea. The United States and key European actors provide security guarantees to Ukraine in exchange for its agreement not to join NATO, and the alliance is strengthened through an expanded dual-capable aircraft (DCA) mission and enhanced conventional deterrence. Russia faces economic constraints and political instability, creating opportunities to use economic incentives as leverage for arms control. Additionally, arms control could serve as a “PR win” for Putin by reaffirming Russia’s status as a nuclear peer with the United States while offering a face-saving option for reducing defense spending. In this scenario, NATO is eager for arms control to codify the new status quo and strengthen transparency and predictability. Options for arms control could include bilateral limits on all nuclear weapons—either through a New START follow-on agreement or a Presidential Nuclear Initiatives (PNI)–style agreement—along with recommitting to existing agreements such as the OST; however, the United States will continue to reject any reduction agreements until Beijing participates, and Moscow may take the same stance regarding France and the United Kingdom, though with limited bargaining leverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scenario 4: Disordered Competition.&lt;/strong&gt; Russia, the United States, and Europe all face economic and domestic political pressures but remain entrenched in their strategic positions. Russia makes a third attempt to seize Ukraine assuming that the United States will not intervene in Europe due to its focus on deterring China. Europe is left to deter further Russian aggression, determine the extent of its support for Ukrainian independence, and coordinate defense planning. In this scenario, arms control could center on crisis communication and risk reduction mechanisms, but options for strategic arms control would be limited. Russia will insist on French and British participation, while Europeans refuse any arms control dialogue as long as Moscow continues to threaten sovereign territories backed by nuclear threats; however, the P5 process could serve as a forum for dialogue to prevent escalation to nuclear use. Another opportunity lies in leveraging existing nuclear treaties and mobilizing the wider international community to uphold the nuclear taboo and pressure all parties to refrain from nuclear escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scenario 5: Change of Leadership in Moscow.&lt;/strong&gt; In this first black swan scenario, the war in Ukraine continues into the fall of 2025, but Russian military activity slows following reports that Putin is ill. Eventually, Putin succumbs to his illness and dies, leaving no clear successor. As a result, decisionmaking in Moscow is crippled for months. Ukraine uses this period to strengthen its frontlines and make gains in Donetsk. In this scenario, Russia’s objectives will be driven by a desire to demonstrate the credibility of a new regime, which could include securing a decisive victory in Ukraine and/or securing an agreement with the United States. The new leadership may prioritize stabilizing the economy over defense investments, in which case arms control could serve as a face-saving option for reducing strategic forces. However, it is equally possible that the new regime adopts a hardline approach to shore up its political base within the Kremlin and rejects any Western overtures for dialogue. This scenario is perhaps the most uncertain and least stable of the six, despite repeated expert claims in discussion about other scenarios that “arms control won’t be possible as long as Putin is in the Kremlin.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scenario 6: Nuclear Use.&lt;/strong&gt; In the second black swan scenario, peace negotiations are deadlocked, and Ukraine and Russia reengage in military conflict. Due to renewed European resolve to support Ukraine, NATO members launch a conventional strike on Russian forces in Ukraine, signaling their commitment to the renewed conflict and threatening Russia with a decisive battlefield defeat. In response, Russia detonates multiple sub-kiloton-yield nuclear weapons over a command post and battlefield positions in northern Ukraine, killing thousands of Ukrainian military personnel and allowing Russian forces to break through the frontline, forcing an unfavorable peace settlement on Kyiv. NATO responds conventionally, and the international community expresses widespread condemnation of Russia’s nuclear use. By 2027, however—one year after the detonation—international outrage has faded, the majority of Global South states have normalized relations with Moscow, and China has resumed support for the Russian defense industry. Prospects for arms control are mixed. On the one hand, breaking the nuclear taboo after 80 years of non-use, along with the subsequent humanitarian and environmental consequences, prompts calls for ambitious arms control measures to reduce the risks of further nuclear use. On the other hand, the lack of sustained international outrage and Russia’s argument that nuclear weapons use against a military target was justified under international law when the “existence of the state” was perceived to be at risk could suggest a normalization of nuclear threats and small-scale use. In this scenario, the wider international response could play a decisive role in shaping the prospects for arms control and preventing further nuclear use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;competitive-arms-control-and-player-europe&quot;&gt;Competitive Arms Control and “Player Europe”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two main themes emerged across all scenarios: Competition with Russia is likely to continue after the war in Ukraine, and Europe is emerging as a more significant player in deterrence and arms control in the Euro-Atlantic region. While these two trends were evident across all scenarios, two additional insights emerged from the black swan scenarios, aligning with broader findings: A change in leadership in Moscow will not necessarily lead to a breakthrough in arms control, and the nuclear taboo is weakening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;competition-with-russia-might-not-end-anytime-soon&quot;&gt;Competition with Russia Might Not End Anytime Soon&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key finding across all six scenarios is that U.S. and/or European competition with Russia is likely to continue after any peace settlement in Ukraine, and Euro-Atlantic security will not revert to the status quo ante. Throughout his rule, Putin has expressed a “persistent sense of vulnerability” and publicly voiced a fear of encirclement. In his 2007 Munich Security Conference speech, he expressed disdain for the U.S.-led global order, saying, “Unilateral and frequently illegitimate actions have not resolved any problems. Moreover, they have caused new human tragedies and created new centres of tension.” Following Russia’s 2014 invasion of Crimea, Putin declared, “we have every reason to assume that the infamous policy of containment, led in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, continues today.” Immediately before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, Putin asserted that NATO’s “main goal is to contain Russia’s development. This is the whole point. In this sense, Ukraine is simply a tool to reach this goal.” Based on our scenario analysis, Russia’s strategic objectives at the war’s conclusion could include continuing territorial advances in former Soviet states to expand a “buffer zone,” attempting further incursions into Ukraine as part of a face-saving strategy, or perceiving a peace settlement favorable to Moscow as acquiescence to Putin’s ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all of the project’s scenarios, a peace settlement over Ukraine did not readily facilitate a return to traditional arms control. This was due to enduring distrust in Moscow, Washington, and European capitals, as well as conflicting arms control priorities. Russia has repeatedly violated or suspended participation in arms control agreements. According to former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Eric Edelman and former National Security Council Senior Director for Defense Policy and Arms Control Franklin Miller, Russia has violated nine major agreements under Putin. They argue, “Given this deliberate and well-documented track record, the bar for holding Moscow accountable for its actions under any agreement it might sign regarding Ukraine’s future, much less the kinds of nuclear arms control agreements in which President Trump has also shown an interest, should be exceedingly high.” Russia’s track record was a key inhibitor of arms control across the project’s scenarios. In most cases, participants feared that Russia would attempt to use arms control both to constrain the West and to gain strategic advantage. For example, Russia could pursue limits on regional missile defenses that would asymmetrically benefit Moscow. In this context, arms control was perceived as a potential tool for undermining strategic stability. In short, the scenario analysis revealed that future strategic stability will likely depend on waiting for—and attempting to deter—the next round of Russian territorial aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of the scenario discussions indicated that Russia would reduce its reliance on nuclear weapons following the war in Ukraine. In fact, Moscow may be emboldened by the war’s conclusion, viewing its strategy of coercion as successful. Russian nuclear rhetoric evolved in tandem with its activities on the battlefield, beginning with Putin’s threat on the day of the February 24, 2022 invasion: “No matter who tries to stand in our way . . . Russia will respond immediately, and the consequences will be such as you have never seen in your entire history.” Subsequent nuclear signaling included warnings that attacks on illegally annexed Ukrainian territories could trigger nuclear responses, as well as large-scale nuclear exercises, as Russia suffered battlefield losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s rhetoric has been matched by a buildup of its nuclear forces. In congressional testimony, defense expert Austin Long catalogued new Russian nuclear platforms under development, including the SS-X-30 heavy intercontinental ballistic missile and Status-6 autonomous underwater drone. Long also warned that Russia was pursuing a nuclear posture with options that “would include limited nuclear use in dire circumstances. Yet dire circumstances, from a Russian perspective, could occur very quickly in a conflict.” Russia’s nuclear doctrine states that Russia could use nuclear weapons in response to a “critical threat” to its sovereignty. The type of action that would constitute a “critical threat” to Russian sovereignty is ambiguous, however, allowing Moscow to justify nuclear use under a broad range of circumstances. Experts consistently expressed skepticism that Russia would abandon its nuclear trajectory due to a peace settlement: If Russia emerges from the war strategically weaker, it may continue relying on nuclear weapons to compensate; if it emerges stronger, it could be emboldened to double down on its nuclear saber-rattling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experts concluded that Russia has a fundamentally different perception of the Euro-Atlantic security environment and what “strategic stability” in that context would entail. Many of their observations from the workshops, which were held under the Chatham House Rule, have been reflected in recent scholarship on the topic. As described by Kristin Ven Bruusgaard, “NATO and Russian policymakers disagree on the key challenges to crisis stability in Europe. NATO policymakers express concern that Russia may consider a direct military attack on NATO as a continuation of the war in Ukraine. Russian policymakers worry that NATO or the West is seeking to undermine the Russian state on its periphery and from within.” The scenarios all pointed to the potential for economic incentives for arms control, but any reductions or limitations with meaningful economic benefits would likely be complicated by enduring distrust, ongoing competition, and the anticipation of strategic instability. Since its invasion of Ukraine in 2014, Moscow has proven somewhat impervious to economic pressure, such as sanctions. Additionally, it appears to have either avoided or disregarded any international reputational costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;multiplayer-arms-control&quot;&gt;Multiplayer Arms Control&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second main finding of the project was that Europe is playing an increasingly significant role not only in deterrence within the Euro-Atlantic, but also in shaping prospects for future arms control agreements. Scenario-based discussions acknowledged the challenge of defining “Europe” as a geopolitical actor, particularly due to variations in threat perception, domestic politics, and nuclear status. For the purposes of this project, “Europe” primarily refers to European members of NATO, though the term can encompass a complex and diverse mix of states. In all but one of the project scenarios, U.S. and European priorities were not in clear alignment due to the U.S. shift in focus toward the Indo-Pacific and potential domestic political factors. Depending on the outcome of the war in Ukraine and the process by which any peace settlement is reached, U.S. and European objectives may further diverge, leading Europe to consider exploring greater strategic autonomy from Washington. Amid the war in Ukraine, Europe has already demonstrated its importance in conventional military capabilities. Continued investment in the European defense industrial base could ensure that Europe sustains this influence in the long term. The new €150 billion loan plan proposed by the European Commission forces participants to purchase European-made equipment and will ensure that any rapid effort to acquire new capabilities also strengthens the European defense industrial base in the long term. Additionally, France and the United Kingdom have signaled their intent to increase defense spending beyond NATO’s 2 percent target, while Poland is nearing 5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numerous experts in the scenario-based discussions pointed to Russia’s insistence that French and British nuclear forces be included in any future agreement. Russian Ambassador to the United States Anatoly Antonov has repeatedly stated that Russia’s priority is to engage France and the United Kingdom in arms control dialogue, particularly “in light of London’s recent decision to increase the maximum level of nuclear warheads by 40%,” referring to the 2021 Integrated Review. In many of the scenarios, however, Europe is expected to prioritize enhancing its conventional and nuclear deterrence capabilities, which could pose a challenge for any arms control initiatives entailing reductions or limitations on capabilities. In some scenarios, Europe appeared positioned to play a spoiler role in strategic arms control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the importance of Europe in future arms control, multiplayer arms control is further complicated by the importance of including China’s nuclear forces in any future agreement for Washington. During scenario discussions, participants generated numerous ideas for bilateral arms control, some of which are discussed below, but they were skeptical of their long-term prospects due to the need to include Beijing. The Strategic Posture Commission concluded, “The ideal scenario for the United States would be a trilateral agreement that could effectively verify and limit all Russian, Chinese, and U.S. nuclear warheads and delivery systems.” Additionally, in his February 2025 comments expressing an interest in “denuclearization” and arms control, Trump was explicit that this should include both Russia and China. Thus far, Beijing has rejected attempts at arms control on the grounds of enduring U.S. support for Taiwan and because of an asymmetry in arsenals. For example, in July 2024, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that it was suspending upcoming arms control negotiations with the United States over U.S. arms sales to Taiwan. The United States’ focus on incorporating China into arms control will also persist after the end of the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;black-swans-dont-wait-for-a-gorbachev-moment-and-the-nuclear-order-is-wobbly&quot;&gt;Black Swans: Don’t Wait for a Gorbachev Moment, and the Nuclear Order Is Wobbly&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One surprising finding from the scenario analysis was that prospects for arms control are seemingly personality agnostic. In the black swan scenario, wherein Putin dies and there is a leadership change in Moscow, arms control opportunities did not flourish, at least in the 2027 timeframe. Workshop participants pointed to the political leadership surrounding Putin, which would likely produce his replacement and share his worldview. Putin’s successor may be able to provide top-down support for rapprochement and arms control, but they would likely first need to consolidate power among traditional hardliners, build trust with U.S. and European counterparts, and surround themself with like-minded policymakers to execute their vision, as occurred in the case of Mikhail Gorbachev. An additional challenge would be reshaping public attitudes in Russia toward the West to facilitate rebuilding trust. In terms of arms control, this finding from the scenario-based discussions doesn’t rule out any potential agreements but suggests that they would likely be performative in the short term. In many ways, this finding challenges conventional wisdom that a change in leadership can produce arms control breakthroughs, such as the arrival of Gorbachev in the 1980s, and recommends a more sanguine approach to the influence of personality, even in authoritarian regimes, over arms control in the short to medium term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second black swan scenario produced an equally pessimistic conclusion in terms of prospects for future arms control. In a scenario of nuclear use, the international community succeeded in the short term but failed in the long term to hold Russia accountable, with dangerous implications for both the nuclear taboo and the wider nuclear order. The arms control architecture is now a shell of its former self. Russia has systematically undermined the practice of bilateral strategic arms control because it believes such agreements no longer serve its interests and, according to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, the United States’ interest in arms control is based on an attempt “to try to establish control over [Russia’s] nuclear arsenal and minimize nuclear risks for itself.” Additionally, the nuclear order is crumbling, and long-standing pillars of the regime, such as the NPT, risk sliding into irrelevance due to a failure to reach consensus, along with a muted international response to Russia’s nuclear saber-rattling. To be clear, the NPT does not appear to be at risk of some dramatic collapse sparked by a cascade of withdrawals; rather, it risks a gradual descent toward a hollow treaty that is still in force but lacking in political buy-in. The end of the war in Ukraine will not suddenly revive the nuclear order, so this wider challenge for arms control agreements such as the NPT and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) will also remain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final finding came primarily from next-generation experts, who posed fundamental questions about the enduring value of institutions. One participant posed the question, “How hard should we fight” to keep institutions like the NPT, but also NATO? This also reflected a geographic difference among participants, with European experts focusing on how to keep the United States engaged in NATO and preserving the alliance, whereas U.S. participants were more focused on the two-peer challenge and balancing deterrence in both Europe and the Indo-Pacific. Next-generation experts offered a creative vision for finding a balance between preserving existing institutions and pursuing new, more inclusive approaches to security and arms control, such as formalizing the role of the private sector or civil society organizations in traditional diplomatic forums. This finding not only offers a valuable framing for the future of arms control—what is worth saving?—but also demonstrates the value of cross-generational and early-career engagement in discussions about seemingly intractable security and defense challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;integrated-arms-control-in-practice&quot;&gt;“Integrated Arms Control” in Practice&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2022, CSIS published a report on integrated arms control that advocated for a more flexible approach to arms control to address a rapidly changing security environment. The report outlined a “menu of options” for pursuing arms control in an era of strategic competition, allowing for flexibility in format, verification, membership, and limits. This adaptability would enable arms control strategies to accommodate new agreements, adopt different modalities, or modify existing agreements. The end of the war in Ukraine could present an opportunity to apply the report’s concepts and draw from its menu of options to develop new arms control opportunities and a refreshed arms control agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But arms control is not the only tool for strengthening deterrence. For decades, scholars and policymakers have emphasized the need to broaden the concept of strategic stability to account for nonnuclear capabilities, as well as broader political factors and capabilities that are not easily quantifiable, such as emerging technologies like cyber. An overarching finding from this project is that strategic stability must also expand to encompass a wider range of actors; it is no longer a purely bilateral equation—if ever it was. Both China and “player Europe” will shape the strategic environment and have the potential to strengthen strategic stability through various tools, including arms control; however, it is worth remembering that arms control is but one tool for strengthening the condition of strategic stability and avoiding escalation to nuclear use. Other critical tools include deterrence and norms, which should also be considered in crafting new policy approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-return-to-us-russia-strategic-arms-control&quot;&gt;A Return to U.S.-Russia Strategic Arms Control?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most scenarios, there was no clear overlap in Russian or U.S. and European strategic objectives in arms control, nor in the capabilities they would want to see captured in any agreements. Moscow has indicated that it would want to see limits on nonnuclear capabilities, including long-range precision strike systems and missile defenses. An enduring Russian priority for decades has been to incorporate British and French nuclear forces into any future agreement, counting them toward “parity.” From the U.S. and European perspectives, the goal of future arms control agreements ranged from specific to conceptual. A primary specific interest was limiting and reducing Russian tactical nuclear weapons (TNWs). A 2024 State Department report on Russian TNWs stated that the United States “seeks to address Russian [nonstrategic nuclear weapons]” due to their ability to “alter the nature of a conflict, create the potential for uncontrolled escalation, and have strategic effects.” Other priorities could include re-establishing a commitment to existing agreements such as the OST and the CTBT. Broader objectives could include reestablishing transparency and implementing Transparency and Confidence-Building Measures (TCBMs) with Russia to improve predictability regarding the trajectory of its strategic forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realistically, treaty-based strategic arms control options may be extremely limited across the scenarios due to the crucial role of third parties. The United States will likely reject any nuclear arms control agreement that excludes China, while Beijing has maintained that it will not engage in negotiations as long as Russia and the United States possess substantially larger arsenals. A further complication arose in 2024 when China halted arms control consultations over U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, adding yet another hurdle to U.S.-China engagement on the issue. Similarly, Russia may continue to reject any nuclear arms control agreement that does not include European actors. Even within these constraints, however, opportunities for arms control may still exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One option might be for the United States and Russia to seek an agreement to continue abiding by the New START limits of 1,550 deployed warheads on 800 strategic delivery vehicles for up to three years. This would allow time for the lengthy and detailed process of negotiating a new strategic arms control agreement that includes additional actors. The agreement could be established through presidential directives, reflecting the increasingly close relationship between Trump and Putin. Such an agreement would have to rely on national technical means for verification but could also set up a standing arms control dialogue to provide transparency into the agreement’s implementation and explore opportunities for a more permanent, long-term agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, an agreement to abide by the limits set by New START could create momentum for a follow-on agreement and reduce the pressure to engage in an arms race on specific strategic systems. On the other hand, New START only limits strategic systems, meaning many of Russia’s most threatening systems in the eyes of Europe—such as novel and dual-use nonstrategic delivery vehicles like the Kh-47M2 Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missile—would likely remain unrestricted by any arms control treaty. Furthermore, while ensuring parity between Russian and U.S. strategic forces contributes to broader strategic stability, much of the treaty’s value lies in its extensive and invasive verification regime, which would be lost in a simple agreement to abide by its limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another option discussed in the scenarios was a performative arms control agreement, similar to the 2002 Moscow Treaty. Such an agreement might set an overall ceiling limit while allowing both the United States and Russia to determine their own strategic and sub-strategic limits. It could be negotiated relatively quickly, without verification, and with little or no engagement with allies. Such an agreement, however, would come with risks, including failing to account for Chinese strategic capabilities and, given Russia’s track record, potentially leaving the United States vulnerable to the consequences of Russian violations. A particular fear among Europeans is that the United States might grant Russia a sphere of influence in the Euro-Atlantic region as part of any arms control agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to any agreement, the United States will need to prepare to hedge. Specifically, it should enhance its nuclear deterrent by preparing to upload warheads if Russia no longer observes New START central limits, expanding capacity in the National Labs, and developing additional delivery platforms, to include nuclear sea-launched cruise missiles and a new standoff capability. In the past, the United States has created negotiating leverage by strengthening its conventional, nuclear, and missile defense capabilities to incentivize arms control engagement. A key advantage of many of these measures is that they can be paused or rolled back in the event of a breakthrough in arms control, providing both negotiating leverage and enhanced deterrence. If the United States can build leverage and offer opportunities for arms control engagement, the ball would remain in Moscow and Beijing’s court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;player-europe-strategic-stability-and-arms-control&quot;&gt;Player Europe, Strategic Stability, and Arms Control&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe is getting its house in order. For now, Europe seems relatively united in its objectives of deterring further Russian aggression in the region, though the specific means and sustainability of this approach are still being worked out. The real first step for Europe must be to develop a new strategy for deterrence, accounting for uncertainty in its relationship with the United States. This strategy will need to address a key question: How much strategic autonomy does Europe want vis-à-vis the United States? At one end of the spectrum is a relatively extreme form of autonomy, potentially including more independent nuclear capabilities (discussed in greater detail below), which may appeal to France and some Eastern European countries that feel the threat from Russia most acutely. At the other end is a hedging approach, in which European states maintain close relations with Washington—potentially on a more bilateral basis—while building the capacity and flexibility to act independently should the need arise. The relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom, for example, has withstood the test of time and historical challenges and should remain a priority on both sides of the Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A divide between the United States and Europe comes with significant risks. Greater strategic autonomy for Europe could lead to states unilaterally escalating with Moscow—either unintentionally or intentionally—such as by launching attacks inside Russia, whether kinetic or non-kinetic. This approach would be highly dangerous, as it could pull the continent into an uncoordinated and unwanted war while also carrying significant implications for the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, a reliance on bilateral alliances and a hedging approach could fracture European coordination in deterring Russia or leave the continent vulnerable to further aggression. This report does not offer a specific recommendation for where Europe should position itself on this spectrum of autonomy. Instead, it recommends that key European actors work together to develop a coherent strategy that enhances deterrence, allows for flexibility in the event of a U.S. withdrawal, and simultaneously strives to maintain strong ties with Washington, given the legacy of cooperation and the tangible benefits it has provided for European security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One recommendation that fulfills all of these objectives is for European states to continue increasing defense spending and coordinating their defense industrial bases. Europe could adopt a “comparative advantage” approach to defense planning by designating lead nations for specific defense investments and capabilities. For example, if one European country proves particularly efficient at producing drones, it should prioritize that capability, while another country that excels in munitions should focus on munitions production. Additionally, Europeans would need to make major investments to compensate for any withdrawal of U.S. conventional capabilities. For instance, most of NATO’s intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities rely on the United States, and Europe has yet to develop comparable capabilities. Ideally, this type of coordination could be conducted as part of NATO’s defense planning efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One key consideration for a new European defense strategy concerns independent nuclear forces. While the United States remains committed to its extended deterrence obligations to its allies, recent political shifts have prompted conversations in Europe about the credibility of that deterrent. France has been the most vocal of the European nuclear-armed states in openly discussing the concept of a European extended deterrence, with French President Emmanuel Macron repeatedly indicating his willingness to engage in such discussions with European allies. Statements from leaders in France, Germany, and Poland suggest that, in the absence of a credible and strong U.S. extended deterrent, they would be interested in pursuing additional nuclear capabilities—either through a European deterrent or independent nuclear weapons programs. Europe’s conventional investments, along with French proposals to expand its nuclear deterrent to include other European states, could complicate strategic decisionmaking for Russia. Options for enhancing European-led nuclear deterrence could include expanding French and British nuclear forces—such as adding an air leg to the British deterrent—or France becoming an observer in the NATO Nuclear Planning Group. As argued by CSIS experts Sean Monaghan and Doreen Horschig, however, debates about a European nuclear deterrent are a distraction from the real priority: strengthening conventional deterrence through increased combat power. The best option remains the continuation of a credible U.S. extended nuclear deterrent, both to prevent nuclear proliferation and to strengthen the NPT—a position that was universally acknowledged among U.S. and European workshop participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of its new strategy, Europe may also decide to develop a new arms control policy. Historically, European states have not been in perfect alignment on arms control. Countries in Eastern Europe and the Baltic states are typically skeptical of arms control, while Germany and the Netherlands are more positive, and France has historically focused its arms control efforts on the NPT, for example. But now, Europe can make or break future arms control efforts, whether that involves a new nuclear reductions treaty or conventional arms control, and it will cast a shadow over strategic considerations and balancing, especially for Moscow. A priority for the new arms control strategy should be flexibility, such as through time-limited agreements or the freedom to mix and match forces, or more informal approaches, like risk reduction measures within the P5 process. One specific opportunity might be a three-year limit on warheads in partnership with China, whereby the combined British and French nuclear forces, along with China, do not exceed a certain ceiling. Verification would rely on national technical means and open-source intelligence, so confidence in the agreement could be limited. It could provide some degree of predictability and gradually bring China into arms control dialogues. To be clear, the authors recognize that this proposal is highly unlikely not only because of China’s traditional position on arms control, but also due to France’s insistence on maintaining independence and not imposing constraints on its nuclear forces. Nonetheless, an openness to such discussions could increase pressure on Beijing and demonstrate an enduring commitment to arms control and the NPT on the part of Europe’s nuclear powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conventional arms control will also need to be a consideration in a European arms control strategy. European states remain committed to the Vienna Document, which provides a useful forum for information exchanges and transparency in conventional capabilities. The Vienna Document could prove particularly valuable in monitoring any ceasefire or peace settlement in Ukraine. A creative option, recently suggested by RAND, would involve geographic limits on conventional capabilities—specifically, limits “based on the geography of activities and deployments and perceived vulnerabilities” rather than explicit numerical caps on certain forces. The report suggests that “The sides could also agree to voluntary but coordinated self-restraint on naval and air activities in the Black and Baltic Seas and in the High North.” There are several reasons why Russia and Europe may have a common interest in geographical limits on the deployment of certain systems or activities. Russia has repeatedly linked its perception of strategic stability to the existence of a geographical buffer zone between itself and NATO. Limits on deployment locations, rather than numbers, would allow Europe to continue working toward qualitative and quantitative conventional superiority vis-à-vis Russia. This geographic approach, however, could exacerbate divisions within Europe because of different threat perceptions between Northern, Eastern, and Western European states. Such an agreement could leave one or more members of the alliance feeling left out in the cold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;risk-reduction-in-the-p5-process&quot;&gt;Risk Reduction in the P5 Process&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its challenges, the P5 process remains the best game in town for dialogue on risk reduction and laying the groundwork for multilateral strategic arms control. Established in 2009 as a signal that the P5 countries took their disarmament commitments under the NPT seriously, the P5 process has hosted a number of arms control proposals, including a missile launch notification regime, transparency into former nuclear test sites, and a formalized crisis communication channel between P5 capitals. While these have had limited success, the end of the war in Ukraine could provide a new impetus for such risk reduction efforts. An additional benefit of this approach will be the strengthening of the NPT in the process. There are at least three opportunities for the P5 process to advance arms control following the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, during the war in Ukraine, Russian military leaders apparently considered following through on their nuclear threats, bringing Europe closer to the nuclear brink than at any point since the Cold War. The war in Ukraine, therefore, should offer unique lessons for nuclear risk reduction efforts and crisis communication. The P5 should launch a Crisis Stability Initiative as a standing agenda item to first review the sources of instability during the war in Ukraine and perceptions among all parties about risks of nuclear use. The initiative should then identify tools for reducing these risks in the future by engaging a wider group of experts from nonnuclear weapon states, nongovernmental organizations, and next-generation researchers. This engagement-based approach can produce creative solutions, removed from many of the practical and political constraints of the P5 process itself, but then be tailored to the P5’s preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, based on the new Crisis Stability Initiative, the P5 could agree to a shared set of responsibilities and commitments to communicate and reduce the risks of misperception during a crisis. This might include a wider and renewed commitment to “hotlines” across all P5 members. These commitments could be included in the P5 deliverables to the NPT review process, further strengthening the nuclear order as a result. If such an initiative is too ambitious for the P5, an alternative would be a Track 2 dialogue or leveraging the P5 Track 2 and/or Young Professionals Network to identify potential shared commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final step would be for the P5 to expand their use of the common reporting form. As Mike Albertson, deputy director of the Center for Global Security Research, has argued, one of the greatest benefits of arms control is information exchanges. The common reporting form is a unique opportunity for such exchanges and would be particularly important in further socializing China with transparency building. China has become more involved in these efforts in recent years. In November 2024, for example, Chinese President Xi Jinping signed a joint understanding with then-U.S. President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to keep “human control” in nuclear decisionmaking. France and the United Kingdom have made similar statements, and Russia is the only member of the P5 refusing to make a “human in the loop” statement. Additionally, both the United States and China have notified one another of missile test launches, despite no formal agreement to do so. Continuing this trajectory with the common report form will be an important contribution to future arms control opportunities and again contribute to the NPT review process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strengthening-the-nuclear-order&quot;&gt;Strengthening the Nuclear Order&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next-generation experts asked the question, “What is worth fighting for?” among existing institutions. While it is tempting to say “all of it,” especially with regard to the nuclear order, that may be a challenge given the demise of traditional arms control tools in recent years. At least three treaties, however, remain and are worth a focused multilateral effort to maintain and strengthen: the NPT, the CTBT, and the OST. These treaties are important not only because they are some of the last remaining mechanisms with widespread international participation, including by nuclear possessors, but also because they are the foundation of nuclear norms. The NPT continues to have constraining power over nuclear proliferation, as withdrawal would likely come with extreme political and economic costs, as witnessed in the case of North Korea. This restraining power could be tested in the coming months and years, both because of Iran’s continued nuclear activities and increased enrichment, and because of concerns about allied proliferation in the face of questionable U.S. credibility. Maintaining the CTBT will not only strengthen the norm against a return to nuclear testing, which would include massive humanitarian and environmental consequences, but also slow the vertical proliferation of nuclear arsenals, especially in China. Finally, recent allegations against Russia highlighted the potentially catastrophic consequences of deploying a nuclear weapon in space, which could hold at risk international communication systems and the functioning of critical infrastructure in the United States and Europe. The OST is one of the best tools for pressuring Russia to refrain from such a move, but it requires a more robust international response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Global South or Global Middle Ground is poised to play an influential role in the arms control agenda and in upholding these treaties and norms. In addition to calling on all states to continue to observe existing treaties, these countries can take additional steps to strengthen the nuclear taboo and other nuclear norms. The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW), for example, currently has 73 full members and 94 signatories, and the treaty bans the threat of the use of nuclear weapons. While TPNW efforts to date have focused on the weapons themselves, resulting in a blanket approach that treats all nuclear possessors the same, a more targeted approach to norm-building—one that explicitly calls out bad behavior, such as threatening nuclear use as part of an illegal invasion—could both increase pressure on norm violators and strengthen the international order. States Parties to the TPNW should issue a joint statement in NPT forums condemning the role of nuclear threats in Russia’s war in Ukraine and stop treating all nuclear possessors as a monolith. Rather, they have a unique and powerful opportunity for strengthening strategic stability and reducing future nuclear risks by upholding norms of non-use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-coming-instability&quot;&gt;The Coming Instability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report has identified numerous opportunities for arms control after the war in Ukraine that prioritize enhancing deterrence and flexibility; however, these come with a host of challenges. First and foremost is the risk of an arms race, given that a buildup in U.S. and/or European conventional and nuclear forces could be perceived as escalatory by Moscow or Beijing. Not all buildups are created equal, of course, and not all buildups equate to an arms race. The risks associated with a buildup depend on its scale, speed, and perception. The buildups the authors recommend, therefore, should be accompanied by robust analysis of how they would be perceived by adversaries, inspiring risk reduction efforts to avoid escalation and falling into an action-reaction cycle. A related risk is groupthink: While this report has captured the overwhelming consensus of scenario-based discussions, there were occasional dissenters who suggested that Russia might change its course after a peace settlement in Ukraine. And while many of the report’s recommendations for enhancing deterrence can be scaled back in the event of rapprochement, they could be perceived as a lack of seriousness about arms control and inadvertently undermine dialogue or opportunities for cooperation, potentially becoming self-fulfilling prophecies. That is not in any way the authors’ intention, and above all, the authors recommend that the United States and Europe remain open to arms control opportunities and be prepared to capitalize on them when they present themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another challenge will be overcoming historical positions on what and who to include in arms control. While this report encourages flexibility in agreements to allow for hedging, some arms control positions may prove to be too entrenched to allow even short-term cooperation or dialogue. For example, missile defense has historically proven a sticking point in U.S.-Russia arms control negotiations and may be again. In reaction to the establishment of an Aegis Ashore battery in Poland in 2024, Russia lamented that U.S. missile defenses in Europe “leads to undermining strategic stability, increasing strategic risks and, as a result, to an increase in the overall level of nuclear danger.” To take another example, the above analysis demonstrates that European nuclear states could have leverage in negotiations with Moscow, which has repeatedly called for their inclusion in future agreements. But just because European nuclear states have leverage does not necessarily mean that they should, or are willing to, use it. In the era of competition, enhancing deterrence vis-à-vis Moscow will likely remain a priority, and Europe may choose to reject arms control altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coordination and unity within Europe will also be a challenge, particularly with regard to resourcing if European states refuse to raise taxes, cut domestic programs, or borrow money. Enhancing conventional and nuclear deterrence and generating leverage in arms control will require an unprecedented level of coordination among these states, particularly with regard to defense investments. The large, but not perfect, overlap between the two largest multilateral groups with the potential to shape European defense investment—the European Union and NATO—will require close coordination on the margins and a clear division of labor for all of Europe. Finding the resources to make these investments will be asymmetrically challenging for smaller European states and may require Europe to consider increasing its borrowing, taking drastic fiscal measures, or developing unprecedented coordination to increase efficiencies. A coordinated European position on arms control will also be a challenge, given historically divergent positions between Eastern and Western European states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these challenges, Euro-Atlantic stability is on the line. Many states in Europe perceive the coming years as decisive in determining whether Putin’s ambitions are checked and whether or not nuclear weapons are used. Putin has demonstrated that he is not someone to be trusted, so any future promises or arms control agreements should be accompanied by hedging and continued commitments to enhance deterrence in Europe. European states appear ready to lean in on deterrence and defense, and, as the authors argue, arms control should be part of a renewed competitive European strategy. Arms control remains a crucial tool for strengthening strategic stability and reducing the risks of nuclear use. The game is now on to develop new arms control solutions for an era of competition, and for Europe to step into a leading role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Six Scenarios for 2027&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scenarios 1–4 were based on an alternative futures approach with variation in alliance unity and adversary capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Table A-1: Scenarios for Euro-Atlantic Security&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The additional two scenarios are black swans, included to account for significant developments that could shape the future of arms control but were not covered in the alternative futures. Each scenario was analyzed to identify (1) Russian, U.S., and European strategic objectives; (2) potential points of leverage to incentivize Russian participation in arms control; and (3) specific arms control outcomes that could result from each scenario. Below is the scenario text provided to workshop participants, along with a summary of discussion points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scenario-1-bloc-competition&quot;&gt;SCENARIO 1: BLOC COMPETITION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine ends through a negotiated settlement. Russia cements its control over the territory it occupies as of December 2024. The United States and its allies provide Ukraine with security assurances in the event of future aggression, and Russia offers written negative security assurances. Ukraine renounces its aspiration to join NATO. Cooperation among U.S. adversaries deepens to include formalized technology transfers and increasingly large and frequent joint exercises, sometimes involving nuclear-capable delivery systems. Enhanced cooperation enables Russia and China to expand their diplomatic and economic inroads in Latin America and Africa. Russia, China, and North Korea announce a trilateral arrangement to develop and share technologies related to nuclear submarines. Iran declares that it has constructed a nuclear weapon but will remain in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The United States remains committed to NATO and its Indo-Pacific allies. The Trump administration maintains the United States’ existing agreements as of December 2024, including AUKUS, the Nuclear Consultative Group, and NATO. The United States, its allies, and its adversaries seek to rapidly expand their defense capabilities, leading to an arms race and a large military buildup on all sides. Both blocs make advances in potentially destabilizing delivery system technologies, including theater-range, dual-capable systems. European allies make limited progress in implementing a continental air and missile defense system, with some allies further ahead than others. U.S. nuclear modernization proceeds according to schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic Objectives:&lt;/strong&gt; In this scenario, Russian objectives could include a desire to buy time to rebuild its forces and make another attempt at seizing Ukrainian territory or elsewhere in the former Soviet space. Moscow does not appear to have learned a lesson on the value of cooperation from the war in Ukraine, and there have been no other signs that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s wider strategic ambitions have abated. As a result, Russia’s strategic objectives also include continuing to attempt to divide the United States from its European allies, such as through ongoing disinformation campaigns and gray zones attacks on NATO members, and continuing trends set by Russian cyber operators like COLDRIVER, which seek to leak potentially disruptive political information to sow political unrest in rival states. Perhaps ironically, one of Russia’s strategic objectives may be in perfect alignment with Washington’s in this scenario: a shift in U.S. resources from the European to Indo-Pacific theaters. For the United States and Europe, there are shared objectives of focusing on domestic stability and balancing budgets. For Washington, this will mean encouraging more burden-sharing with allies, such as increased conventional capabilities; however, European allies may have a contrary objective of limiting defense spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incentives and Opportunities for Arms Control:&lt;/strong&gt; In terms of arms control leverage, one of the best tools for incentivizing Moscow to participate in arms control in this scenario could include economic factors and relief, so as to avoid a costly arms race. This would not only free up resources for Moscow to rebuild conventionally following the war in Ukraine but also pause Western buildups, giving Russia an opportunity to attempt to gain some strategic advantage. One particular limitation for the United States in this scenario, based on statements by the previous and current Trump administrations, will be the importance of including China in any future strategic arms control limitations, as the current administration seems to be picking up where the previous administration left off, with its current position nearly identical to the one put forward by president Trump in 2020, when he called for arms control that “includes not only Russia, but also China.” To summarize, in this scenario experts assumed that Russia will be using arms control to buy time and gain strategic advantage over the United States and its allies, which will be struggling to devote the necessary resources to deterring renewed Russian aggression in Europe, particularly because of a U.S. shift to the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scenario-2-strategic-disadvantage&quot;&gt;SCENARIO 2: STRATEGIC DISADVANTAGE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine ends through a negotiated settlement that advantages Russia. Ukraine officially cedes the Donbas and Crimea, along with much of Kherson, Kharkiv, and Zaporizhzhia Oblasts. Western leaders warn Russia against further aggression in Ukraine but offer no formal security guarantees. Russia imposes limits on the size of Ukraine’s military and forces Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky out of power. Following the conclusion of the war, Russia begins to amass troops in Transnistria, on the border with Moldova. North Korea successfully tests a new nuclear warhead design, which it developed in partnership with Russia. Russia deepens its cooperation with China and Iran on disinformation efforts targeting the United States and its allies. The Trump administration hints repeatedly that it will withdraw from NATO unless allies increase their defense spending to 3.5 percent of GDP. The Trump administration maintains U.S. participation in AUKUS but withdraws from the Nuclear Consultative Group and considers downsizing the U.S. nuclear mission. U.S. allies face heated internal debates about defense spending; some hold defense spending constant, while a handful move toward anti-nuclear positions. The Netherlands considers joining the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. U.S. nuclear modernization falls behind schedule, with the Sentinel and Columbia programs experiencing multiyear delays. Russia rapidly fulfills its planned conventional military expansion, while Europe struggles to keep pace due to funding constraints and coordination challenges. Europe’s defense industrial base stagnates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic Objectives:&lt;/strong&gt; Having achieved a favorable peace settlement after the war in Ukraine, Russia’s strategic objectives in this scenario would likely include continuing to advance its regional ambitions and maintaining pressure on NATO so as to further divide Washington from its European allies. Moscow, and others, may take away a lesson from the war in Ukraine that nuclear bullying deterred Western intervention and divided allied support for extended nuclear deterrence. They may continue to rely on this strategy in pursuing other regional aggression, such as in Moldova or Georgia. With the war concluded, the Trump administration feels free to shift capabilities and focus to the Indo-Pacific, largely leaving the Europeans to deter for themselves and work out internal disputes. European strategic objectives thus include preserving the alliance, strengthening regional deterrence and security without U.S. conventional support (with the long-term prospects for extended nuclear deterrence in question), and balancing domestic pressure to cut defense spending now that the war in Ukraine has officially concluded. In this scenario, European states will have to become ruthlessly pragmatic and efficient: They will need to fill the U.S. conventional “deterrence gap,” coordinate their defense industrial bases, and decide how to maintain and strengthen extended nuclear deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incentives and Opportunities for Arms Control:&lt;/strong&gt; Leverage over Russia will likely be limited in this scenario due to U.S. disinterest in Europe and the shift of resources and focus to the Indo-Pacific. The best option for leverage would be a European conventional buildup, along with an increased British and French nuclear presence and commitment to deterrence. For example, if France joined the Nuclear Planning Group and/or extended a nuclear “umbrella” over states in Eastern Europe, including Ukraine, this could slow Russian ambitions in the region and force Russia to the negotiating table to avoid a costly arms race and dangerous standoff. Russia would likely insist on French and British forces being included in any nuclear agreement. As Russia seeks to rebuild conventionally, Europe could also have economic leverage, depending on what happens to seized Russian assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scenario-3-strategic-advantage&quot;&gt;SCENARIO 3: STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine ends through a negotiated settlement that favors Ukraine. Ukraine legally cedes Crimea without officially conceding the Donbas, most of which remains under Russian occupation. Russia cedes the other territory that it seized since its full-scale invasion on February 24, 2022. The United States and key European allies provide strong security guarantees in the event of future Russian aggression, and NATO commits to admitting Ukraine into the alliance by 2035. Cooperation between U.S. adversaries largely ends following the conclusion of the war in Ukraine. Russia provides no additional support to the Iranian and North Korean nuclear and missile programs, and Russia’s “no limits” partnership with China produces no meaningful outputs. The United States remains actively engaged in NATO and with its allies in the Indo-Pacific. There are no significant changes to the United States’ global force posture. NATO expands its conventional superiority over Russia, which faces economic troubles and struggles to rebuild and expand its conventional forces. The United States expands the NATO DCA mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic Objectives:&lt;/strong&gt; Rebuilding the Russian economy and ensuring domestic stability would likely be Moscow’s primary strategic objective in this scenario. If Russia chooses to continue pursuing its regional ambitions, it will need to rebuild conventionally and/or increase reliance on nuclear weapons, but will have limited resources for doing so. Another objective will be face-saving for the Putin regime following a less-than-favorable outcome of the war that cost hundreds of thousands of Russian lives. For the United States and Europe, one of the objectives will be pursuing an arms control agreement that codifies the state of play, limiting a return to conventional and nuclear competition in the Euro-Atlantic region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incentives and Opportunities for Arms Control:&lt;/strong&gt; This scenario offers the best prospects for arms control, whereby Russia could use arms control negotiations to demonstrate its great power status and parity with the United States, while also achieving cost savings that would allow it to focus on rebuilding the economy and domestic stability. Interestingly, even in this scenario, many of the workshop participants still doubted that Russia would give up its territorial ambitions in the region and thought that it could actually feel more encircled because of the outcome of the war. The short term, therefore, could prove to be a favorable environment for cooperation; but over the long term, the risk of a return to competition would remain. Arms control options for this scenario could include U.S.-Russia limits on tactical nuclear weapons either through a treaty or Presidential Nuclear Initiatives–style agreement, a new version of a Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty, along with informal risk reduction measures such as a joint commitment to maintain a “human in the loop” in nuclear decisionmaking, exercise and training notifications, and a recommitment to existing agreements such as the Outer Space Treaty. Assuming the United States maintains its position that China must be included in any strategic nuclear arms control, even in this scenario there would be limits on the ambition of an agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scenario-4-disordered-competition&quot;&gt;SCENARIO 4: DISORDERED COMPETITION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine ends in a settlement similar to that in Scenario 1, but Russia violates the agreement after a year in a renewed invasion, which quickly settles into a grinding stalemate. The West, facing economic constraints and flagging public support, fails to uphold its loose security guarantees to Ukraine. In response, Ukraine covertly initiates an indigenous nuclear program, which both Russia and the United States quickly discover. After the initial peace settlement in Ukraine, cooperation between U.S. adversaries largely ends. This cooperation remains limited despite Russia’s renewed invasion. Russia provides no additional support to the Iranian and North Korean nuclear and missile programs, and its relationship with China produces no meaningful outcomes. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran, dies, leading to a pro-democracy movement that drives a wedge between Russia and Iran. The Trump administration remains in NATO but significantly scales back U.S. participation and activity in the alliance. The administration makes it clear to both adversaries and allies that its primary focus is China and the Indo-Pacific. U.S. nuclear modernization falls behind schedule, with the Sentinel and Columbia programs experiencing multiyear delays. Russia faces economic challenges and struggles to rebuild and expand its conventional forces. European allies, facing similar challenges, struggle to expand the European defense industrial base. Meanwhile, U.S. and Russian nuclear modernization efforts face delays, while China rapidly expands and modernizes its nuclear force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic Objectives:&lt;/strong&gt; Russia, the United States, and Europe would all be facing economic and domestic pressure to de-escalate in this scenario; however, they may also be deeply entrenched in their positions. Russia’s objectives would include decisively defeating Ukraine on its third attempt at invasion and could include perceiving the U.S. shift away from Europe as a sign of success in its approach, if not tacit consent. Economic pressures and the continued loss of Russian troops put time pressure on Moscow to secure a decisive victory. For Washington, strategic objectives would include deterring China from starting an opportunistic war while Russia stirs up mischief in Europe, particularly as 2027 is the year Chinese President Xi Jinping indicated China should be prepared for a full-scale invasion of Taiwan. Europe’s strategic objectives would be deterring further Russian aggression and supporting Ukraine in winning the war and pushing back Russia, including through the provision of advanced conventional weapons and, potentially, European troops on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incentives and Opportunities for Arms Control:&lt;/strong&gt; In this scenario, leverage and prospects for arms control would likely focus more on crisis communication and risk reduction. For the United States, any nuclear arms control efforts would need to include Beijing, which would limit opportunities for treaties or strategic arms reductions or limitations in the scenario given the heightened tensions between Washington and Beijing. A key priority for all states would be avoiding escalation to nuclear use and the risk of a nuclear exchange over the outcome of the war in Ukraine. European capitals could appeal to Moscow and Washington to recommit to crisis communication channels and utilize the P5 process to increase transparency regarding threat perceptions and nuclear doctrine amid the ongoing war. Another opportunity would be leveraging existing nuclear treaties and engaging the broader international community to uphold the nuclear taboo and pressure all parties to refrain from nuclear escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scenario-5-change-of-leadership-in-moscow&quot;&gt;SCENARIO 5: CHANGE OF LEADERSHIP IN MOSCOW&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the spring of 2027, rumors spread across Europe that Putin is critically ill. The Kremlin does not respond; however, weeks of Russian inaction on the front lines of Ukraine and signs of intense activity within the Kremlin alert European countries that this time, the rumors may be more credible. Sensing an opportunity, Ukraine begins moving troops and matériel to support a second incursion into Kursk Oblast. Since Trump’s return to office, an uneasy peace agreement has kept the front lines of the war in Ukraine frozen in place since February 2025. Nearly two weeks after the rumors first circulate, Russian state media announces Putin’s death and the appointment of a temporary president. Elections for Putin’s successor are scheduled to take place in 14 days—exactly one month after the initial rumors of his death. Public support appears to be split among several status quo candidates, with no reformist contenders making it to the final rounds of voting, but a pro-war hardliner emerges as the winner. What at first appears to be a rapid and smooth transition of power quickly unravels amid allegations of fraud and electoral interference. A schism rapidly forms within the siloviki, who debate whether to double down on reopening the front in Ukraine or prioritize rebuilding the economy. Russian political decisionmaking is paralyzed for nearly a month, allowing Ukraine to expand its territorial gains in Kursk. As the dust settles in Moscow and the new leader consolidates power by mid-summer 2027, the Kremlin vows that “the Nazi regime in Ukraine and their co-conspirators in the West will pay an unimaginable price for meddling in the affairs of Russia” and declares that the Kursk offensive was “designed to take advantage of Russia at its most vulnerable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic Objectives:&lt;/strong&gt; For Russia, strategic objectives in this scenario would include solidifying the credibility of the new regime, which could involve securing a decisive victory in Ukraine and demonstrating a continued hardline stance to domestic political audiences. Washington may view the change in leadership as an opportunity for arms control, including efforts to ensure the security of Russian TNWs. European strategic objectives could include attempting to build a more favorable relationship with the new leadership in Moscow while preventing any major territorial ambitions or advances. However, they would also likely continue to prioritize a Ukrainian victory, leading European states to seize the opportunity to increase aid to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incentives and Opportunities for Arms Control:&lt;/strong&gt; This scenario could present unique opportunities for arms control. The new leadership in Moscow might view high-level arms control dialogues as a means to showcase regime stability and assert its role on the global stage. It may also take a different approach from Putin and prioritize stabilizing the economy over defense investments, in which case arms control could serve as a face-saving option for reducing strategic forces. Experts considered it to be just as likely, however, that the new regime will commit itself to a hardline approach to consolidate its political base within the Kremlin and reject any Western overtures for dialogue. One surprising finding from this scenario was that prospects for arms control appear to be largely personality-agnostic for Moscow, as leadership continues to be shaped by an oligarchy rather than a single individual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scenario-6-nuclear-use&quot;&gt;SCENARIO 6: NUCLEAR USE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early 2025, the Trump administration seeks to end the war in Ukraine through a negotiated settlement. While Ukraine is willing to negotiate, the Kremlin refuses to compromise on its maximalist demands. Following a year of deadlock, during which Russia gradually gains ground, the United States’ European allies provide Ukraine with a large number of long-range missiles in an effort to compel Putin to compromise. Despite the Kremlin’s threats to escalate, Ukraine uses the missiles to strike military and dual-use targets in western Russia. Two weeks into Ukraine’s missile campaign, in early 2026, a Taurus strike kills Chief of the Russian General Staff Valery Gerasimov at a command post in southwestern Russia. Twenty-four hours later, without warning, Russia detonates a sub-kiloton-yield nuclear weapon over a command post in central Ukraine. Putin declares that support for Ukraine has brought the West to “the precipice of Armageddon.” The strike inflicts limited civilian casualties. The United States, the United Kingdom, and France launch a conventional strike of limited effectiveness against the Russian military unit responsible, which is stationed in western Russia. Putin does not retaliate, and the war in Ukraine drags on with continued U.S. aid and restrictions on Ukraine’s use of Western missiles. The international community initially presents a united front in condemning Russia’s nuclear strike, with India discontinuing its purchases of Russian gas and China cutting off support for Russia’s defense industry. A year after the detonation, however, international outrage begins to fade. Many developing states, particularly in Africa and the Middle East, normalize relations with Russia, and China quietly resumes its support for Russia’s defense industry. Three years after the detonation, the war in Ukraine has ended, and—apart from the United States and its allies—most states have resumed normal relations with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic Objectives:&lt;/strong&gt; Nuclear use ultimately brought Russia military victory with only short-term political and economic costs; therefore, Russia’s objectives would include solidifying its gains in Ukraine, rebuilding economically, and potentially continuing to expand in the region, backed by nuclear threats that have now proven credible. For the United States and its European allies, the strategic objective will be deterring further Russian aggression and nuclear use in the Euro-Atlantic region. This will require building up both conventional and nuclear capabilities, along with strengthening the credibility of NATO’s deterrent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incentives and Opportunities for Arms Control:&lt;/strong&gt; Prospects for arms control in this scenario would be mixed and largely dependent on the international response. On the one hand, breaking the nuclear taboo after 80 years of non-use, along with the subsequent humanitarian and environmental consequences, should provide an opportunity to highlight the dangers of nuclear weapons and rally international support for new arms control initiatives, as occurred following the Cuban Missile Crisis. On the other hand, the lack of sustained international outrage and Russia’s justification that nuclear weapons use against a military target—when the “existence of the state” was perceived to be at risk—is permissible under international law could signal a normalization of nuclear threats and small-scale use. In this scenario, the broader international response could play a decisive role in prospects for arms control and preventing further nuclear use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When disasters strike, whether from natural causes like earthquakes, hurricanes, and typhoons, or man-made causes such as conflict or famine, the United States has swiftly responded by mobilizing funding, coordinating emergency responses, and deploying teams to directly alleviate suffering in countries around the world. The United States has reliably mobilized when allies and partners are in need of aid during their most vulnerable moments, such as its leadership during the 2014–2016 Ebola crisis, which led to fewer than a dozen cases being treated on U.S. soil, and its emergency responses to devastating storms like the 2004 tsunami in Aceh, Indonesia, and Typhoon Haiyan in 2013 in the Philippines, a key U.S. security partner. This has caused nations the world over to look to the United States for leadership during crises, understanding that the American people—among the world’s most generous—care about the lives of their neighbors near and far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This legacy has enjoyed bipartisan support in Congress for decades, but has recently become a flashpoint in the second Trump administration’s plan to “usher [in] a Golden Age for America by reforming and improving the government bureaucracy to work for the American people.” One of the president’s day one executive orders imposed a “90-day pause in United States foreign development assistance for assessment of programmatic efficiencies and consistency with United States foreign policy.” In the 80 days since, the order has already had serious consequences for humanitarian assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The executive order granted the secretary of state the authority to waive the pause for specific programs. Nevertheless, confusion reigns as to whether humanitarian assistance can continue, and if so, what kind, how much, and to what extent, as well as whether humanitarian agencies will get paid for their work. Subsequent efforts to shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) as an independent entity have added considerable turmoil into the mix, and a series of lawsuits have raised questions about whether government actions can continue. Most recently, the Supreme Court ruled that the U.S. government did not need to immediately pay $1.5 billion for work already performed in accordance with U.S. government contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that 83 percent of USAID agreements would be terminated, including many that had previously been granted a full or partial waiver. In late March, a leaked list reportedly shared with Congress indicated that the administration had terminated 5,341 programs, accounting for an even higher 86 percent of total USAID programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the Trump administration has revealed plans to “realign certain USAID functions” to the State Department by July 1, 2025. These functions include global health support and humanitarian assistance, albeit with a much-reduced footprint and an as yet undefined structure. This presents an opportunity for the administration to build upon what worked in the provision of humanitarian assistance and step away from what did not serve U.S. interests. In order to do so, the administration must take stock of the consequences of what it has dismantled and where confusion exists about its directives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the State Department, the primary goal of humanitarian assistance is to save lives and alleviate suffering by ensuring that vulnerable and crisis-affected individuals receive assistance and protection. It often entails providing for basic human needs, including shelter, protection from violence, adequate food, clean drinking water, sanitation services, medicine and medical care, education, and other needs during crises. Uninhibited humanitarian access is essential for delivering this aid. In his confirmation hearing, Secretary Rubio affirmed he would use “all the authorities” of his office to ensure that humanitarian organizations—including those funded by the U.S. government—have safe, unfettered access to conflict-affected populations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initial State Department guidance on implementing the aid pause exempted “emergency food assistance.” However, it seemed as though the freeze would cover broader humanitarian aid. It was also unclear whether “emergency food assistance” would include the cash-based Emergency Food Security Program or only the in-kind Food for Peace, which procures U.S. farm commodities and is politically popular on both sides of the aisle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten days into the near-total foreign aid “stop-work” order, Secretary Rubio issued a waiver for “life-saving humanitarian assistance.” This directive includes permission to provide, “core life-saving medicine, medical services, food, shelter and subsistence assistance, as well as supplies and reasonable administrative costs necessary to deliver such assistance.” In practice, the implementation of the lifesaving waiver has been much less straightforward. Implementing partners submitted requests for waivers but variably received no response; received responses from a variety of different individuals in the administration awarding them a partial waiver (sometimes framed as a “partial suspension”); saw the waivers they received reversed; or saw their programs previously under a waiver terminated, and then restated, sometimes multiple times. Some programs that had been granted lifesaving waivers were mistakenly terminated, then later reinstated, such as the World Food Programme’s work in 14 impoverished countries. An outgoing administration official involved in the waiver process testified to Congress that officials in charge were offering changing and increasingly narrow definitions of “lifesaving.” Even some programs with “lifesaving” in their award title that provided aid into countries such as Afghanistan were still ultimately terminated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the media coverage of the administration’s effort to suspend aid programs has focused on the attempt to roll USAID into the State Department, pare its staff down from thousands to a few hundred, remove the agency from the Ronald Reagan Building in downtown Washington, D.C., and ensure it follows orders originating from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by President Trump’s senior advisor, Elon Musk. Now that the Trump administration has notified Congress of these plans, the merger seems imminent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reports have also indicated the extensive knock-on effects on USAID’s partners, grantees, and contract recipients, including local organizations in countries receiving U.S. assistance. Tens of thousands of jobs at home and abroad are at risk, as are entire organizations and programs that support health, education, democracy, agricultural development, environmental protection, and entrepreneurship, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;humanitarian-implications&quot;&gt;Humanitarian Implications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aid pause and terminations are likely to have substantial short- and long-term effects on humanitarian assistance. The expanded waiver for “life-saving” activities is welcome, but thus far, program suspension remains the default standard operating procedure. Alarmingly, for a month, DOGE staff essentially shut down USAID’s payment system, meaning that even if humanitarian agencies received approval to work under the waiver, they could not obtain reimbursement for the costs of doing so. More than two months later, humanitarian organizations are still struggling to obtain payment for the work they have performed for a number of reasons. First, USAID leadership has prioritized payments for work performed prior to February 13 and deprioritized payments for terminated awards and awards that are continuing. In practice, this has meant that a number of organizations are not receiving payments. Second, DOGE has implemented a layered process for reviewing disbursements that are paid via the Department of the Treasury or the Department of Health and Human Services, the two U.S. federal government entities that traditionally disburse USAID payments, as USAID is not a disbursement agency. The extra layer of review without feedback going back to USAID officers familiar with programs or to implementing partners themselves has led to a rash of errors, further complicating payments to the partners that were authorized to receive them in principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This catch-22 situation has disrupted food and healthcare for vulnerable people in war-torn Sudan; schooling for Malian refugees in Mauritania; HIV/AIDS prevention worldwide; and response efforts to Marburg disease in Tanzania, Mpox in Central and Eastern Africa, and Ebola in Uganda. Commodities aimed at helping communities in dire need have piled up unused in places facing severe malnutrition and threat of famine, and items already procured remain stuck on ships, unable to be put to use upon reaching their intended destinations. Over the weekend of April 5, nearly all humanitarian programs in Syria were terminated, leaving only one remaining USAID-funded program left standing; the same weekend, all humanitarian programs in Yemen and Afghanistan were terminated. With 80 percent of Yemen’s population, nearly 70 percent of Syria’s population, and half of Afghanistan’s population in need of aid, these three crises alone represent nearly 64 million people in need of humanitarian assistance. The resulting suffering, illness, and death is entirely preventable. The likely long-term human capital losses pose a huge threat to economic growth and prosperity in developing and wealthy countries alike. U.S. citizens will feel this disruption in the coming months if disease outbreaks are unable to be stopped and permeate U.S. borders. Early estimates suggest that the global health impacts will be substantial, with more than 100,000 additional deaths from malaria expected, as well as sizeable increases in paralytic polio, tuberculosis, and drug-resistant tuberculosis. Likewise, 11.2 million newborns are likely to miss out on critical postnatal care within two days of their birth, and 1 million children will not receive treatment for severe acute malnutrition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vulnerable communities will also have to face a world, for the first time in decades, that is far less capable of responding to human crises, such as the violence, instability, and conflict that cause mass displacement, including the outflow of refugees into neighboring countries. U.S. humanitarian leadership and financing contribute to the implementing agencies that act as migration management tools and help people fleeing harm find assistance closer to home. Taking a preventative approach by addressing the root causes of suffering is also the more humane approach, as no person wants to flee their home due to violence or disaster. As the number of displaced persons balloons globally, having more than doubled over the last 10 years, the survival strategies people use will only become more costly and unpredictable absent U.S. support. This vacuum also puts these populations at even greater risk of sexual exploitation and abuse, trafficking, child marriage, and other exploitative situations. Although the waiver has allowed some humanitarian programming to resume, organizations find that even when they can carry on operations in one country, they cannot necessarily do the same thing elsewhere. In Ethiopia, the waiver allows for the provision of food aid to millions of people affected by multiple years of drought and the aftermath of civil war. But agencies have no guidance on whether they can rehire the program staff and truck drivers fired due to the aid pause. This leaves the available food rotting in warehouses in Djibouti, a scenario unfortunately duplicated in many other emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is likely that disruptions will continue to evolve, as four main lawsuits—J. Does 1-26 v. Elon Musk, Global Health Council v. Donald J. Trump, AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition v. Department Of State, and American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, et al. v. United States Office of Personnel Management—filed in response to the workforce cuts and aid freeze have now entered the U.S. courts of appeals. The administration has filed various “motions to stay” and thus will not be required to reinstate employees or disperse payments during the appeals process. Any repayments or employee reinstatements resulting from the litigation will likely occur months or years in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the humanitarian ecosystem is extremely fragile, with organizations often living paycheck to paycheck. Many organizations do not have the means to contest administration decisions and will simply need to cease operations entirely and potentially close their doors. Resources were vastly unevenly allocated between international implementing partners of USAID and local humanitarian organizations even before the review began, meaning that the partners closest to crises and communities on the ground may have a harder time advocating for their operations or filling the gaps left by U.S. disinvestment. The Network for Empowered Aid Response (NEAR) reported that more than 13.5 million people, including women, children, and marginalized communities, have lost access to services previously provided by 120 of its members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;humanitarian-brain-drain&quot;&gt;Humanitarian Brain Drain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;USAID has long invested in the knowledge systems needed to ensure effective humanitarian efforts. For example, to ensure that emergency food assistance (both cash and in-kind) addresses situations of acute food insecurity, the agency has invested in major data collection and analysis systems that provide accurate and timely information to support aid allocation decisions. These include the Famine Early Warning System Network (FEWS NET) and the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) initiative, both of which have greatly enhanced understanding of the global acute food insecurity situation and outlook. Researchers for FEWS NET provide forecasting information eight months prior to food security crises emerging and allow humanitarian workers and policymakers the opportunity to plan and prioritize where aid should go in line with the forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its important humanitarian role, FEWS NET received a stop-work order in connection with the aid suspension. As of this writing, its website is non-functioning. The absence of these data tools will have serious negative effects on the capacity to make intelligent humanitarian assistance decisions, particularly with regard to food aid, even where the waiver is available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;USAID’s own website is likewise inaccessible as of this writing, except for a notice that all direct-hire USAID personnel, with exceptions for mission-critical functions, have been placed on administrative leave globally, and the agency’s online knowledge management tools no longer provide real-time information. The Development Experience Clearinghouse (DEC) long provided online access to downloadable technical and program documentation dating back to USAID’s establishment in 1961, including many program and project evaluations. But its website is no longer functioning, abruptly leaving those documents inaccessible. The foreignassistance.gov site, which offers a wealth of budgetary and financial data on aid programs administered by USAID and other U.S. government agencies, remains up and running, and at the time of writing, was last updated March 7, 2025. And the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) program, which includes nationally representative surveys of households, malaria indicators, and data on health facilities in over 90 low- and middle-income countries, saw their USAID-funded programs terminated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent report on the state of open humanitarian data by the Humanitarian Data Exchange anticipates that some important humanitarian data is at risk of becoming inaccessible or out of date due to recent funding cuts. Timely humanitarian data is critical to inform real-time decisions about aid allocations, including where needs are most acute and what types of populations are in need. It also provides important insights into how other trends such as conflict or weather dynamics are impacting communities in need. These data inform aid implementers’ security considerations, ensuring that aid workers and recipients of aid have information that they need to safely continue their work. Other information channels that are crucial to ensure aid worker safety, such as the USAID-funded notification system in conflict zones, were affected by the aid freeze. This imperils aid workers, as it shuts down the channel they usually use to notify the U.S. military of their location so that they are not accidentally at risk in the course of a military operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;USAID and the Department of State have also historically funded important efforts relevant to monitoring, collecting, and reporting data related to global conflicts. One such effort whose data sources could be impacted by the widespread aid cuts is Armed Conflict Location &amp;amp; Event Data (ACLED), which previously received funding from the Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations at the Department of State and from several bureaus at USAID. According to Clionadh Raleigh, founder of ACLED, its researchers spend the majority of their time sourcing data from a variety of reliable local sources on crisis and conflict zones. Yet many of these local sources have scaled down operations or ceased them entirely due to funding freezes. U.S.-supported foreign-language media outlets have also been impacted, as well as humanitarian implementers who produce open-source data and researchers who create humanitarian datasets. Many of these are now not only unable to produce reliable open-source data but may be unemployed. Since these sources were designed to monitor conflict and produce data in areas that are hard to reach and where other sources are not available, the potentially permanent erasure of this data makes it even harder for those seeking to aid affected populations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The administration’s recent actions also affect weather and navigation data sources that may have impacts on humanitarian forecasting and national security more broadly. These foreshadow potential erosions in the quality of weather and atmospheric data critical to the functioning of the U.S. shipping, farming, and disaster response industries, as well as to U.S. allies and partners around the globe. The administration reportedly fired and then reinstated hundreds of employees from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. agency that provides critical data on weather patterns around the globe. This follows earlier cuts and retirements that, together, are set to decrease the total federal workforce by 25 percent. The implications of this for humanitarian aid are also significant. Through NOAA, the United States provided critical weather forecasting data and early warning on hurricanes, tsunamis, wildfires, floods, and other severe weather events to partner countries around the globe. In addition, it helps ships navigate by providing data on marine conditions, provides information to warn of space weather that could damage the U.S. electrical grid, provides information that helps farmers optimize their crops, and helps with disaster response, including responding to oil spills. There are substantial national security dependencies on NOAA as well, from its unmatched contributions to defense and operational readiness to its capture of data in harsh environments, including the Arctic and underwater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these functions help position the United States as a technological leader that other nations can rely on, a legacy which may now be at risk. The erosion of NOAA’s workforce may compromise the quality and breadth of the data it is able to provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This embargo on knowledge about foreign aid, including humanitarian assistance, makes a robust rational policy debate impossible. Even where there is consensus, or the potential to develop broad agreements, the sudden absence of documents and data precludes transparent, democratic governance of aid programs. While policymakers and humanitarian organizations are often operating with imperfect information about crises, eliminating key data sources or degrading the ones that exist could create blind spots for the United States and other countries about issues that could have impacts well beyond their borders, such as another global pandemic, a famine, or a conflict that could spur a refugee crisis. It could also fuel misinformation claims by parties to conflicts around the world who may claim that a conflict does not exist or cast doubt on its impacts. The people who are most harmed are those who are most vulnerable to the impacts of conflict and humanitarian crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;who-will-mind-the-gap&quot;&gt;Who Will Mind the Gap?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The humanitarian finance implications of freezing U.S. aid are devastating. The United States is by far the largest humanitarian donor globally. Last year, 42 cents of every dollar of humanitarian aid reported to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) came from the U.S. government. The $14 billion that the United States provided exceeded the $10 billion in total humanitarian assistance from the next five largest donors combined—Germany, the European Commission, the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Saudi Arabia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is highly doubtful that other traditional donors will step in to fill the gap created by the U.S. aid pause and the prospect of reduced resources going forward. Even before the Trump administration took office, the European Commission and the biggest donors among EU member states—Germany, France, and the Netherlands—announced aid cuts in light of faltering economies, and big chunks of the remaining resources are covering the costs of hosting migrants, many of whom fled due to the impacts of humanitarian crises. While a number of other EU members, including Greece, Spain, and Portugal, have boosted their aid, they remain small players, especially when it comes to humanitarian assistance. Outside the European Union, the United Kingdom is a significant humanitarian donor, but it also faces an anemic economy and has reduced aid. Turkey and the Gulf countries, including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, have stepped up their humanitarian giving in the past decade, but their contributions remain miniscule compared with the gap left by the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theoretically, China or Russia might see opportunity in the chance to become a major source of emergency relief. But over the past five years, both countries have reported minimal levels of humanitarian assistance to UNOCHA. China currently faces its own economic difficulties, and for the time being, Russia remains bogged down in its invasion of Ukraine and fledgling peace talks. Nevertheless, the recent response to the 7.7-magnitude earthquake in Myanmar featured visible contributions from both China and Russia. The United States fired the rest of its USAID workforce the same day the Myanmar earthquake response was to commence. Globally, other sources of humanitarian finance exist, including private charity and philanthropy, remittances, and funds collected from solidarity-based networks. Yet none of these sources of finance are likely to fill the gap left by the U.S. government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Populations in partner countries have long memories, passing down stories about the United States and the way it shaped their destinies and molded their nations through generations, in part due to the provision of foreign aid. The United States famously rebuilt Germany and other nations after World War II, countries that are now close U.S. allies. When a country is in its greatest hour of need, it has meant something that the U.S. president or another senior U.S. official was often a leader’s first phone call. The United States has used its soft-power tool of foreign aid, and humanitarian assistance, to be a trustworthy, reliable partner to nations across administrations. Today, polls in Germany indicate that only 19 percent of the population considers the United States an ally. In a separate poll in Germany, one in two respondents said their opinion of Trump has worsened since he assumed office. What happens to the United States’ long-term relationships when trust is broken?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;back-to-the-humanitarian-future&quot;&gt;Back to the Humanitarian Future?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the chaotic situation created by the aid pause, clunky humanitarian waiver process, terminations, and effort to shutter USAID, the Trump administration’s approach risks setting aid back to the 1980s and limiting the foreign policy tool kit the president has to respond to global crises as they emerge. This is because it rigidly siloes humanitarian and development assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is in contrast with four decades of good practice that focused on how best to link the two. Examples include efforts to boost investment in disaster risk reduction to help mitigate the effects of natural hazards before they become disasters and to integrate programming across the humanitarian-development-peacebuilding “triple nexus.” Humanitarian appeals for early recovery programming receive little funding from donors, so such an integrated approach to crisis response remains woefully under-resourced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along these lines, USAID and other donors have supported community-based resilience building in drought-prone areas in Kenya. This aims to help pastoralists and agro-pastoralists better cope with the effects of natural hazards. Such activities also include immediate relief but seek to reduce the need for emergency aid over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effective triple-nexus programming remains a work in progress, but there are encouraging recent examples. In West Africa, Chad hosts over a million refugees from Sudan and continues to provide an open door to uprooted people. The government has worked with donors, including the World Bank and the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), to address not only immediate needs among the refugees and their Chadian host communities, but also to obtain investment in longer-term development and secure livelihoods for both. It bears emphasizing that the United States is the biggest funder of both the World Bank and UNHCR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another innovative practice emerging in recent years has been the expansion in the use of anticipatory action. This smart innovation allows practitioners to better target aid to places in which data strongly suggest a natural hazard will strike by allowing funding to be allocated in advance. In a disaster, minutes matter, and this forward-looking approach allows humanitarian practitioners and community members to be prepared to hit the ground running in a disaster response, rather than waiting for funders to get their act together in the first few days following a rapid onset crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;does-where-aid-sits-matter&quot;&gt;Does Where Aid Sits Matter?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the discussion around the Trump administration’s aid freeze and personnel layoffs has focused on whether USAID will remain an independent agency or get folded into the State Department. President Trump himself has posted “CLOSE IT DOWN” on social media, and the Department of State has recently notified Congress of its intent to merge parts of USAID into the State Department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Administration critics rightly note that Congress established USAID as an independent federal entity, so an act of Congress is needed to change that. But the issue of where to house aid programs organizationally is, ultimately, a huge tangent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secretary Rubio recently said in a press conference that USAID “is unresponsive” to U.S. foreign policy, and presidential advisor Musk wrote more bluntly on X that it is “a viper’s nest of radical-left Marxists.” While some humanitarian workers highlighted the tension between upholding humanitarian principles and using humanitarian aid to promote U.S. foreign policy goals, anyone who has ever attended a meeting at USAID’s headquarters or visited its operations in the field is likely to come away with a different impression of the degree of alignment with U.S. diplomacy. The legal framework conferring independent agency status on USAID subjects it to the policy guidance of the State Department. In actual practice across multiple administrations, including during President Trump’s previous term, the collaboration between the two agencies is broad and deep. The State Department and USAID have long engaged in extensive joint planning of assistance strategies, as together they administer the vast majority of U.S. aid resources. Moreover, the State Department has the lead role coordinating foreign aid across its own programs (which include the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR), USAID, and 22 other U.S. government entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at other major humanitarian donor governments, there are a variety of aid governance mechanisms. The United Kingdom has moved away from an independent agency and runs aid through the integrated Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office (its ministry of foreign affairs). In contrast, Germany has a free-standing Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, where humanitarian assistance sits on the government’s organigram is far less important than the quality of programs. The key questions are whether those programs adhere to humanitarian principles, comply with internationally agreed-upon standards of aid effectiveness and accountability to affected people, and, in keeping with the Grand Bargain, embody a serious commitment to increasing the capacity and resourcing of local and national humanitarian actors in crisis-affected countries. Of course, to do so, the U.S. government must adequately train and staff those who are managing U.S.-funded programs. They must also ensure that their support for implementing partner organizations is consistent enough that those organizations can responsibly plan for their business operations and keep the lights on. In short, people matter. Without the specialized expertise and nimble response capacity of USAID’s humanitarian staff, foreign policy generalists within the Department of State may have difficulty overseeing humanitarian assistance and ensuring that it aligns with international best practice. Perhaps most importantly, it could be challenging for non-specialists to adhere to one of the most important humanitarian principles: “first, do no harm.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;building-on-past-reforms&quot;&gt;Building on Past Reforms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States can build on past reforms to address long-term critiques of U.S. humanitarian assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, what reforms are needed to take USAID’s longtime focus on localization to a new level? The agency has sought to support greater local leadership of humanitarian and development programming across multiple administrations from both parties. During the first Trump administration, USAID Administrator Mark Green sought to have aid support “the journey to self-reliance.” This reform effort addressed pain points to streamline USAID’s bureaucratic processes, enhanced USAID’s ability to partner with the private sector and faith-based organizations, and approached aid from the perspective that the organization sought to truly “work itself out of a job.” Under President Biden, Administrator Samantha Power set a goal of providing 25 percent of resources to local actors by 2025. Though USAID fell far short of this target, prior administrations from both parties agreed that to successfully partner with countries to achieve humanitarian and development objectives requires greater support for the entities and systems that already exist in partner countries and that will remain long after USAID and other global development partners have exited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only is localization an efficient and effective way to provide aid, but it is in the United States’ interest to do so, as it puts the people of aid-receiving counties in the driver’s seat to address crises and chart their own future. It can ultimately reduce dependency on foreign donors, including the United States, and allow crises to be handled locally before they have far-reaching, transnational implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big-picture question is whether consensus remains that U.S. international relations dependes on the “three Ds”: diplomacy, defense, and development. There once was wide bipartisan agreement that aid is a crucial “soft-power” instrument. Is that still the case? Does the United States still view saving lives as vital to its long-term security as a nation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Conclusions and Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration has recognized the value of maintaining a humanitarian assistance capability within the U.S. government. By notifying Congress that it intends to preserve humanitarian functions and situate them within the State Department, and by issuing a waiver intended to continue lifesaving aid, this administration has indicated that the parts of foreign aid—and U.S. soft power broadly—that it values include providing emergency relief to populations in need outside of the United States. Yet it has let go of most staff who have the expertise to carry out humanitarian missions and crippled the nongovernmental infrastructure that implements U.S.-funded humanitarian programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To take advantage of this moment, minimize and mitigate damage and unintended impacts, and shift course to a more effective approach to humanitarian aid, the Trump administration should pursue the following actions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommit to “first, do no harm.”&lt;/strong&gt; The administration should define its humanitarian objectives and immediately recommit to the principle of “first, do no harm” to ensure that its aid, or review of aid, does not result in loss of life or harm recipients of aid.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provide clarity on lifesaving waivers and increase their consistency and flexibility.&lt;/strong&gt; Provide public clarification about what qualifies under humanitarian waivers and ensure that partner organizations have access to contracting officers and other U.S. government officials who can promptly answer their questions. Make the waivers more flexible, and abide by waiver decisions to allow procurement and staffing to continue.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pay partners for work performed.&lt;/strong&gt; Promptly reimburse partner organizations that have incurred costs under U.S. partnership agreements prior to the aid freeze, and reimburse organizations operating under the waiver or that were approved to be “unfrozen.” Take stock of public-private partnerships and multi-donor funds and projects to ensure that people receiving aid are not left in a lurch if U.S. contributions are suddenly pulled.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restore data to inform decisionmaking and future humanitarian efforts.&lt;/strong&gt; Direct efforts to restore transparency and access to data about U.S. assistance, and restore funding for relevant data collection. Encourage the collection of specific data on vulnerable populations to ensure that localized needs are met and resources are distributed effectively. Partner with outside institutions to understand trends in data and create structures within the U.S. government to assess impact and ensure accountability over aid programs. Use this data to inform humanitarian policymaking and allow for a robust public conversation on the value of aid.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Require meta-analyses of already completed evaluations, third-party independent evaluations, and ex-post evaluations and make them public.&lt;/strong&gt; The U.S. government should not be grading its own homework when assessing the effectiveness of its programs. The United States should require that third-party, independent evaluations are conducted of aid programs and published in non-technical language and require ex-post evaluations for aid to understand the impact on communities after the completion of a project. It should also take stock of evaluations that have already been completed, including by the Multilateral Organization Performance Outputs Network, and create meta-analyses to better understand evidence. USAID had a rigorous evaluation requirement, but the State Department’s track record is less strong, so the administration should ensure that aid programs are clearly defining their intended impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restore emergency response expeditionary capacity.&lt;/strong&gt; Promptly reconstitute and adequately staff U.S. Disaster Assistance Response Teams and allow them to maintain readiness to deploy in case of an international disaster or emergency. Restore contracts with partners, including urban search and rescue teams.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Map partner capacity to understand new vulnerabilities.&lt;/strong&gt; Conduct a mapping analysis of humanitarian partner organizations’ capacities and gaps in capability, access, or reach to understand new vulnerabilities within humanitarian sectors such as water and sanitation, food, health, shelter, protection, and others. By identifying the areas in which organizations previously provided an essential service in humanitarian response, and can no longer do so, the United States can better tailor its assistance and set expectations for partners.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider smart reforms.&lt;/strong&gt; Use data-backed approaches to increase the use of more effective forms of humanitarian assistance, such as cash-based approaches to food assistance that stimulate local markets, better integration of humanitarian and development programming, deployment of anticipatory action, and provision of direct aid to local partners to reduce aid dependency.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embrace the responsible exit.&lt;/strong&gt; Humanitarian aid is a lifeline for populations in need, and a population will long remember the nation that reneges on a promise. The United States should learn from research on responsible exits from humanitarian settings to ensure that future aid stoppages use a phased transition plan that minimizes harm to aid recipients.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Convene humanitarian donors and encourage a new approach to burden sharing.&lt;/strong&gt; The United States rightly wants other countries to step up to take on more leadership in funding humanitarian responses. In order to urge action, the United States should convene implementing partners, donors, philanthropies, private sector partners, volunteer networks, and others to clearly articulate what it will fund and where it will step back. The United States should call upon other countries to define where they will step up and step in and develop a new approach to burden sharing that catalyzes increased commitments from partner nations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Urge the United Nations to lead true humanitarian reform.&lt;/strong&gt; Past humanitarian reform efforts from the Transformative Agenda to the Grand Bargain have avoided changing humanitarian response architecture globally. This architecture has weakened substantially and is not fit for purpose. A “next-generation” architecture is needed that prioritizes frontline needs and organizations and does not entrench existing power dynamics within the aid system. This should include efforts to establish predictable humanitarian financing. A new initiative by UN Humanitarian Coordinator Tom Fletcher called the “humanitarian reset” has promise to streamline aid delivery and build in greater accountability to local partners, but only if it takes aim at the United Nations in addition to others in the humanitarian system.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set guardrails for responses to protracted conflicts by working to resolve conflicts.&lt;/strong&gt; Humanitarian crises do not have humanitarian solutions. Protracted conflicts have grown exponentially, as countries fail to resolve their conflicts and displaced people remain displaced for decades. The United States should work with the UN Security Council and use bilateral channels and regional pressure to push for the swift resolution of conflicts so that they do not continue for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not underestimate human mobility.&lt;/strong&gt; The desire to migrate for a better life or to flee adverse circumstances is as old as humanity, and a variety of factors are pushing people out of their homes at an increasingly rapid pace. This is only set to increase. The Trump administration should ensure that it is providing aid strategically in locations where pressures increase the likelihood of widespread migration outflows. This requires maintaining expertise in refugees, migration, demography, and human mobility to ensure that U.S. responses are evidence-based.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communicate results to Congress and the American people.&lt;/strong&gt; The Trump administration should focus its aid efforts in key strategic areas and clearly communicate results to Congress, the American people, and recipients of aid in language that is accessible to them. Too often, aid programs are spread so thinly in such tremendous quantities that the forest gets lost for the trees.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work with Congress to create a Humanitarian Service Reserve Corps.&lt;/strong&gt; As the administration seeks to reduce the federal workforce, including humanitarian experts, health workers, and peace and conflict experts, it should create a Humanitarian Service Reserve Corps that allows humanitarian workers who work full-time in other fields to deploy voluntarily in service of the United States to perform professional humanitarian missions. Not only would this address some of the humanitarian brain drain, but it would also provide paid opportunities for the many generous American volunteers who would like to be professionally trained to provide a service that is committed to the principle of “first, do no harm.” This would improve upon USAID’s surge roster approach to provide additional capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congress should pursue the following actions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communicate legislative intent clearly&lt;/strong&gt; about appropriated funds for foreign aid, including humanitarian assistance, to ensure the administration understands the structures and purposes of aid that they should be implementing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enforce the requirement for the administration to meaningfully consult with Congress&lt;/strong&gt; on the foreign aid reforms proposed before they approve congressional notifications for structural changes. Recent appropriations legislation mandates prior consultation with appropriate congressional committees before structural changes to USAID can be made.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Request review by the Congressional Research Service&lt;/strong&gt; of the impacts of the foreign aid freeze on humanitarian programs, U.S. expeditionary disaster response capabilities, populations receiving aid, and humanitarian data availability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Require the administration to reinstate inspectors general&lt;/strong&gt; to provide oversight over aid administered by U.S. federal agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authorize and fund a Humanitarian Service Reserve Corps&lt;/strong&gt; to provide surge capacity for humanitarian responses by experts who work in other fields.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space technology plays a pivotal role in advancing the UK’s economic interests and ensuring national security. Space technology that has particular relevance to national security, and is being developed at pace by the UK’s flourishing small companies includes small satellites, indigenous launch and spaceports, sustainable space initiatives, space-developed biopharmaceuticals and secure communications. With a focus on making the intersection of space technology, security and sustainability readily understandable, this briefing aims to provide non-specialist policymakers with insights into the strategic opportunities and challenges shaping the UK’s technological space future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;demystifying-some-space-technology&quot;&gt;Demystifying (Some) Space Technology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;National and Geopolitical Relevance of Space Technology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s investment in space technologies underscores their importance in a rapidly shifting global landscape. Spacepower is a cornerstone of national security, with satellites supporting critical infrastructure such as finance, navigation and defence systems. Geopolitically, as espoused in the National Space Strategy, the Defence Space Strategy and the Space Industrial Plan, the UK aims to position itself as a leader in sustainable and responsible space use, balancing commercial opportunities with ethical considerations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By prioritising small companies and fostering innovation, the UK not only strengthens its national security but also contributes to a sustainable, inclusive global space economy. Doing so offers a strategic edge by providing resilience and adaptability in an increasingly contested and congested domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technologies underpinning the future of UK space power – small satellite design and manufacture, innovative bio-fuelled and reusable launch systems, sustainable space practices and space-developed biopharmaceuticals – are at the forefront of a global shift in how space assets are developed, deployed and used. These technologies have expanded access to space, enabling not only governments but also small companies and start-ups to participate in shaping the future of space-based capabilities and security interests pinned to space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand the foundational role of small satellite design and manufacture, launch systems and sustainable space practices in the UK’s National Security Strategy, the technical underpinnings of these innovations must be explored. These technologies are interconnected and mutually reinforcing, forming a cohesive framework for the UK’s ambitions in space power and national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Basics of Space Technology: Small Satellite Design and Manufacture, Core Components and Functions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK rightly maintains a focus on small satellites and their launch capabilities because they offer a cost-effective, agile platform for enhancing telecommunications, Earth observation and national security capabilities, driving technological innovation and economic growth in the burgeoning space sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small satellites have evolved and are designed to perform specific functions within constrained sizes, ranging from femtosatellites (0.001–0.01 kg) to minisatellites (100–180 kg). They are equipped with miniaturised sensors, processors and communication systems to fulfil specialised roles such as Earth observation or communication. A critical enabler of their functionality is the integration of advanced materials, miniaturisation technologies and efficient power systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small satellites in particular rely on advanced miniaturisation technologies to pack essential components into their compact frames. These are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Payload:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the functional heart of the satellite, including sensors, cameras and communication systems. For example, optical sensors are used for Earth observation, while radio frequency receivers can support signals intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Earth observation payloads: The UK excels in the development of advanced hyperspectral imaging sensors and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems, enabling satellites to capture high-resolution, multi-spectrum data for applications in agriculture, climate monitoring and disaster response. Surrey Satellite Technology Limited (SSTL) is renowned for developing hyperspectral imaging sensors and compact payloads for Earth observation, used in missions such as the Disaster Monitoring Constellation.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Communications payloads: UK firms such as Inmarsat and OneWeb are leading in designing next-generation communication payloads, incorporating phased array antennas and software-defined radio technologies to deliver flexible, high-bandwidth connectivity across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power systems:&lt;/strong&gt; Most small satellites are equipped with solar panels to generate power and rechargeable batteries for energy storage. Advances in efficient solar cell technologies allow even small satellites to operate robustly in space.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;While many small satellites operate passively, some include propulsion systems for orbit adjustments. Many UK-designed small satellites use electric propulsion technologies such as ion thrusters and Hall-effect thrusters, which offer high efficiency and precise manoeuvrability for tasks such as orbital adjustments and station-keeping while consuming minimal fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;UK companies such as Nammo UK are developing innovative green monopropellant propulsion systems that use environmentally friendly fuels, such as LMP-103S, to provide reliable thrust for small satellites while reducing toxic by-products and storage hazards associated with traditional propellants.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Onboard processing and communication:&lt;/strong&gt; Miniaturised processors and antennas enable satellites to perform data collection, processing and transmission autonomously, reducing dependence on ground stations.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;AAC Clyde Space develops onboard communication subsystems, including high-performance radios and transceivers, designed for reliable data downlink in smallsat constellations.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Archangel Lightworks is an innovative UK company focusing on free-space optical communications, enabling high-speed data transfer between satellites and ground stations using laser-based systems.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;applications-of-small-satellites-in-national-security&quot;&gt;Applications of Small Satellites in National Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small satellites are pivotal in national security due to their flexibility and deployability. The UK could use them for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ISR:&lt;/strong&gt; Satellites like those from SSTL provide real-time imagery and intelligence for military operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secure communications:&lt;/strong&gt; Small satellites can be used to form resilient communication networks, ensuring connectivity during emergencies or hostile actions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supplementing Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS):&lt;/strong&gt; Developed in tandem with multi-constellation GNSS receivers, by reducing reliance on prominent Medium Earth Orbit Positioning Navigation and Timing constellations such as GPS, the UK could increase PNT resilience and deterrence by denial.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early warning for disaster monitoring:&lt;/strong&gt; Small satellites could be used to enhance satellite capabilities to alert first responders and government officials within minutes of a disaster – such as floods, fires or landslides – at home or in overseas interests.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/uH7SFwP.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;space-launch-systems&quot;&gt;Space Launch Systems&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may seem obvious, but a satellite that remains tethered to terra has little purpose. Satellites need to be in space; thus, the success of small satellites depends on reliable and adaptable launch systems. The UK’s renewed focus on launch capability – highlighted by the development of spaceports such as Spaceport Cornwall and SaxaVord Spaceport – signals its commitment to ensuring sovereign access to space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Innovations in Launch Technology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launch vehicles designed for small satellites are smaller, lighter and more efficient than traditional rockets. Notable features include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dedicated launches:&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike shared launches, dedicated systems transport small payloads to specific orbits, offering greater control and responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reusable components:&lt;/strong&gt; As demonstrated by SpaceX and adopted by UK-based start-ups, innovations such as reusable rocket stages significantly reduce costs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eco-friendly propulsion:&lt;/strong&gt; Orbex, for example, a UK-based orbital launch services company, is developing rockets using bio-propane, a low-carbon alternative to traditional rocket fuels.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Applications in National Security&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launch systems enable rapid deployment of small satellites, which is crucial during crises or conflicts. For instance, if adversaries disrupt satellite constellations, quick-response launch capabilities can replace or augment assets, maintaining critical services such as communication and ISR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sustainable Space Practices&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With 40,500 pieces of debris (greater than 10 cm) and 130 million pieces of debris (between 1 mm and 1 cm) in orbit, sustainable space practices are no longer optional – they are imperative. The UK has already taken a global leadership role in promoting responsible space stewardship through policy, innovation and international diplomacy, and it should be noted that the UK led the work for UN General Assembly Resolution 75/36, “Reducing Space Threats Through Norms, Rules and Principles of Responsible Behaviours”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Technical Approaches to Sustainability&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Space debris mitigation:&lt;/strong&gt; Companies such as 3S Northumbria are designing sustainable space solutions, including space surveillance systems and supporting software, grounded in the principles of a circular economy for space, with space situational awareness at the heart of the work.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design for disposal:&lt;/strong&gt; New satellites are engineered for planned decommissioning. Lightweight materials and controlled de-orbiting mechanisms ensure minimal long-term impact.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Propellant-free manoeuvring:&lt;/strong&gt; Emerging technologies use solar sails or other innovative means for orbit adjustments without traditional propulsion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;National Security Implications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sustainability of space is not only about ethics; it should be a national security priority. Space debris directly threatens active satellites, including those essential to defence and intelligence. The UK’s emphasis on sustainability ensures its assets are protected while setting a global standard for responsible space exploration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;intersections-with-other-technologies&quot;&gt;Intersections with Other Technologies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technologies driving UK space power – small satellites, launch systems and sustainable practices – intersect with transformative fields such as AI, quantum technologies, advanced telecommunications and additive manufacturing. These intersections amplify the capabilities of these technologies, enabling innovative applications across civil and national security domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;AI&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI enhances the functionality of small satellites by enabling autonomous decision-making, real-time data analysis and efficient constellation management. For example, AI-driven algorithms can optimise satellite orbits to avoid collisions or adjust sensor focus for targeted intelligence collection. This reduces the need for constant ground control and increases operational resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quantum Technologies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum computing and quantum communication, as led by UK company Arqit, are reshaping satellite security. Quantum key distribution (QKD), a breakthrough in encryption, ensures unbreakable communication links. Integrating QKD into small satellites offers secure communications for defence applications, safeguarding critical infrastructure against cyber threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advanced Telecommunications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small satellites underpin the development of global communication networks, particularly in underserved areas. They intersect with 5G and future 6G networks to deliver high-speed, resilient connectivity. This capability supports not only commercial markets but also secure military communications and remote operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Additive Manufacturing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additive manufacturing, or 3D printing, accelerates the production of satellite components and launch vehicles. This technology enables rapid prototyping, lightweight designs and cost-efficient manufacturing, allowing UK start-ups to innovate and compete globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;relevance-of-technologies-for-national-security&quot;&gt;Relevance of Technologies for National Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The suite of technologies encompassing small satellite design, launch systems and sustainable space practices plays a critical role in enhancing the UK’s national security. These technologies contribute to strategic resilience, geopolitical influence and the safeguarding of critical infrastructure in an increasingly contested and competitive space domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strategic and Geopolitical Implications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space is recognised as critically important to national security. Small satellites and launch capabilities provide the UK with a sovereign ability to monitor, communicate and respond to threats, ensuring strategic independence from international providers. Geopolitically, the UK’s leadership in sustainable space initiatives, such as promoting norms of responsible behaviour at the UN (for example, Resolution 75/36), positions it as a global leader in ethical space governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dependencies and Supply Chains&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;National security is intricately tied to the resilience of supply chains for satellite components and launch systems. The UK relies on small domestic companies, such as SSTL and In-Space Missions, to build satellites. However, certain materials and technologies, such as high-performance processors and radiation-hardened components, still depend on imports. Mitigating these dependencies requires investment in domestic production capabilities and securing international partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Public Perception and Policy Questions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public discussions around space often centre on its benefits – connectivity, climate monitoring and disaster response – but awareness of its security implications is growing. Questions about the growing militarisation of space, space debris and competition with countries such as China and Russia are shaping policy debates. A transparent and balanced approach to national security, aligned with ethical and sustainable space practices, reduces the risk of security dilemma while strengthening public trust and political legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Collaborations and International Engagements&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK actively collaborates on international initiatives that bolster its space capabilities. Partnerships with organisations such as the European Space Agency, the Five Eyes intelligence alliance and NATO support the development of cutting-edge technologies and strategic interoperability. The UK Space Agency also engages with global investment programmes to fund innovation and ensure access to emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;UK Research and Development Hubs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK is home to a vibrant ecosystem of research and development hubs focused on space technology. Notable centres include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harwell Space Cluster:&lt;/strong&gt; A leading hub for satellite innovation, based in Oxfordshire, this group hosts more than 100 organisations working on small satellite development, AI integration and sustainable space solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Space North East England:&lt;/strong&gt; A cluster that brings together businesses, academia and institutions to unlock the opportunities within the space sector in the region. Includes vibrant multi-disciplinary research at NE universities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Satellite Applications Catapult:&lt;/strong&gt; Based in Oxfordshire, this organisation bridges research and industry, accelerating the commercialisation of space technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leading Companies and Promising Start-Ups&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s private sector is instrumental in advancing space power. Organisations include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SSTL:&lt;/strong&gt; A pioneer in small satellite development, providing platforms for national security applications.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Orbex:&lt;/strong&gt; A developer of eco-friendly launch vehicles, enabling rapid deployment of satellites while reducing environmental impact.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skyrora:&lt;/strong&gt; A business focused on small satellite launches, leveraging innovative propulsion systems for cost-effective solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3S Northumbria:&lt;/strong&gt; A start-up driving sustainable practices through debris mitigation and end-of-life satellite solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BioOrbit:&lt;/strong&gt; A company harnessing the benefits of microgravity for large-scale crystallisation of protein drugs, enabling the shift from intravenous (IV) to subcutaneous (SC) injection.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;future-developments-and-horizon-scanning&quot;&gt;Future Developments and Horizon Scanning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future of UK space power could be defined by accelerated innovation and strategic investment in transformative technologies, with small satellites, sustainable practices and advanced sustainable launch capabilities at the forefront.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;five-year-horizon&quot;&gt;Five-Year Horizon&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next five years, miniaturisation, AI integration and propulsion advancements will enable smaller, more efficient satellites with enhanced capabilities. The launch sector will become more agile, with domestic spaceports and eco-friendly propulsion systems, such as those developed by Orbex and Skyrora, enabling frequent and sustainable access to orbit. The UK could lead the space and pharmaceutical industry with companies such as BioOrbit, headed by Katie King, which aims to be the go-to pharmaceuticals factory in microgravity, part of the space manufacturing revolution, and is currently developing a platform for large-scale crystallisation of protein drugs. Sustainable space development from UK Space thought leaders such as Ralph “Dinz” Dinsley at 3S Northumbria could pave the way for the UK to be a world leader in circular economy in space – which in turn would increase soft-power elements of national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;10-year-horizon&quot;&gt;10-Year Horizon&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2034, small satellite constellations will dominate low Earth orbit, providing ubiquitous high-speed connectivity and supporting real-time global intelligence operations. Quantum communication and AI-driven autonomous satellites will further enhance civil and defence applications, while effective debris mitigation technologies will ensure sustainable orbital management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;20-year-horizon&quot;&gt;20-Year Horizon&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 20 years, fully autonomous satellite constellations, powered by AI, will transform space operations. Sustainable manufacturing and biotechnology innovations could enable in-orbit production of critical resources, reducing reliance on Earth-based supply chains. The UK’s investments today will ensure leadership in these areas, fostering a secure, innovative and sustainable space future. BioOrbit’s innovations could even extend to bioregenerative life support systems for long-duration space missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum physics is the branch of science that describes the behaviour of the world of the small; it defines the properties of atoms, molecules, electrons and photons. Quantum science has been explored for decades, but practical applications have only emerged in recent years. Through its National Quantum Technologies Programme and other investments, the UK is one of the leading countries driving innovation in quantum computing, security and sensing. These technologies promise transformative impact across multiple sectors, from healthcare to finance, defence, energy and national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with all technologies, quantum devices pose threats to national security: quantum computers can be applied to attack encryption standards; quantum security could keep communications by nefarious groups secure; and quantum sensors may be used to track military operations that would otherwise be considered covert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensuring that the UK retains its competitive position in developing quantum technologies and establishing a robust supply chain demands significant investment in specialised resources and expertise, both technical and operational.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-introduction-to-quantum-technology&quot;&gt;An Introduction to Quantum Technology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The defining capabilities of quantum devices are derived from the fundamental properties of quantum mechanics that they embrace. These include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Quantum confinement: the wave-like, probabilistic nature of “particles” such as electrons and photons and how restricting the motion of these influences their behaviour. This property also relates to a phenomenon known as quantum tunnelling, which can allow particles to pass through barriers forbidden in classical physics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Superposition: the fact that quantum systems can exist in multiple states simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Entanglement: the fact that quantum systems can behave as if they are joined or in a shared state, even when far apart.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These properties underpin the capabilities of quantum devices to compute, securely communicate and sense in ways that traditional technologies cannot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s National Quantum Technologies Programme kickstarted significant momentum in this domain by funding research, fostering industrial partnerships, and setting up dedicated quantum technology hubs. This approach aims to help the UK remain a key player in quantum research, patents, publications and industrial investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US and China dominate quantum technology development due to their massive research budgets and strong private sector involvement. China’s patent filings have been particularly prolific in recent years. Commercially, large US tech firms (such as IBM, Google, Microsoft, Honeywell and Intel) are pushing forward with quantum computing platforms, while Chinese corporations (such as Alibaba and Baidu) are accelerating their national efforts. In Europe, Germany, the Netherlands and France are front-runners, driven by substantial government funding. The UK has demonstrated a strong commitment to quantum technologies through substantial investment and a long-term vision, having invested more than £1 billion to date, with an aim at accelerating research, innovation and commercialisation to establish the UK as a global leader in the field. Private investment in the sector in the UK is rapidly approaching £1 billion pewr annum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;understanding-the-tech-in-quantum-technology&quot;&gt;Understanding the “Tech” in Quantum Technology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum technologies are emerging. Half a century ago, it was impossible to predict where the advent of the digital revolution would lead us – and we are in a similar position today when evaluating the future potential of the quantum technology revolution. It has branched into three primary subfields, each with distinct operational principles, implementation requirements, and applications. The subsections below give an overview of quantum computing, sensing, and security, emphasising the technical details that highlight how each technology works and why it is strategically relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/AX1esSg.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;quantum-computing&quot;&gt;Quantum Computing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Basic Principles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computers traditionally represent and store information in binary digits, 0s and 1s (bits). Quantum computers are fundamentally different, normally processing information in superpositions of a 0 and 1 state encoded on quantum bits (qubits, two-level quantum systems); measurements and reading out information from qubits collapses superpositions into binary states that can represent the results of calculations. In quantum computation, entanglement between qubits can be used to scale the complexity of the problems that can be tackled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Implementation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many different systems for realising qubits have been proposed. The leading contenders today are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Superconductors: cooled to temperatures close to absolute zero, superconducting circuits allow qubits to be manipulated via precisely timed microwave pulses. Companies like IBM, Google and Oxford Quantum Circuits are at the forefront of this approach – IBM and Google reported significant advancements recently, defining the boundaries of qubit performance and count. Figure 2 shows a photograph of IBM’s Quantum System One.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ions: electromagnetic fields can trap and manipulate charged atoms (ions). Lasers and microwaves are used to manipulate quantum states encoded on these ions. IonQ, Quantinuum and Alpine Quantum Technologies are pioneers here.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Photons: particles of light– photons– can be transmitted and processed through optical circuits. Photonic systems can operate at room temperature and allow for modular scaling. Xanadu, Quandela and ORCA Computing are pioneering companies here.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lack of a leading technology for implementing qubits for computation indicates that material advancement is still required in this field, as no qubit system is ideal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum simulators are an implementation used to model complex physical systems that are subtly different from general-purpose quantum computers. They use carefully controlled quantum systems to mimic the behaviour of other quantum or classical systems, which are then used to provide insights into phenomena that would otherwise be hard to model. Unlike universal quantum computers, these devices target specific problems, which makes them more resource-efficient. Through this direct mirroring of the quantum dynamics of the system under study, they offer powerful routes of investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Applications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cryptanalysis: large-scale quantum computers have long been heralded as having the potential to attack current public-key cryptography schemes such as RSA, elliptic curve cryptography and discrete log-based schemes (such as Diffie–Hellman). Thus, much of today’s encrypted communications are under threat.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chemical and materials simulation: quantum devices can accurately model molecular interactions, enabling breakthroughs in drug discovery, energy storage and weapon design.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Logistics and optimisation: quantum algorithms can tackle complex optimisation problems relevant to defence logistics, supply chain management and strategic planning.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;quantum-sensing-and-metrology&quot;&gt;Quantum Sensing and Metrology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Basic Principles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum sensors use quantum states, often entangled or in superpositions, to measure magnetic, electric or gravitational fields, electromagnetic radiation, or time. They target performance metrics, such as signal-to-noise ratios, that are better than conventional devices and, in some cases, better than the theoretical maximum classical performance that is possible. Quantum states are susceptible to small changes, and quantum sensors often exploit this to detect minute variations that classical sensors cannot detect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Implementation and Applications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Atomic clocks use atomic properties to precisely define a period (tick) to monitor time passing. They can be highly stable reference devices crucial for GPS, maintain synchronisation in high-speed telecommunication systems, and underpin transactions in financial ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gravimeters detect tiny fluctuations in gravitational fields with subterranean and subsea mapping applications.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Magnetometers measure extremely weak magnetic fields. They are used in biomedical imaging, submarine detection and the identification of concealed metallic objects.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Photon detectors are essential for many applications, from secure communications to gas and molecular sensing. Developments in photon detectors have driven applications in quantum imaging, which aims to achieve resolutions and signal-to-noise ratios beyond classical limits. Ghost imaging uses correlations between entangled photons to reconstruct an image, even when the detector does not directly view the object. Advancements here could be important in biomedical imaging and military contexts, offering advantages in surveillance, reconnaissance and target identification under low-light or adverse conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;quantum-security&quot;&gt;Quantum Security&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Basic Principles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common misconception is that quantum technology can only be used to decrypt data. The field of quantum security targets the opposite: applying quantum physics to keep information secure and provide solutions with provable metrics. The first example of this, proposed in the 1970s (although unplublished until 1983), is known as quantum money. The scheme stores randomised quantum states in banknotes. Unknown superposition states cannot be cloned or measured without errors, thus preventing counterfeiting. While not currently practical, this idea led to the invention of quantum key distribution, which uses a similar idea to prove that communications are free from eavesdropping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another simple, elegant application emerged from the realisation that the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics could be used to generate random numbers. The need for randomness in applications is widespread, from gambling to scheduling and simulations. However, it is critical in the security field: if the generation of cryptographic keys is predictable, then security is compromised. Many companies have developed and are developing quantum random number generators, ranging from scalable solutions for large-scale applications (such as the Internet of Things (IoT) to ones that do not require trust in the supplier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Applications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum states, encoded on photons, can be used to distribute encryption keys. Eavesdropping alters these states, alerting parties to the intrusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple pilot QKD links and networks have been implemented in the UK. Different protocols have been developed alongside methods to combine classical and quantum communications on the same communication links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, current implementations are still slow and inefficient. Current research aims to tackle practical challenges. Entangled photons, for example,can support more advanced secure communication protocols that lay the groundwork for a future quantum internet, where quantum states are transmitted and processed across distributed networks. Toshiba Europe, based in Cambridge, is the leading developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Applications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This field also encompasses applications for authentication, proof of provenance and anti-counterfeiting. Physically unclonable functions link imperfections, often introduced in a manufacturing process, to the identity of an object. They can harness quantum effects to generate “fingerprints” sensitive to atomic imperfections. Quantum Base is pioneering this technology in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;intersections-with-other-technologies&quot;&gt;Intersections with Other Technologies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum technologies are not being developed in isolation. They intersect with other nascent fields, forming synergies to realise novel capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ELeQKef.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4: Intersection between Quantum Technologies and Others.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: The author.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI:&lt;/strong&gt; today, quantum computers have limited resources and capabilities that are hamstrung by errors. AI may help identify problems that can be efficiently tackled with imperfect quantum computation and develop the algorithms employed. In the future, quantum computing may help accelerate the generation of machine learning models.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyber Security:&lt;/strong&gt; as quantum computing threatens cryptographic standards, post-quantum cryptography (PQC) has emerged to encrypt data using algorithms that cannot be practically attacked by either a classical supercomputer or a future “all-powerful” quantum computer. Some lattice-based schemes appear to be resistant to any computational attacks, and the US National Institute of Standards and Technology recently published FIPS 203, “Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism Standard”, a draft set of standards incorporating PQC algorithms. The institute also aims to select and recommend quantum-resistant key-encapsulation mechanisms for standardisation soon. Key challenges for PQC are efficient implementation, encouraging (or mandating) widespread adoption and, crucially, gaining confidence that the accepted standards are secure. There is a long track record of standardised encryption schemes being compromised.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5G/6G Telecommunications:&lt;/strong&gt; quantum computing algorithms can be applied to network optimisation, accelerating the allocation of spectrum and reducing latency in ultra-dense network environments. Wireless quantum communication has been demonstrated, primarily using laser links and telescopes, but there is potential for implementation using radiowaves/microwaves.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IoT:&lt;/strong&gt; quantum sensors may enable hyper-accurate geolocation or environmental monitoring when integrated into IoT networks. For instance, quantum clocks synchronised across an IoT network could improve the timing accuracy in smart city applications.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biotechnology:&lt;/strong&gt; quantum computing’s potential to compute complex molecular interactions far more efficiently than classical methods stands to accelerate drug discovery by simulating how potential compounds will bind to targets. This may enable personalised medicine. Quantum sensors could detect subtle variations in biological signals and biomarkers, enhancing disease detection. Quantum devices may be applied to secure valuable genomic data and patient records and maintain confidentiality in the data-driven biotech industry.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The confluence of quantum technology with AI, cyber security, telecommunications, IoT and biotech underscores its broader transformative potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;relevance-of-quantum-technologies-for-national-security&quot;&gt;Relevance of Quantum Technologies for National Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;National security concerns around quantum technologies revolve around opportunity and risk. Quantum computing, sensing and security boost intelligence capabilities and strategic defence operations, while adversarial use compromises cyber security and covert operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cryptography and Secure Communication:&lt;/strong&gt; perhaps the most immediate national security concern is the potential for quantum computers to break widely used public-key encryption protocols. An attack, often called a “harvest now, decrypt later” attack, could be employed today where valuable encrypted data is stored in anticipation of future decryption aided by more advanced technologies. In response, the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre supports initiatives in PQC that use algorithms that are believed to resist quantum attacks. However, such resistance is difficult to prove, and researchers are trying to develop quantum algorithms targeting lattice problems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR):&lt;/strong&gt; sensors underpin ISR, and the potential for quantum sensors to enhance ISR capabilities is important, especially in quantum imaging. UK-based start-up QLM Technology is developing quantum light detection and ranging systems for high-resolution gas sensing, which has potential implications for military intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supply Chain Dependencies:&lt;/strong&gt; quantum hardware implementation has specialised requirements. Quantum computers and sensors often require cryogenic refrigeration, advanced production facilities are needed for creating superconducting qubits, ultra-high vacuum chambers are used for ion traps, and advanced photonic components underpin most quantum communication devices. These requirements create dependencies on specific materials and manufacturing processes. Ensuring a robust domestic supply chain could be critical. Strengthening manufacturing capacity would mitigate apparent risks associated with supply chain disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK hosts a vibrant quantum ecosystem with numerous leading quantum technology companies and a collaborative environment for them to thrive, as provided by the UK’s National Quantum Technologies Programme and National Quantum Computing Centre. 771 UK-based quantum-related companies were studied in Beauhurst’s Quantum Ecosystem Mapping report, published in March 2025. Prominent examples in quantum computing include: Nu Quantum; ORCA Computing; Oxford Quantum Circuits; Quantinuum; Quantum Motion; Riverlane; and Universal Quantum. Example in quantum security include: Aegiq; Arquit; KETS Quantum Security; PQShield; Quantum Base; Quantum Dice; and Toshiba Europe. Examples in quantum sensors include: Cerca Magnetics; MoniRail; Peratech; QLM Technology; and Quantum Detectors. Key enabling technologies include Oxford Instruments and M Squared Lasers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;future-development-and-horizon-scanning&quot;&gt;Future Development and Horizon Scanning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trajectory of quantum technologies is evolving rapidly, driven by scientific breakthroughs and commercial investment. Predicting the shape and size of the iceberg, the tip of which we have only recently discovered, is difficult. Below are some short-, medium- and long-term predictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;five-year-horizon&quot;&gt;Five-Year Horizon&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, featuring hundreds of qubits, have demonstrated a quantum advantage. They will soon target useful, though modest, problems. These devices will not break classical cryptography and will target specific tasks such as drug discovery and materials design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early-stage commercial solutions will continue to emerge. Quantum-as-a-service models, offered via cloud platforms, will expand. These will enable businesses and government agencies to experiment with quantum algorithms without owning hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In quantum-ready cyber security, PQC standards will be increasingly adopted, and expanded pilots of quantum communication links in government and corporate networks will be implemented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;10-year-horizon&quot;&gt;10-Year Horizon&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum computers with 1-10k qubits and improved error correction will likely enable meaningful cryptanalysis of specific classical encryption schemes and broader logistics, as well as AI and cryptography applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small-scale quantum networks with entanglement-based secure communication could emerge in metropolitan areas or specialised government facilities. This evolution aligns with ongoing efforts to build quantum repeaters facilitating long-distance entanglement distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the quantum supply chain matures in the UK, it should also become more robust. Local manufacturing of key components like cryogenic systems, advanced photonic chips, and specialised electronics will reduce reliance on imports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;20-year-horizon&quot;&gt;20-Year Horizon&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advances in error correction, scaling and algorithm flexibility will enable large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers that can tackle classically intractable problems. Large-scale quantum computers could range from complex modelling to codebreaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum sensors may become ubiqitous, integrated into everyday technology such as atomic clocks in mobile devices, enabling unprecedented accuracy in navigation and communication bandwidths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Widespread adoption of global quantum protocols and standards will likely reshape global cyber security practices. Nations leading these standards may gain disproportionate influence, further elevating the strategic dimension of quantum technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McKinsey &amp;amp; Company estimates the potential quantum technology market size in 2040 to be over $100 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long-term investment in quantum research, talent development and enabling infrastructure is a strategic imperative for the UK. Quantum technologies will be pivotal in shaping the nation’s future technological and economic leadership, delivering transformative capabilities that drive innovation, productivity and growth. In an era of intensifying global competition, the UK’s national security and strategic preparedness will increasingly hinge on its ability to harness these technologies and remain ahead of global competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern telecommunications networks have the potential to enhance communication, deliver economic growth and innovation, transform certain industries and improve quality of life across the globe. Telecom networks underpin all national critical infrastructures, and their security and resilience are crucial to national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;future-telecom-technology-and-roadmap&quot;&gt;Future Telecom Technology and Roadmap&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern telecommunications networks, like 5G, have the potential to enhance communication, deliver economic growth and innovation, transform certain industries, and improve quality of life across the globe. Use cases foresee next-generation networks supporting millions of devices, powering smart cities and underpinning critical functions like power plants and emergency communications. Nonetheless, legacy mobile networks still play a crucial role in the development of modern telecommunications networks. They may support fewer devices and provide fewer critical services, but services such 2G, 3G, 4G and wired services still form part of existing infrastructure, have industry-specific applications, are used by rural communities, and provide back-up should modern systems fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Telecommunication networks, like any network, are prone to denial of service attacks. As a crucial part of daily life and a functioning economy, including the support of critical areas such as space, protecting telecommunications networks is a matter of national security. Most recently, a Chinese advanced persistent threat (APT) actor, dubbed Salt Typhoon, was said to have compromised major US telecommunications networks leading to widespread concerns over data and communications security. The group, linked to China’s Ministry of State Security, exploited vulnerabilities in telecommunication infrastructure, including wiretapping mechanisms used by law enforcement. Balancing the growth opportunities of modern telecommunications networks with national security risks is an enduring challenge for governments and societies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-mobile-cellular-systems-technology&quot;&gt;What is Mobile Cellular Systems Technology?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many technologies that can be categorised as telecommunications networks – including mobile cellular networks, WiFi, and space satellites. Other examples include HAPSs (High Altitude Platform Stations) which are airborne systems that typically operate 18-25km above earth, UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) which are drones that can enhance wireless connectivity, and Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) which is typically used at just outside the homes, inside homes or in offices. Finally, undersea fibre or cable networks are laid on the ocean floor to enable the high-speed transmission of data. Recently, there have been high-profile incidents where underseas cables have been damaged either accidentally or via sabotage. Overall, mobile cellular networks (including 5G) are the largest telecommunications network category in terms of global market share, scale and adoption. 6G is expected to be available on the market from 2030 onwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are typical mobile network sub-systems?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5RyxkjY.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: A mobile network system architecture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A mobile network is comprised of three sub-systems:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core Network&lt;/strong&gt; is where all system intelligence resides and controls many base stations (on the scale of thousands) in a network. It manages mobility and call forwarding to a user wherever they happen to be, regularly authenticates customers and devices when they want to set up a session, handles charging and billing and manages communications to other networks (such as fixed line network, internet and other mobile operator networks) nationally and internationally. Operation and management sub-system control radio access and core network operation. Core Network connects all these functions and databases using many switches and routers, which are interconnected usually with a network of fibre/cables. Core Network can be housed in a cloud or within a physical data centre. The connectivity (when between different boxes and functions) will vary from one generation to another. For operational and upgrade costs savings, mobile operators are gradually moving their Core Networks to a cloud platform.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Radio Access Network (RAN)&lt;/strong&gt; consists of Base Station (radio mast), wireless link and user equipment (UE) or mobile phones. Each Base Station (BS) provides service to a limited geographical location which is referred to as a cell. In a mobile network, thousands of cells are needed for a country-wide coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Service Platform&lt;/strong&gt; supports internet services and mobile network operator (MNO) own services.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a typical mobile network, there are millions of user equipments connected to thousands of Base Stations (BSs). Each generation from 1G to 5G consists of these three sub-systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evolution of mobile cellular systems is shown in Figure 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rNBueD7.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: Evolution of mobile cellular systems&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roughly speaking, every ten years a new generation is standardised and deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that mobile systems are based on global standards for achieving global roaming using the same device or SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) card anywhere in the world, as well as for reducing the cost thanks to economies of scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A SIM card contains all users’ identity and service profiles as well as information about their home network. A home network is the one that a user buys their subscription from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development of any generation is broadly divided into three phases, which sometimes overlap in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 2 shows evolution of mobile wireless through generations. The following five points are important to note:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each generation is researched, standardised and deployed approximately every 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each generation is deployed for about 20 years – roughly the span of time in which the capacity is saturated, or a more capable generation is introduced.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A new generation does not necessarily replace the previous generation. For example, 2G and 3G are still in operation. 3G can still provide voice services and medium rate data transfer (for example, mid-range speeds that can support lower resolution video streaming and basic household backups). However, as these services can also be provided by 4G and 5G, 3G is expected to be terminated in next few years by Vodafone and BT in the UK and in some other countries. 2G is now mainly used for services like smart metering in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The emergence of each generation is justified by market needs starting with new use cases which also have a clear business case.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every generation goes through new development phases with new capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;understanding-the-tech-in-telecom&quot;&gt;Understanding the “Tech” in Telecom&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5G as the current global standard:&lt;/strong&gt; The case for developing 5G emerged in 2015, based on need for higher data rate (10 times faster than 4G) and more capacity following the impressive success of 4G and smartphones. In addition, wireless technology was needed to enable the transformation of other industries to improve their productivity and cost effectiveness through the automation capability offered by 5G, including manufacturing, transportation and utilities. 5G also extended wireless communication for the automation of vertical industries. This automation, also called the Internet of Things (IoT), enables connecting and managing machines and robots (for example: vehicles, UAV, robots and machinery in factories). However, automation requires high wireless fidelity (reliability) and guaranteed low delay (latency) for control of machines (robots) specially for mission and time-critical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These new features of high reliability and low latency make 5G fundamentally different from previous generations. For example, 4G and previous generations were about primarily connecting people to people and connecting people to the internet through smartphones. People are tolerant to delay and delay variation (jitter) but machines are not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Industrial Application of 5G:&lt;/strong&gt; The needs of vertical industries are mainly for connecting machines rather than people. While the belief is that 5G will revolutionise other industries and the national economy with its automation capabilities, take up of 5G in industrial setting has been slower than was expected and the expected transformative effects remain to be seen. However, in China Industrial 5G is much more widely adopted compared with the rest of the world. Reasons for slow take up in other countries are due several factors: Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) lack experience in business to business (B2B) model; understanding of mobile ecosystem and evolution by vertical industries; and market scale for equipment vendors. MNOs fully understand the business to consumer (B2C) model which has been the case since 2G. Equipment vendors are used to nation-wide scales whereas for 5G industry use cases the coverage is local and of small scale to be profitable for vendors. Furthermore, governments are still grappling with the process of auctioning of the radio frequencies for local use as opposed to nationwide and exclusive licence use. For nation-wide license of spectrum, each MNO has its own piece of spectrum which makes it easy to manage interference between different networks. Local licensing of spectrum on the other hand raises the problem of co-existence of several networks that use same part of spectrum and can potentially interfere with each other. Interference management for co-existence of private 5G in industrial settings requires knowledge of wireless deployment and optimisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 5G technologies there are effectively three networks: Massive Machine-Type Communications (mMTC), Ultra Reliable and Low Latency Communications (URLLC), and Enhanced Mobile BroadBand (eMBB).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Massive Machine-Type Communications (mMTC)&lt;/strong&gt; 5G offers mass connectivity of devices in the form of IoT for various sensing applications. The target is to support 1 million devices per square km – which is beyond 4G capability. In 5G standards, it is commonly referred to as mMTC.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ultra Reliable and Low Latency Communications (URLLC):&lt;/strong&gt; It is important to note that the low delay or latency is better defined as guaranteed or deterministic delay. Guaranteed delay means low delay variation (jitter) must be very low. This capability of 5G in standards is referred to as URLLC.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced Mobile BroadBand (eMBB):&lt;/strong&gt; Another capability offered by 5G is mobile broadband communications – in 2015, the justification was that 4G was going to face a capacity crunch by 2020. There is urgent need for more capacity and higher speed as most applications are based on video and High Definition (HD) video. This aspect is named eMBB. 5G maximum speed is 10 times that of 4G.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The performance requirements of these three networks are extremely conflicting, in terms of data rate, number of users, reliability, latency, security and Quality of Service (QoS). These three networks are supported in one infrastructure using an innovative solution called “network slicing”, where all resources (computing, energy, bandwidth, processing etc.) are dynamically divided (sliced) and each slice carries one type of traffic. The slices do not interfere with each other and all conflicting requirements can be supported using network slicing. Each slice can have its own tailor-made technologies in support of the specific service it carries. There is extensive flexibility to have different security, latency, and data rate QoS mechanisms for each slice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The choice of frequency in deployment of any standard including 5G is important from many points of view such as capital cost, operational cost, capacity, energy consumption and coverage range. Three frequency bands were identified for 5G called the “pioneer bands”: 700 MHz (cost-effective coverage increase in less densely populated areas); 3.5GHz (for high population density environments); and 26 GHz (for environments with very high population densities such as in airports, sport and music venues). So far, the technology is not mature enough to support 26 GHz. MNOs globally have focused on rolling out 5G at mid-band of 3.5GHz and only mobile broadband (eMBB) service based on a B2C model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The use case of 6G:&lt;/strong&gt; Every generation has to bring about new dimension and capabilities to the market and 6G is no exception. In 2023, the ITU Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R) identified three important use cases for 6G (referred to as IMT 2030): ubiquitous connectivity, AI and communication, and integrated sensing and communication. The research community in industry and academia are working on technology solutions in support of these use cases. In 2025, use cases for 6G will be further discussed in 3GPP and refined in terms of value of these use scenarios and whether they can help reduce the cost as well as bring new revenue to MNOs and improvement to environmental sustainability and people’s quality of life. The standardisation on those selected use cases will start around June/July 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are the three use cases and why are they important?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ubiquitous Connectivity:&lt;/strong&gt; universal connectivity is intended to provide broadband communications anywhere. This will hopefully eliminate the problem of patchy coverage. The technical implication of this use case is that the future 6G network will be an Integrated Network of Networks between space (Satellite and UAV/HAPS) or Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN) with Terrestrial Networks (TN). This integration will make the 6G system a three-dimensional Network (3D Network). In a unified 3D network a user is connected irrespective of the user’s geographical location (including land, sea, air and remote locations).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI and Communication:&lt;/strong&gt; The incorporation of AI and Machine Learning (ML) in all layers of communications will lead to an intelligent mobile network that can self-manage and self-optimise communications resources (spectrum and energy consumption) and also enable smarter and more personalised services. Future networks will be so complex that today’s management of these networks by people will be untenable. AI should help to reduce network outages and improve its resiliency against intentional and unintentional incidents. It is also expected to reduce operational costs of a network.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrated Sensing and Communication:&lt;/strong&gt; The decisive difference between 5G and 6G is the importance of sensing. Sensing is an integral part of 6G, also referred to as “Internet of Senses”. Sensing can capture ambient information to be integrated into communication networks for smarter and personalised services to users as well as for the network to manage itself. Considering how dynamic mobile networks are in terms of users, vehicles and robots’ mobility, their variation in user traffic density as well as radio propagation sensing information helps the network to manage its resources more accurately and in time. Integration of sensing into communications offers other advantages: sensing information can enable new services such as locating objects and people, and their mobility, and thus provide more relevant services. For example, driverless vehicles can detect proximity of objects and other vehicles to avoid possible accidents. The combination of sensing data (information) with AI makes AI a more powerful tool. AI algorithms perform better with more – and more varied – data, which can be continuously provided by sensing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;intersections-with-other-technologies&quot;&gt;Intersections with Other Technologies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing technologies that meet 6G-use scenario and technical performance requirements demands that technologies and industries which have been traditionally developed or worked in silos come together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Space and Terrestrial Systems:&lt;/strong&gt; Development of 6G will need expertise in both satellite communications, UAV, HAPs, WiFi and cellular mobile systems. Common standards between these sectors are important for unification between them so that a user can roam between sectors without changing their devices. This requires expertise in system engineering for overall energy efficiency, spectrum efficiency, and a resilient and secure 6G. This also applies to the transportation industry for connected vehicles or eventually driverless vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IT and Communication Technologies:&lt;/strong&gt; Communication technologies are gradually adopting IT technologies in the softwarisation of the system. As with the IT industry, upgrading software is easier and quicker without changing expensive underlying hardware. This is referred to as virtualisation and is a common practice in the computer/desktop industry, where applications and software can be changed without changing the computer hardware. This is expected to reduce the capital cost of telecom networks and help with speeding up introduction of new services and functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Computer Science, Electronic Engineering and Physics:&lt;/strong&gt; Different disciplines of computer science and electronic engineering will need to work together in virtualisation of future telecom systems and more specifically combined expertise needed on AI, wireless (signal processing, RF components, and so on), Cloud, security, radio propagation, antenna and Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces technology, quantum networking and sensing is essential.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biology and Computing:&lt;/strong&gt; Inspired by the way neurons communicate with each other at extremely low energy, neuromorphic computing and communication is considered important in achieving several orders of magnitude in energy efficiency compared to traditional transmitter and receiver approach.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;relevance-of-the-technology-for-national-security&quot;&gt;Relevance of the Technology for National Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Protecting telecommunications networks is a matter of national security. Four risks to consider are highlighted below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;risk-1-supply-chain-risks-and-vendor-diversity&quot;&gt;Risk 1: Supply Chain Risks and Vendor Diversity.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ecosystem of telecommunications equipment providers is limited. This is further complicated by the exclusion of high-risk vendors (such as Huawei) based on concerns over their links to the Chinese state. The market is limited to Ericsson and Nokia, and to a limited extent, Samsung. These vendors already have difficulties in meeting global demand. There is a risk that vendor-specific vulnerabilities could easily spread across the whole network, which is a considerable risk to supply chain resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To counter this dependency in the UK ecosystem, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) assembled a “supply chain diversification task force” in 2020. The taskforce provided a set of recommendations which are being currently implemented in DSIT. The comprehensive recommendations to address the concentration of 5G suppliers in the UK’s infrastructure market cover:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Influencing telecoms standards.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Policy and regulatory measures.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;R&amp;amp;D investment and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Identifying opportunities to invest in long-term R&amp;amp;D and innovation to build UK capability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enhancing market transparency.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Greater international collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;risk-2-the-dominance-of-closed-or-proprietary-radio-access-networks-ran&quot;&gt;Risk 2: The Dominance of Closed or Proprietary Radio Access Networks (RAN)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open RAN is a standard for networks which makes them interoperable, meaning that hardware and software can be sourced from multiple vendors. In theory, this infrastructure model reduces the risk of reliance on one supplier in a telecommunications network. In contrast, closed network architecture means that components within a network are provided by one vendor with little flexibility for wider system integration using components from other suppliers. Traditionally, Huawei, Ericsson and Nokia provide both their own software and hardware for RAN in a closed environment. Consequently, OpenRAN initiatives face serious challenges. While creating long-term market diversity is an important aim, it may take a long time to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DCMS’ supply chain diversification taskforce emphasised a new strategy of “open networking” and more specifically “Open RAN”. It supports an approach where different network functions are disaggregated and connected with open standard interfaces. This open networking paradigm can achieve two important goals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Facilitate the entrance of new players in the ecosystem of vendors with their own niche product.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Put an end to black box telecom equipment which could carry insecure and illegitimate codes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a global level, the UK strategy of open networking is now being supported by different MNOs and governments. It has mobilised new small and medium size companies as well as IT companies to enter the telecom market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are still risks from using Open RAN. An open and disaggregated network might increase the risk of network failure and could be an easier target for network attacks and denial of services. For OpenRAN to succeed, R&amp;amp;D and innovation investment should focus on security, resilience and energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, satellite networks are an important component of 6G that will provide new opportunities for the UK’s satellite industries. A greater prevalence of satellite telecommunications networks may benefit the UK’s strong MNOs community (e.g. Vodafone, EE/BT, Virgin Media O2) while reducing reliance on the traditional group of infrastructure providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;risk-3-sensing-technologies&quot;&gt;Risk 3: Sensing Technologies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sensing technologies should drive improvements in automation, real-time decision-making and the user experience in telecommunications networks. One use case relates to sensing technology and autonomous vehicles which can detect objects, pedestrians or road conditions while leveraging 5G networks. The speed of modern telecommunications like 5G means that sensing technologies work instantaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The national security risks relate to the potential for espionage and vulnerability exploitation. One risk is that sensing technology processes significant amounts of real-time and personal user data. Another risk relates to high-resolution positioning information (below 10 cm accuracy). This technology enables threat actors to locate people and objects with high accuracy. Looking further ahead, as the number of data points increase from sensing technology, it could be used to profile individuals in terms of physical and mental capacities. Finally, as sensing technology is able to scan environments at speed, the impact of the application of this technology in military environments requires further understanding. Sensing of environments is similar to radar and provides more intelligence for operation of civil or military networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;risk-4-artificial-intelligence-in-telecommunications-networks&quot;&gt;Risk 4: Artificial Intelligence in Telecommunications Networks.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of AI and ML for telecommunications networks is in the early stages of R&amp;amp;D, much like other sectors. Current AI solutions are not reliable for time-critical applications such as self-organising and self-healing networks called here as Self-X. In Self-X networking, a network can detect potential network failures or detect anomaly behaviour in traffic, for example, and tries to correct or heal itself from possible outage with zero human operator intervention. Decision-making on possible network failure or prevention must be accurate and timely. Importantly, the combination of sensing technologies and AI is critical for AI training data, solutions and decision-making. At present, AI solutions and decisions are unexplainable and cannot be trusted in time for mission-critical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, critical national infrastructure (e.g. finance, health, utility services, government) are underpinned by telecommunications infrastructure. The 3D-Network of Terrestrial and Non-Terrestrial Networks is a conceptual framework that integrates various types of communications networks, over land, air and space. In theory, the interoperability of this framework provides greater resilience should one area fail. One risk is that satellite communication networks that use inter-satellite links can easily bypass certain countries. This may be a question of sovereign capability and control over communications which will require a Network Operation Centre for any satellite networks to be located in the UK to mitigate this risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;future-developments&quot;&gt;Future Developments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, future telecom development over the next 10-year horizon is briefly explained:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI and Sensing:&lt;/strong&gt; Future telecom starting with 6G will be intelligent, delivering personalised services to overall network management by combining sensing with AI. Current Large Language Models AI and Generative AI mainly use data available on the internet and are suitable for text. Future multi-modal AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) will support voice, text, video and other data. The UK needs to invest in high performance computing facilities and make available relevant data to develop foundational telecom models which are both reliable and explainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mega-constellation of satellite communications:&lt;/strong&gt; The future roadmap for satellite communications and their future generations, in addition to being based on common standards like terrestrial networks, is progressing from fixed broadband (current systems such as Starlink, EutelsatOneWeb) to users, and in support of connectivity for cellular terrestrial network (such as Rivada ) to mobile broadband directly to vehicles and eventually directly to handheld terminals. Direct to device (vehicles and handheld) will be a game changer for mobile systems and in particular satellite communication systems. This will truly unify NTN and TN into one network. There are also ongoing discussions that satcom networks should be providing Positioning, Navigation and Time (PNT) as well as broadcast services. Provision of high accuracy time in addition to GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) is critical for resilience of National Critical Infrastructures that rely on accurate and reliable time information.&lt;/p&gt;

Can industry play a role while contributing to industrial development?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, imported natural gas underpins the UK’s energy security strategy. The UK’s ambitious Clean Power 2030 Action Plan (CP2030) intends to reduce this dependency by delivering an electricity system that uses only 5% unabated natural gas by 2030, with 95% clean power - that includes renewables, nuclear, low carbon dispatchable (hydrogen and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)) supported by storage, interconnections and consumer-led flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as a transitional measure to support energy security, CP2030 retains 35GW of unabated gas capacity. In future, system reliability and energy security must reflect an increasingly electrified and variable system, which will make flexible energy consumption increasingly important. Indeed, demand flexibility may be one of the quickest ways to increase security while reducing energy costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CP2030 cannot sacrifice industrial competitiveness. A key challenge highlighted in the Invest 2035 Industrial Strategy is that UK electricity prices are higher than European countries like Germany and France. Meanwhile, in 2023 industry accounted for 27% of the UK’s electricity demand. Around 70% of electricity consumption from industry was supplied by the grid, with an additional 20% from combined heat and power (CHP), and 10% from onsite generation. Industry could be incentivised to play a bigger role in securing the CP2030 system with solutions that also support lower industrial energy costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CP2030 cannot sacrifice industrial competitiveness.

Industry could be incentivised to play a bigger role in securing the CP2030 system with solutions that also support lower industrial energy costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2024, less than 27% of UK electricity generation was from unabated natural gas or coal, and at 30%, wind became the largest source of electricity generation. The UK electricity system can manage high levels of variable renewables; the challenge is having enough low carbon generation – such as wind, solar, biomass, hydropower, nuclear, imports and storage – when needed. Multiple solutions are needed, for example, to manage multiple dark days without wind as well as within-day variability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/q378t9t.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1.2 Low Carbon Generation share in Electricity Mix in January and July&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/wvSsz0R.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1.3 Low Carbon Generation share in Electricity Mix in 24 hour period&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 1.1 illustrates the monthly, daily, and within day share of low carbon generation in the electricity mix. The first chart shows the day with the lowest share of low carbon generation and the day of the highest share of low carbon generation for each month in 2024. The gap between the two lines shows the variability in that month. The biggest variability is in November, December, and January when there are dark days with little wind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 1.2 shows the daily percentage of low carbon generation in January and July. In the summer, electricity from solar increases and this generation profile is complementary to wind. Adding more wind and solar will shift the lines up, but there will still be a gap, particularly in the dark winter months. Reducing this requires more dispatchable (generation that can be turned on and off) low carbon sources, long-duration storage, or adjusting demand to match electricity availability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 1.3 shows within-day variability. The electricity system has managed 95% from low carbon generation sources and will be able to manage 100% when available in 2025 through digital operations, system services, interconnections, batteries, load following of hydropower, and demand response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the winter of 2022/2023, the demand flexibility service (DFS) enabled consumers and businesses to shift or reduce over 3,300MWh of electricity, reducing demand at key times. In the winter of 2023/2024, DFS was successfully adapted to allow more participation from commercial consumers. In CP2030, demand response is expected to provide 10-12GW of flexibility. Industrial facilities are already among the service providers in DFS, but there is much more potential.Given 61% of demand is industry, commercial, or energy industry, consumer-led flexibility capacity from these consumers will be critical in matching demand to supply in periods of system stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the increase in variable renewables should not increase total electricity costs, one result of Figure 1 is a change in the share of commodity vs. non-commodity electricity costs, with commodity costs (wholesale electricity prices) going down and non-commodity (e.g., system services, delivery, policy) costs going up. For example, constraint management is expected to cost £500 million to £3 billion/year, most of which is redirecting or turning off renewable power. Capacity market charges are also a significant non-commodity cost: the last T4 auction cleared at £65/kW.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;design-system-services-and-capacity-markets-with-energy-intensive-industry-in-mind&quot;&gt;Design system services and capacity markets with energy-intensive industry in mind&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;System services could better reflect the characteristics of industrial consumption: supporting industrials in stacking revenues (in other words, earning revenue and delivering multiple system services from the same asset simultaneously), reducing peak demand, and even participating in capacity markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“By working with industrial and commercial consumers to optimise demand loads (leveraging energy efficiency, storage, and other technologies) so the consumption profile is in harmony with the generation profile, demand flexibility can improve resiliency and be a risk management tool.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;--cathy-mcclay-national-grid-dso&quot;&gt;- Cathy McClay, National Grid DSO&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industrial facilities, particularly in energy-intensive sectors, have distinct constraints – such as continuous processes or temperature-sensitive production – but also hold significant potential to contribute to system flexibility. By designing demand-side mechanisms that recognise these operational realities, industry could participate more effectively while maintaining both operational and financial stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An ongoing research project by MIT, Accenture, and an industrial cluster in Spain is examining the potential for industrial demand management and flexibility. The study reviewed Spain’s Servicio de Respuesta Activa de la Demanda (SRAD) programme, a structured but initially underutilised demand response mechanism. Industrial participation was limited in the early stages due to uncertainty regarding interruption expectations and a misalignment with planning cycles. Engagement increased once the programme introduced clear expectations on interruption duration, structured compensation models, and well-defined activation timelines, ensuring flexibility requirements were predictable and could be integrated into business planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key finding from this research is that industrial flexibility mechanisms are more effective when they accommodate partial load reductions rather than requiring full facility shutdowns. For instance, forthcoming research conducted by SPRI and Accenture found that in the cement sector mills accounting for a substantial share of a plant’s energy consumption were curtailed while furnaces remained operational, allowing participation in demand response without compromising core production processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“By aligning flexibility mechanisms with industrial needs, we enhance energy efficiency, reduce emissions, and strengthen long-term competitiveness while ensuring industries play a central role in the clean energy transition”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;--cristina-oyon-deputy-director-general-of-grupo-spri-economic-development-sustainability-and-environment-department-of-the-basque-government&quot;&gt;- Cristina Oyon, Deputy Director General of Grupo SPRI, Economic Development, Sustainability and Environment Department of the Basque Government.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK could enhance industrial participation in flexibility markets by supporting industry to integrate demand response into operational planning, for example, leveraging planned maintenance cycles and scheduled downtime to incorporate flexibility in routine operations; annual MW commitments with minimum and maximum participation thresholds to provide the certainty needed to align curtailment with operational requirements; and tiered activation notice periods, ranging from short-term response to day-ahead scheduling, to allow different industries to engage based on their ability to adjust operations within given timeframes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The growth in electrification of industrial processes supported by initiatives like Make UK’s Electrify Industry and incorporation of the electrification of fleets and heating (including renewable CHP, heat pumps, and emerging power-to-heat technologies) adds further optimisation opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incentive frameworks also need to reflect commercial realities. Conducting sector-specific financial break-even assessments for production adjustments would help tailor incentives to industrial constraints, making flexibility an attractive option rather than a risk to production continuity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;use-industrial-clusters-to-optimise-industrial-electricity-consumption-storage-and-infrastructure-development&quot;&gt;Use industrial clusters to optimise industrial electricity consumption, storage, and infrastructure development&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industrial clusters are a core part of the UK’s industrial strategy. Although the UK’s industrial cluster approach has focused on CCUS and hydrogen, renewables and grid investments are already part of the cluster plants (e.g. offshore wind in Humber). NESO is trialling a Local Constraint Market in one of its most constrained boundaries to access new sources of flexibility. This could go further to include industrial facilities and fleets in constrained areas. Organisations like Regen have proposed “collaborative power pools” to allow clusters and regions to procure energy under longer-term power purchase agreements (PPAs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 2 shows the location of the industrial clusters and the electricity planning regions. The UKRI CCS and Clean Hydrogen Cluster Approach could be adapted for Clean Power 2030, for example with a competition for established clusters and distribution system and network operators to develop electricity cluster plans that optimise storage, local and/or co-located low carbon generation, infrastructure development, synergies between electricity and heat and transport, system services, peak power reduction, and capacity market participation to reduce electricity costs and support Clean Power 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We have to be pragmatic. We should not necessarily allow policy constraints to over-ride what is technically possible and which would support more efficient delivery of Clean Power [2030] – e.g., the 100MW limit on private wire transfers. We should also aim to maximise efficiencies of power across industrial clusters, which could include such steps as thoughtful co-installation of pipelines and cables to better connect clusters for a lower-carbon future.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;--jonathan-oxley-executive-director-humber-energy-board&quot;&gt;- Jonathan Oxley, Executive Director, Humber Energy Board&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to capital project efficiency, there is an opportunity to bring industry flexibility and regional resiliency into the planned work developments during the development of the Local Area Energy Plans (LAEPs), the NESO Regional Energy Strategic Plans, and in the creation of new industrial clusters/groupings through programmes like the Local Industrial Decarbonisation Plans Competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/tPJO1tM.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: Industrial Clusters and Electricity Planning Regions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other markets are exploiting cluster opportunities. Since May 2018, Dublin Airport Authority (DAA), the airport operator, has been participating in Ireland’s DS3 (“Delivering a Secure, Sustainable Electricity System”) programme. With the support of Enel X, DAA contributes more than 8MW of flexible capacity into EirGrid’s ancillary services programme by leveraging its energy assets. DAA is remunerated for its services and, by utilising their assets regularly, they improve the resilience of their operations. Airports are useful for energy security as their loads typically run countercyclical to a weather event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With demand growth from new loads (for example, data centres/AI hyperscalers, carbon capture plants), new sources of flexibility (for example, cooling of data centres), growth in onsite solar and renewable CHP, and the electrification of heat and fleets, there will be synergies between bottom-up local and regional solutions and top-down whole system planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The industrial sector is an important partner in delivering a Clean Power 2030 that supports competitiveness and growth. We want to work with industry and regions/clusters, so they have access to reduced electricity costs while improving the reliability, resiliency and security of the electricity and wider energy system.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;--fintan-slye-chief-executive-national-energy-system-operator&quot;&gt;- Fintan Slye, Chief Executive, National Energy System Operator&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industrial facilities are large demand centres that can also be generation, storage, and flexibility centres. There are opportunities to design system services products that match the operational realities of industrial facilities to reduce peak demand. Regional models could be leveraged to find synergies that will reduce electricity costs and reward industry while supporting a clean power system, for example, where on-site storage, local or on-site generation, and shared infrastructure could support thermal constraints, congestion challenges, demand growth, and system resiliency and security. These measures would potentially quite quickly build resilience into the energy system and to industrial operations, improving the ability of the system to cope with shocks and supply constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Flexible demand is too often overlooked as an enabler of progress towards a cheaper power system, which can accommodate variable renewables at scale. We have set an ambition for 12GW of consumer-led flexibility by 2030, in line with NESO advice. Since most electrical demand is industrial and commercial, this is now a critical component of government’s 2030 ambitions. Non-domestic consumer-led flexibility has fallen recently, reducing from 1.7GW in 2021 to 1.2GW in 2022 and then to 0.8GW in 2023. We see steps to support more flexible industrial demand, from industrial clusters and possibly data centres too, as key to reversing this recent trend.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;introduction-what-is-artificial-intelligence&quot;&gt;Introduction: What is Artificial Intelligence?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly altering the landscape of national security, as with so much else. For the UK, AI offers the possibility to reimagine how it defends its citizens and asserts its influence globally. But there are also many challenges, not least the risk of adverse, unintended consequences, whether from AI’s use in combat, or from its potential to transform democratic society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Artificial intelligence” encompasses a range of technologies that enables machines to perform tasks traditionally requiring human intelligence. These include: machine learning, where algorithms improve through experience; computer vision, which allows machines to interpret and analyse visual information; natural language processing, which enables AI to understand and generate human language; and autonomous systems, capable of independent decision-making in defined environments. These diverse capabilities underpin AI’s expanding role across societal activities, including in national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI is already embedded in everyday life, from personal assistants such as Siri and Alexa to recommendation algorithms that shape our online experiences. In national security, its applications and potential applications are just as varied: AI-driven cybersecurity tools detect and neutralise threats in real-time;predictive analytics forecast potential crises; and autonomous drones provide persistent surveillance with minimal human intervention. These technologies are advancing rapidly, raising both opportunities and risks for defence and security policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI technologies exist on a spectrum, from “narrow AI” – specialised systems trained for particular tasks, such as image recognition or language translation – to more complex agentic AI that can operate autonomously within specified limits. Recent developments have expanded AI’s capacity for reasoning and adaptation, making it an increasingly powerful tool in high-stakes domains such as national security. Today’s AI is demonstrating the potential to transform intelligence analysis, logistics and even strategic planning, in addition to warfighting itself. AI’s strengths lie in decision speed and pattern recognition at scale: qualities that are critical in modern warfare. But those same strengths also expose vulnerabilities. How do we ensure accountability when decisions are delegated to machines? What happens when adversaries deploy AI systems that disregard the norms and ethics that the UK seeks to uphold?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This briefing paper explores AI’s role in UK national security, dissecting its applications and exploring some of the challenges shaping its adoption. There is a degree of urgency here, as the pace of AI development shows no signs of slowing. Successfully adapting to AI requires more than technical mastery: it will likely also demand a willingness to challenge conventional thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-current-state-of-ai&quot;&gt;The Current State of AI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI is a general-purpose, dual-use technology, comparable in some ways to electricity or the steam engine. Its applicability across a wide range of economic activities, coupled with its potential to dramatically increase productivity, makes it one of the most transformative forces of our time. Beyond reshaping industries, AI has profound implications for social relations and global power dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/R6YDwDW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Key AI Terminology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The modern AI era dates back roughly a decade to the adoption of deep learning and big data, which revolutionised how machines process information. Today, we are still in the early stages of this technological revolution, but the pace of change is accelerating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI is in the midst of a transformative revolution, driven especially by the advent of transformer architectures. These neural network models, first popularised by innovations such as ChatGPT, have redefined the capabilities of AI, enabling systems to process and generate human-like text, and write computer code. Their applications in national security have already begun to reshape how the UK defends its interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This “generative AI”, alongside more established machine learning techniques, enhances intelligence analysis by synthesising vast amounts of unstructured data, identifying patterns and offering predictive insights. This capability allows decision-makers to process information faster and with greater nuance than traditional methods. But the next frontier is AI that reasons. Emerging models, such as OpenAI’s o3, are designed to extend inference capabilities, allowing machines to connect information across disparate domains and produce insights that approximate human-like reasoning. These systems promise to handle complex, multi-step problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding to this transformative landscape is the imminent arrival of agentic AI – systems capable of autonomous action within defined parameters. These agents will not only support decision-making but may also execute tasks independently, for example, by coordinating logistics or conducting cyber defence operations. In the not-too-distant future, we will see highly capable AI innovating the next generation of even-more-capable AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the UK, all this innovation raises profound questions: how to maintain human oversight, ensure accountability, and balance operational benefits and the risks of unintended consequences? The UK is at a critical juncture. The ability to harness these capabilities effectively will depend on large investment in infrastructure, a robust yet permissive regulatory framework, and a strategic vision for integrating AI into defence systems. The government has begun to act on these requirements. At the same time, the rapid pace of innovation necessitates constant vigilance to ensure that the ethical and security implications of these technologies are fully understood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;intersections-with-other-technologies&quot;&gt;Intersections with Other Technologies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI’s progress is deeply intertwined with advances in other technological fields. These intersections can both accelerate AI development and create new synergies across domains that are critical to national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One key area of convergence is quantum computing. While still in its early stages, quantum computing has the potential to exponentially enhance AI capabilities, particularly in optimisation, encryption-breaking and complex simulations. If successfully integrated, quantum AI could drastically improve cryptographic security and provide an edge in intelligence analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In space warfare, AI plays an increasingly vital role in satellite-based intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR). Autonomous satellite coordination and real-time data fusion, powered by AI, could enhance situational awareness and decision-making in contested environments. Additionally, AI-driven defence mechanisms against cyber and kinetic threats to space assets are becoming a strategic priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hypersonic weapons – which travel at speeds exceeding Mach 5 – require AI-driven guidance, target tracking and decision-support systems to be effective. AI can optimise trajectory prediction, counter-defence measures, and dynamic mission planning, at speeds far greater than human operators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, materials science stands to benefit from AI-powered design and testing of novel materials, including lighter, stronger and more heat-resistant composites. These materials are critical for military applications, from next-generation armour to advanced aircraft and spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In biological sciences and genetics, AI is revolutionising biosecurity, disease detection, and even the development of enhanced performance systems for military personnel. AI-driven drug discovery and genomic analysis could enable more effective countermeasures against bioterrorism and emerging biological threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These intersections highlight how AI is not just transforming national security on its own but is also amplifying advances in other high-impact fields. Understanding and leveraging these relationships will be key to maintaining technological and military advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tactical-military-applications-of-ai&quot;&gt;Tactical Military Applications of AI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI is transforming the tactical dimensions of modern warfare, with applications that enhance situational awareness, streamline operations and augment combat effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most prominent areas of change is the development of autonomous platforms, such as aerial drones and uncrewed ground vehicles. New AI-focused defence companies have emerged, such as Anduril Industries, providing AI-driven autonomous surveillance and defence systems. Its Ghost helicopter drones, for example, can conduct persistent surveillance and support tactical operations with minimal human intervention. Palantir Technologies, another leading firm, focuses on integrating AI into battlefield management, offering platforms that synthesise data from multiple sources to provide actionable insights in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional defence contractors such as BAe Systems and Lockheed Martin are also investing heavily in AI-driven technologies. BAe Systems is working on AI-enhanced targeting systems for fighter jets and ground vehicles, while Lockheed Martin is developing autonomous systems for logistics and precision targeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI is also beginning to play a role in cyber defence and offence. One goal is for systems that can identify and neutralise threats faster than humans. For example, agent-based AI systems might monitor networks for anomalies, enabling pre-emptive action against potential breaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application of tactical AI is already evident in recent conflicts. In Ukraine, AI has been used to provide terminal guidance for aerial drones flying in electronic warfare-contested environments. Similarly, in Gaza, Israeli forces have employed AI systems for intelligence assessment and targeting, leveraging their ability to process vast amounts of data and identify targets faster than human analysts can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As AI models and the hardware on which they run become cheaper, more capable and more robust, we can expect to see AI featuring even more prominently “on the edge” – aboard deployed systems. These systems will progressively take more complex, context-rich decisions without human involvement, adapting in real- time and making split-second judgements. This makes many observers uneasy. There is already widespread concern about the implications of “killer robots” from campaign groups, some governments and wider civil society. Achieving internationally binding agreement about tactical military AI will be challenging – the technology is evolving rapidly and states are understandably concerned about falling behind. The testing and validation of such systems will be critical to ensure they perform as intended, especially in high-stakes operational contexts where failures could have severe consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The integration of AI into tactical operations raises important questions. How do militaries maintain human oversight of autonomous systems? What protocols ensure accountability in the event of an AI failure? Addressing these challenges will be essential as the UK and its allies seek to exploit AI’s tactical potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wider-applications-of-ai-in-national-security&quot;&gt;Wider Applications of AI in National Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While tactical AI focuses on the immediate needs of the battlefield, its broader applications extend far beyond the theatre of war. Wider national security uses encompass intelligence analysis, strategic decision-making, and enhancement of the operational readiness of the entire national security ecosystem. There is a clear overlap of the use of these tools in defence and broader issues, such as counterintelligence, counterterrorism and law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One area with great potential is boosting situational awareness. AI systems excel at synthesising data from diverse sources – such as satellite imagery, social media and signals intelligence – to identify patterns and predict threats. Predictive modelling, including the creation of “synthetic environments” and “digital twins” can help government agencies to model, and perhaps even pre-empt, cyberattacks or military escalations. The UK’s GCHQ, for instance, uses AI to analyse and secure communications while detecting potential cyber intrusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In espionage and intelligence gathering, AI enhances both offensive and defensive capabilities. Advanced algorithms might assist in counterespionage efforts, tracking suspicious activity and identifying insider threats. On the offensive side, AI-driven tools can mine and analyse open-source intelligence to provide actionable insights, giving intelligence agencies a critical edge in fast-moving geopolitical scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI is also playing a role in strategic decision-making. Tools such as those developed by Palantir and Hadean enable leaders to wargame scenarios, evaluate the outcomes of different policy options, and coordinate responses during crises. Hadean’s focus on synthetic environments has significant potential at the military operational level, allowing for the simulation of complex scenarios and training exercises. Over time, such capabilities may extend to the strategic level, enabling the modelling of intricate social dynamics and broader geopolitical considerations. By integrating AI into diplomatic negotiations and crisis management, governments can better anticipate adversary actions and optimise their strategic positioning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, these wider applications are not without risks. Bias in algorithms can lead to flawed decisions, while concerns about data sovereignty challenge the secure and ethical use of AI technologies. The infrastructure required to support these applications, including secure data centres and reliable energy sources, represents a significant investment for the UK, which currently lags leading global powers China and the US in most salient metrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these challenges, the integration of AI into broader national security functions appears increasingly both necessary and inevitable. We are in the early stages of a transformation, in which the UK’s ability to anticipate and respond to evolving threats will depend on the successful application of AI technologies across its national security apparatus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;challenges-of-adopting-ai-in-defence&quot;&gt;Challenges of Adopting AI in Defence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is much excited talk about AI as a revolutionary development, actual adoption within defence sectors remains more limited. It requires a fundamental transformation of the systems, structures and cultures within which these technologies operate. Decision-making processes in defence institutions can be slow, and there is often a preference for proven methods over new, untested systems. Bridging the gap between military objectives and the innovation-driven ethos of the tech sector is another critical challenge. There is, in particular, a significant gap between the development of cutting-edge “frontier” research and the types of AI technologies currently feeding through into practical defence applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To capitalise on these changes, defence organisations must learn to collaborate more effectively with both AI startups and tech giants. Unlike the US or China, the UK has a smaller pool of “unicorn” tech companies with the capacity to develop cutting-edge AI systems at scale. This constrains the UK’s ability to independently innovate, especially at the frontier of AI research. Some AI systems also require vast computational resources and reliable energy infrastructure, both of which can be costly in the UK. In addition, there is a significant shortage of skilled AI professionals with expertise in defence applications, creating competition for talent with the private sector, where salaries and working conditions are often more attractive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operationally, the UK risks becoming overly dependent on external contractors or allied countries for critical AI capabilities, potentially compromising strategic autonomy. Ensuring that AI systems are transparent, reliable and accountable is a major challenge. Autonomous systems must operate within established legal and ethical frameworks, but achieving this balance in practice is difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;future-developments-will-we-get-to-agi-and-when&quot;&gt;Future Developments: Will We Get to AGI, and When?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artificial general intelligence (AGI) remains one of the most debated concepts in the realm of AI. Unlike narrow AI systems, which are designed for specific tasks, AGI would possess the ability to perform a wide range of intellectual activities at or above human level. However, the definition of AGI itself is contentious. Some emphasise the breadth of capability as the defining feature, while others focus on AGI’s potential to reason and learn autonomously across domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nor is it clear how AGI might be achieved. Some argue that existing approaches, particularly transformer models and reinforcement learning, will be sufficient to reach this milestone. Others reckon that a combination of these and other approaches will be required. Equally contested is the timeline for AGI’s arrival, with some suggesting it could emerge well within the next decade, while sceptics view it as more distant prospect, if it is achievable at all. Recent advances in reasoning models, however, have prompted many to revise their estimates, moving projected timelines closer to the present. That is especially true of those leading AGI research at frontier companies. Systems such as OpenAI’s o3 demonstrate nascent capabilities in extended inference and multi-step reasoning, sparking both renewed optimism and concern about the pace of progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implications of AGI for national security are profound. Much depends on how quickly AGI emerges and whether its development represents a gradual evolution or a disruptive breakout that is difficult to control. At its most optimistic, AGI could revolutionise strategic planning, decision-making and resource allocation, enabling unprecedented efficiency and precision. However, it also raises existential risks. A monopoly on AGI by any one state or actor could shift the global balance of power dramatically. Furthermore, poorly controlled AGI systems could create vulnerabilities, including unintended escalation in conflict scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a UK perspective, preparedness is key. Policymakers and defence leaders should engage far more deeply with emerging AGI research, fostering domestic capabilities while participating in international efforts to establish norms and safeguards. The challenge lies in balancing innovation and caution, ensuring that AGI is developed and deployed in ways that enhance security without compromising stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Conclusion and Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI is reshaping national security in profound and complex ways. From tactical applications on the battlefield to strategic decision-making and governance challenges, its impact is already being felt. More dramatic changes are likely, and in the short term. For the UK, the opportunities are significant, but so too are the risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key takeaways from this analysis include the transformative potential of AI technologies, the need to integrate them into defence while ensuring ethical oversight, and the importance of maintaining a competitive edge in the face of rapid innovation by global adversaries. The integration of AI into tactical operations and broader national security functions is not merely a technical challenge but one that involves cultural shifts, strategic investments and international cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenges for the UK government include prioritising investment in AI talent and research to ensure the UK remains at the forefront of technological innovation. Strengthening international partnerships is critical, both to shape global norms for AI governance and to ensure interoperability with allies. Developing robust frameworks for ethical AI deployment in national security, with a focus on transparency and accountability, is equally essential. The UK government has already carved out a leading international role on regulation and norm formation and can usefully build on this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, the UK must prepare for the potential arrival of AGI, navigating its transformative possibilities while mitigating its risks. Ensuring that AI systems serve as tools to enhance human decision-making will be central to maintaining stability and public trust. The pace of change demands vigilance, adaptability and leadership. By embracing innovation responsibly, the UK can position itself not only as a beneficiary of this technological revolution but as a global leader in its ethical and strategic application.&lt;/p&gt;

This paper considers the role of land-air integration in achieving their suppression and destruction.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conventional deterrence of Russian aggression in the Euro-Atlantic area requires a demonstrable NATO capacity to defeat Russian ground force incursions within politically acceptable timeframes. In the context of increasingly strained transatlantic relations and US prioritisation of the Indo-Pacific – where deterrence of a war over Taiwan is strongly in the interests of European NATO, and the US military is increasingly overstretched – European NATO members need to demonstrate that they can deter conventional aggression by Russian forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO land forces are overwhelmingly dependent on air power for fires. Without large-scale US assistance, however, European air forces would currently struggle to roll back dense and integrated air defence systems (IADS) such as those protecting Russian forces. Accelerating the degradation of the Russian IADS in any conflict is therefore critical to enabling the defeat of Russian ground forces. This is increasingly a joint task, and therefore this paper considers the issues of land-air integration in achieving the suppression and destruction of enemy (Russian) air defences (SEAD/DEAD).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper gives several recommendations for NATO’s European members that would help make this realisable:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many complex command and control (C2) challenges emerge from the need for an inter-echelon and joint SEAD/DEAD campaign, for which there is currently no suitable platform for training and thus testing requirements. Joint NATO SEAD/DEAD exercises are therefore needed, with the design of appropriate Alliance C2, a critical exploitation activity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;European air forces should invest in the production of stand-off weapons suitable for SEAD/DEAD campaigns. Specifically, these include the American AGM-88G Extended Range Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile, or potentially the Norwegian AGM-184A Joint Strike Missile, or the British SPEAR and SPEAR-EW cruise missiles. The latter three are especially important, as they can be manufactured in Europe. Air forces should also invest in greater stockpiles of the GBU-39/B small diameter bomb for affordable stand-off mass, and in aerial decoys such as the ADM-160 MALD or equivalents: both can force the Russian IADS to waste missiles, and provide saturation effects to enable other weapons to get through to targets. Another option is the GBU-53/B Stormbreaker II, which can automatically hit moving targets, but is significantly more expensive than the GBU-39/B and is highly vulnerable to interception due to it being a slow-flying glide bomb.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For offensive counter-air capabilities to support a SEAD/DEAD campaign and provide cover to ground forces, European countries should invest in increasing stockpiles of METEOR long-range air-to-air missiles to improve the combat effectiveness of existing fourth-generation platforms such as Typhoon, Rafale and Gripen when these are forced to remain a significant distance from front lines.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Land forces should prioritise fielding corps artillery groups of rocket artillery and bringing divisional artillery groups of general support howitzers up to strength. Stockpiles of precision strike missiles, the US Army Tactical Missile System and the Extended Range Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System–Extended Range should be prioritised, with a particular emphasis on manufacture of a European munition at scalable cost that can be launched from the M270 or M142 HIMARS launchers. Priority munitions natures include submunitions, thermobaric and sensor-fuzed payloads. These natures are critical to efficiently engaging ground targets on a battlefield where it is becoming harder to concentrate and sustain a large number of firing pieces. However, to be able to purchase and use many key submunitions payloads for SEAD/DEAD targets, and to attrit Russian ground forces in the open, European NATO members would need to withdraw from the Convention on Cluster Munitions (as Lithuania already has).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is significant advantage in investing in loitering munitions, one-way attack munitions, and aerial decoys that can be launched from land to suppress, stimulate and strike air defence systems. In combination with a reorganisation of traditional artillery capabilities, the deployment of hunter-killer and loitering top-attack UAS should also be able to help compensate for the close air support (CAS) that would not be generally available to ground forces until the SEAD/DEAD campaign was well advanced. In all cases, however, these uncrewed assets need to remain cheap and easy to produce in large numbers to have the effects described. They are a potent lethality multiplier for traditional fires and air-delivered weapons, rather than a substitute.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Investment in significantly increasing the long-range precision fires stocks of European air, maritime and land forces is a prerequisite for rapidly generating a credible capability to degrade and ultimately roll back the Russian IADS. It is also vital for providing sufficient lethality to enable ground forces to survive until SEAD/DEAD operations have degraded the IADS to a point where more traditional CAS missions become possible again. However, investment in long-range precision munitions is not sufficient on its own. Europe must also develop electronic attack, special operations forces and orbital ISR capabilities to replace the critical joint enablers for SEAD/DEAD operations currently only provided by the US.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For three decades, NATO land forces have operated with assured air supremacy and thus ubiquitous close air support (CAS). NATO air forces developed a robust methodology for defeating relatively centralised and static air defence networks, fielded during the 1980s, while significant investment in targeting pods and precision weapons made CAS progressively more precise and therefore more widely applicable against a broader range of targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, modern Russian air defence systems have far greater range, are more mobile, more resilient and significantly more lethal than any faced by NATO forces in conflict so far. This, combined with the limited training and capability development for the suppression and destruction of enemy air defences (SEAD/DEAD) in most European countries since the end of the Cold War has made the availability of CAS doubtful during the initial period of any war between peer adversaries. Only the US has retained the stocks of suitable munitions, electronic attack (EA) assets and aircrew training to execute a comprehensive SEAD/DEAD campaign against modern threats, and even US Air Force and US Navy leaders frequently acknowledge that this task is becoming increasingly resource intensive. As the military balance in the Indo-Pacific tilts away from the US towards the People’s Republic of China (PRC), US SEAD/DEAD capabilities will be prioritised in this theatre of operations. This leaves unanswered the question of how European NATO members are to regenerate the ability to conduct SEAD/DEAD operations without the US doing most of the heavy lifting, and, because such operations will take time, how European land forces should plan to fight through at least the initial phases of any Russian attack in the absence of ubiquitous CAS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the problem of executing SEAD/DEAD is getting harder, a range of emerging land and air capabilities means that these tasks may be approached differently by the joint force, while capabilities are also being fielded that replicate some of the effects previously achieved through CAS. It is not, therefore, simply necessary to consider how the capability can be rebuilt, but how it can be redesigned, given modern tools. This is not a trivial task, since it demands a level of inter-echelon joint command and control (C2) which current force structures and command relationships do not currently support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper endeavours to answer three critical questions. First, what are the gaps in SEAD/DEAD capabilities in the European theatre, and why is there an imperative to overcome them? Second, how will land forces need to organise their fires capabilities in an environment where forward echelons lack CAS and there is a strong burden placed on land fires to support a joint SEAD/DEAD campaign? And third, what C2 relationships and sequencing challenges would be required to field such a joint capability?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer these questions, the paper is divided into four chapters. Chapter I covers how modern Russian air defences work and the challenges they create for NATO air forces. Chapter II considers how land forces have depended on CAS, and thus what they must be able to achieve without it, as well as the demands placed on land forces to be able to contribute to joint SEAD/DEAD operations. Chapter III explores how both SEAD/DEAD and CAS effects may be partially serviced using UAS and other capabilities where there is convergence between the land and air domains; the space domain is an intimate enabler of all these activities, but classification means that this has been excluded from the discussion in detail. Chapter IV explores the existing C2 relationships in a NATO context, and those that will be required in the future. The paper concludes with a series of recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the third paper in a series drawing on lessons from Ukraine. The first considered the principles of fielding mass precision strike complexes within land forces, while the second set out an approach to counter the threat from UAS. This paper is also an extension of a paper published in 2022 which looked at methods for overcoming complex air defences, and which in essence produced a targeting methodology for applying joint effects against a modern integrated air defence system (IADS). This paper is more concerned with how the force is structured and equipped to execute those complex strikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evidence base for this paper is diverse. Both authors have spent several years examining Russian air defence systems, including physically inspecting examples. They have also spent significant time with aviation and fast air units, have observed exercises and operations, and flown in military aviation and – in the case of one author – fast jet aircraft with several NATO countries. Both authors have also interviewed a significant number of air defence officers and observed air defence engagements. One of the authors has spent significant time working with land forces testing targeting processes and conducting targeting, while the other has similarly engaged with air forces. The C2 challenges and planning obstacles to these issues have also been a subject of observation across NATO and non-NATO states. Additionally, the authors have spent considerable time with the scientific and technical personnel working to overcome Russian air defences in Ukraine, using a range of emerging tools, and have worked with Ukraine’s international partners seeking to derive lessons from the current conflict. Due to the sensitivity of the subject, a significant number of these research interactions cannot be cited individually, but care has been taken to show the sources of information and judgements, where possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-barriers-to-the-suppression-and-destruction-of-enemy-air-defences&quot;&gt;I. Barriers to the Suppression and Destruction of Enemy Air Defences&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most critical military challenge currently facing NATO is that the Alliance would have a serious SEAD/DEAD deficit against Russian forces in an Article 5 scenario. The air assets likely to be available in Europe currently have a range of capabilities for detecting and locating ground-based air defence (GBAD) radars, and some capacity to suppress them, but they have insufficient air-delivered firepower to reliably destroy them within the Russian IADS deployed on NATO’s borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three key aspects to this DEAD lethality challenge. The first is the demonstrated capability of many Russian GBAD systems to intercept Western air-delivered weapons in terminal phase. This is partly a function of NATO air forces currently possessing very few weapons that are specifically designed to destroy air defence targets in a highly contested airspace. The second, linked, challenge is the layered coverage of the various GBAD systems deployed by Russian forces, which makes it very difficult to engage any one threat system in isolation. The third aspect is that many Russian radar systems move regularly and must be emitting for most Western sensors to reliably and accurately detect and geolocate them. Therefore, the IADS must be stimulated by threats either to it or assets that it is protecting as part of any SEAD/DEAD operation. These three aspects are discussed in more detail later, but what they essentially mean for NATO forces is that SEAD/DEAD operations must be closely coordinated with a range of simultaneous effects that are difficult for European air forces to mass without joint support from other domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several of the main Russian surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems have a proven capability to shoot down most kinds of Western air-delivered munitions, as well as some ground-based and maritime long-range weapons. The SA-20 (S-300PMU-1/2 Gargoyle/Favorit), SA-21 (S-400 Growler) and SA-23 (S-300VM Gladiator/Giant) are all so-called “strategic SAM” systems that provide coverage over very long ranges against aerial targets flying above the radar horizon. However, they are also designed to shoot down ballistic missiles, including the MGM-140 Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) over a significantly smaller coverage area. In addition, they provide some capability to intercept other weapons, such as cruise missiles like the BGM-109 Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM), anti-radiation missiles like the AGM-88 HARM series, and battlefield rockets such as the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (G-MLRS) fired by the M270 and HIMARS launchers. Other Russian systems, most notably the SA-15 (9K331/332 Tor-M1/M2) and SA-22 (96K6 Pantsir M-1) short-range air defence systems (SHORAD), and the medium- to long-range SA-28 (S-350 Vityaz) SAM are optimised for intercepting cruise missiles and other incoming precision guided munitions such as HARM and glide bombs. Both the SA-15 and SA-22 offer short engagement and coverage ranges but are often emplaced as “goalkeeper” systems that share situational awareness data with the long-range SA-20/21/23 systems they are protecting, and provide a formidable inner defensive layer against attacks on those systems. While they are optimised primarily for intercepting aircraft, the more modern variants of Russia’s “Buk” medium-range SAM family, the SA-17 and SA-27 (9K317/M Grizzly), also offer some capacity to intercept cruise missiles and potentially other incoming munitions, at least in self-defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The capacity of Russian SAM systems to shoot down incoming munitions of various kinds has been demonstrated hundreds of times over the three years since the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine began on 24 February 2022. Details remain scarce in the public domain due to the high levels of sensitivity and operational security applied to data on such engagements. However, for those with visibility on the data either from Ukrainian sources or Western operational analysis, the results are clear. Russian GBAD forces have become steadily more proficient since the start of the invasion, and in particular have gained a thorough understanding of how to engage several important classes of Western air-launched and ground-based long-range weapons and SEAD munitions as the latter have been introduced into theatre for use by Ukrainian forces. The result is that strikes, either against Russian air defence systems directly, or against targets protected by them, generally require careful layering of multiple near-simultaneous strikes and non-kinetic effects to get weapons through successfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;weaponry-to-counter-russian-air-defences&quot;&gt;Weaponry to Counter Russian Air Defences&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are clear implications for the SEAD/DEAD campaign that NATO member countries would have to wage as a critical first step in any defence of Alliance territory against future Russian aggression. Russian air defences are far from impenetrable, as Ukrainian forces themselves have repeatedly shown. Indeed, those Western partners who have worked closely with Ukrainian forces since February 2022 now have a far more detailed understanding of the weaknesses, as well as the strengths, of Russian GBAD systems. However, simply firing limited numbers of traditional precision-guided weapons at GBAD systems as they are located will generally result in those weapons being intercepted by layered SAM systems in the IADS. This is particularly true for weapons that fly relatively slowly and/or on a predictable flight path without complex manoeuvring capability, such as glide bombs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, NATO air forces currently lack sufficient stockpiles of munitions with both the stand-off range and terminal survivability and guidance capabilities required to reliably penetrate and cause DEAD effects within a representative Russian IADS. Suitable weapons do exist; notably the American AGM-88G Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile – Extended Range (AARGM-ER), the Norwegian AGM-184A Joint Strike Missile (JSM) and the British SPEAR miniature cruise missile. These weapons are all designed expressly for the purpose of penetrating heavily defended airspace to strike radars, command nodes and other key IADS components. To do so, they use either reduced radar cross-section (AARGM-ER and JSM) or powered manoeuvring capabilities in flight (SPEAR and JSM) to make interception much more difficult; and they also carry seeker heads able to complete terminal target identification and guidance automatically even if a SAM has stopped emitting and is moving. However, the trade-off is a high unit cost (around $3 million per missile for foreign customers in the case of AARGM-ER and JSM). Moreover, the AARGM-ER and JSM are comparatively large, which limits internal carriage to two weapons for the F-35A/C fighter aircraft and external carriage only for the F-35B. Currently, there are none in operational service with frontline squadrons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Netherlands, Finland and Poland have ordered the AARGM-ER for their F-35A fleets, while Norway and the US Air Force have ordered the JSM, and the US Air Force has selected the AARGM-ER to form the basis for a munition called the Stand-in Attack Weapon (SiAW) that will be capable of striking well-defended targets from the F-35A. The UK has funded the development of SPEAR and its electronic warfare (EW) variant, SPEAR-EW, but has yet to order operationally significant quantities, partly due to cost and partly to integration delays on the F-35B. Overcoming these delays and getting weapons delivered to users will take time. The number of weapons procured by European users remains in the order of a few hundred for each country, according to US Foreign Military Sales/Defense Security Cooperation Agency authorisation notices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, despite the prospect of significant improvements by the late 2020s, NATO air forces currently remain largely dependent on glide bombs such as the GBU-39/B small diameter bomb and the GBU-53/B Stormbreaker II for air-launched DEAD effects. These have a very limited capability to penetrate through and hit Russian SAMs and radars within the IADS due to their relatively slow and predictable behaviour in flight. On the other hand, they can still perform a useful SEAD function because (at least in the case of the GBU-39/B) they are a comparatively cheap way to force the IADS to light up and engage them – thus exposing radar locations and depleting expensive interceptor missiles. They can also be carried and launched in comparatively large numbers due to their small size, light weight and quadruple carriage rack. Nonetheless, they are far from ideal for DEAD, not only due to their vulnerability to interception but also their reliance on GPS and their small warhead size (which limits their kill potential against armoured SAM systems in the event of a near-miss). Russia has a very well-developed capability to deny and spoof GPS, which has seen consistent use and improvement in terms of both equipment and tactics during the war in Ukraine, so munitions that depend on GPS for terminal guidance and mid-course navigation will need advanced anti-jam functionality to avoid serious degradation in effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as dedicated SEAD munitions are concerned, American F-16CMs and EA-18G aircraft, as well as German and Italian Tornado ECRs (electronic/combat renaissance aircraft), field the legacy AGM-88B HARM and a limited number of more modern AGM-88E AARGM weapons. Both the HARM and AARGM are based on the same basic missile body, and Russia has now had more than two years of combat experience against the HARM, which the Ukrainian Air Force has used extensively for SEAD since late 2022. After an initial period of surprise, its performance as a DEAD weapon decreased rapidly as Russian GBAD operators learned to react to launches by pausing radar emissions and sometimes relocating. HARM is also periodically intercepted in flight by the more capable Russian SAM systems, and their operators have had plenty of practice up to late 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;electronic-attack-capabilities&quot;&gt;Electronic Attack Capabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of EA capabilities, which are critical for enhancing the survivability and lethality of aircraft and weapons during SEAD/DEAD operations, almost all NATO capabilities are American, including the EA-18G Growler and EA-37B Compass Call aircraft from the US Navy and US Air Force, as well as the latest variants of the ADM-160 Miniature Air-Launched Decoy (MALD) family, which can be launched from a variety of aircraft types. Germany is developing the Eurofighter EK to replace the Tornado ECR in Luftwaffe service, but in its first iteration it will only be capable of self-protection jamming alongside passive emitter-location capabilities to cue in AARGM launches for SEAD. Thus on current plans it will not be a stand-off EA asset, although that might change if a “Phase 2” variant of the aircraft is developed and introduced in the mid-2030s. Italy, therefore, is so far the only European country that has a dedicated airborne EA platform on order, having received Foreign Military Sales authorisation for two EA-37Bs that should be in service by the late 2020s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the air-launched munitions inventory in Europe, therefore, air forces operating without cross-domain support would struggle to reliably destroy Russian SAMs at large scale within a functioning IADS. There are probably insufficient weapons and airborne EA capacity in European air force inventories to generate the required penetrating or saturation effects, in the absence of simultaneous weapons and effects employed from other domains. The self-defence capabilities of many key Russian systems are impressive in themselves and, as a compounding problem set, they are deployed in a layered and mutually supporting way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russian-integrated-air-defence-system-layering&quot;&gt;Russian Integrated Air Defence System Layering&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The layering of air defences is the second key consideration for understanding the challenge that Russia’s IADS poses for NATO SEAD/DEAD efforts. When Russian forces fight, they deploy with large numbers of SHORAD, medium-range air defence (MRAD) and long-range air defence (LRAD) systems that both accompany and provide cover to ground forces and protect key areas and facilities from attacks in depth. This ensures that it is very challenging to engage any one type of Russian SAM threat without simultaneously having to contend with the capabilities of multiple other systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, aircraft and weapons must avoid being successfully engaged by multiple SHORAD and MRAD systems en route to attack LRAD systems in operational depth that are likely to be the primary targets of any SEAD/DEAD campaign. Equally, however, it is difficult for aircraft to locate, suppress and destroy SHORAD or MRAD systems closer to the front lines while operating in the missile engagement zone of an LRAD system such as the SA-21. The problem goes deeper than geographically overlapping coverage, however. Russian strategic SAM units operating equipment such as the SA-21 or SA-23 use C2 vehicles that are designed to be connected to nearby MRAD and SHORAD systems. When operating as intended as a truly integrated air defence system, this allows Russian SAM batteries to share situational awareness and coordinate target prioritisation to provide the most efficient possible engagement of targets. This also means that many of the MRAD and SHORAD systems deployed closer to the front lines may be able to maintain good situational awareness without emitting regularly using their own radars, by using information from the target acquisition radar on an LRAD system further back. This makes them much more difficult to locate and allows them to pose a more dangerous “pop-up” threat to any aircraft or weapons unknowingly transiting their coverage area to attack the strategic SAMs or provide CAS to nearby NATO forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, geolocating and identifying the SAM systems throughout an IADS so that they can be suppressed, attacked or bypassed is a prerequisite capability for any SEAD/DEAD effort. Space-based ISR assets play a vital role in identifying the rough pre-sited locations that the IADS components tend to use, and specialised assets may also be able to provide SAM launch detection and electromagnetic spectrum analysis that can help identify radar sites and signal patterns. However, most of the current military space-based ISR capabilities in NATO are provided by the US, and commercial providers – which are an increasingly important source of ISR data – generally have a response time measured in at least hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Russian target acquisition radars typically move between pre-sited locations every few hours and relocate significantly more frequently if commanders are expecting an attack. The consequent need to force them to emit to find, fix and target them in real time further emphasises the need to synchronise effects from across domains for any predominantly European SEAD/DEAD campaign to be effective. If Russian SAM operators are aware that a large SEAD/DEAD operation is underway but face no concurrent threats to the units or facilities they are protecting, it is likely that they will keep most radars across the IADS passive until either the threat passes or is deep inside their engagement zones, with limited time to react to pop-up threats. Therefore a key component of any successful SEAD/DEAD package coordinated by air forces will be to employ simultaneous long-range strikes from either maritime cruise missiles or ground-based rocket artillery systems and one-way attack UAVs against static targets within the IADS coverage area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deploying cruise missiles, one-way attack UAVs or rocket artillery salvoes at key static targets will force the IADS to switch most SHORAD, MRAD and LRAD radar systems into active mode to perform their core task of defending Russian ground forces and installations from strikes. This will not only allow NATO forces to geolocate them (predominantly, but not exclusively, using airborne assets such as the F-35), but will also split the finite fire control and interceptor capacity of the SAM systems. The goal must be to force the IADS to defend against SEAD and DEAD weapons in self-defence while simultaneously having to intercept significant numbers of long-range strike munitions aimed at ground targets and installations, such as ammunition dumps and C2 nodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, if suitable Alliance C2 and networking architectures are in place, ground-based weapons in particular can contribute greatly to the DEAD effectiveness of a joint SEAD/DEAD operation by contributing responsive artillery or rocket artillery strikes against SAM targets found and fixed by aircraft such as the F-35. Of course, the artillery systems would need to be in place, briefed on their part in the planned operation, supplied with suitable munitions against the SEAD/DEAD task, and so on. However, given that some of the most potentially problematic layered IADS concentrations for NATO – for example, Kaliningrad – are potentially within 155-mm howitzer range, let alone G-MLRS and ATACMS range, this sort of cross-domain integration needs to be prioritised and exercised as a matter of urgency. This will require not only air and space forces but also armies to concentrate on the problem set. And this may be essential, since achieving the required SEAD/DEAD capability in Europe to ensure credible deterrence will require simultaneous use of both SEAD/DEAD effectors from multiple domains – at least until and unless a far greater quantity of DEAD munitions, one-way attack UAVs and EA capabilities for supporting SEAD effects sits in the inventories of European air forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-land-operations-in-the-absence-of-close-air-support&quot;&gt;II. Land Operations in the Absence of Close Air Support&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;US doctrine during the inception of AirLand Battle hypothesised the close cooperation of air and ground forces at both the operational and tactical level. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, however, the lack of resilience in adversary air defence networks allowed air forces to devote a large proportion of their capabilities to supporting ground forces. With the subsequent investment in targeting pods and precision weapons, the resulting CAS capability proved highly addictive for land forces, for three reasons. First, the speed of aircraft meant that the support was available across the frontage of a land formation, without the need to manoeuvre firing assets into position, protect them, and – most laborious of all – sustain them in the field. Second, the weight of air-launched munitions (and therefore the lethality of these effects against targets in hard cover) exceeds almost anything that land forces can themselves generate. Third, it was institutionally convenient for ground forces to divest from fires, sustainment units and stockpiles while retaining effective battlefield lethality through an air force’s budget; for air forces, meanwhile, the criticality of the mission gave them continued relevance and thus investment even in the absence of a complex air threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the divestment in ground-based fires made sense during the sustained period of counterinsurgency, it creates a serious problem for land forces and the joint force in the current context of needing to urgently strengthen NATO’s conventional deterrence posture. The disproportionate difficulty of a reclamation battle, combined with the anticipated behaviour of Russian troops on terrain they have seized, means that NATO now has a strategic posture of deterrence by denial. This means that land forces cannot wait for air forces to complete the SEAD/DEAD campaign before they themselves are committed – they must be able to operate for a sustained period while the air space is still heavily contested. It is also the case that much of the land component’s higher echelon fires will be needed to support the SEAD/DEAD campaign being led by the air component, as outlined in the previous chapter. This means that while corps fires assist in the deep battle to eventually create permissibility in the air to the benefit of the land component, many of these launchers and ready ammunition stocks will not be available for missions to assist land forces in the early stages of fighting. Precisely because these corps fires will need to support the air-led SEAD/DEAD campaign, they will need to manoeuvre to fire, and contribute land-based sensing to the mission. These corps assets will need protecting, further committing land forces to fight before the airspace becomes sufficiently permissive for air support to be a reliable planning assumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question therefore arises as to how land forces can assure their own mission requirement with organic fires while also servicing the requirements for SEAD/DEAD. The conventional argument would be to simply regenerate a level of firepower at an echelon comparable to Cold War doctrine. This would provide ubiquitous fires availability, replicating the coverage of air assets. It would not replicate the lethality of air-launched weapons, however. Land-based weapons are generally small-yield munitions because they need to be transported and must include enough propellent to climb, rather than simply descend. The traditional answer to this has been volume of fire, but dense enemy ISR, combined with a responsive precision strike complex and dynamic counter-battery capabilities (for example, hunter-seeker munitions such as Lancet-3M) make sustaining a high volume of fire impracticable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Battlefield geometry contributes to this challenge. In 1991, there were enough howitzers concentrated in northern Saudi Arabia for fire controllers to direct “fire mission Regiment” onto targets, with the ammunition replenished through Saudi ports and thereafter by road transport along uncontested ground lines of communication. While it is theoretically possible for NATO to invest in an Army Group’s worth of howitzers in the Baltics, it is not a safe planning assumption that ammunition for so many howitzers could be reliably transported, either across the Baltic Sea or through the Suwałki Gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The usual response to the prospect of constrained munitions supplies is to argue for the use of precision weapons. Precision is undoubtedly part of the solution but is insufficient on its own. Precision munitions are, in the first instance, too expensive to be relied on exclusively: a strategy that relies solely on precision munitions ensures insufficient magazine depth to enable mission success. Furthermore, precision is enabled by precision navigation and timing, or by connectivity – all of which are vulnerable to extensive Russian EW capabilities. Although it is possible to overcome EW, doing so in an assured manner tends to be expensive, or slow. A rapid targeting cycle at large scale creates a level of inefficiency in fires that leads to a requirement for area effect munitions. Because of the payload limitations of most land-based fires, this further drives a requirement for increased lethality, but without increasing the mass of the munition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;land-fires-requirements&quot;&gt;Land Fires Requirements&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consideration of the land fires requirements within this context can be divided by target set and mission. For deep strikes using long-range weapons in support of a SEAD/DEAD campaign, there is significant utility in land forces launching loitering munitions, because of the scale at which they can be generated and the shaping effect they can have on the behaviour of air defence systems, thus enabling other kinds of strikes. The other munitions of disproportionate utility for this mission are tactical ballistic missiles (TBMs), owing to their speed into action, difficulty of interception, and payload leading to a high probability of kill (Pk). In terms of loitering munitions, the efficacy of Harrop and Orbiter has been demonstrated persistently. Further opportunities arise from the use of EW and decoy munitions to massively complicate the adversary’s air defence challenge. The reduction of Ukrainian air defences over time by Russian 9M723 Iskandr TBMs is testament to the potential efficacy of these munitions for DEAD, as is the utility of ATACMS in striking Russian GBAD radars in Crimea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of their Pk, cluster munition warheads have consistently proven more effective for DEAD fire missions than unitary variants. This is because a single round that gets through defences can damage or destroy multiple elements of a SAM battery, while cluster munitions’ wider area of effect means that they suffer less severely from degradation of accuracy due to hostile EW. Extended Range Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (GMLRS-ER) are also highly useful in this role. However, while cluster munitions are also useful against some land targets, others – such as headquarters, ammunition depots and infrastructure relevant to a deep strike campaign that would directly affect the land battle – tend to be hardened structures against which cluster warheads would have little effect. Instead, a unitary penetrating warhead is necessary for such fire missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For targets in tactical depth, the relevant tasks for fires may be broken down as fire missions against dug-in personnel, mobile personnel, vehicles in hides, vehicles on the move, and hardened targets. Historically, a significant distinction has been drawn between general support fires and close support fires designed to directly enable manoeuvre. Today, however, close support fires are likely to be provided by organic mortars, since the counterbattery threat is so high – both from loitering munitions such as the Lancet 3M and from conventional artillery threats, exacerbated by the supply chain to sustain howitzers. With sustained fire missions being too dangerous, general support artillery is likely to be more viable. The tactical support of SEAD/DEAD may be considered the same as engagement of moving vehicles, while the counterbattery fight can be likened to engaging targets in hides, or moving vehicles if they are using carousel tactics. As with the air defence battle, the limited number of fire missions likely to be available mandates a shift in emphasis from suppression towards destruction of targets. Thus, the key is to match appropriate munitions to targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against dug-in personnel, High Explosive-Fragmentation is an inefficient round. While air burst can improve lethality, it can be countered if defensive positions have overhead protection. One-way attack munitions that can fly into a trench, or laser-guided artillery and mortar rounds, can be highly effective at landing rounds inside a defensive position. However, the Pk of all these attack vectors is significantly improved if the munition is thermobaric or at least an enhanced blast munition. As troops become more dispersed in defensive positions, there is disproportionate utility in munitions that can achieve lethal effect around corners. This has often been achieved with air-launched munitions because of the yield of the munition, which is why Russian UMPK-fitted glide bombs have been so lethal for Ukrainian troops. For ground-based fires, thermobaric munitions can help to reduce the lethality gap resulting from a lack of air support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For hostile troops moving in the open, air burst munitions can achieve a comparable level of lethality to cluster munitions. However, air burst proximity fuzes are more susceptible to interference from Russian EW systems, whereas time-based fuzes are more robust. Nevertheless, the lethality of such munitions is comparable to what can be achieved with cluster munitions, if simply considering manoeuvring land forces. Cluster munitions are also highly effective against the radar sites and EW complexes that are likely to become increasingly prevalent and critical in tactical echelons as counter-UAS operations become an all arms and all echelon concern. The evidence from Ukraine demonstrates that there is a difference in effectiveness such that any military that is constrained on the number of fire missions it can conduct should probably prioritise cluster munitions for its artillery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the efficacy of cluster munitions has always been clear, there are significant ethical arguments against their use. These primarily relate to dud-rates leading to a dispersion of unexploded ordnance across the battlefield. Because of this risk, many states signed the Convention on Cluster Munitions from 2008, disavowing their use. However, states that perceived a risk of major ground operations – including Finland, Poland, South Korea, Ukraine, the US, Russia, China, India, Pakistan and others – did not. In 2024, Lithuania, recognising the expanding threat on its borders, withdrew from the convention. It seems that many European nations may have to do the same if they are to be able to guarantee their security in the absence of a major US commitment to the theatre, mitigating the ethical concerns by limiting the context in which such munitions are employed, and investing in reducing the dud-rate of newly produced munitions. It is also worth noting that Russian forces make extensive use of cluster munitions, so in the context of Russian armed aggression against a frontline NATO state, ethically motivated self-limitation by the defending side would not obviate the need for a large-scale post-conflict unexploded ordinance clearance and disposal effort to avoid lasting risk to civilians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vehicles in concealed positions (hides) present another important class of target. As offensive action has become more deliberate, the need to degrade enemy reserves has increased. When moving in the open, there are many options for both detecting and engaging these targets. When static and concealed, radio traffic and ground sign may give an indication that a unit is inhabiting an area of woodland, but finding specific hides would take substantial ISR efforts, while striking them is challenging. Sensor-fuzed sub-munitions and other anti-vehicle systems may struggle to find targets that have overhead cover, while one-way-attack UAS, long-range anti-tank guided missiles, and rockets will often strike trees, limiting their impact. Air strikes have bypassed this challenge via the vertical attack profile of air-dropped munitions and their heavier weight and explosive payload, but the effect is reduced by increased dispersion. The most effective means of overcoming this impediment is to set fire to the hides. While persistent incendiaries would be ideal for such a mission in regard to effect, they are prohibited by Protocol III of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, and in any case are not necessary. Thermobaric munitions are highly likely to set fire to hides, forcing the displacement of vehicles. While this may not destroy many vehicles, it can rapidly turn a static vehicle grouping into a mobile vehicle grouping. Thermobaric munitions in this context can also be highly effective against emplaced guns in the counterbattery role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is ample evidence to demonstrate the indispensability of sensor-fuzed munitions for the engagement of moving vehicles. Whether from air-delivered CBU-105 Wind Corrected Munitions Dispenser (WCMD) in Iraq, or BoNUS artillery shell engagements in Ukraine, sensor-fuzed munitions have an exceptionally high Pk against moving vehicles. There is a high cost to these munitions, which means they must be conserved for use against vehicles when they are exposed, but under the right conditions their efficiency makes the investment highly worthwhile. Such munitions can also prove a reliable means of engaging mobile air defence vehicles, especially where the target is the transport erector launcher rather than supporting radar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against hardened targets such as buried command posts, a penetrating warhead with greater velocity is indispensable, driving a reliance on an appropriate GMLRS-ER munition with a unitary warhead – at least until conventional air support and deep strikes are available following a successful SEAD/DEAD campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposition that artillery units supporting deep fires should have two munition types, while general support artillery should have three, imposes implications for the echelons at which these capabilities are held. If deep fires are to be supported by appropriate targeting capacity and the command links to collaborate with air assets, they probably sit at the corps level. For general support fires, a typical howitzer carries between 28 and 48 rounds. To split this between three natures would mean that each howitzer could carry out only a very small number of missions before needing resupply. If different batteries are allocated different ammunition natures, this requires a constant movement of batteries, which will increase attrition and require more batteries to be available for a given area. A brigade is unlikely to be able to assure the sustainment requirements for howitzers with multiple munitions natures or have enough organic artillery to have natures assigned by battery. This dynamic therefore pushes artillery upwards to the division, where the concentration of guns allows for the cycling of batteries and the flow of munitions to be coordinated more efficiently. For genuine close support fires, therefore, the emphasis shifts to mortars and probably the retention of high explosive fragmentation as an inefficient but valuable all-purpose round that simplifies sustainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without a properly resourced divisional and corps artillery group with appropriate munitions, it seems unlikely that ground forces can replicate the responsiveness or lethality derived from CAS. One capability that stitches much of this together is UAS, but, as these straddle the air and ground domains, their role will be addressed in the next chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-uncrewed-aerial-vehicles-and-joint-strike&quot;&gt;III. Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles and Joint Strike&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEAD provided some of the earliest use cases for UAVs on the modern battlefield, most notably by Israeli forces in the 1970s and 1980s. Aerial targets originally developed to train air defenders were repurposed as aerial decoys that emulated the radar cross-section and flight profile of aircraft, causing air defences to illuminate and reveal their positions. These decoys also forced operators to deal with the cognitive load imposed by the need to filter out false detections, or even expend interceptors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When used in a similar vein in more recent times, Russia’s E95M target UAV caused significant C2 problems for Ukraine’s air defenders early in the full-scale invasion. Israel pioneered the use of radar homing seekers for UAVs for the express purpose of suppressing or destroying air defences. Anti-radiation missiles (ARMs) such as the AGM-88B HARM and Russian Kh-31P series are a useful toolfor attacking air defences, but are limited by the fact that the speed at which they travel enables defenders to turn off their system for a minute or two, likely causing the missile to miss, before the radars are turned on again. ARMs, therefore, are most useful in creating short windows of opportunity to enable other strikes, and have a poor track record of actually destroying air defences. As UAVs are slower in flight and can loiter over a target until it emits again, they are less immediately responsive but can significantly extend the duration of suppressive effect. Israel and Azerbaijan have both demonstrated the effectiveness of these munitions in conflict. In combination with one-way-attack munitions, UAVs also force air defences to expend interceptors in self-defence. When a Patriot system was first deployed to Ukraine, for example, Russia fired 75 Shahed-136 UAVs at the system, which had to exhaust its interceptors in self-defence. While 73 UAVs were shot down, the two that got through damaged the Patriot system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this long history, however, there have been several relatively recent changes in the relationship between UAVs, air operations and air defence operations, driven by changes in technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the mass employment of UAVs for aerial reconnaissance – especially electro-optical observation – has arguably reduced joint force dependence on traditional air assets for ISR. This does not mean that the air component’s ISR capabilities do not have utility, but rather that they can be focused on a narrower set of tasks, such as identifying and classifying air defence radars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, although air strikes have long been the preferred means of engaging a very wide range of targets, many of the targets do not actually require the payloads deliverable from fast air to engage successfully. For many targets, UAVs with 10–50 kg warheads offer a cheaper and more widely available – albeit slightly less responsive – means of strike. This, therefore, should help the air component narrow its CAS offering to target sets where it has a uniquely useful capability, especially in the early phases of a SEAD/DEAD campaign, when opportunities for CAS will be limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the pervasive threat of UAVs to land formations and joint military installations means that counter-UAS (C-UAS) capabilities are now an all-arms and all-echelon concern. Because the challenge for C-UAS operations is to ensure the economical defeat of cheap, relatively slow-moving targets, few of the munitions would threaten aircraft at medium or high altitude, although they could pose a threat at low altitude. The sensors required for successful C-UAS coverage for ground forces, however, are likely to also enable widespread passive tracking of conventional air threats. Thus, hostile C-UAS capabilities will contribute to the challenge for friendly air operations over the battlefield. Equally, however, friendly ground force C-UAS sensor coverage may be able to reduce the burden on air force assets for wide-area detection, classification and tracking of potential air threats over the area of operations, allowing defensive counter-air assets to prioritise high Pk engagements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, between the 1970s and 2010s, UAVs were predominantly operating in blocks of airspace relevant to air operations, with a small number of UAVs flying at lower altitudes to assist tactical activity. It made sense, therefore, to treat these systems as aircraft and for their C2 to sit within air forces. Today, however, land forces can launch a wide range of highly capable UAVs that can (but will not always) enter blocks of airspace relevant to air operations. There is also considerable tactical utility in having UAVs that are organic to land forces and can therefore be launched closer to the target, reducing both transit time and allowing the UAV to be smaller relative to the effect it can have on the target. This means that, between friendly and enemy UAVs, the air space above land formations is liable to be increasingly congested with assets operated by both land and air forces, reporting to two very different C2 structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, the small number of UAVs being used and their role in day-one SEAD or flying routine “orbits” made the question of airspace deconfliction either bespoke, or straightforward. Today, however, it may be highly desirable for UAVs to be launched from multiple land force elements, targeting distinct parts of an IADS, in a manner that must synchronise with air operations and long-range munitions that travel at orders of magnitude greater speed. To give a simplified example of both the potential utility and complexity, consider the following hypothetical strike:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A Composite Air Operation (COMAO) is planned to destroy a strategic LRAD system in operational depth. The COMAO combines a mixture of fifth- and fourth-generation strike aircraft, with the former tasked with the location and both electromagnetic suppression and direct attacks on key radars, and the fourth-generation aircraft carrying greater numbers of stand-off munitions and decoys for suppression purposes. To locate and attack the mobile fire control and target-acquisition radar assets of the target LRAD system, the IADS must be stimulated to illuminate and engage either real or illusory threats. To have an acceptable Pk against the LRAD system, the fifth-generation aircraft must get well inside its potential engagement range. However, the LRAD system is protected by, and networked with, a much greater number of SHORAD and MRAD SAMs that are located in the gap between friendly territory and the LRAD system in the enemy deep. Since these systems are also mobile, some of them are also likely to be unlocated during the COMAO planning phase, thus presenting a “pop-up” threat for aircraft attempting to work their way into the IADS to attack the LRAD system. In short, it is difficult to effectively attack the LRAD system without also engaging the SHORAD and MRAD systems on the route towards it that strike aircraft and munitions are trying to use. However, it is difficult to safely and reliably locate, suppress and either bypass or destroy the SHORAD and MRAD systems without having first successfully suppressed the LRAD system that is supplying their cover and situational awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ground-based capabilities and UAVs can assist with this problem set in several ways. First, airborne ISTAR sensors such as those on the F-35 that can detect and geolocate SHORAD and MRAD systems can (if adequately supported by joint C2 networks) generate and pass real-time target coordinates to land-based fires to destroy, suppress or displace threats on the intended flight path of the COMAO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, launching loitering munitions from ground units against known MRAD sites near the front lines, with a loiter time covering the period of the COMAO, can impose significant risk on MRAD systems that choose to illuminate and engage the aircraft and air-launched weapons. Loitering munitions use is unlikely to stop all MRAD systems engaging the COMAO. However, between suppression from the COMAO’s self-defence EW capabilities, the threat from the ground-launched loitering munitions, and strikes from the aircraft where required, the risk can be substantially reduced. In terms of provoking sustained radar illumination by the strategic LRAD system, the use of aerial decoys and massed, cheap, one-way-attack UAS may force longer-range radar to stay active to support the elimination of false positives for other parts of the IADS, and in extremis to defend itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the combination of the air-launched stand-off weapons and ground-based TBMs can present the defensive systems with both manoeuvring cruise and quasi-ballistic targets that can better saturate SHORAD capacity to protect the main LRAD systems. This kind of multidomain strike involving at least three (land, air and space) and probably four (adding naval or cyber) domains of operations, with a need for precise synchronisation, takes significant levels of planning and must deal with the latency introduced by the friction of operations for land forces. How to coordinate such a strike is the subject of the next chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For land forces, contributing ISR and firepower in support of air operations may pay off in the long run, but it does not explain how the force is to have sufficient lethality in the absence of regular CAS before the SEAD/DEAD campaign has progressed sufficiently to enable control of the air where and when required. UAVs also play an important role in reducing some of the deficiency but are insufficient to provide a like-for-like substitute. It is important to consider how UAVs shape ground force demands of the air component, because this determines where force development in the air domain can prioritise effects against ground targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speed of response and heavy explosive payload constitute the real distinguishing features of air-launched munitions that are difficult to replicate using ground-based munitions. To that end, air is disproportionately valuable for engaging hardened or dug-in targets. Speed of munitions also makes air-launched weapons harder to intercept than most classes of UAV – at least in the absence of a functioning GBAD system. UAVs, however, are highly effective in conducting top attack, either against point targets or moving targets such as armoured vehicles. As the passive terminal homing capability of strike UAVs improves, the combination of rocket- or artillery-launched sensor-fuzed munitions, alongside UAVs, can probably obviate much of the traditional doctrinal emphasis placed on air interdiction of ground targets. Engaging hardened point targets is a mission where air-launched munitions are likely to retain disproportionate effectiveness compared with UAVs or ground-based artillery, but for less hardened targets like fighting positions, heavier UAVs, such as Russia’s Privet and Molnya UAVs have a sufficient payload and accuracy to replicate what would previously have been achieved with CAS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One intriguing question that emerges here is the data relationship between UAV crews and ground forces, especially regarding Joint Terminal Attack Controllers. With UAVs now the primary means for locating targets in the close and deep battlespace, the generation of strike coordinates is generally conducted at the level of the brigade headquarters. This is the structure that both the Ukrainian military and Israeli military have arrived at in the light of what is probably the most extensive experience of widespread UAV employment in joint operations. The result is that there is significantly less need for pilots to have assured communications with forward units, which was, in any case, one of the more vulnerable C2 links in a contested electromagnetic spectrum. However, if ground forces are to contribute corps or divisional deep fires such as precision strike missiles (PrSM), ATACMS or G-MLRS as responsive DEAD munitions as part of the wider SEAD/DEAD campaign, then that trend is reversed. This is because those artillery units would need to be able to receive and rapidly action time-sensitive target coordinates that are overwhelmingly likely to come directly from pilots in fifth-generation combat aircraft or potentially national-level orbital ISTAR assets. Getting the C2 structure right is therefore critical, and this is the subject of the next chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iv-command-and-control-for-joint-suppression-and-destruction-of-enemy-air-defences&quot;&gt;IV. Command and Control for Joint Suppression and Destruction of Enemy Air Defences&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While in theory there is huge potential to rapidly build up the much-needed capacity to degrade Russian air defences through expanded joint planning and campaign execution, in practice there are major challenges that must be solved if such an operational approach is to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the C2 arrangements for air-land integration for counterinsurgency and stabilisation operations at longer ranges have involved land as the supported and air as the supporting component, due to the nature of those campaigns. However, most of the find, fix and suppression capabilities needed for SEAD/DEAD are fielded by air and/or space forces. Furthermore, other critical capabilities also sit within national air forces and at NATO Allied Air Command (AIRCOM): most of the key ISTAR assets; the required processing, exploitation and dissemination (PED) capacity; and the personnel and expertise needed to continuously and rapidly conduct intermediate and advanced target development (ITD and ATD) at scale to populate the Joint Prioritized Target List (JPTL). Insofar as such capabilities have sat within corps headquarters in the land component, there is an identified need to disperse higher-ground force echelon C2 nodes in a way that is likely to complicate the capacity to develop such targets at these echelons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The requirements to sequence effects across domains within the extremely tight fuel–time–distance requirements of the COMAO plan for each pulse of activity will require the planning of maritime and land fires contributions to be largely synchronised with the timeline required by the air component, rather than the other way round. Thus, air will need to be the supported component during the initial SEAD/DEAD phase of any defensive campaign by NATO against Russian forces, which will require different C2 and planning arrangements from those that have provided synchronised joint effects in most Western overseas operations since the end of the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the Joint Force Command (JFC) centres in Norfolk, Brunssum (the Netherlands) and Naples have defined geographical areas of responsibility within which they are supposed to lead on campaign planning and execution, with support from other NATO Commands. However, for a SEAD/DEAD campaign in Europe against even localised Russian aggression, it would be necessary to conduct joint operations across the entire European theatre in a coherent way – from the Arctic to the Mediterranean. As a result, a C2 structure built around the assumption of either maritime or land forces being the supported component in each area of operations, with a JFC as the primary operational headquarters, presents a range of problems. While it might seem more logical for NATO AIRCOM to be the primary operation headquarters from an air perspective, this would present additional challenges for how land and maritime forces synchronise planning and execution of operations outside their currently assumed command structures. While the air component may have the expertise on targets relevant to setting the requirements for effects on target, the air component generally lacks relevant expertise in what is required to move land forces into position to fire, the protection of those forces, or the implications of cutting some land capabilities to these mission sets relative to their contribution to the land deep battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need for simultaneous effects for both SEAD and responsive DEAD fires from maritime and land forces as a key part of the COMAO requires extremely tight coordination during both planning and execution. It also requires C2 networks with the bandwidth, latency, security and redundancy to assure connectivity between airborne sensors and ground-based shooters in what would undoubtedly be a contested electromagnetic environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, there will be an urgent requirement to deconflict the flight paths of ground-based fires with friendly air assets, especially for high-apex quasi-ballistic weapons such as ATACMS, PrSM or GMLRS that would hopefully be fired in response to the identification of time-sensitive targets by air assets. That Concept of Employment (CONEMP) implies a strong possibility that friendly air assets would be considerably closer to the potential flight path of such weapons than traditional pre-planned deconfliction measures would rely on for safe separation. Electromagnetic deconfliction will also be a vital element of the joint planning process, to ensure that air-provided or orbital electromagnetic suppression of threat systems interfere as little as possible with friendly weapons in flight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further complication is that the echelon structure and battlespace geometry used to manage land operations do not correspond to those used by air operations. If it is a case of having M270 launchers at the corps echelon held ready to fire by the corps fire-control headquarters, to launch a missile that is synchronised with an air strike, then this is relatively straightforward. However, if the need is for UAVs to be launched from the brigade echelon, for general support artillery and EW to be applied from the divisional fires group, and for corps-level fires to be synchronised not with one another, but instead with a COMAO package and the threats that present themselves within the defensive system, then a level of inter-echelon C2 is required that land forces would struggle to achieve today within themselves, let alone in combination with the air component. Furthermore, it is highly unlikely that the flight plan adopted by the air component – and thus the sequencing of defensive fires – would correspond with the unit boundaries demarcating corps, divisional and brigade areas of responsibility. Nor can it be assumed that the assets to be engaged with corps, divisional and brigade fires would necessarily sit within the close and deep battle areas of regard used to federate responsibility by echelon within the land force. The risk, therefore, is not just that setting up the C2 structure to coordinate this mission would be complicated, but that it would require all fires across the corps to actively divert planning capacity and hold fires in reserve to respond to the air component’s needs, to such an extent that this could become detrimental to their efficiency in fighting the land battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present, the organisations with the most relevant relationships and knowledge to manage this deconfliction are the air defence cells within current headquarters, but these do not have the C2 relationships or (usually) the planning capacity to coordinate offensive fire. Finally, there is the issue of battle rhythm. At present, air operations are planned according to the 72-hour Air Tasking Order. This aligns with the corps’ battle rhythm, but not with the 48-hour divisional battle rhythm or 24-hour brigade battle rhythm, creating the risk that something planned by the air component will disrupt plans for land operations in subordinate land component formations. There is, therefore, a significant amount of work that needs to be done to harmonise the C2 structures to make such a concept executable. The most likely solution to this is for the land component Joint Air-Ground Integration Cell (JAGIC) to become the lynchpin of a joint counter-anti-access/area-denial operation, but this would require a significant increase in the representation of air and space operators in these elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also the more prosaic concern about land (and maritime) asset/ammunition allocation and training schedules. A wide range of joint fires and UAV assets from multiple NATO member countries could be extremely useful as part of joint SEAD/DEAD operations, but all are unlikely to be of practical use if they are allocated and deployed according to other operational priorities during the critical phases of defending against a Russian attack. This is more critical for land assets than maritime or air systems, due to the need for them to stage closer to the target(s) from a range perspective, as well as their slower mobility and greater logistical tail when deployed. An aircraft can quickly fly from one base to another, re-arm, refuel and conduct a sortie where needed within only a few hours almost anywhere in the European theatre. Maritime assets at sea can transit in a few days. But land forces typically take weeks to deploy and once deployed in a combat zone take weeks or months to move to a different part of the theatre en masse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If land-based fires are to play their potentially key role in enabling a successful NATO SEAD/DEAD campaign, therefore, there are several key requirements that must be met:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The units in question – most likely M270 or HIMARS GMLRS launchers in the first instance – need to be allocated to the SEAD/DEAD campaign, with stockpiles of suitable ammunition natures at both the army and joint planning levels.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Logistics plans at national and Alliance levels need to focus on deploying these land-based fires platforms, their crews, ammunition and other logistics enablers to the key areas on the borders of the Alliance during the first waves of any crisis mobilisation effort. This is a complex task and a major departure from the typically assumed role of these capabilities as part of the divisional or corps long-range fires group to be deployed as part of heavy follow-on forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Army units operating these systems need to regularly deploy as part of major annual SEAD/DEAD exercises run by NATO AIRCOM. Without doing so, it is almost impossible to anticipate and plan against the multitude of integration, planning and C2 challenges that are involved; and only by doing so can those problems begin to be credibly solved. Equally, Russian leaders will only be deterred by the enhanced SEAD/DEAD capability that greater joint integration can bring if they can at some level observe it being practically exercised. However, making participation in such exercises a regular feature of land (and maritime) long-range strike assets will require changing training and readiness schedules, which in turn will probably require altering how those assets are parochially viewed within their own service. At present, and despite a great deal of joint doctrine, there is a lack of joint training, which must be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current situation – in which European NATO members would struggle to conduct a successful SEAD/DEAD campaign to rapidly degrade Russian air defences if the US were unable (or potentially unwilling) to conduct the bulk of the task – is a dangerous one, and must be tackled as a matter of urgency. The threat facing US forces in the Indo-Pacific means that there are multiple crisis scenarios that could see the bulk of US air and maritime forces committed far from Europe, and the first months of the second Trump presidency have already sparked major concerns about the level of US commitment to European security. At the very least, the new US administration has made it clear that it expects Europe to take on a far greater share of the burden in underwriting Article 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only clear route to a predominantly European NATO posture that can threaten a Russian force with sufficient combat power to make a “defence by denial” posture credible by the mid- to late 2020s is to generate the capacity to rapidly suppress and ultimately destroy the bulk of Russian ground-based air defences on the borders of Alliance territory, should a conflict start. If the IADS is badly degraded, Russian ground forces would be left exposed to the devastating firepower of hundreds of fourth-generation fast jets and attack helicopters against battlefield targets such as armoured vehicles, gun lines, command posts and logistics hubs. Despite likely local numerical and ground-based firepower superiority, the Russian armed forces would have little capacity to respond in such a scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as this paper has attempted to explain, generating the required SEAD/DEAD capacity requires incorporating joint fires into SEAD/DEAD COMAOs to generate the necessary simultaneous effects to overcome the layered self-defence capacity of the Russian IADS. It also requires equipping land forces with capabilities that can substitute for the firepower traditionally provided by CAS – at least for the initial few weeks of defensive fighting until the SEAD/DEAD campaign is sufficiently well advanced to allow CAS to be conducted again, at larger scale, in support of forward forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the wider force structure, organisation, doctrine, training and exercising implications – of which there are many – there are several munitionsprocurement decisions to be made, without which the task is almost impossible to achieve:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;European air forces must be provisioned with significant numbers of munitions with the required combination of stand-off range, automatic terminal target acquisition, guidance capabilities and survivability to reliably get through Russian defences and destroy high-priority GBAD radars and SAM systems. For F-35A operators, this primarily means the AGM-88G AARGM-ER, or potentially the AGM-184A JSM. However, those weapons are not a particularly attractive option for the UK, which operates the F-35B, since they would need to be carried externally, compromising the stealth capabilities of the aircraft. Instead, the focus must be on ordering the SPEAR miniature cruise missile and SPEAR-EW stand-in jamming variant in quantity for both F-35Bs and Typhoon to use in a stand-off support role. SPEAR could also offer a European production option of a critical class of munitions, if procured by other European members of NATO. Large numbers of GBU-39/B are still useful for suppressive effects, can force SAM operators to expend available interceptors inefficiently, and may get through to targets if used alongside other layered capabilities from other domains. Decoys such as the ADM-160 MALD family are also huge force multipliers for any SEAD/DEAD COMAO. While critical to engaging crucial elements of the IADs, however, they would be insufficient by themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For land forces, the key munitions for SEAD/DEAD support are likely to be the new PrSM, as well as extended range G-MLRS rockets and any older ATACMS stocks that the US might be willing to provide for forces equipped with compatible M270 or HIMARS launchers in Europe. In the longer term, establishing European production of cheaper munitions that can be launched from the M270 should be a priority. Submunitions-equipped warhead variants of long-range weapons systems are far more effective as DEAD weapons against Russian SAM systems than are unitary warhead versions, as they compensate for degradation in accuracy and can damage multiple elements of the SAM battery simultaneously. SAM batteries generally spread their elements out when deployed to minimise the damage from any unitary strike, and EW interference may degrade accuracy and reduce the reliability of fuzing. Submunitions warheads therefore offer a much higher chance of a few rounds successfully delivered onto the rough location of the SAM site destroying or damaging the key radar systems and as many launchers as possible. They are also necessary to enable land forces to significantly increase their lethality against Russian ground forces in the open and on the move – within likely logistical, financial and tactical weight of fire constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Countries purchasing such munitions natures would need to withdraw from the Convention on Cluster Munitions. The Convention is an important and admirable arms control success, but one to which countries acceded on the assumption that large-scale warfare between major powers was no longer a force-driving assumption – a situation that has indisputably changed. It is also important to note that in any conflict with Russian forces both they and some NATO member countries would be employing cluster munitions on a large scale, meaning that the problems associated with unexploded submunitions would be present in any contested territory, regardless of whether some NATO forces limited their own defensive options by foregoing them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Loitering munitions, especially those with anti-radiation seeker capabilities, could allow land forces to further contribute to the SEAD/DEAD campaign by providing suppressive effects against Russian SHORAD and MRAD systems relatively close to the front lines over a significantly longer period than conventional anti-radiation missiles. This would greatly increase the effectiveness of aircraft and air-launched weapons against the primary target set of long-range strategic SAMs and early warning radars. However, as with the use of long-range ground-based PrSM, ATAMCS and GMLRS-ER as DEAD weapons against those same LRAD targets, the use of loitering munitions for SEAD effects would need to be carefully planned and coordinated with the COMAO timings, with air as the supported command. These munitions also require much more regular updates to remain effective, which must be a consideration in their acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To achieve the effects required, one of the first steps that the UK and other European NATO member countries should consider – alongside orders of relevant munitions – is to start incorporating army rocket artillery and one-way attack UAS units into regular SEAD/DEAD exercises run by NATO AIRCOM. This would require synchronising their training and exercise programmes with a different tempo and calendar, and initially might yield little in terms of useful strike contributions. However, such unit participation in AIRCOM large-scale multinational SEAD/DEAD exercises would start generating concrete data on the most urgent C2, data standardisation and airspace deconfliction bottlenecks that need to be addressed. It would also be a visible signal of joint SEAD/DEAD capability development that Russian military intelligence would notice, and might start to positively influence their expectations of European SEAD/DEAD capability growth – one of the best ways to increase deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are clear implications in terms of land forces maintaining sufficient firepower to fight in the absence of regular CAS during the initial weeks of operations. First, a proportion of the rocket artillery in corps artillery groups (and periodically howitzers from the divisional artillery groups) will not be available for supporting fire against targets in the corps and divisional deep, but will instead need to support air operations. European nations thus need to increase the number of howitzers in their formations. For rocket artillery, there is a desperate need to increase the magazine depth available. This should prompt the production of cheaper and simpler rockets in Europe, to fire from existing launchers. Munitions must also be stockpiled for divisional tube artillery. In both cases, the pushing of artillery into greater depth with loitering munitions imposes a limit on the weight of salvo that can be generated against a given target. Overcoming this again requires maximising the lethality of each round, and thus the fielding of thermobaric munitions, sensor-fuzed munitions, and rounds with submunitions. This too would require withdrawal from the Convention on Cluster Munitions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a great deal of alarm in Europe about the state of readiness of conventional forces relative to the pace of Russian force generation. The alarm is justified, but conventional deterrence is also achievable. Making clear to Russia that munitions and UAS are being bought in sufficient numbers to make existing air- and ground-launched capabilities credible, and that training and reform of joint C2 is being undertaken to undermine the foundational protection of Russian military units, would significantly shift Russia’s calculus in terms of the feasibility of challenging the Alliance. A focused set of investments across European NATO to develop the industrial capacity to sustain these operations would similarly signal to the US that the continent is taking its own defence seriously. The resources, technology and time needed to secure Europe against further military aggression all exist; but there is no time for delay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After three years of fighting, many of the Russian navy’s limitations in the Black Sea have been exposed. The Black Sea Fleet has lost around a third of its combat strength and has been forced from its home port at Sevastopol by the threat of Ukrainian long-range strike capabilities along with Uncrewed Surface Vessels (USVs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the invocation of Article 19 of the Montreux convention by Turkey, limiting the ability of both belligerent parties’ vessels to transit the Bosporus and Dardanelles, creates considerable limitations for both Russia and most NATO members in region. For Russia, should a ceasefire result in a relaxation of the convention, any vessel deployed to the Black Sea would be fixed in the region in the event of re-invocation and a return to hostilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Montreux, by design, limits the freedom of action of NATO members not based in the Black Sea. It might, then, be asked whether the region will become, to some extent, a peripheral one for both Russia and NATO, and one which should be accorded secondary importance relative to maritime theatres such as the High North.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this view is understandable, the Black Sea retains considerable importance within Russian maritime – and the wider – economic strategy. Despite Turkey’s access-control, other non-riparian alliance members would be poorly served by a failure to engage with the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-black-sea-in-russian-maritime-strategy&quot;&gt;The Black Sea in Russian Maritime Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Black Sea has several important functions in Russian maritime strategy. Russia is the world’s second largest oil exporter, with 22% of shipments coming through Black Sea loading points like the Novorossiysk Commercial Sea Port. The impact of oil-related sanctions is well documented, as is Russia’s attempts to circumvent them, including with its shadow fleet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is notable that Russia’s sanction-related demands during the ceasefire negotiations have pertained to agriculture-related banking access. Black Sea ports such as Novorossiysk and Taman represent the primary export hubs for wheat and grain and are of considerable importance to Russian maritime strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While not as financially significant as oil, the export of agricultural products is an increasingly important part of Russia’s export portfolio. It continues to harvest from land occupied since 2022. In 2024, for example, the value of agricultural exports reached $43 billion. This is a far cry from the value of hydrocarbon exports but nonetheless means that foodstuffs are, in financial terms, Russia’s second most important export product, with the value of exports in this sector exceeding that of pre-war arms exports (traditionally an important source of revenue) twofold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In years to come, continuing population growth and the impact of climate change on Global South agricultural production will likely grow the value of the agricultural sector considerably. While Russia is unlikely to eliminate its structural reliance on the sale of hydrocarbons, it is hoped that a more diversified export portfolio can allow it to mitigate some of the risks which its current overreliance on energy creates. To some extent this is already the case as rising revenues from agriculture are one factor (albeit among others) which partially offsets hydrocarbon revenue declining in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance of agriculture to the Russian leadership is illustrated by the longstanding practice of setting ambitious export targets for the sector backed by state subsidies. Russia has long viewed exporting strategic goods – and creating reliance on these critical and not easily substitutable products – as a key pillar of its geoeconomic strategy in a world where it will not be one of the major players in terms of GDP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food will generate political value well in excess of its commercial value for regions such as the Middle East and North Africa, where food insecurity remains a chronic concern and can impact regime stability. We might remember, for example, that food shortages were a proximate cause for the Arab Spring protests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Land conflict is also a source of instability in the Sahel region, where Russia is continuing to focus diplomatic efforts. Not only does this provide influence over the region but given the second order effects of instability within the Middle East for Europe, it implies leverage over NATO as well. Russia can see the political opportunities that this provides, as illustrated by its attempts, prior to the fall of Assad, to invest $500 million in a commercial facility near its naval base in Tartus to use as a grain export hub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometime between middle of the next decade and the early 2040s, Russia will also have to grapple with peak oil (the period at which global demand for hydrocarbons is at its zenith) after which we will see a shrinking market for hydrocarbons. Coordination with other oil producers through frameworks like OPEC+ will become increasingly difficult. Not only can agricultural exports offset possible financial losses but if Russia can achieve something approximating a monopolistic position as an exporter of staple foodstuffs to many OPEC nations it will enjoy some leverage in negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia thus has strong incentives to both facilitate agricultural exports through the Black Sea and undercut Ukraine’s ability to export food, in order to extend its own control over these key markets. Thus, even after any ceasefire we should still expect the disruption of Ukrainian maritime trade to remain a long-term Russian aim. If a ceasefire is agreed, we should expect to see a reprisal of the tactics Russia adopted in the Sea of Azov in 2014-2022, in which the obstruction of maritime traffic by the Kerch bridge and periodic harassment of vessels led to a steep reduction in container traffic to and from Ukrainian ports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One avenue for Russia to achieve maritime trade disruption would be to clandestinely mine the approaches to Odessa and explain any mine strike as being the result of drifting residual Ukrainian mines from the war. Alternatively they could periodically harass and interdict vessels using Russian ships, something which has already occurred near Bulgarian waters. Ukraine could not as easily target naval vessels harassing shipping in the context of a ceasefire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, during any breakdowns of a ceasefire, Russia is likely to use such periods of conflict to target Odessa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the importance of export markets for Ukraine and NATO, the maritime component of the 100-year partnership between the UK and Ukraine may have a particular significance. Whether Turkey reopens the straits to belligerents’ navies during a ceasefire is important to both sides. If it does, this should allow the Ukrainian mine hunter vessels, stuck in Portsmouth since early 2024, to enter the Black Sea. Additionally, the UK maintains an expeditionary Mine Counter Measures (MCM) capability including Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) and other uncrewed systems, which could deploy to the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to disposing of mines, systems such as the Towed Synthetic Aperture Module (TSAM) can be used to generate high resolution images of the seabed in critical shipping route and port approaches. Demonstrating the absence of mines should help deter future Russian mining as a breach of ceasefire could be demonstrated easily. This, combined with the activity of the MCM Black Sea group under Turkish leadership, will ideally reduce the current and future mine threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equally, the importance of dealing with harassment by surface ships in a lower-intensity conflict provides an incentive for regenerating a Ukrainian surface-fleet through frameworks like the UK-Ukraine 100-year agreement. Even if vulnerable in high-intensity conflict, these vessels’ ability to conduct peacetime security and policing activity is a requirement for any sovereign maritime state, and vital to limiting Russia’s interdiction and harassment in a ceasefire context where sinking ships with coastal missile batteries may not be an option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another consideration is the role of the other navies of the Black Sea. While navies such as the Romanian Navy are recapitalising their forces, the most important player by some distance is Turkey. Turkey’s dominance has been improved considerably by the attrition of the Black Sea Fleet, but control of the straits gives Turkey leverage – although it has tried hard to present itself as an honest broker. The potential role of Turkey and regional navies – should any reassurance force for the security of Ukraine materialise – is one that merits close consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-black-sea-as-a-lynchpin-of-russias-southern-strategy&quot;&gt;The Black Sea as a Lynchpin of Russia’s Southern Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second critical role that the Black Sea has is as a lynchpin of Russia’s power projection beyond its immediate environs. Historically, expeditionary squadrons such as the 5th Eskadra (the Soviet Mediterranean squadron) have been subordinated to the Black Sea Fleet since it is from this region that they can be most easily rotated and resupplied. Deploying vessels from further afield, by contrast, imposes considerable demands on a Russian navy, a green-water fleet comprised of frigates and corvettes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Russia cannot confront NATO in a conflict at reach, it can engage in more limited activity where the Black Sea Fleet might be central. For example, the fleet served as the logistical backbone of the Russian intervention in Syria in 2015 with Ropucha-class LSTs running a logistical operation dubbed the “Syrian Express.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Success in Syria provided the Russians a greater presence in the Eastern Mediterranean, which allowed it to set up a limited (but not wholly irrelevant) anti-access bubble and engage in actions such as convoying Iranian oil to Syria. Russia’s construction of future amphibious vessels such as the project 23900 is also concentrated in the Zaliv shipyard in Crimea, illustrating the centrality of the Black Sea Fleet in Russian thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Russia secures access to ports in Sudan and potentially Libya, its coercive and disruptive options increase. In Sudan, Russian vessels and associated systems would straddle the Red Sea, with ramifications in peacetime and conflict. In peacetime, the mere presence of hostile capabilities in an area makes moving military vessels more difficult and costly, with multiple ISR assets dedicated to any single journey. In effect this means that routine naval activity will become more costly and difficult. In conflict, as demonstrated by Houthis in the Red Sea, even a limited sea-denial capability can significantly constrain shipping. Contending with this challenge would draw platforms from the European theatre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s extra European maritime hubs, while not formidable, are not inconsequential. These can be symbiotically linked to the Black Sea Fleet. Whilst they can operate even if the Black Sea Fleet is constrained – Tartus was kept running with vessels rotated from the Baltic Fleet after 2022 – this would become more logistically challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-black-sea-fleet-in-a-hot-war&quot;&gt;The Black Sea Fleet in a Hot War&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its limitations, the Black Sea Fleet would be significant in a hot war between Russia and NATO. Though comprised mostly of corvette-sized vessels such as the Karakurt-class, the fleet holds a considerable portion of Russia’s throw-weight for sea-launched cruise missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One 2019 estimate of the Southern military district (comprising the Black Sea Fleet and the Caspian flotilla) found it possessed the launch capacity for 80 long ranged land attack missiles in a single salvo, compared with 85 in the western military district and 56 in the Northern Fleet. This balance has likely shifted with changes to the Northern Fleet, but the Zaliv shipyard is due to deliver 7 further Karakurt-class corvettes to the Russian navy by 2027 (although one, the Askold, was destroyed in a Ukrainian attack). Each Karakurt-class vessel carries 8 VLS (vertical launching system) cells and the forthcoming order of new ships, if bolstering the Black Sea Fleet, will mean it retains a considerable portion of Russia’s overall cruise missile throw-weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this means the fleet can launch cruise missiles from the relative safety of Russian controlled waters. Vessels can be sunk in defended bastions, as demonstrated by Ukraine, but at a significant cost in terms of numbers of munitions expended. There is also threat to aircraft and vessels which must be operated within range of Crimea’s A2AD capabilities. These include long-range SAM (surface-to-air-missile) systems and anti-ship complexes such as the Bastion-P. This is not an insurmountable challenge but a costly one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The missile threat to civilian targets from the Black Sea would make it politically difficult and costly to exercise sea control at distance even though this might be the most militarily rational approach. Allied navies and air forces would be pulled towards the heart of Russia’s anti-access capabilities even though the Alliance’s advantages compound further from the Russian shores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The growth of Ukrainian long-range strike capabilities is thus of significance not only to Ukraine but also to NATO, and this should be a key priority of ongoing and future efforts to support Ukraine in the maritime domain. Ukraine has conducted consistent strikes on Crimea using both air-launched storm shadow missiles and ground-launched UAVs. An expansion of its A2AD capabilities to include a larger number of short-ranged ballistic missiles would complicate the Black Sea Fleet’s position. By dint of proximity Ukraine can also employ more expendable systems such as USVs. The growth of Ukrainian anti-access capabilities, assuming coordination with Allied systems in a conflict, would mitigate, though not remove, the challenge posed by the Russian Black Sea Fleet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second threat that the Black Sea Fleet would likely pose in a conflict is the mining of chokepoints such as the Bosporus and the multiple avenues for its sea lines of communication. The economic consequences of mining may be limited for members of the alliance. For example, maritime freight comprises 16% of Romania’s freight and an even smaller portion of Bulgaria’s, while Turkey has many non-Black Sea ports. However, mining at chokepoints would complicate the reinforcement of the region by non-riparian Allies. The challenge is fairly well understood, however, with efforts both on a trilateral basis between Turkey, Romania and Bulgaria and across the Alliance to mitigate mine threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more pressing challenge will be anti-submarine warfare (ASW) against the fleet’s six-kilo-class submarines. There is likely to be some capability growth within the region as Romania takes delivery of three French Scorpène-class submarines and Turkey progresses with an ambitious frigate building programme. However, ASW is a task which requires the close coordination of air, surface and subsurface platforms that often necessitates the sharing of sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coordinated ASW in the region will require both political and organisational trust and capabilities to be exercised on a large-scale basis. This appears, on balance, unlikely to occur on a regional basis in the short-term and while Alliance-wide ASW exercises conducted elsewhere can provide some corporate-knowledge, the specific characteristics of ASW differ by region. The alliances most viable pathway to constraining the Black Sea Fleet’s submarines runs through the emergence of Turkey as an actor capable of providing theatre ASW capabilities within the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it may be tempting for naval strategists to write-off Russia’s capabilities in the Black Sea and focus heavily on threats to the North, the region retains both strategic and military significance. Members of NATO such as the UK should thus think in terms of a long-term campaign to constrain the Russian Black Sea Fleet’s freedom of action. This will involve working with partners including Ukraine but increasingly, Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more credible post-war Ukrainian navy built around a limited flotilla of MCM vessels and patrol ships to constrain grey-zone blockades will be vital to ensuring that the Black Sea Fleet cannot militarily support a commercial strategy for the emergence of Russia as a monopolistic provider of food in key regions. In a conflict, Ukrainian anti-access capabilities can contribute to limiting the Black Sea Fleet’s freedom to operate. Equally, actors such as Turkey, have considerable strategic significance and it will be important to make the best of a likely Russo-Turkish duopoly in the region by bolstering Turkey’s ability to emerge as the dominant actor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the recent rhetorical and postural shifts signalled by the Trump administration with regards to the transatlantic relationship and NATO, European partners are left with more questions than answers. As they reel from what appears to be a fundamental shift in this historic alliance, they ask themselves: are these changes limited to President Trump, or do they signal a larger ideological and strategic realignment at work in the United States? To what extent do Americans support Trump’s foreign policy priorities? Is there room for dissent in the foreign policy debate that may give hope for a return to a familiar approach?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;donald-trump-and-europe-art-of-the-deal-or-ideology&quot;&gt;Donald Trump and Europe: “Art of the Deal” or Ideology?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump is not an ideologue operating from a grand strategy playbook. He is, however, driven by a handful of core beliefs. First, the US has made an outsized contribution to fund and underwrite the post-Second World War international order and has not benefited nearly to the level of its payments into the system. Second, alliance-based foreign policy has led to the enrichment of others, to the exploitation of America, and to the degradation of its standing in the world. Third, the economic prism functions as the primary (but not exclusive) framework for qualifying and achieving “America First”, a worldview characterized fundamentally by hard power with no interest in the notions of influence and credibility built by investing in soft power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With his stated admiration for President William McKinley, Donald Trump has shown a penchant for that president’s 19th century policies of economic protectionism and territorial expansion, regardless of the historical debates ultimately questioning the efficacy of such a legacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Donald Trump is more focused on transactions than on commitment to a particular ideology, he is bookended by two dominant figures – Vice President JD Vance and Elon Musk – each with expressed ideological tendencies and complimentary functions in Trump’s orbit. Both Vance and Musk share Trump’s preference for disrupting – if not dismantling – the system and ridding it of what they perceive as entrenched interests and waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk has made clear his disdain for allies, universities, media, immigration, and US membership in the UN and NATO (among others) while also adopting a “chainsaw” approach to gut federal spending and the federal workforce. Overseas, he has hailed right-wing movements in more than fifteen countries on six continents through vigorous public support (online or in person) for parties, figures, and causes defending nationalism, nativism, and anti-regulation in their respective lands. If there is an international ambition for the spread of ideological Trumpism, Musk is its one of its most visible and loudest proponents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JD Vance has carved a very visible space for himself in the Trump orbit, far exceeding the image of the eternally eclipsed vice president. Through his willingness to act as Trump’s attack dog and with his full embrace of Trump foreign policy ideas, Vance is quickly positioning himself as an inevitable successor for 2028.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supported in his political rise by Peter Thiel, Vance has come to embrace scepticism of alliances, anti-immigration sentiment, hostility for free trade, and criticism of American military engagement as being harmful to working class Americans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vance has been vehemently critical of Ukraine and US aid to that country’s war effort, insistent on the need for Ukrainian territorial concessions to Russia, and an advocate for a fast end to the war in Gaza. And Vance, like Musk, has been a fervent critic of Europe. JD Vance’s understanding of the inner workings of American politics, particularly the Senate, and his unhidden presidential ambitions (Elon Musk recently referred to Vance as “the next president of the United States”) make him a key figure in the intellectualization, institutionalization, and perennialization of Trumpian ideals both at home and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent statements from Trump administration officials regarding Europe (including Trump himself, but also Vance and Secretary of Defense Peter Hegseth) embody at least three beliefs in Republican foreign policy circles. First, the US must finally reduce its engagements in Europe in order to shift to the Indo-Pacific (Vance, Hegseth).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The underlying assumptions are that the US cannot fight against Russia and China simultaneously and must reorient its security apparatus to better curb the rise of its new peer competitor in Beijing. Second, the US would do better to deal with European nations on a bilateral basis rather than to negotiate with the European Union, the world’s second-largest economic power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US would then be able to incentivize those countries who reinforce defence and economic cooperation with Washington while threatening or punishing – via tariffs for example - those that do not. Shared values do not matter in this approach, transactions do. Finally, there is a belief among many policymakers in the United States that Europe is of decreasing relevance as a geopolitical player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent leaked private Signal exchanges were but the latest confirmation that Trump administration contempt for Europe runs deeper than mere public posturing (“I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It’s PATHETIC.” wrote Hegseth to Vance). Particularly JD Vance, as the nation’s second most powerful elected official, embodies criticisms that go beyond grumbling about imbalanced defence spending and emphasize societal culture war issues that fuel the MAGA movement in the US. In Munich, Vance accused European democracies and their institutions of denying free speech by regulating hate speech, of “civilizational suicide” by not curbing immigration, and of ignoring voters’ concerns on these issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That same speech, lambasting traditional allies, amounted to implicit support for Germany’s AfD in the days leading up to elections there, just as he met with its leader Alice Weidel shortly after. Faced with pushback from this speech, Vance later doubled down: “The transatlantic elite have created so many institutions to silence their own people and to delegitimize the beliefs of the public.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vance’s rhetoric would indicate the desire to support Trumpism abroad through support for populist parties and governments that align with Trump’s societal and economic policies characterized by anti-elite, anti-immigration, and anti-regulation sentiment. This would make Vance, along with Musk, a key player in transforming an ideological worldview into real foreign policy realignments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-does-trump-foreign-policy-fit-with-us-public-opinion&quot;&gt;How does Trump Foreign Policy Fit with US Public Opinion?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up-to-date, extensive public opinion polling on foreign policy is relatively scarce; but recent Gallup polls shows that Americans’ top preferences are not entirely out of line with the president’s overall international priorities even if they are increasingly expressing reserve about his means to achieve them. Across parties, Americans’ chief preoccupations are preventing terrorism and nuclear proliferation, securing the US’s energy supply, and promoting favourable trade policies. Values-based prerogatives like providing humanitarian assistance, building democracies, and the economic development of other countries fall to the bottom of the list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Americans of both parties placed these issues last, but Democrats showed more support for them than their Republican counterparts. Small majorities of Americans indicated support for defending allies’ security more generally (58%), and for Ukraine specifically (50%). Regarding the method for guaranteeing US interests, about 60% of Americans surveyed confirmed their approval for acting through multilateral channels like the UN and NATO. Within that figure lies a clear division along partisan lines. In the case of both the UN and NATO, approximately 9 out of 10 Democrats were in favor compared to just 4 Republicans out of 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even some of Trump’s more controversial recent decisions – freezing humanitarian aid and taking steps to gut USAID – have not created a watershed moment to crystalize public opinion against him. If around two-thirds of Americans believe that shuttering USAID will lead to death elsewhere or to more humanitarian crises, nearly half also say that Trump’s decision will allow that money to be directed to domestic problems and/or to reducing the national deficit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, most Americans do not want humanitarian aid to be cut entirely, even among those who argue that the US spends too much. And generally, Americans overestimate the amount its government typically spends on such assistance. Nonetheless, this polling echoes a sentiment long in the making – Americans concerned about dire domestic issues (decaying infrastructures, the homelessness crisis) are increasingly wary of sending money far away rather than investing at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond recent foreign policy public opinion polling, it is worth noting that Americans’ perceptions of threats and opportunities are changing. An overwhelming majority of Americans consider China to be either a threat or an enemy. And deeper, ineluctable demographic shifts are gradually turning Americans’ attention away from Europe. Young Americans (starting with Millennials) are most likely to have one immigrant parent. They are the most multicultural generations in US history. They indicate less personal attachment to Europe and look more to the East and to the South as the theater for international challenges and solutions (NB: Hispanics are the fastest growing demographic group and currently account for about 20% of the US population).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The growing distance from Europe – embodied increasingly by the sociodemographic profile of the American population – is also evident within this administration. The Trump II foreign policy team counts little European expertise but is perhaps the most experienced on Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;little-incentive-for-dissent&quot;&gt;Little Incentive for Dissent&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, there is little incentive within the Republican party to question Donald Trump’s stewardship of American foreign policy, and Democratic voices on international issues are not in a position to alter the political landscape. The president’s action is not misaligned with public opinion – his stated goals, particularly around the economy, energy and, to a lesser extent, terrorism are coherent with what matters to Americans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If most Americans support multilateralism and alliances, the president’s disdain for both is nonetheless supported by his MAGA base and Republican voters. Since the president fixes the country’s foreign policy orientations, his party gives him wide berth to do just that, and Trump is no exception. In other words, there is no reason to expect meaningful and impactful dissent at this stage. And were he to face a public challenge, Donald Trump has repeatedly shown readiness to wield the threat of mounting a midterm primary challenge to dissenters, to be financed by Musk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if some Republicans in Congress will discreetly indicate their continued support for the funding the Ukrainian war effort, for example, the electoral risk and political price (vis-à-vis Trump but also with regards to their voters) for open opposition is often too high for all but a handful of the most prominent Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next major electoral moment will take place with the 2026 midterms. If voters tire of Republican Party policies, they will have the opportunity to deliver (at least partial) control of Congress back to Democrats as well as governorships and other state and local offices. Foreign policy, however, is unlikely to figure into voters’ decision-making. Instead, touchstone campaign issues – particularly the economy and inflation – will dominate their thinking. A future Democratic congressional majority would grant the opposition more authority to influence foreign policy (with their power over the budget and ability to authorize or require foreign policy actions such as sanctions), but the president will still have the power of the bully pulpit.&lt;/p&gt;

Western policymakers should study Russia’s economic adaptation and update their sanctions strategy accordingly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter the outcome of ongoing ceasefire negotiations over the war in Ukraine, Russia will remain an acute security threat to Ukraine, Europe, and the United States. The sanctions tool kit will remain among the most potent weapons to contain Russian power, and specifically the ability of the Russian state to marshal its resources for conventional military confrontation. The Western sanctions regime imposed on Russia in the wake of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 had clear successes, even if the threat of these sanctions failed to stop the invasion itself. However, its effectiveness has also had undeniable limits, and often unintended consequences. Through technocratic skill, its wealth of natural resources, and the slow-moving and inconsistent implementation of Western sanctions, Russia has had the time and capacity to adapt to the sanctions challenge over the last three years. This reality means that some of the sanctions imposed on Russia will offer diminishing returns over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This piece will provide an overview of Western sanctions policy toward Russia as it currently stands, outlining its largest successes and clearest shortcomings, as well as articulating new ways to apply acute pressure on Russia, should the Kremlin choose to open some sort of new front in its effort to undermine Western commitment to limiting Russian aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part I of the paper covers the initial impacts of the sanctions regime on the Russian economy. Next, Part II runs through the lessons Russia learned from the sanctions imposed in 2014, and how these lessons were applied in 2022. Part III of the paper addresses the question of how Vladimir Putin may have ultimately decided to move forward with his full-scale invasion of Ukraine, despite the economic risks. Part IV then turns to the ways the Kremlin has taken advantage of Russia’s wartime economy, the unique impacts of international sanctions, and its domestic political dominance to further strengthen its position at home. The paper concludes with recommendations for those tasked with implementing future sanctions policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sanctions policy should not be framed as a suite of punitive measures that retroactively punish Russia for past bad behavior, but should instead be used as a coherent strategy of economic containment designed to weaken Russian power, and decisively and quickly bring Russia to the negotiating table in the event of future bad behavior. In this vein, sanctions practitioners should head back to the drawing board and try to think of new and creative ways to rapidly constrain Russia’s material ability to project power in a moment of crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;part-i-the-onset-of-the-2022-sanctions-regime-and-its-impact-on-the-russian-economy&quot;&gt;Part I: The Onset of the 2022 Sanctions Regime and Its Impact on the Russian Economy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;oil-and-fiscal-engineering&quot;&gt;Oil and Fiscal Engineering&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sanctions imposed on Russia at the start of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine targeted three main pillars of the country’s economy. Firstly, by disconnecting most Russian banks and companies from international finances and freezing Russian sovereign, corporate, and private foreign reserves, the United States and its allies hit the Central Bank of Russia’s ability to support the ruble, cross-border trade, and Russia’s capital account, thereby closing the doors for capital to easily enter or leave the country. Secondly, they targeted the import of goods and services, on which Russia continues to depend. Thirdly, the sanctions targeted Russian energy exports, the crucial source of government income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia based its economic defense on massively stimulating fiscal spending and actively keeping capital from exiting the country. Sanctions gave the Kremlin political cover to keep capital from leaving Russia via the stick of capital controls and the carrot of an overnight spike in domestic interest rates. Western bans on Russians making European stock investments and deposits in European banks, as well as overcompliance on the part of Western financial institutions, helped stymie the kind of massive capital flight that could have put a heavier strain on the ruble and Russia’s balance of payments. In contrast, when the People’s Bank of China launched a surprise devaluation of the renminbi in 2015, concerns over the value of renminbi-denominated deposits and ensuing capital flight led to a $1 trillion drop in Chinese foreign exchange reserves as the central bank fought to defend the yuan. Nothing of the sort happened in Russia in early 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most effective capital controls put in place by the Russian government was the requirement that Western firms operating in Russia pay any dividends or proceeds from the sale of their assets into special “type-C” accounts domestically, thereby seizing these assets and keeping their value onshore. Effectively, the people who paid for the freezing of Russia’s sovereign reserves were foreigners who had invested in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The West and the Kremlin, albeit with opposite intentions, effectively combined their efforts to keep capital inside of Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian oil and gas revenues, collected by the state through taxes, were the primary source of maintaining financial and social stability for years. They accounted for over half of federal budget revenue in 2011–2014, while dropping to as low as 28 percent in 2020 due to a sharp decline in prices amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Oil was more critical for the economy than gas. Russia’s energy export strategy was based on the principle that oil exports are more important for income, and gas exports are more important for political influence, especially in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian finance ministry had developed a system called “the fiscal rule” to mitigate the volatility of the international energy market. In a nutshell, the rule worked as follows. The government sets a specific oil price derived from a long-term historical series on which it balances the budget. If the oil price or, rather, the revenue denominated in rubles exceeds the planned level, all of the extra income should be converted and directed to the rainy-day National Wealth Fund (NWF). The central bank, acting on behalf of the finance ministry, buys the dollars in the domestic market to sterilize extra revenue and prevent the ruble from over-strengthening. If the price of oil drops, a decline in fiscal revenue is partially mitigated by a weakening ruble and partially by the sales of the dollars from the abovementioned fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This clever fiscal engineering prevented ruble swings, smoothed out inflation, and supported domestic industry by weakening the currency. On the whole, before 2023, the “base” oil price was consistently lower than the actual oil prices, thus creating a constant flow of savings to the fund. This conservative policy proved to be wise during the 2020 slump, as the fund’s usage helped mitigate the negative consequences of collapsing oil sales. Intentionally or not, the freeze of the central bank’s foreign reserves, which included part of the National Wealth Fund’s liquid assets by the West, reduced this Russian ability to moderate swings in the value of the ruble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another blow to the fiscal books came from the breakdown of oil sales. Facing sanctions, Europe’s gradual refusal to buy Russian oil, and an imposition of the so-called price cap, Russia started shifting sales to Asia—primarily India, China, and Turkey. The price cap mechanism provides a compromise between the European readiness to stop Russian oil and the U.S. eagerness to keep Russian oil flowing to prevent a rise in gasoline prices, of which crude represents a much higher share than in Europe due to lower taxes. The price cap allows Western insurers, brokers, shippers, and other relevant parties to sign contracts for Russian oil only if its price doesn’t exceed the cap. It also allows the nonparticipating buyers to haggle a discount on the market price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These measures resulted in a discount at which Russia sold its oil, although this was offset by overall higher global prices in 2022 and 2023. Moreover, the reported discounts, as it turned out, were driven more by the tax regime, ill-fitted for the new reality, than by the actual Russian income from oil exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responding to the issue within its tax structure, the Russian government acted swiftly. Today, the tax collected from oil no longer depends directly on the reported, easy-to-distort, realized price of exported oil. The fiscal oil revenues are defined by the global price of oil and the amount produced. Oil companies’ incomes still depend on their sales and costs, which affects the amount of corporate taxes they pay, but this revenue is incomparable to direct fiscal oil revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s hardships increased as the West, notably the United States, launched a sanctions campaign targeting specific oil tankers transporting Russian oil outside the price-cap mechanism. Fear of U.S. secondary sanctions has prevented buyers from India or China from servicing black-listed vessels. In turn, Russia has shopped for more tankers, but the procurement and bureaucratic concealment of each additional tanker has become more expensive. This dents oil companies’ revenues and threatens the overall fiscal revenue from oil. However, these measures against the tankers came into force in 2024, which was too late to have a material effect on Russia’s state finances during its military transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With oil revenue under control and stopgaps on draining the NWF removed, Russia started to spend. It suspended the “fiscal rule,” abandoning a self-imposed spending limit and allowing almost all of its oil revenue to be spent rather than keeping part of it in the NWF. It has also allowed itself a wider fund usage, particularly in terms of plugging the fiscal deficit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin has tightened its grip on the economy by distributing the newly available fiscal money on state (primarily military) procurement and subsidized loans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The lack of capital flight and the government’s unprecedented fiscal stimulus, designed to turbocharge the country’s wartime production, resulted in the unexpected growth of the Russian economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past years, such a surge in spending would have resulted in a rise in capital outflow through higher imports, rubles conversion, and foreign asset purchases. This time, the Western sanctions on exports to Russia and on Russian investment, the Russians’ fear of unpredictable asset freezes in the West, and overscrupulous compliance practices of Western banks, on the one hand, and the decline in imports due to the sanctions and Russia’s capital control measures on the other, kept the money at home. Even if Russians want to move their funds to countries that do not participate, or only partially participate within the Western sanctions regime—such as Turkey, Armenia, or the United Arab Emirates—they still face difficulties. While, of course, leakage occurs, its scale remains limited, and by no means constitutes a panicked, systemic capital flight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lack of capital flight and the government’s unprecedented fiscal stimulus, designed to turbocharge the country’s wartime production, resulted in the unexpected growth of the Russian economy. According to the International Monetary Fund, in real GDP terms the Russian economy suffered a modest 1.2 percent decline in 2022, with 3.6 percent growth in 2023. The Russian government announced further growth of 4.1 percent in 2024. Russia has also seen an unprecedented boom in real wages and internal investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;military-keynesianism&quot;&gt;Military Keynesianism&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government spending has been transferred to the general public and businesses via state contracts, budget transfers, and social handouts. Salaries started to grow steadily in 2023 after a slump in 2022, and a little more than a year into the war, they registered double-digit inflation-adjusted growth. In 2024, salaries went up 17.8 percent in nominal terms and 8.7 percent in real terms compared to 2023. Despite the high borrowing rates and a steep rise in government-regulated tariffs, disposable incomes shot up 6.1 percent in 2023 and 7.3 percent in 2024, setting growth records not seen in almost two decades. This unprecedented rise in incomes started to slow down in the second half of 2024, but it remains well above Russia’s historic average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fiscal-fueled rise in living standards is expected to continue, albeit more slowly, in the coming years. In its budget projections, the government expects real salaries to rise 7 percent in 2025, 5.7 percent in 2026, and 4.1 percent in 2027—a far cry from the peaks in 2024, but still twice as high as they were in the decade before the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The growth in salaries and war-fueled demand resulted in growing corporate and private borrowing despite prohibitively high rates. Corporate borrowing has experienced significant growth since 2022. Developers were borrowing to fund housing construction projects, supported by state-subsidized mortgages, while transport, military production, and IT firms led the way thanks to government-subsidized loans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new kind of borrower now plays a prominent role on the Russian credit market. Given high rates, individuals with enough cash on hand are incentivized to place their funds into interest-bearing accounts, while using access to preferential loans—either through corporate channels or benefits from participation in the war effort—to cover expenditures. In the first quarter of 2024, lending to the population doubled, with a slight decrease only coming at the end of the year with the winding down of a national subsidized mortgage program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A rise in incomes and lending fueled a consumer boom. This, together with military procurement and investments, resulted in higher economic growth rates, which generated more taxes for the state coffers. However, one may call this economic growth a growth of the wrong kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the years before the war, the Russian government tried but failed to convince businesses to stop stockpiling reserves that they used to fund large dividends. Businesses, however, complained that the investment climate was not ideal, tax policy lacked predictability, and the state was too overbearing. Now, everything has changed. Western sanctions and Russian efforts have made moving large amounts of capital outside the country next to impossible. On the other hand, there is a growing demand for capital amid limited production capacities. This has resulted in an investment boom not seen in years. Capital investment (expenditure on new construction, higher-tech equipment for enterprises, purchase of new kit, etc.) stood at 9.8 percent year-on-year in 2023, which exceeded inflation, and 7.4 percent in 2024, a quarter below the inflation rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A rise in incomes and lending has fueled a consumer boom. This, together with military procurement and investments, has resulted in higher economic growth rates, which has generated more taxes for the state coffers. However, one may call this economic growth a growth of the wrong kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major factor behind the GDP growth is consumption, fueled by rising salaries. The Kremlin boasts record-low unemployment levels, but Russia is facing the most severe workforce crisis in its post-Soviet history. Prior to the war, Russia already had a declining number of workers due to natural demographic causes. The Labor Ministry predicts that, by 2030, Russia will be lacking 2.4 million workers. Mass emigration in 2022 has also deprived the labor market of about three-quarters of a million Russian and foreign workers, mainly in IT, finance, and management. Secondly, the Russian army is recruiting tens of thousands of working-age men per month. While the Kremlin remains reluctant to impose another round of mobilization, the army has to compete with all other employers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s natural population decline was traditionally balanced by migrant labor. However, migration in 2023 was at its lowest level since pandemic-hit 2020. The number of migrants shot up almost fourfold in 2024, reaching the highest level seen in 25 years. However, there has not been a rise in the number of actual migrant workers, but instead a much stricter electronic registration system was introduced in 2024, enabling more accurate data. Following the March terrorist attack on Moscow’s Crocus City Hall, Russia imposed tighter checks on migrants entering the country, and there was aggressive anti-migrant rhetoric from officials. Given Russia’s long-term demographic challenges, combined with battlefield casualties and war-induced emigration, Russia’s demographic crisis only appears set to worsen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is a rising demand for workers in the military industry. Defense sector companies have hiked salaries to attract workers, and other companies have been compelled to follow suit. This fuels inflation, leading the Central Bank of Russia to raise interest rates in response. Those who enjoy state-subsidized borrowing rates are not impacted; for the rest, the future looks grim. This results in dislocated growth—production of everything defense-related is rising, while the rest of the economy is nearly stagnating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Russia has survived the first years of the economic war with the West by mortgaging its future and stockpiling its financial resources in advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Higher productivity could have partly resolved the workforce problem. However, that would have required a technological breakthrough, which has been thwarted by the continued and tightening restrictions on technological exports to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further fiscal spending would contribute more to inflation than growth, slowing down the latter to below the pre-war average and aggravating the lack of synchronicity between monetary and fiscal policy inside the Russian economy today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;part-ii-the-lessons-russia-learned-from-the-2014-sanctions-regime&quot;&gt;Part II: The Lessons Russia Learned from the 2014 Sanctions Regime&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin started building its “Fortress Russia” foundations just after the global financial crisis of 2008. Back then, the Kremlin and Russia’s main industrialists reached an unwritten compact by which the former agreed to financially back the crisis-stricken industries in exchange for the latter’s refusal to fire workers. While political factors were the primary drivers of this interdependency, it has reduced Russian dependence on Western capital and tied corporations closely to the Kremlin, resembling a form of quasi-nationalization. This came in handy 15 years later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the role of international capital remained significant in Russia. Most large companies had international investors and lenders, and foreigners owned about a quarter of the country’s domestic debt at the time of the full-scale invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the launch of the full-scale invasion, one of the main points of discussion in the United States regarding sanctions was a restriction on investing in Russian debt, such as through purchasing Russian sovereign or corporate bonds domestically and on international debt markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The earlier sanctions only barely touched the public debt—before the full-scale war, international companies could not buy the Russian government’s domestic and foreign debt on the primary market (i.e., directly from the issuer), although nothing prevented them from doing so through an intermediary. Over time, however, corporate Russia came to gradually reduce its reliance on foreign capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On several occasions, the U.S. Congress unsuccessfully considered a complete ban on holding, trading, and investing in Russian debt. The Russian finance ministry considered an eventual ban on buying new debt highly probable, but a blanket ban on all debt less so. Nevertheless, the crawling rate of sanctions before the onset of the full-scale invasion contributed to lower capital outflow, and the ministry saw enough cash in the country to borrow domestically for its conservative fiscal needs if the worst came to pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike in the 1990s, Russia’s need for foreign capital over the last quarter century was limited thanks to its status as a surplus country. But international investors were still drawn to the Russian market by prudent monetary and fiscal policies in line with the “Washington consensus,” which outweighed the potential political risks. Foreign investors continued to invest in Russia despite the state’s growing authoritarianism, drawn by what they perceived to be a stable and balanced economic climate. Between 2014 and 2022, roughly one quarter to one third of all Russian domestic debt, both corporate and sovereign, was owned by foreign investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another dependence Russia has managed to reduce is that of imported food. As food constitutes the lion’s share of the Russian consumer basket, any sharp rise in the exchange rate caused by an oil price slump translates into high consumer price inflation. Russian protectionism of its agricultural sector in response to the West’s 2014 sanctions aided in this effort to insulate Russian consumers from a Western food cutoff. By closing the market for almost all Western foods and subsidizing local production, the government reduced the share of imported food in retail by half—down to 18 percent—in 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia also developed a national payment system and decreased the dollar share in its sovereign reserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, following the onset of the 2014 sanctions, Russia continued to expand the role of the state in the economy and maintained an increasing appetite for dirigisme, combined with conservative fiscal policy, an open capital account, and a fully convertible ruble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The earlier batch of sanctions was imposed by the United States and its allies in 2014 in response to Russia’s annexation of Crimea. Limited in scale, the sanctions were primarily intended as a warning of more brutal consequences if Moscow did not change its policy. This was also the purpose of the public warnings the United States sent to Russia before the full-scale invasion in 2022. Another purpose of the threat of personal sanctions was to pull the oligarchs and top managers away from the Kremlin, which on the whole has failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The eight years of sanctions between the annexation of Crimea and the full-scale invasion reduced the inflow of Western money into the country; the sanctions also created financing problems for some banks and oil companies. However, similar to weak antibiotics, which over time allow for the growth of more resilient bacteria, the limited sanctions aided Russia in preparing for the larger confrontation of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the meekness of the 2014–2021 sanctions policy and the Kremlin’s belief that the West would not risk its economic well-being created a lackadaisical attitude toward economic warfare at the top echelons of much of the Russian political class. However, as Russian tanks started rolling into Ukraine and the West dramatically expanded its suite of sanctions, the Russian business and political elite had no choice but to rally around Putin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s economic strategy had been based on keeping the economy’s commanding heights under the Kremlin’s control while keeping the rest of the economy relatively open for foreigners. This created a potent lobbying force against any bold moves against Russian assets abroad, which could have resulted in reciprocal seizure of the foreign assets by the Kremlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the years leading up to the full-scale invasion, the Kremlin remained skeptical about potential Western moves against its commodities exports if geopolitical tensions increased. Botched U.S. sanctions in 2018 against Russian aluminum giant Rusal, which caused a dislocation on the global market and were revoked, must have strengthened this belief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia saw its energy export as a win-win game vis-à-vis potential sanctions. The United States had no appetite for removing about 10 percent of oil from the global market, which would have caused a spike in domestic gasoline prices. On the other hand, any attack on pipeline gas exports would have been met with opposition from the European Union. Consequently, Russia didn’t prepare its logistics, taxation, and financial infrastructure for the loss of the Western market and for the “pivot to the East.” Almost three years into the war, Russia has not replaced European gas market demand with either expanded liquified natural gas (LNG) shipments or increased gas exports to China. Today, Russia’s state-owned gas giant, Gazprom, once one of the world’s most profitable corporations, is a loss-making company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equally, conversations with high-ranking figures within the Russian state have confirmed that the Kremlin did not believe in a joint Western move to attack its sovereign assets and banking system. More than half of Russia’s reserves had been parked in Western countries, demonstrating the Kremlin’s belief that even if it moved on Kyiv, its back-up financial firepower would not actually be a target of Western governments. On this front, however, the Kremlin grossly miscalculated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;part-iii-putin-thought-his-full-scale-invasion-was-worth-the-risks&quot;&gt;Part III: Putin Thought His Full-Scale Invasion Was Worth the Risks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, given the important but limited impacts of the post-2014 sanctions on the Russian economy writ large, it is not surprising that Putin concluded that he could launch his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 with the possibility of not actually facing serious economic consequences. The West’s previous measures had been narrow in scope, and were often haphazard and inconsistent in their implementation. Fundamentally, trade between Russia and Europe remained robust, and the Kremlin’s continuing cultivation of Western “fellow-travelers,” not only at the edges of the European political spectrum but amongst some of its foremost industrial and business leaders, meant that Russia maintained an outspoken cohort of supporters who could be relied upon to advocate against a cutting of economic ties with Moscow from within the European Union’s own market and capitals, particularly when it came to Russia’s cheap energy supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin had reason to feel confident that any large-scale drive into Ukraine, coupled with a well-timed wave of concurrent disinformation, could prevent Western leaders from taking the harshest steps against Moscow. Additionally, if the reported intelligence Putin was receiving from his spymasters was correct and the Ukrainian state would collapse in just a few days following a serious Russian effort at regime change, then the Kremlin could present the West with a fait accompli in Ukraine, further disincentivizing the leveling of sanctions as a means of reversing Russia’s advances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Putin appears to have concluded that the risk of sanctions and economic fallout, even if they were to be as devastating as the technocrats feared, were worth the geopolitical gains that victory in Ukraine would provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, reporting has made clear that Putin was consistently warned by some of his closest economic advisors that the war, and the ensuing sanctions and economic fallout that would follow, would be devastating for the Russian economy. A number of the regime’s prominent technocrats, central bankers, and more liberally inclined magnates apparently cautioned against the 2022 invasion, even personally briefing the Russian president on their dire concerns in the weeks running up to the full-scale invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it would appear that unlike Putin and his closest associates, the technocratic wing of the regime found the threat of a more widespread application of sanctions promised by the Western leadership to be credible, and concluded that this time around, the Western coalition would not allow Moscow to get away with its land grab as easily as it had in 2014 (when the earlier round of Russia sanctions did not seriously kick off until July 2014, following the downing of the MH17 passenger jet over eastern Ukraine). Their warnings to Putin—the only decisionmaker whose opinion mattered—fell on deaf ears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin appears to have concluded that the risk of sanctions and economic fallout, even if they were to be as devastating as the technocrats feared, were worth the geopolitical gains that victory in Ukraine would provide. Like beauty, state interests are in the eye of the beholder. Leaders who weigh the varying definitions of successful statecraft differently will choose different paths for their polities to pursue. Whereas the technocrats and systemic liberals within the Russian regime may have seen the pathway to greatness through Russia’s acceptance and inclusion within the Western-led international community, participation in the international financial system, and a security policy predicated on diplomatic engagement, Putin may have concluded that the state’s interests were best pursued through decisive military power and trade with fellow nations who bristled at the perceived constraints of the Western-dominated international system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who believed the threat of massive economic sanctions alone could deter Putin’s invasion did not properly understand how the Russian leader perceived his state’s interests, underestimated the importance of ideology in his decisionmaking, and overestimated the analytical competence of the Russian intelligence agencies informing the president on the state of affairs inside Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historian Stephen Kotkin has argued that the greatest surprise discovered within the Soviet archives when they were opened after the Soviet Union’s collapse was that the early Soviet leaders spoke in private in the exact same ways they spoke in public—that is, their ideological convictions were sincere, and impacted the way they viewed the world. Relatedly, historian James Harris persuasively argued that throughout much of his time in power, Stalin—the cloistered dictator—formed his perception of global affairs and foreign relations in large part through the constant stream of intelligence reports he received. The agents and analysts writing these reports and responding to the political incentives within the Soviet system often fed their higher-ups the information they wanted to hear, which in turn only reinforced preexisting formulations and ideological predispositions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While any direct comparisons between Putin and his predecessors in the Kremlin risk analytical imprecision, it would appear that in his belief that war in Ukraine would be met with quick victory, Putin fell into the same trap of ideologically inflected miscalculation reinforced by bad intelligence that had previously bedeviled Stalin. While some of the information Putin was receiving—for example, that his troops in Ukraine would be greeted across the east and south of the country as liberators—was clearly false, that does not mean it did not sincerely impact his cost-benefit analysis of an invasion, or his understanding of Russian state interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the limited deterrent effect of the 2014 sanctions, the faulty intelligence fed to Putin, and the clouding effect of his regime’s ideology upon his own decisionmaking process, Putin could have been influenced by an additional factor—the idea that the costs of Russia’s isolation after a full-scale invasion would be outweighed by the domestic political benefits the regime stood to inherit from an ensuing rally-around-the-flag effect, an increased opportunity to justify further crackdowns on domestic dissent, and the cultivation of economic interest groups directly profiting from the war’s prosecution. While this final claim is purely speculative, its arguments have been borne out by ongoing domestic developments in Russia, particularly within the economic sphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;part-iv-the-power-of-the-purse-or-how-the-kremlin-has-so-far-managed-to-strengthen-its-wartime-domestic-position&quot;&gt;Part IV: The Power of the Purse, or How the Kremlin Has So Far Managed to Strengthen Its Wartime Domestic Position&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be a gross understatement to say that the Russian economy of today faces long-term challenges. With its access to key technologies and components either restricted or constrained by inflated prices connected to the costs of importing under sanctions, Russian companies in many cases lack the materials needed to build the competitive industries of the future. Additionally, with the Russian economy essentially cut off from the U.S.-dominated international financial system, Russia’s capacity to raise capital on international markets remains curtailed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, at least in the short to medium term, in many ways the Russian economy has weathered the storm dramatically better than expected. Despite predictions that the economy could collapse when faced with the onslaught of sanctions, it has not only endured, but adapted to the challenge. Growth rates remain impressive, and while inflation remains a serious concern, the technocrats running the Russian central bank and ministry of finance have remained determined enough in their efforts to keep the problem controllable, at least for now. Continued Russian profits from hydrocarbon exports allowed the Russian state to postpone and limit the kinds of spending trade-offs the sanctions regime was designed to cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the Kremlin has effectively used the context of economic war to write a new domestic social contract for Russia’s political economy—one that economically strengthens the regime’s internal allies and weakens its opponents. In sum, the Kremlin has used the unique wartime economic climate to enrich existing loyalists and build a coalition within society that directly benefits from the war’s different revenue streams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the lower end of the economic spectrum, the Kremlin has made enlistment economically attractive through large signing bonuses and competitive salaries, along with survivors’ benefits paid to the families of soldiers killed in battle. As money pours into the country’s industrial base, domestic defense companies are able to offer high salaries, particularly in Russia’s depressed regions, which draws workers into the state’s military procurement effort. Due to Russia’s aforementioned labor shortages, workers find themselves in a uniquely advantageous position, leading to the real wage growth described above. Russia’s working classes are now an interest group directly benefiting from the war’s continuation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the Kremlin has effectively used the context of economic war to write a new domestic social contract for Russia’s political economy—one that economically strengthens the regime’s internal allies and weakens its opponents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A parallel process of enrichment has played out within the upper echelons of Russian society. First, the turbocharging of investment into defense and national security has provided elements of the Russian elite with lucrative defense opportunities as defense contractors. Additionally, wealthy Russians who support the state’s war effort have found themselves in pole position to receive the spoils of Western asset seizures. As part of its response to Western sanctions, in particular the seizure of Russian state and private assets by governments backing Ukraine, the Russian government has effectively frozen Western assets stranded in Russia, as well as engineered forced sales at massive discount to well-connected Russians willing to toe the party line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like with Russia’s lower classes, the Kremlin has used the dramatic changes forced on the Russian economy by the war and sanctions to strengthen its power base within the Russian elite—by rewarding loyalty and seizing assets from anti-war business leaders driven from the country by their refusal to kowtow politically. One prominent example is the case of Oleg Tinkov, former owner of Tinkoff Bank, who claims he only received 3 percent of the market value of his bank shares after he was forced to sell off his assets after speaking out against the full-scale invasion. With sanctions limiting the opportunities for Russian wealth to move abroad, the Kremlin has functionally achieved a long-held goal dating back to the 1990s—the reshoring of Russian oligarchic wealth. Combined with an effective purge of Russian society’s system-liberals, the war has provided the Putin regime with the opportunity to build a new class of stakeholders invested in the system’s durability and success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the start of the war, Russia has witnessed the most significant redistribution of property since the massive privatization of the 1990s. While many of the assets involved belonged to foreign companies leaving Russia, this redistribution was not limited to those assets alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Kyiv School of Economics and Yale’s Chief Executive Leadership Institute, more than 1,000 transnational companies, or about two-thirds of all the foreign companies monitored by these researchers, either left Russia or suspended operations following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the invasion of Ukraine, Russia installed capital controls for foreigners to keep capital from leaving the country. In April 2023, Putin signed a decree that enabled the state to take over the management of any asset owned by a company from an “unfriendly” nation. Later, the government installed draconian conditions to prevent foreigners from departing the Russian market. Foreign companies that want to sell their assets must receive permission from the Kremlin and then must sell at a 60 percent discount before paying a 35 percent tax, leaving them with 5 percent of the market price after the latest installment of the exit law. Additionally, others have left due to pressure from shareholders and politicians at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fire sale of Western assets left behind inside Russia has allowed Russian businessmen with the right political connections to seize the moment and make a major profit. For instance, The Bell, an independent Russian news outlet, found 41 different businessmen benefiting from the Western asset bonanza who had each acquired assets with a pre-war valuation of at least $1 billion. In 2021, the combined revenues of the previously Western-owned companies came in at $32 billion. Many of the prominent figures cashing in on this asset reshuffle are not the most prominent oligarchs, but rather middle-tier operators who make up a new pillar of support for the regime and its aggressive foreign policy. These include partners Alexander Varshavsky and Kamo Avagumyan, who have taken advantage of the exodus of Western firms from Russia to purchase the major Russian car plants previously owned by both Volkswagen and Hyundai. Describing the opportunity at hand in 2022, Russian oligarch Vladimir Potanin emphasized, “Foreign investors have left us so much that you just have to pick it up.” Potanin directly benefited from the French bank Societe Generale’s exit from the Russian market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, and more importantly, the scramble for assets didn’t stop at foreign-owned property. The extreme political conditions of wartime have allowed the state to break the taboo of not radically reconsidering the results of the 1990s privatization, except in cases of perceived political disobedience, such as that of Mikhail Khodorkovsky’s energy firm, Yukos. In September 2023, the state seized methane producer Metafrax Chemicals after a Russian court ruled that the 1992 privatization of the firm was actually illegal. At the same time, in the occupied territories of Ukraine, the Russian administration started to nationalize the property of those who had left. In 2024, the Duma was considering seizing the property of disloyal émigrés. In terms of redistributing private assets inside Russia, the war opened up Pandora’s box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to research by a Russian law firm, NSP, at least 85 companies have been nationalized by the courts since 2022. In many cases, it took the courts just a day to decide in favor of nationalization. Not a single such decision has been overturned. The Kremlin is not redistributing these assets to buy loyalty, given that the beneficiaries are chosen for their record of loyalty to the regime. Rather, the Russian leadership wants to concentrate property in the hands of proven loyalists to send a warning to Russian business figures who might consider breaking ranks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, all of these domestic economic changes have institutionalized an outright rejection of the path to Westernization offered by a development model rooted in the new consensus that emerged in Russia following the collapse of the Soviet Union. This rejection of economic collaboration with the West is coupled with a symmetrical economic pivot to the East—to trade with China, often denominated in renminbi—proving a critical lifeline to Russia’s war effort, and broader macroeconomy. Today, we see the formulation of an alternative political economy of Putinism that empowers certain sections of society, and certain segments of the ruling elite, over others, and generates a new narrative of legitimacy for the Putin regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-recommendations&quot;&gt;Policy Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter the ultimate conclusion of the Trump administration’s ongoing efforts to negotiate a quick settlement to the end of the conflict in Ukraine, the topic of sanctions relief will likely continue to be brought up by the Russian side as a precondition for any sort of peace deal. Heading into negotiations on potential sanctions relief, the Trump team will need to be strategic in its approach. Sanctions still play a critical role in stunting Russia’s economic power, and therefore should not be removed without tangible concessions from the Russian side. No matter the ceasefire agreement signed between Ukraine and Russia, the Putin regime’s words and actions make clear that it remains committed to long-term, strategic, and direct confrontation not just with Ukraine, but also the United States and its Western allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Sanctions still play a critical role in stunting Russia’s economic power, and therefore should not be removed without tangible concessions from the Russian side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump-backed negotiators should zoom out, head to the drawing board, and weigh each element of the current sanctions strategy without prejudice before making any concessions to Moscow. Individual sanctions policies that have proven less impactful could be traded, but sanctions that directly impede Russian efforts to develop and expand its war machine, along with sanctions that apply pressure to Russia’s current account, the country’s main economic weakness at this point in time, should not be relaxed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following are specific policy recommendations for shaping a targeted and effective sanctions policy toward Russia within the current context of ongoing negotiations to end the war in Ukraine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sanctions and export controls on key technologies, components, and dual-use goods should remain in place. These are the items that Russia desperately needs to reconstitute its military in the wake of any sort of ceasefire. Given the direct danger that reconstitution will pose to both Ukraine and its European allies, any weakening of these sanctions must be a nonstarter. As recent history has shown, these banned goods will still find their way into Russia, but at a much higher cost, extending pressure on the Russian economy and current account.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any sanctions removed from the Central Bank of Russia must be regularly reviewed, perhaps every six months, with the threat of “snap-back” sanctions on the central bank remaining in place. In the event of a Russian violation of the ceasefire with Ukraine, or a parallel thrust to undermine Western security, the return of these sanctions must be immediate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sanctions on certain noncritical industries, like Russia’s civil aviation sector, could be traded over the course of negotiations, but technologies that help Russia make critical industrial investments for the future, like in its nascent LNG industry, should remain in place.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Few Western firms with effective compliance teams should want to make significant investments into the Russian economy while the current leadership remains in power. The risk of geopolitical instability impacting profits, in addition to the threat of outright nationalization, should be a powerful deterrent. Therefore, nominally removing existing penalties on Western firms investing in permitted Russian sectors could be allowed without too much worry of a return to the kinds of robust EU-Russian trade that took place before 2022. While it could have some positive effect on lowering inflation inside the country, the trade in consumer goods will face stiff domestic resistance from those who benefit from the closed market, and also will aid in capital outflow from Russia to the West while not directly benefiting the military-industrial complex.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It seems unlikely that Russia will agree to any sort of settlement that does not remove Western sanctions that are impeding Russian hydrocarbon sales. However, given the critical role these revenues play in the broader Russian macroeconomy, Western negotiators should bargain hard on this front. A full removal of sanctions would be a mistake. But a concession on raising the oil price cap, and removing certain recently sanctioned Russian banks that process these transactions, could be a compromise. It is key that U.S. policymakers keep in place some sort of easily expandable mechanism to limit Russian hydrocarbon revenues in the future, even if its effectiveness will be limited. As recent discussions on returning certain Russian banks to the SWIFT financial messaging system have demonstrated, the European Union will have the potential to limit the removal of certain penalties placed on Russian financial institutions. Brussels should use its influence to ensure that any concessions offered to Russia are met with worthy concessions from Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia’s frozen central bank reserves remain a valuable carrot the West could use to force Russia to fund at least part of Ukraine’s reconstruction. Western negotiators should stick to the European Union’s political declaration that those funds will remain frozen until Ukraine is satisfied with a future damages settlement with Russia. Western negotiators should tie the future of Russia’s frozen central bank reserves to a post-war Ukrainian reconstruction settlement, in addition to the release of Western assets frozen and nationalized within Russia. The European Union is unlikely to seize the funds outright given concerns for the potential repercussions, but there remain persuasive and creative mechanisms to leverage the assets’ total value as a means to financially support Ukraine’s defense and reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Western policymakers should work to increase the labor strain on the Russian economy. This could be done by easing the process of professional emigration from Russia—with a focus on engineers, technical experts, and postgraduate students—while removing unusual restrictions against Russians already settled in the West. While this does raise the risk of hostile Russian actors infiltrating Western societies, all policies require trade-offs. Western officials should try to balance the need to limit the inflow of potential Russian intelligence assets with the desire to heighten the contradiction between Russia’s strained labor supply and Russia’s raging labor demand.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, when it comes to increasing the strain on the Russian labor market, Western policymakers should work with Central Asian governments and financial institutions to limit the flow of migrant workers to Russia by directly attacking the flow of remittances from Russia into Central Asian financial systems. Central Asian laborers could be encouraged to work in other countries that are allies of Ukraine and its coalition partners.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The West’s strategy to economically contain a revanchist Russia should try to prevent Russia from waging future wars by kneecapping Russia’s efforts to restock its financial war chest and reconstitute its military forces. If a return to hostilities were to break out after a previously agreed-upon ceasefire and sanctions relief, the West should learn from the limitations of its expanded sanctions regime launched in 2022, and instead launch a rapid, full-on attack on Moscow’s ability to process financial transactions associated with commodity exports, with a focus on speed and severity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the above scenario, coordinated overnight sanctions on the Russian energy and banking sectors could trigger massive capital flight out of the Russian economy. Rather than stopping that money from flowing out of the country, Western financial institutions should keep avenues open to accept it. Western governments should encourage financial institutions to accept these funds into their coffers and avoid overcompliance that could hamper this process. The Central Bank of Russia will most likely have to respond with rapid capital controls, stemming the flight—but then they will have to bear the political cost of doing so domestically, such as promoting black market activity, the stockpiling of cash, and pressure from business elites. This situation would differ from that of 2022, where Western banks’ refusals to receive Russian outflows allowed the central bank to relatively quickly and quietly remove most of the limited capital controls they had put in place at the outset of the war by the summer. Sanctions on Russian export sectors must be maximalist, coordinated, and launched simultaneously. This risks a spike in the global price of oil, but any gradualist approach would allow Russia to adapt as it has from 2022 to 2025. For maximum effectiveness, energy sanctions should be paired with attacks on other key components of Russia’s suite of key export products—minerals, metals, agricultural goods, and fertilizers, many of which face the risk of long-term price declines on the international market as the commodity price boom of the 2020s fades and market conditions begin to look more like the period of commodity price drops of the 2010s. Furthermore, with the ongoing threat of extended trade wars putting downward pressure on the price of oil, Russia’s revenues from hydrocarbon sales may be entering a period of acute stress.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Western policymakers would need to develop contingency plans to avoid a sharp rise in food prices in the Global South and for key mineral inputs for European industries. Given the Russian economy’s dependence on importing expensive sanctioned goods, any direct attack on Russia’s hard currency-earning exports combined with massive capital flight, if severe enough, could lead to a balance-of-payments crisis in the following months. This kind of acute financial breakdown, more so than the more slow-gathering burst of a credit bubble, would more likely force Russia to back down from whatever aggressive maneuver had triggered the snap back of the sanctions regime in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of any smart sanctions strategy toward Russia should not be to cause economic disruption as an end in itself. Rather, the goal should be to create economic problems so severe that they generate enough social tension to force the Kremlin to back down or face serious domestic unrest. It should be noted, however, that without proper sanctions buy-in from key countries such as China, India, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates, this kind of scenario will remain difficult to bring to fruition.&lt;/p&gt;

So far, there has been no indication in the public domain to suggest that any such material or expertise transfers from Russia to Iran have actually taken place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, the expanding Russia-Iran relationship poses a nuclear proliferation threat of a different kind: the tacit acceptance of highly concerning Iranian nuclear activity. This not only reduces the effectiveness of ongoing efforts to address the threat of a nuclear Iran but undermines non-proliferation norms more broadly, signalling to other potential proliferators that they can expect political cover from powerful states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russia-and-nuclear-diplomacy&quot;&gt;Russia and nuclear diplomacy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a permanent member (P5) of the UN Security Council (UNSC) and a nuclear weapons state under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), Russia is an influential actor when it comes to the state of the global non-proliferation regime. Historically, Russia’s record on non-proliferation matters has been far from clean. However, Moscow has traditionally been broadly constructive on efforts to address particular proliferation challenges – including North Korea and Iran. Yet, as others have argued elsewhere, since 2022, Russian behaviour has become markedly counterproductive – and outright obstructive – on global non-proliferation and counter-proliferation challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been particularly apparent on the question of the Iranian nuclear programme. Russia was broadly seen as a constructive actor in diplomatic efforts to reach the 2015 Iran nuclear deal (formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action – JCPOA). Subsequently, during negotiations to return all parties to compliance with the agreement (following US withdrawal and Iranian violations) the Russian delegation was, by all accounts, instrumental in bridging gaps between Iran, the US and Europe. In March 2022, that appeared to have changed overnight, as the Russian negotiating team tabled demands that Russian trade with Iran be exempt from EU and US sanctions under any revived nuclear deal – demands which (among other challenges) derailed the negotiations. This proved to be the start of broader Russia counterproductive behaviour on the Iran nuclear question – arguably today’s most acute nuclear proliferation threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expanding Russo-Iranian relationship is helping undermine an already weakening international non-proliferation regime. While there is currently no indication that Russia is actively supporting any weapons-relevant activity in Iran, it is helping to degrade non-proliferation norms and tools at the fringes with consequences for non-proliferation efforts as they relate to the Iran nuclear programme and more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications-for-the-effectiveness-of-sanctions&quot;&gt;Implications for the effectiveness of sanctions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary mechanism for pressuring Iran on the nuclear file has been the expansive patchwork of sanctions placed on the Iranian economy by the UNSC, the US, the UK, the EU and a number of other countries. Sanctions have both material and normative effects. They restrict Iran’s ability to raise funds and procure materials in support of its proliferation activity, while also designating Iran as an actor of proliferation concern. UNSC sanctions – because of their multilateral nature and their provenance from an organisation that (at least in theory) is meant to represent the interest of the international community – have particular normative value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technically, most economic activities with Iran are permitted under current UNSC sanctions. However, the UNSC’s continued engagement on the Iran nuclear file marks the country as a persistent threat to international security and the non-proliferation regime. Russia’s willingness to engage with Iran regardless, including in trade in military and nuclear technology, severely undermines the still-valuable normative impact these sanctions are meant to have. Outside whatever practical benefit the trade relationship may offer (the volume of economic trade between the two countries remains relatively low), it signals a tacit approval by a P5 UNSC member, a party to the JCPOA and an NPT nuclear weapons state of Iran’s highly concerning nuclear activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Moscow’s growing relationship with Tehran, namely, Russian reliance on Iranian drones in Ukraine has made it highly unlikely that the UNSC will adopt any new sanctions on Iran for its proliferation behaviour to strengthen the material impact on the Iranian economy. The option of reimposing historical UNSC sanctions on Iran, which had been suspended after the conclusion of the JCPOA, is still available; however, the so-called “snap-back” provision expires in October of this year. The Chinese “Five-Point Proposition on the Iranian Nuclear Issue”, released by Beijing following a March meeting between Russian, Chinese and Iranian senior officials to discuss the Iran nuclear issue confirmed as much. The proposition included an explicit criticism of the “use of force and illegal sanctions” and warned against “hasty intervention by the UNSC”. This greatly reduces the leverage of those remaining parties to the JCPOA, namely, the E3 (Germany, France and the UK) intent on finding a diplomatic resolution to the threat posed by Iran’s nuclear programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;diplomatic-cover&quot;&gt;Diplomatic cover&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to sanctions, the US and Europe have sought to increase diplomatic pressure on Iran through the introduction of resolutions at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) calling out Iran for its concerning nuclear activities and failures to cooperate with the IAEA in addressing outstanding questions over its nuclear programme. Russia – as well as China – have vetoed all four of the censure resolutions brought forward against Iran at the IAEA since 2022. The proposition issued following the March meeting in Beijing did call on Iran to honour its commitments not to develop nuclear weapons. However, it appears to have achieved no practical progress towards addressing specific concerns on the programme, including outstanding IAEA questions on past Iranian activity, or paving a path for further productive diplomacy. It did, however, offer Tehran a photo-op with Russian and Chinese senior representatives, and an opportunity for joint criticism of Western efforts to apply further pressure on Iran for its concerning nuclear behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The potential impact of diplomatic ostracisation and recrimination of Iran should not be underestimated. The country does not aspire to becoming a pariah state on par with North Korea but rather sees itself as a regional leader in the Middle East and an active economic and diplomatic actor on the global stage. Threatening to maintain and exacerbate, if needed, Iran’s economic and political isolation is therefore an important lever for convincing Iran to address international concerns over its nuclear programme. Russian and Chinese unwillingness to call out Iran for its nuclear activities and their willingness to continue economic and diplomatic engagement with Iran undermines these efforts. Not only that, it also sends a dangerous message to other would-be proliferators and those who may be willing to assist them that they can behave similarly and expect to be protected by powerful states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russian-civil-nuclear-activities-in-iran&quot;&gt;Russian civil nuclear activities in Iran&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A noteworthy aspect of the Russo-Iranian relationship is the countries’ cooperation in the civil nuclear sector. Russia has been involved in the construction of Iran’s Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) since the 1990s. Russia’s state nuclear enterprise Rosatom is currently constructing additional reactor units at Bushehr. The recent Russia-Iran Strategic Cooperation Treaty includes commitments for cooperation in the field of civil nuclear energy and Iran has expressed an interest in building more power plants with Russian support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cooperation with Iran on the construction of light water reactors (of the kind being built at Bushehr) is not prohibited under the JCPOA or other nonproliferation regimes. Iran, like any other party to the NPT, is of course permitted to pursue peaceful applications of nuclear energy under the NPT. However, Russia’s nuclear cooperation with Iran under the current circumstances raises some concerns. Iran is a country of serious proliferation concern – one which has significantly reduced IAEA access to its programme and where the debate over the need to develop nuclear weapons is very active. Russian construction of light water reactors in the country is unlikely to offer Iran expertise or materials that it does not already possess. However, such engagement allows for the maintenance of active working relationships between the Russian and Iranian nuclear sectors and experts, which could theoretically be repurposed for nuclear transfers of a less benign sort. It also turns a blind eye and helps normalise what is in fact extremely irresponsible and worrying Iranian nuclear activities and rhetoric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;raising-the-bar-and-holding-to-account&quot;&gt;Raising the bar and holding to account&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia can, and in fact should, play a role in the resolution of the Iranian nuclear question. As a party to the JCPOA, a P5 member of the UNSC and a nuclear weapons state under the NPT, Moscow has a responsibility to address the serious threat posed by Iran’s nuclear programme. In fact, because of its relationships with Iran, Moscow is uniquely positioned to exert pressure. If it chose to, Russia could, for instance, withhold its civil nuclear activities in Iran until Tehran agreed to reapply the Additional Protocol and fully cooperate with the IAEA. However, Moscow has thus far chosen not to bring this leverage to bear. Recent Russian and Chinese meetings with Iranian officials may be an effort to make some progress on the issue. However, they have yet to demonstrate any practical outcomes. There is also the risk that whatever is agreed between the three states falls well short of meaningfully and sustainably addressing international concerns over the Iranian nuclear programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US and Europe will ultimately need to be involved in the resolution of the Iranian nuclear issue, considering the threat the programme poses to their security interests and the importance of their engagement in providing Iran with the economic benefits it is after. Upcoming US-Iran talks in Oman – even if indirect – are a positive development and will help ensure that more than just Russian and Chinese interests are represented in any diplomatic efforts to address concerns over Iran’s nuclear programme. The options available to the US and Europe to incite Iranian cooperation are, however, limited. Those that remain must be leveraged for all their practical and, as importantly, normative value. As the author has argued elsewhere, reimposition of suspended UNSC sanctions on Iran before their expiry can and should be pursued if necessary, despite likely limited economic effects. Should considerable progress be made in any US-Iran negotiations between now and the expiry of the “snap-back” provision, the E3 may consider foregoing reimposition of sanctions; however, Iran must first take meaningful and sustainable steps to address outstanding concerns and cannot be allowed to simply wait out the clock until October. Should UNSC sanctions be “snapped back”, the US, Europe and other states concerned by Iranian nuclear activity will have to help support and enforce their implementation. This may include intelligence-sharing or further capacity-building measures with countries that may lack the necessary expertise or resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US and Europe should also actively call out not only Iran for its irresponsible nuclear behaviour, but also those who tacitly endorse it or turn a blind eye, including Russia and China. Statements (joint or unilateral) from other states – at fora like the NPT Preparatory Committee or the IAEA General Conference – may also be helpful in placing pressure on Russia and China, as nuclear weapons states, to play a constructive role in calling out and holding to account concerning Iranian nuclear activity. Not engaging in the direct transfer of nuclear weapons technology to a state of serious proliferation concern should not be the bar to which nuclear states are held when it comes to upholding their non-proliferation commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent media kerfuffle provided a stark reminder; the gap between Egypt and Israel has become wider, the relationship between Tel Aviv and Cairo is probably the worst it has been since the Camp David Accords were signed in 1978, and the propensity for further destabilisation remains acute. The consequences for and impact upon regional security should not be underestimated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 21 March, the Lebanese newspaper al-Akhbar, known for its proximity to the pro-Iranian militant group Hezbollah, published a report that indicated that Cairo had changed its position on accepting the “relocation” of a quarter of Gaza’s population, which would “temporarily” move to Egypt’s Sinai. Almost immediately, the report went viral in the Israeli press; the Times of Israel, the Jerusalem Post, i24 News and others spread the news like wildfire. The fact that it did is quite telling, for two reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first reason is that the transfer from Gaza of its Palestinians to Egypt’s Sinai has long been a current idea among some senior members of the Israeli establishment, as has the linkage between Gaza and Sinai in Israeli security paradigms, in order to avert a Palestinian state in the occupied Palestinian Territories (oPT) of East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the Israeli National Security Council Chief in 2004, Giora Eiland, called for “persuading” Egypt to contribute a 600 square kilometer of land from Sinai in order to move Palestinians there. Tellingly, Eiland described Gaza at that time as a “huge concentration camp”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Egyptian president in 2010, Hosni Mubarak, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had proposed settling Palestinians in Sinai, which Mubarak had rejected. In 2017, Israeli Minister Ayoob Kara promoted the idea of “A Palestinian State in Gaza and Sinai. Instead of Judea and Samaria”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much further back in history, at least as far back as 1956, the idea of providing a Palestinian entity in Sinai, rather than the West Bank and Gaza, was proposed to Egyptian leaders, according to allegations by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. At the same time, nevertheless, Israeli leaders have mostly sought to contain Palestinians in Gaza, rather than expel them en masse. The policy did oscillate, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the likes of then-Prime Minister Levi Eshkol combined incentivising Palestinians in Gaza to leave via a specific programme, set up immediately after the 1967 occupation began, with the deliberate maintenance of difficult economic conditions in Gaza at the same time. However, the policy did not continue in quite the same fashion, particularly when it was clear that Palestinians would not leave Gaza en masse, and that those that did, would not be controlled by the Israelis. As Meron Rapoport, one of Israel’s most noted journalists put it, “Ultimately, Israel’s security establishment reached the conclusion that it was preferable to contain Palestinians in Gaza, where they could be monitored and controlled, rather than to disperse them across the region.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of the war on Gaza in October 2023, the goal posts have shifted, with some Israeli politicians calling for Palestinians to leave Gaza altogether and move to Sinai en masse, and calls to expel Palestinians becoming increasingly mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eiland, who continues to be a prominent commentator, wrote that one of Israel’s objectives in the war could be that “The entire population of Gaza will either move to Egypt or move to the Gulf”. Eiland later proposed a strategy entitled the “General’s Plan”, which would have seen Palestinian civilians become “legitimate targets” if they refused to leave the north of Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond prominent personalities, including government ministers, multiple Israeli institutions, both inside and outside of the state, have consistently proposed the idea of removing Palestinians from Gaza to Egypt. The right-wing Misgav Institute for National Security and Zionist Strategy, for example, published a paper in 2023 proposing the complete evacuation of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to Egypt, while another proposal in 2023, considered by Israel’s Ministry of Intelligence (a department which was abolished in 2024), recommended forcibly resettling Palestinians from Gaza in Sinai.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, the so-called Riviera Plan of US President Donald Trump has also insisted Egypt would take in Palestinians from Gaza, on a permanent basis, as Gaza is allegedly rebuilt into the “Riviera of the Middle East”. The Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu described it as “visionary” and “innovative” when President Trump announced it, and recently referred to it as “the plan”, or at least part of it, that Israel is putting into effect. The Riviera Plan is repeatedly being referred to as policy by different Israeli ministers, including within the security cabinet, with the Finance Minister saying they were “following the vision of US President Donald Trump”, and the Defence Minister saying that Israel was using “all means to implement the vision of the US president”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all of these cases, however, the Egyptian authorities rejected the proposals, insisting that Egypt’s territory could not be used as a homeland for Palestinian refugees, and Cairo would refuse to be complicit in the forced removal of Palestinians from Gaza, to Egypt or elsewhere. Cairo considers such a course of action to be one that “aims to liquidate” the Palestinian cause. United Nations’ Secretary General Antonio Guterres also branded President Trump’s idea as potential ethnic cleansing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That assessment from Cairo has not changed, despite the Akhbar newspaper report in March; the sourcing of the solitary report was dubious, and the Egyptian government denied the claim within a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;deeper-misunderstandings-and-growing-israeli-hostility&quot;&gt;Deeper Misunderstandings, and Growing Israeli Hostility&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, as noted, the Israeli press hastily spread around the report, and the Israeli Defence Minister reconfirmed Israel’s intention to fulfill the Riviera Plan, threatening Israeli seizure of Gazan territory after Israel failed to proceed with the continuation of the ceasefire-hostage agreement with Hamas. The misreading of Egypt in particular, and the Arab world in general in this regard, remains widespread in Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That gap is not simply between the Trump administration and the Arab world, but more specifically between Tel Aviv and Cairo. It is a peculiar gap, as one might expect there to be more awareness in the Israeli establishment about Egyptian assessments and sensibilities 46 years since the signature of the Camp David peace treaty. However, it is also indicative of a trend within Israel at present that has misread, willfully or otherwise, Egyptian security paradigms. It is a trend that has led to Egypt joining the South African case at the International Court of Justice against Israel on charges of committing genocide in Gaza, despite four decades of the Camp David Accords - and the impacts of this should not be disregarded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cairo views the Camp David Accords as the bedrock of regional security architecture, and the “foundation of peace” in the region, as Tamim Khallaf, Egypt’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson, recently put it. This is despite the challenges to the accords, particularly around Israel’s remilitarisation of the Philadelphi Corridor along the Gazan border with Egypt, and Israel’s failure to withdraw from it as required under what was known as “Phase One” of the Hamas-Israel hostage-ceasefire agreement concluded just before President Trump’s inauguration in January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is a clear trend in Israeli politics that has begun to view Egypt as a problem, a trend linked to a broader shift to the right in Israeli politics over recent years. Yechiel Leiter, the newly-appointed Israeli ambassador to the US, recently accused Cairo of building up military bases in Sinai for offensive operations. And Danny Dannon, the Israeli ambassador to the United Nations, also expressed his own concerns around Egypt, two days later. Former Israeli minister Yuval Steinitz also recently raised the alarm, saying there was “definitely reason” to view recent developments with concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent Israeli media reports indicate that Netanyahu’s own advisors have been promoting campaigns of this nature, for other political purposes, but not based on factual developments. Such reports around Egyptian building up offensive capacities in Sinai were not substantiated, and some of the accusations made by Israeli officials were subsequently removed from social media platforms. Still, an Israeli trend is emerging that is keen to promote a more adversarial view of Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;worse-may-lie-ahead&quot;&gt;Worse May Lie Ahead&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is little doubt that Cairo would respond to any Israeli expulsion of Palestinians into Sinai by substantially remilitarising the peninsula; such knowledge should be part and parcel of any realistic Israeli assessment of Egyptian security calculations. Instead, it seems that Israel has not factored this in at all. Indeed, in different “Track Two” discussions, Israeli interlocutors expressed astonishment at the certainty of such a forceful Egyptian reaction, ideas which any more impartial observer of Egyptian calculations would see as wholly inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear that the room for constructive discussions between Israel and Egypt has diminished, as the political mainstream in Israel has shifted further to the right. And this leads to two corresponding consequences. The first is the increasing lack of awareness in Israel of how Egypt in particular and the region in general views the current situation, which could set off a dynamic that would be even more destabilising for regional security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second outcome is the growth of a type of a new pre-emptive belligerence doctrine in Israeli security thinking which goes beyond Egypt. That trend has escalated not only in Gaza, but in Lebanon and Syria as well, where the maintenance of Israel’s security is at least partially informed by a sense of pre-emption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Syria, this has meant the recent occupation of more Syrian territory in addition to the Golan Heights that has been occupied by Israel since 1967; in Lebanon, this has meant the continuation of occupying several points in southern Lebanon, despite the ceasefire agreement that was agreed between the Israelis and the Lebanese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new and belligerent pre-emptive doctrine is now impacting even Israel’s discourse on Turkey - Israeli media has reported that Prime Minister Netanyahu apparently advised TV channels to emphasise that a confrontation between Tel Aviv and Ankara is inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combination of Israel’s apparent lack of awareness about Egyptian security priorities, coupled with a trend that looks at Cairo more negatively and adopts a “precautionary security paradigm” to all of Israel’s challenges does not bode well for the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding a leader’s personality, beliefs, and motivations is no longer a luxury but a necessity. Political psychology offers the tools to do just that, yet its insights remain underused in policy and intelligence circles. This commentary offers both a reflection on what has been done and a call to explore how these insights can be more effectively integrated into present and future analyses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emphasis on understanding leaders as individuals is not new. In 1978, President Jimmy Carter demonstrated the value of such analysis during the Camp David negotiations between Anwar Sadat, President of Egypt, and Menachem Begin, Prime Minister of Israel. After thirteen intense days, a historic peace agreement was reached. Reflecting on this pivotal moment in his memoir Keeping Faith, Carter emphasised how crucial it was to understand the people involved – not just the politics. He recalls: “I was poring over psychological analyses of two of the protagonists, which had been prepared by a team of experts within our intelligence community.” He wanted to understand what made these leaders tick – their ambitions, beliefs, strengths, and likely reactions under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team Carter referred to was part of the Centre for the Analysis of Personality and Political Behaviour (CAPPB) within the CIA, founded by Dr Jerrold Post. A pioneer in the field of political psychology, Post developed psychological profiles of key historical figures to aid negotiation and anticipate behaviour. Yet, following the Cold War, these efforts were scaled back, contributing – according to Post – to intelligence “surprises” in the face of major global events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While leadership analysis may still feature in some areas of government, the extent to which it is used, how influential it is, and whether it consistently draws on evidence-based methods all remain unclear. Yet the need for such analysis has never been more urgent. Relying solely on structural or realist frameworks – approaches that treat leaders as interchangeable and states as purely rational actors – no longer suffices in explaining today’s geopolitical realities. Political psychology offers rigorous, research-based insights that can enhance our understanding of decision-making at the highest levels. It is time we take this knowledge more seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Carter’s case illustrates the value of such analysis, references to “leader psychology” today are often vague or reductive. Analysts, journalists, and even academics frequently invoke it as a catch-all explanation for behaviour that defies conventional logic, without drawing on the field’s methodological depth. Political psychology is not a rhetorical device – it is a discipline with decades of empirical research and tested frameworks for profiling and understanding leaders. To meet the challenges of our current moment, we must apply its tools with greater precision and purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2021, many analysts focused on Vladimir Putin’s cost-benefit calculations, assuming a large-scale military operation would not align with Moscow’s interests. Reports such as one from the Centre for Strategic &amp;amp; International Studies (CSIS) did warn, however, that emotion and miscalculation could override rational judgement – echoing historical moments like the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. When the invasion occurred, some analysts were caught off guard, interpreting Putin’s behaviour as irrational or emotionally driven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This framing overlooks a deeper point. Political psychologists have long challenged the traditional concept of “rationality” in international relations – a model that assumes leaders make decisions through objective, utility-maximising calculations. In contrast, psychology shows that decision-making is shaped by how individuals perceive and interpret their environment, filtered through belief systems, emotions, cognitive biases, and past experiences. These are not random or chaotic influences, but patterned and analysable factors. Leaders, like all individuals, are subject to psychological dynamics that shape how they respond to information, interpret constraints, and navigate crises. Labelling behaviour as simply rational or irrational, without examining these underlying processes, offers limited explanatory value. By incorporating these insights, political psychology helps us make sense of decisions that might otherwise seem erratic or unpredictable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin’s psychological profile offers a clear case for the value of political psychology. Psychological profiling of Vladimir Putin shows that his belief system has shifted significantly over time, becoming increasingly adversarial. Early in his presidency, he appeared more cooperative, but by the 2008 Georgia conflict, profiles noted growing frustration and a loss of control. This trend intensified after the 2014 annexation of Crimea, with a marked rise in hostility towards the US, NATO, and the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the described shifts in Putin’s worldview, much of the Western political establishment continued to engage with him as a rogue – but ultimately manageable – leader. While expert analysis and perceptions did evolve over time, this shift was often slower or more cautious than the changing nature of Putin’s leadership may have warranted. Scholars have also found that Putin should be seen not as a grand strategist but as an opportunist, whose decisions are shaped more by his perception of immediate circumstances than by long-term plans. This interpretation not only helps explain his actions but also suggests a need for nuanced strategies of engagement based on psychological insight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another useful example is the reaction to Donald Trump’s behaviour during his second term, which many analysts and politicians described as notably different from his first. He appeared more aggressive in implementing changes, more willing to threaten traditional allies, and more inclined to pursue previously unthinkable alliances. Yet, such reactions often ignore long-standing insights from political psychology. It is well established that leaders learn during their time in office, adjusting their behaviour as they come to understand the limits of their power and the constraints of political institutions. In this context, Trump’s second-term focus on consolidating authority and surrounding himself with like-minded individuals is not unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Trump is frequently described as unpredictable, research has shown that his actions are, in fact, predictable when viewed through the lens of his personality. For example, his approach to China during his first term reflected traits such as competitiveness, distrust, and a preference for direct confrontation – behaviour consistent with his psychological profile. In this sense, he is described as “predictably unpredictable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numerous psychological assessments of Trump, including those conducted before he took office, have consistently highlighted the extremity of his profile compared to other world leaders. These studies have identified a strong preference for conflictual methods, high achievement and power motives, deep distrust of others, extreme extraversion, low emotional stability, and elevated traits of narcissism and Machiavellianism. Historically, such characteristics have been linked to a heightened focus on loyalty, resistance to constraints, impulsiveness, intolerance, and manipulative behaviour – traits that increase the likelihood of conflict escalation and, in some cases, the outbreak of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scholars in this field have long examined how leaders respond to crises, process external information, challenge established norms and rely on emotions and belief systems in decision-making. Using both quantitative and qualitative methods – such as content analysis and psychobiographical studies – they have developed tools to assess, compare, and even predict leadership behaviour. Techniques like Leadership Trait Analysis and Operational Code Analysis allow us to profile leaders and compare their scores to known patterns of behaviour among similar profiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, leaders high in control and power motivation tend to act assertively, while those with lower scores favour collaboration. A greater degree of conceptual complexity relative to self-confidence correlates with openness to advice and flexibility, whereas the reverse often results in rigidity and selective perception. Task-oriented leaders focus on outcomes, sometimes at the expense of cohesion, while relationship-oriented leaders prioritise unity and internal support. Traits such as high in-group bias or distrust further raise the likelihood of norm violations and conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, it is not too late to make greater use of the tools offered by political psychology – not only to deepen our understanding of leaders but also to improve diplomacy and better anticipate future behaviour. Like any field that seeks to explain human action, psychology is not without its limitations and continues to evolve. Still, the analytical frameworks already available can offer valuable insights. Ignoring them is a missed opportunity for both scholars and policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geopolitics will always matter in global security, but it is the choices of individuals – often idiosyncratic, emotionally charged, or shaped by deeply held beliefs – that ultimately steer the course of world events. The assumption that leaders are interchangeable or inherently rational no longer holds. As today’s challenges become more volatile and personalised, integrating psychological insight into political analysis is not optional – it is essential.&lt;/p&gt;

Expanding these programs is key to deepening ties and building a new generation committed to strong U.S.-Brazil relations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil is the world’s seventh-most populous country and the largest economy in Latin America. Yet despite vast opportunities for economic development and global engagement, Brazil’s educational disparities, skill gaps, and foundational inequalities present significant obstacles to its progress. Historically, cross-cultural exchange has served to help mitigate these challenges and accelerate development—in particular, bilateral educational exchange between Brazil and the United States, which has served as a key pillar of cooperation and fostered academic, economic, and cultural ties between the two nations. This report provides an in-depth look at the cross-cultural educational exchange between the United States and Brazil, analyzing the impacts and benefits for both nations and highlighting opportunities for growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-importance-of-international-exchange-with-brazil&quot;&gt;The Importance of International Exchange with Brazil&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;diplomacy-and-soft-power&quot;&gt;Diplomacy and Soft Power&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and Brazil have had a diplomatic relationship since 1824. Today, Brazil is an increasingly critical partner for the United States as it seeks to address challenges in energy, food security, climate change, and multilateral cooperation. Trade also remains a central pillar of the relationship. In 2024, trade between the United States and Brazil reached an estimated $92 billion. Of this total, U.S. imports from Brazil accounted for approximately $49.7 billion—a trade surplus for the United States. Beyond economic cooperation, maintaining a strong political alliance is crucial as Brazil positions itself as a global power—especially as countries like China seek to expand their influence through initiatives such as BRICS, an intergovernmental organization comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. A key factor in sustaining the close U.S.-Brazil relationship is soft power, including educational exchanges, cultural diplomacy, and scientific collaboration, all of which play a vital role in deepening ties between the two societies. These connections not only foster mutual understanding but also reinforce long-term strategic cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Beyond economic cooperation, maintaining a strong political alliance is crucial as Brazil positions itself as a global power—especially as countries like China seek to expand their influence through initiatives such as BRICS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the United States and Brazil share a strong tradition of educational collaboration, the rise of the BRICS bloc has introduced new complexities for alliances within the western hemisphere. Since its formation in 2009, BRICS has sought to challenge Western influence, with member states steadily expanding their geopolitical and economic reach. As a key participant, Brazil has strengthened its ties with fellow BRICS nations—particularly China and Russia—thereby broadening opportunities not only for trade and strategic cooperation but also for educational and cultural exchanges. These evolving partnerships reflect Brazil’s growing role in a shifting global landscape, raising important questions about the future of its engagement with Western institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stakes for countering Russian and Chinese influence in Brazil continue to rise, particularly given that Brazil is Russia’s leading trade partner in Latin America—and with China’s imports from Brazil reaching $89 million in 2022, more than double U.S. imports that same year. In recent years, education has emerged as a key pillar in strengthening Brazil’s individual ties with both China and Russia. BRICS initiatives have underscored the growing opportunities for educational exchanges between Brazil and Russia, culminating in the establishment of the first Russian-Brazilian school near Rio de Janeiro. Similarly, Brazil and China have recognized the need to expand student mobility, implementing programs to encourage cross-country study. China, in particular, has advanced these efforts through initiatives to bring Brazilian students to the School of Foreign Languages at East China University of Science and Technology (ECUST) and offer Chinese instruction in Brazil through the Confucius Institute at FAAP Business School in São Paulo. These developments highlight the urgent need for the United States and Brazil to prioritize educational collaboration—not only to deepen bilateral ties and maximize shared opportunities, but also to counterbalance growing Chinese and Russian influence in Brazil’s academic and cultural spheres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, there is also strong global competition to attract international student talent. Recent years have seen an expansion of international students studying outside their home countries, according to UNESCO. The United States is the top host of international students worldwide, but it is notable that both Russia and China consistently rank among the top ten. Beyond BRICS, there are other countries actively recruiting large numbers of globally mobile students that have experienced robust growth, based on 2024 data from Project Atlas. Following the United States, the leading hosts include Canada (+28 percent), Australia (+21 percent), and the United Kingdom (+6 percent). In addition to these large hosts of international students, intraregional mobility within Latin America has also been increasing. For example, more Brazilian students studied in Argentina (24,219) than in the United States, based on 2024 data provided by the Argentinean Ministry of Education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the United States looks to build upon its history of hosting the most international students in the world and to compete with other countries for top talent, there continues to be capacity across its nearly 4,000 colleges and universities, particularly at the undergraduate level, which is currently facing declining enrollments. With Brazilian students in the United States mostly studying in undergraduate programs, there is space within our institutions to host more of these often self-funded students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In considering the benefits of international student mobility, it is important to recognize not only the valuable skills, language training, and knowledge gained by international students, but also the immense economic benefit they bring to the United States. The U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) records the amount that international students contribute yearly to the U.S. economy. International students from all over the world contributed more than $50 billion to the U.S. economy in 2023 and supported more than 378,175 jobs.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Over the past 15 years, there has been significant growth in the economic contributions of Brazilian students to the U.S. economy, according to BEA’s data. In 2010, Brazilian students contributed $271 million to the economy. In 2015, four years after the launch of Brazil’s Science Without Borders program (known in the United States as the Brazil Scientific Mobility Program, or BSMP), that number had nearly doubled to $499 million. As of the most recent calculation (2023), Brazilian students contributed $1 billion dollars to the U.S. education sector, supporting jobs at colleges and universities throughout the country.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;brazil-us-student-exchange-trends-and-the-lasting-impact-of-special-programs&quot;&gt;Brazil-U.S. Student Exchange: Trends and the Lasting Impact of Special Programs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on data from Open Doors—a 75-year research project on international educational exchange conducted by the Institute of International Education (IIE) and supported by the U.S. Department of State—there were 16,877 Brazilian students in the United States in 2023–2024 (see Figure 1). The trend line below, which tracks the number of Brazilian students studying in the United States since 1948, is more striking not for the current numbers, but for the surge occurring in the mid-2010s, when significant bilateral government programs supported Brazilian students coming to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/2b7AKI6.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Number of Brazilian Students Studying at U.S. Higher Education Institutions.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Open Doors Report on International Educational Exchange.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of Brazilian students in the United States peaked at 23,675 in 2014–2015. This record high was primarily due to two government programs that supported mobility by providing funding: Brazil’s BSMP and the U.S.-led “100,000 Strong in the Americas” initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil’s substantial investment of $1.3 billion in international academic mobility through BSMP aimed to send students all over the world for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. Between 2011 and 2016, the investment funded over 25,000 Brazilian students, many of whom also benefited from the program’s coordination with more than 2,500 companies, organizations, and universities for hands-on internships and research experience. This program (which will be examined below) yielded swift returns, causing academic exchange participation and enrollment in STEM fields to surge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the 100,000 Strong in the Americas initiative was launched to expand institutional partnerships, collaboration, and mobility opportunities for the western hemisphere. Through a public-private partnership, the initiative brought together government entities, companies, foundations, and educational institutions to build collaboration between institutions and organizations throughout the region. To receive funding, U.S. and Brazilian institutions submitted joint proposals to a competitive review, with only a select number of winning grant recipients each cycle. This collaborative proposal partnership process has led to an increase in connections and partnerships between Brazilian and U.S. institutions, regardless of whether the proposal received funding, as reported by experts interviewed by the authors. For recipients of funding, awards yielded innovative projects across many U.S. and Brazilian higher education institutions, such as promoting the study of health and nutrition, joint engineering collaborations, the future of mining, building data analytics and entrepreneurship applications, and artificial intelligence for urban sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The number of Brazilian students in the United States peaked at 23,675 in 2014–2015. This record high was primarily due to two government programs that supported mobility by providing funding: Brazil’s BSMP and the U.S.-led “100,000 Strong in the Americas” initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The significant impact of these programs is reflected in the academic level enrollment data seen in Figure 2. The most remarkable growth was in the number of non-degree-seeking students, a rise driven by BSMP, most of whose beneficiaries were participating in one-year exchange or intensive English study programs. These numbers surged from a baseline of approximately 1,000 students in 2011–2012 to more than 11,500 in 2014–2015. Interestingly, there were also notable increases in the number of full degree students coming to the United States: The number of undergraduate and graduate students grew by over 30 percent from 2013–2014 to 2014–2015, with 6,990 undergrads and more than 4,100 graduate students enrolled in the 2014–2015 school year. These data clearly indicate that the most substantial growth in Brazilian student enrollment coincided directly with special programs promoting student exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Vat21dA.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: Academic Level of Brazilian Students in the United States.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Open Doors Report on International Educational Exchange.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the “shock” of BSMP and the ongoing 100,000 Strong in the Americas initiative, undergraduate and graduate enrollment saw a small decline after the BSMP program ended in 2016, but the numbers have continued to rise above pre-program levels. Even following the Covid-19 pandemic, undergraduate numbers have nearly rebounded to pre-pandemic levels, and the number of graduate Brazilian students in the United States has reached a record high, surpassing 5,000 for the first time. This growth has likely been driven by sustained Brazilian student interest, active recruitment by U.S. institutions, regional networks that promote study in the United States, and other partnerships established through these large governmental programs. One example of an organization that builds connections between prospective Brazilian students and U.S. institutions is the Department of State’s EducationUSA, which conducts outreach to students throughout Brazil to promote U.S. colleges and universities and also provides U.S. higher education institutions with resources about how to best recruit students throughout the country. The number of non-degree students, in contrast, has returned to pre-program levels and remained steady since then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the lasting legacies of the BSMP initiative has been the increase of STEM as a field of study—a primary goal of the program. As shown in Figure 3, STEM enrollment surged during BSMP, particularly in engineering. Similarly, math, computer science, and physical and life sciences saw significant growth in 2014–2015 and have continued to increase steadily ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/8RuS0Cd.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3: Brazilian Students in the United States in STEM and Intensive English Programs.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Open Doors Report on International Educational Exchange.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the impact of the BSMP program is still being seen as the proportion of students studying in the STEM fields increases. For example, in the 2023–2024 academic year, 35 percent of Brazilian students studied STEM, up from just 22 percent in 2009–2010. The most popular of the STEM fields in 2023–2024 was engineering (13 percent), with preferences for mechanical, civil, and electrical specializations. Math and computer science also saw significant growth, rising from 3 percent a decade ago to 8 percent in 2023–2024. Brazil has come to rank among the top ten countries of origin for international students in the United States; despite this progress, however, Brazil sends fewer STEM students than other top countries like Nepal, Nigeria, and Vietnam, indicating that there is room for continued growth and collaboration in these fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;us-brazil-study-exchanges-drive-startup-growth&quot;&gt;U.S.-Brazil Study Exchanges Drive Startup Growth&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of Brazilian students studying in the United States extends beyond the increase in international exchange and investment in STEM fields—it is also beginning to shape Brazil’s entrepreneurial sector, fostering innovation and contributing to the country’s growing startup ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017, Brazil ranked 69 in the Global Innovation Index, climbing to 50 by 2024—a significant improvement. A major driver of this progress has been the rapid growth of venture capital activity, both in the number of deals and their total value. According to the Latin American Venture Capital Association (LAVCA), Brazil’s startup ecosystem has expanded dramatically since 2013. That year, the country had fewer than 50 startups; by 2020, the number had surged to 682, and by 2024, it had soared to 1,428, more than double the 2020 number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This expansion has been largely fueled by the adoption of the U.S. venture capital model, which not only provides critical funding but also fosters a culture of innovation and risk-taking. Additionally, the integration of entrepreneurial skills into higher education programs has further strengthened the startup landscape, equipping a new generation of founders with the knowledge and tools necessary to scale their businesses successfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Among the 107 startups that received seed capital between 2021 and 2022, 59 percent of founders had studied in the United States—an 11-point difference from the 2019 cohort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors of this report conducted an in-depth analysis of a dataset comprising 161 Brazilian startups that received venture capital funding in 2019 and 107 that had received seed capital in 2021–2022. The goal was to identify trends and patterns associated with entrepreneurs who had studied at accredited academic institutions in the United States. By examining these startups, CSIS sought to understand the potential influence of U.S.-based education on the growth of venture-backed companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 161 startups that received funding in 2019 did so at various stages of development, from seed and early-stage to expansion. These companies were founded between 1990 and 2018, but most were relatively young—80 percent were established after 2008, with 66 percent established after 2011. Nearly 48 percent had at least one founder who studied in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the 107 startups that received seed capital between 2021 and 2022, 59 percent of founders had studied in the United States—an 11-point difference from the 2019 cohort. Notably, all 107 were at the seed stage, ensuring no overlap with the 2019 dataset and focusing the analysis on businesses founded in the last three to four years. This highlights the significant impact of international education experiences in the United States on Brazil’s entrepreneurial ecosystem. In addition, this newly created ecosystem is also a great opportunity for foreign direct investors—of which the United States is the largest one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also worth highlighting that all startups in this cohort incorporated STEM education in some capacity. Even when their products were not directly related to STEM fields, technology played a crucial role in these products’ development. Forty-six percent of the founders who studied abroad participated in short-term academic programs, which indicates that many may have benefited directly or indirectly from initiatives such as BSMP and partnerships built through the 100,000 Strong in the Americas initiative. This also underscores how even short-term experiences in the United States can play a critical role in startup creation, in turn highlighting the need to sustain and expand programs that facilitate these exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aligned to this period of heightened mobility between 2013 and 2016, the number of STEM graduates overall in Brazil experienced significant growth, from 188,199 graduates in 2015 to 237,767 in 2020. This period also aligns with an increase in Brazilian students studying STEM in the United States, as shown in Figure 4. The upward trend in STEM graduations in Brazil began in 2013–2014 and peaked in 2015–2016, two years after the conclusion of the BSMP, suggesting a lasting impact of the initiative on the country’s talent pipeline and startup ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantifying the direct economic impact of study abroad programs is challenging due to the many factors that influence the sector. However, there is a clear correlation between the expansion of Brazil’s startup ecosystem and the increasing number of entrepreneurs who have studied abroad, particularly in the United States. Notably, at least half of Brazil’s new technology entrepreneurs have received education in the United States, underscoring the significant role of Brazil-U.S. academic exchange programs. These programs not only contribute to Brazil’s overall economic development but also play a crucial role in shaping the industries that will drive its future economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;challenges-to-continued-expansion-of-brazilian-exchange&quot;&gt;Challenges to Continued Expansion of Brazilian Exchange&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings of this report make clear that exchange between the United States and Brazil benefits both countries diplomatically and economically. Yet rapidly expanding the number of students moving between the two countries will be a challenge. Several of the largest existing barriers remain at the student level, where problems like lack of language proficiency, insufficient programs, limited funding, and unequal access to education hold progress back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite Brazil’s economic size and potential, its educational bottlenecks present a fundamental challenge to increasing student mobility, both domestically and internationally. According to the PISA 2022 results, Brazilian students rank far below OECD averages in subjects such reading, mathematics, and science, and these scores have remained nearly unchanged since 2009. Similarly, language skills (or lack thereof) have also been a significant barrier for students. At the global level, Brazil ranked in the “low proficiency” category, placing 81st out of 105 countries in 2024, and even regionally, it trails behind 16 countries in Latin America. Decreasing levels of English proficiency and Brazil’s high level of inequality have also impacted students’ opportunities to study in the United States. From 2013 to 2016, the enrollment of Brazilian students in non-degree programs, including English language programs, surged significantly, peaking in 2014–2015 at 11,581 students. This surge in students due to BSMP’s short-term, funded program likely broadened the pool of students and made the opportunity to study in the United States more accessible to lower-income students. However, as seen in Figure 2, non-degree exchange students dropped sharply after the end of BSMP, despite ongoing need; this shows a clear reduction in opportunities following the end of the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Limited funding also directly restricts study abroad opportunities for Brazilian students in the United States and highlights inequality within Brazil. The International Trade Administration identified in a 2023 report that approximately 80 percent of Brazilian students studying in the United States are from Brazil’s wealthier southern and central eastern states. Because of economic inequality across the country and varying markets that seek out STEM majors, unequal access to education tends to favor those living in wealthier states. Due to limited funding opportunities and resources, students that are able to engage in existing study abroad opportunities often resort to private funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hurdles for Brazilian students studying in the United States go beyond the aforementioned student barriers. Currently, Brazil lacks any formal degree revalidation agreements—the official recognition of a foreign degree as equivalent to a Brazilian one—with foreign countries, meaning that students completing education abroad must undergo a strenuous and costly revalidation process through public universities. Furthermore, students must also take into consideration the logistics and economic cost of acquiring visas. These hurdles raise the level of inaccessibility for students affected by inequality within Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this report has largely focused on the mobility of Brazilian students to the United States, it is also worth noting that other barriers likely exist for U.S. students in relation to Brazil. According to Open Doors, from the 2001–2002 academic year through 2015–2016, Brazil consistently ranked among the top 25 study abroad destinations for U.S. students. However, since 2016, it has no longer appeared on this list. This is likely due to a number of factors, including a lack of Portuguese language proficiency, a dearth of study abroad program options in Brazil, and perceptions of safety and security. At the same time, despite the rise of multilingualism in the United States, poor Portuguese and higher Spanish proficiency may deter many U.S. students from seeking opportunities in Brazil, as students studying abroad in Latin America often choose Spanish-speaking countries. For those students who lack Portuguese skills but are undeterred, they face a limited—albeit growing—number of English-language programs in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;expanding-student-mobility&quot;&gt;Expanding Student Mobility&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By increasing funding, investing in targeted programs, and strengthening institutional linkages, both the United States and Brazil can expand the number of students studying abroad and enhance the long-term benefits of these exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;expand-and-strengthen-funding&quot;&gt;Expand and Strengthen Funding&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil and the United States should prioritize sustained and expanded funding to encourage student mobility. For example, an expansion of the Department of State’s EducationUSA network could create more opportunities for Brazilian students to understand their options, navigate the application and visa processes, and access resources to study in the United States. In addition, establishing long-term programs with funding opportunities for students will lead more Brazilians to pursue their studies in the United States. As Brazilian students have increasing options to study in other English-speaking destinations or BRICS countries, further investment would allow the United States to build a competitive advantage in attracting talented students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;address-educational-gaps&quot;&gt;Address Educational Gaps&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Brazilian government should continue and expand investments in English-language instruction at the high school level, ensuring that students gain the proficiency needed to pursue higher education opportunities in the United States. To aid in the training of English-language teachers, there should be continued development of programs that provide rigorous English-language training, such as PDPI (Programa de Desenvolvimento Profissional para Professores de Língua Inglesa nos EUA), which brings Brazilian high school English teachers to the United States to study both English and instruction techniques. At the same time, higher education institutions should expand English and Portuguese bridge programs, including virtual ones that can reach wider audiences and underserved regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil must also increase investment in primary and secondary education to better prepare students for professional and technical careers. The country’s education spending as a share of GDP has been declining since 2017 and currently stands at 5.5 percent. As of 2023, Brazil invested only $3,583 per student in primary and secondary education—well below the OECD average of $10,949.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;promote-non-degree-and-short-term-study-opportunities&quot;&gt;Promote Non-Degree and Short-Term Study Opportunities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expanding non-degree and short-term study opportunities is crucial for increasing student mobility, particularly that of low-income students who may not have the financial means to pursue full degree programs abroad. Short-term exchanges—such as English language programs, specialized training courses, certificate programs, and technical career programs at U.S. community colleges—provide valuable international exposure and are both accessible and cost effective. To enhance participation, both governments should consider reintroducing and scaling up government-backed short-term exchange programs similar to BSMP. Additionally, U.S. institutions can expand summer programs, internships, and research opportunities specifically designed for Brazilian students, providing them with hands-on learning experiences in key fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strengthen-institutional-partnerships&quot;&gt;Strengthen Institutional Partnerships&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasing academic collaboration between institutions in both countries can create more opportunities for exchange. One way to do this would be through the development of dual-degree programs in which students split their studies between U.S. and Brazilian universities and earn credentials recognized in both nations. By establishing credit-transfer agreements and mutual degree validation frameworks through university partnerships, students could have their coursework pre-approved, making it easier to apply their foreign education upon returning home. Expanding faculty-led study abroad programs, joint research initiatives, and English-language courses in Brazilian universities would also make study abroad more accessible, particularly for U.S. students who may not speak Portuguese fluently. By strengthening institutional partnerships with built-in degree validation mechanisms and addressing bureaucratic hurdles, both countries could create a more dynamic and accessible academic exchange ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Protracted wars are won by the party able to generate new, competitively trained forces and the armaments with which they are equipped and sustained. The ability to generate a second and third echelon of forces is an important aspect of a state’s deterrence posture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Russian defence industry has managed to significantly increase defence production. Ukraine has also done this, although to a lesser extent. European members of NATO, meanwhile, faced substantial problems in expanding defence-industrial output, despite an abundance of funds. This paper examines the processes of military-industrial mobilisation in each of these areas to assess the causes of radically different outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Russia had a well-developed plan for military-industrial mobilisation which it implemented early in the war. Ukraine did not have such a well-developed plan but could draw on its Soviet legacy to regenerate industrial capacity. Europe, meanwhile, lacked both a plan and the data with which to build one; this made investment into defence production inefficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Russia and Ukraine maintained a highly centralised level of coordination over their respective defence industries and had an understanding of the supply chains to enable a relatively coherent orchestration of investments. Europe, meanwhile, lacked control, and could only incentivise industry, while governments and industry lacked an understanding of their own supply chains, leading to massive internal competition and uneven expansion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, while Russia d id achieve a much more efficient military-industrial mobilisation, it also cost far more than is generally acknowledged. Russia has not only expanded defence spending but also rerouted money from other budgets to expand military-industrial recapitalisation and has advanced credit to defence companies to enable rapid growth. This will pose challenges in the medium term. It is not reasonable to expect Europe, which is not at war, to mobilise investment to a comparable level. However, the fragmentation of the European defence market has meant that money is spent very inefficiently. Greater European coordination of spending could improve the return on investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The regulatory environment in Russia and Ukraine should not be held up as a model. In Ukraine, regulation of core defence industries has necessitated a large unregulated non-traditional defence ecosystem to emerge. In Russia, practices are manifestly unsafe and have often led to accidents. In Europe, however, the burden of regulation is often self-defeating in raising the cost and slowing the production of equipment. Incentives for stockpiling equipment and taking risk, meanwhile, are skewed in such a way as to lead to systemic policy failure. Regulatory reform and harmonisation for the testing, procurement, storage and transportation of defence materiel are essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an environment where Europe must be able to deter Russia with reduced US support, Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine should spur significant efforts to address what has been demonstrated to be a manifestly inadequate defence-industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An assessment of the military balance is overwhelmingly concerned with the comparison of adversaries’ first echelon of forces, along with the first round of mobilised reserves. The confrontation of opposing first echelons with their original equipment usually produces the most rapid stages of a conflict. These troops are the most professional and best-equipped units, and they tend to be fewer in number than the force following mobilisation, so there is more space for manoeuvre on a front. The clashes of these forces tend to set the terms for follow-on fighting. They may decisively achieve their objectives, as was the case for Azerbaijan’s forces in Nagorno–Karabakh in 2020, the US-led coalition in Iraq in 1991, and the German invasion of France in 1940. Or they may fail, with the limits of their advance setting the conditions for a period of slower and more destruction-centric warfare, as during the First World War on the Western Front, the Iran–Iraq War, or Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where wars protract, they become industrial, with the capacity of a force to continue the struggle enabled by its capacity to manufacture a sufficient volume of equipment and to remain competitive in the equipment that it fields. Winning a long war depends on the ability to mobilise the necessary resources to ensure the ability to wage it. This applies, of course, to human resources, but the provision of an adequate volume of weaponry and military equipment is just as important. Numerical superiority in troops, their training and high morale do not matter if these troops do not have arms and ammunition. War is not only an art, but also a science, and this is especially true of long wars, which are determined ultimately by the second or third echelon – that is, a country’s reserves – and subsequent entirely new units of conscripts from the population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assessing the military balance of second- and third-echelon forces, and thus the capacity of a state to sustain a long war, is not as simple as measuring wealth and industrial potential. By late March 2022, officials in Russia realised that industrial and military mobilisation would be necessary. There has been a persistent narrative in parts of NATO that Russia is an insignificant threat because the GDP of NATO countries alone is about $46 trillion, which is almost half of world GDP. Russia, by comparison, has a GDP of approximately $2 trillion, representing only 2% of global GDP from an economy smaller than Canada’s. The military threat from Russia was often dismissed on the basis that it had an economy the size of Italy. This complacency is evident in the fact that as Russian defence spending expanded by some 227% and China’s by 566% from 2000, defence spending across Europe and Canada continued to decline until 2014 and, even then, was stable until 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite Russia’s comparative economic weakness, Russia still managed to outproduce NATO in military materiel throughout 2022–24, even with significant efforts in some NATO member states to expand defence production. This reflects the challenges of aligning political will, regulatory and legislative enablement, industrial planning and capacity, and understanding and control over supply chains. Russia’s continuing advantage in defence production poses a strategic threat to NATO and the credibility of its conventional deterrence. It poses a catastrophic risk for Ukraine, since its international partners have become its strategic depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper compares the military-industrial measures in Russia, Ukraine and European NATO over the course of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. It uses such comparisons to identify lessons on how war production among Ukraine’s international partners can be made more resilient and efficient to support Ukraine today and deter Russia into the future. The paper also explains how, and at what cost, Russia has achieved its scaling of military production. The paper does not offer a comprehensive breakdown of the defence industry across all these jurisdictions. Rather, its focus is on key policy issues that have shaped production outputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scope of this paper requires some explanation. On the Russian side, Iran, North Korea, Belarus, India, and China are central to the country’s ability to industrially sustain the war. Similarly, for Ukraine, the US and several non-European partners are important supporters. However, these countries are excluded from the study. The reason for this is that apart from the US, most of these states have been involved in the war as suppliers or funders, servicing orders or offering support. They have not needed to address major policy questions of industrial mobilisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the US, which has retained a substantial defence industry and has policies in place for industrial mobilisation, Russia’s full-scale invasion has prompted investment in the expansion of some kinds of munitions production. However, the mechanisms for doing this were the same as those used during the War on Terror to address shortages of precision-guided munitions. The main policy debate in the US was not one of industrial policy. Rather, it was the balance of investment in equipment relevant to supporting Ukraine and that which is useful in deterring Chinese aggression towards Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper, therefore, focuses on those states where key policy questions of how to industrially mobilise arose, with significant differences in what has been achieved and how. Focusing on Europe, without the US, is also relevant given that over the next few years, it is likely that more US capacity will be fixed in the Indo-Pacific. It is therefore useful and necessary to assess Europe’s military-industrial readiness. It may be asked, quite reasonably, why Europe is treated as a unified entity when it is highly fragmented in defence-industrial policy. The reason is that most European militaries are too small to sustain their domestic defence enterprises. Once scaling activities became necessary, it became clear that the European defence market must be considered collectively. Indeed, the competitive interactions across this market reveal the frictions and opportunities that have emerged over the course of the war. The discussion, therefore, is focused on Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evidence for this paper is diverse. The authors have – throughout the war – been actively engaged in policy discussions in Ukraine and across Europe on support for the Ukrainian war effort. The authors have also extensively consulted with the defence industry across Europe and both industrial and policy leaders in Ukraine. The research into Russian defence production combines a range of open and closed sources, some of which are sensitive in nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combination of commercial sensitivity in Europe, operational security in Ukraine and official secrecy in Russia make it difficult to pursue a unified methodology for these three areas of study. Similarly, while the Ukrainian government has assisted in the research for this paper, the Russian government has sought to prevent it. In Europe, meanwhile, there is a diverse range of actors, to which access was also provided under various terms. Together, this makes it difficult to present a comparable data set for each area of study. Instead, therefore, this paper seeks to understand each industrial environment on its own terms through the information available, and subsequently to draw conclusions about policies and their impact on production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A brief note on numbers. The chapter on Russia includes some specific production figures and costs. In some instances, it has been possible to obtain sensitive industrial information on Russian production, and so these numbers are used. The chapter on Europe does not use many specific numbers, although there are a great many in circulation. This is because while specific numbers are often included in press releases and media reports, the authors’ interviews with the parties concerned invariably indicated that actual numbers were markedly different, or that those that were publicly released amalgamated various kinds of data. The specific data was nevertheless shared in confidence and could not be used. In general, therefore, numbers are omitted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper has three chapters, one for each of the three areas of study: Russia, Ukraine and Europe. From a policy perspective, it may have made more sense to divide the chapters thematically, comparing policy and regulation, industrial capacity, and stockpiling and supply chains across the three areas. However, because of the different methodologies necessary for obtaining data, it is hard to compare like with like, and so the paper considers each separately, and then draws conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-russia-military-industrial-mobilisation&quot;&gt;I. Russia: Military-Industrial Mobilisation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial Russian invasion plan for Ukraine envisaged the destabilisation of the Ukrainian state by Russia’s special services, followed by a coup de main by the Russian military to rapidly seize and take control of Ukraine’s political and economic centres. The main military phase of the campaign was planned to take 10 days, with consolidation of control lasting several months. In this context, Russian planners did not expect to expend significant numbers of munitions or lose large volumes of military equipment. Thus, industrial mobilisation did not accompany the commencement of the Special Military Operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the initial plan failed, Russia found itself expending significantly more munitions and losing more equipment than it was producing. As early as March 2022, this led to advice from a range of Russian ministries to begin mobilisation of both personnel and the defence industries. The Kremlin deferred mobilisation of personnel. Although the Kremlin had decided on achieving its objectives in Ukraine militarily, it initially expected to be able to do this without mobilisation simply because of the limited stocks in Ukrainian arsenals. The expansion of Western military-technical assistance, the culmination of Russian offensive operations in Donbas, and the prospects for a protracted war undermined these assumptions. As a result, the emphasis in Russia shifted towards a partially mobilised war economy. The Russian leadership decided to wage a war of attrition against Ukraine, counting on the unwillingness of Kyiv and its Western partners to maintain the necessary level, pace and duration of funding. Russia’s leaders also assumed that Ukraine and its partners would not be able to effectively transform available financial resources into weapons and military equipment, primarily due to the degradation of industrial capabilities in general and defence-industrial capabilities in particular among Russia’s adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attention of intelligence agencies and think tanks focused on the possible start of the mobilisation of reservists of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation as an indicator of the Kremlin’s readiness to wage a long war. However, the first and more important indicators of Russia’s shift to a protracted conflict were those related to the start of its industrial mobilisation. President Vladimir Putin initiated the partial mobilisation of personnel on 21 September 2022 with his decree “On the announcement of partial mobilisation in the Russian Federation”, in response to a need to increase the density of forces in Ukraine. But industrial mobilisation had already been underway for months. Importantly, Russia had a detailed and established plan for industrial mobilisation as part of its war plans. This included the pre-drafting of legislation to enable military-industrial expansion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most professional and academic assessments of Russia’s ability to sustain a protracted war have over-emphasised calculations of how long Russia will last with the weapons and military equipment it had in stockpiles when the war began, especially with regard to munitions. Assessments of Russia’s military-industrial capacity to produce more equipment, and the significance of stockpiles for the production and maintenance of equipment, were both scarcer and less precise. Nevertheless, it was when Putin pulled these levers that Russia shifted to fighting a protracted war. This chapter outlines how this mobilisation was achieved, examining legislative, financial and industrial changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mobilising-industry&quot;&gt;Mobilising Industry&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision to prepare mobilisation was made during Russia’s offensive on Donbas. Officially, it began on 6 July 2022 when the Russian parliament adopted pre-prepared changes to several strategic laws related to Russia’s defence, the defence industry and system of public procurement. These created the legal prerequisites for the introduction of some elements of a war economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among other things, changes to the legislation allowed Russia’s government to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Start using all mobilisation capacities and facilities – primarily industrial facilities that can be involved in the production of goods and materials necessary to wage the war (including mothballed facilities).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use material assets of the State Reserve – primarily strategic materials necessary for the production of weapons and military equipment (including reserved ones).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Restrict labour rights in organisations, institutions and enterprises whose activities are related to the provision of military needs, including the obligation of employees to work 12 hours a day, at night, at weekends and on holidays, as well as the cancellation of annual leave and reducing the mandatory weekend to one day per week.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prohibit organisations from refusing to conclude agreements with the government on the supply of goods and services aimed at meeting military needs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Refuse tender procedures, and purchase from a single supplier, of the goods and services required for the state defence order, as well as for the formation of stocks of products, raw materials and components necessary to ensure the production of weapons and military equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Expand state regulation of prices in the sphere of state defence procurements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These rules could thereafter be applied to any organisation, including private ones, enabling the government to mobilise the economy. These changes built on a robust legislative base, enabling the Russian government to direct its defence industry. In accordance with the Order of the Ministry of Industry and Trade No. 1981 dated 18 May 2022 in the General Register of Enterprises of the Russian Defence Industry, there were about 1,400 enterprises of all forms of ownership. The majority of them were state-owned. More than 977 of these enterprises (including Rostec enterprises) were subordinated to Russia’s Ministry of Industry and Trade, 166 to the Ministry of Defence, 80 to Roscosmos and 43 to Rosatom. The state therefore exercised significant management over more than 4,000 enterprises and organisations. More than 4.5 million people worked in Russia at enterprises related to the implementation of state defence orders, as either direct employees or contractors: 25% in scientific organisations and 75% in manufacturing enterprises. Thus, taking into account family members, approximately 10% of Russia’s population was connected with the defence industry in 2022, and this figure has since expanded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These changes affected the portfolio of a range of critical companies. The state corporation Rostec, which includes more than 800 industrial and scientific enterprises, was responsible for the fulfilment of about 40% of the state defence order in 2022. By analysing its financial indicators it is possible to understand the general characteristic of the entire government policy in this area. According to its 2023 results, despite a significant reduction in the export of weapons and military equipment, Rostec’s revenues increased to almost 3 trillion roubles (about $34 billion). This was a third more than in 2022, and the main part of these funds was from the state defence order. According to the estimates of Rostec Director General Sergey Chemezov, the structure of these funds mostly reflects the cost of weapons and military equipment, as the profitability of Rostec’s production for the Russian military is only 2.28%. Chemezov has stated that up to 80% of equipment employed by Russian forces in Ukraine has included input from Rostec.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar processes are taking place with other suppliers of the Russian Ministry of Defence. In 2022, Roscosmos lost a significant part of its export portfolio, which accounted for Western countries and assembled civilian goods and services for use in space. However, in 2023, revenue began to grow again due to an increase in weaponry and military equipment orders. Roscosmos management estimates that in two to three years the loss of Western markets (about $2 billion per year) will be fully compensated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The significant growth of companies – such as Roscosmos and, as discussed later, Rosatom – is an important part of the impact of Russia’s military-industrial mobilisation. These enterprises have taken on significant responsibilities for military-industrial production since 2022. Moreover, because Ukraine’s international partners perceive these companies as serving non-military functions, such as nuclear energy, they have often become robust avenues for Russia to obtain specialist equipment and components to enable the continued production of sophisticated weapons. It is not just the scale of their contribution to defence that has increased; it is also their significance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These dynamics are not entirely new. Roscosmos enterprises were active executors of the state defence order prior to 2022. Their cooperation with Western clients (including governmental ones), in addition to financial income, was also used to obtain access to the most modern Western technologies. Such technologies were necessary, for example, for the development of Russia’s own military missile programmes. The West saw Roscosmos as an ordinary space agency and a legitimate partner for NASA and the European Space Agency. However, a large part of the companies that were part of the management of this holding are engaged in the production of weapons and military equipment, including various types of ballistic and cruise missiles for Russia’s Strategic Nuclear Forces, missile fuel, missile launchers and artillery systems. This structure is quite natural, because Roscosmos is the legal successor of the Ministry of General Machine Building of the Soviet Union, a body that was responsible for the coordination of a large number of industrial enterprises and scientific institutions that carried out the production of missiles and space technology, including ICBMs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important role of Roscosmos in the Russian defence-industrial complex has never been especially hidden. It was directly spelled out in the holding’s statutory documents, where it is specifically stated that the Roscosmos corporation was created for the production of missile technology, military and dual-purpose rocket and space technology, the provision of satellite navigation for Russian defence and intelligence agencies, and fulfilment of other tasks of the state armaments programme. The special importance of the defence-industrial function of Roscosmos is indicated by the competencies of the heads of this corporation in recent years – Dmitriy Rogozin and Yuri Borisov, before leading Roscosmos, had been deputy prime ministers for defence and space industry. Borisov was also the deputy minister of defence responsible for the armament programme of the Russian Armed Forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A significant part of the funds in the Russian budget allocated to financing space programmes, even before the full-scale invasion, went to defence tasks – the production of products for the fulfilment of a state defence order, as well as the development of weapons, military and special equipment. In the new space programme for the years 2024–26, more than 1 trillion roubles (about $12 billion) have been laid down. Almost all of these funds will not be directed to the lunar exploration programme, but as state subsidies to companies of the Roscosmos corporation engaged in the development and production of missiles, missile engines and ballistic weapon coordination systems. Among the recipients of subsidies is the Special Design Bureau of the Moscow Energy Institute (OKB MEI), which produces products for the coordination of ballistic, anti-aircraft and cruise missiles, including intercontinental missiles Yars and Bulava. Another form of subsidy is the contribution of funds to the capital of these enterprises. For these needs, Roscosmos will receive $1 billion from the budget in 2024. The Yaroslavl Radio Plant, which produces tactical and satellite military communications for the needs of the Ministry of Defence, will receive part of these funds as part of its charter capital. Special attention in the space programme is paid to the expansion of the satellite group for the performance of military tasks. The militarisation of space technology is, according to the statements of the Russian political leadership, a current priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State nuclear energy corporation Rosatom is also an important executor of the Russian state defence order. The structure of Rosatom includes the enterprises of Russia’s nuclear weapons complex, which are engaged in the maintenance of operational efficiency, modernisation, development and testing of new models of nuclear weapons. Enterprises are also involved in the development and production of non-nuclear weapons. Like Roscosmos, this function of Rosatom is quite natural. Rosatom is the successor of the Soviet Ministry of Medium Machine Building, which, in addition to developing and testing nuclear weapons, dealt with atomic energy. VNIIEF, VNIITF and VNIIA, which carry out the development of nuclear charges and nuclear ammunition, as well as Elektrokhimpribor and Priborostroitelny Zavod, which carry out serial production of nuclear ammunition, are among the enterprises that are part of Rosatom. Rosatom enterprises also participate in the development and production of non-nuclear weapons and military and special equipment, which are actively used by the Russian military against Ukraine. These systems include the Ataka anti-tank guided missile, the Sturm multi-purpose missile complex, the Chrysanthem-S anti-tank missile complex, cluster munitions for the Grad and Smerch multiple launch rocket system (MLRS), the Igla-S MANPADS, complexes for missile control systems, high-precision weapons, and conventional ammunition and their components. Rosatom also develops and produces weapons based on new physical principles, including the Zadyra-16 laser combat complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rosatom’s role in the Russian state defence order has predictably increased since the beginning of Russia’s full-scale aggression. At the same time, the West continues to hesitate to apply sanctions against Rosatom, citing the high dependence of Western energy companies on the supply of Russian nuclear fuel and other related technologies. This allows Rosatom to continue to generate substantial income from its international operations. In 2023, it amounted to $16 billion, more than half of all the income of the corporation. In addition, the absence of sanctions removes restrictions on the purchase and import of export-controlled items such as microelectronics, which can also be used by other enterprises of the Russian defence-industrial complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, Rosatom also expanded its production of microelectronics. For this purpose, a new enterprise of the NPO “KIS” (Scientific and Production Association “Critical Information Systems”) was created within the structure of Rosatom. This entity also started the purchase of specialised assets. In May 2024, it was discovered that Rosatom intends to acquire the Russian company NTC Modul, which produces computing modules, control systems, navigation equipment, high-precision positioning, recognition systems and analysis of video images used in Russian weapons, including in attack UAVs. The purpose of the purchase is to use Rosatom’s funds to expand production, as well as eliminate the company’s current problems with the supply of Western components. It is important to note that for the development of both nuclear and conventional weapons, Rosatom uses funds that formally have no relation to the Ministry of Defence. For example, the state programme “Development of the nuclear energy industrial complex”, supervised by the Ministry of Energy, includes subprogrammes for financing the development of Russia’s defence-industrial complex enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The activities of the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAN) are also subordinated to the interests of war. Even fundamental scientific research is aimed, in accordance with the position of the Russian government, at “the creation of scientific and technical development in the interests of the defence and security of the state, primarily solving the problems of the Armed Forces”. Representatives of the Main Directorate of Innovative Development of Russia’s Ministry of Defence, as well as military innovation technopolis “Era”, participate in the determination of scientific research that scientific institutions of the RAN carry out. Direct customers of research are generally designers of defence enterprises. In January 2024, Putin issued a decree on the inclusion of the head of RAN, Academician Gennady Krasnikov, in Russia’s Security Council. Russia’s budget for 2024 has earmarked about $3 billion solely for fundamental research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many other companies have similar recent histories: since 2022, despite clear losses of business in relation to exports, revenue and production have expanded. While space prevents detailed examinations of each case, the point is that the first explanation for Russia’s successes in expanding military production was its comprehensive ability to take existing engineering enterprises servicing civilian functions and repurpose them for military production. This was chiefly enabled by tight state control. However, it also reflects Russia’s concern with production capacities; this stands in contrast with the West, where dual use is largely a discussion about technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important aspect of Russia’s legislative changes was the ability to expand the labour available to the defence industry. At the time of writing, Russian defence enterprises are drawing on labour from students in the last year of university and technical schools, as well as those convicted of criminal offences. Drawing on these sources of labour significantly reduces the wage expenses of these categories of employees, who receive a lower wage or are not paid at all. As of May 2024, there were about 34,000 convicts in Russia who were being used for forced labour, both at defence-industrial enterprises and in logistical and other functions supporting the defence industry. Russia aims to increase this source of labour in 2025 to 80,000. According to information released in May 2024 by British defence intelligence, the Russian government is also planning to introduce forced labour mobilisation, with appropriate changes to labour legislation being prepared for this purpose. Russia is also making immigrants from Africa and elsewhere work in its defence industries, although this is not likely to be an extensive phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important element of the transition to war is the blending of defence-industrial processes with the units of the Russian Armed Forces. The re-establishment of BTRZ (equipment repair workshops), was a key part of Russia’s industrial mobilisation plan and enabled the maintenance of legacy equipment. Specialist enterprises of the Russian Ministry of Defence and the repair units of the Russian Armed Forces are actively involved in restoring and repairing weapons and military equipment, as well as carrying out a full cycle of pre-combat preparations of new equipment, including in the combat zone. Such enterprises and units use mobilised personnel as well as conscripts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Russian military standards, repair work aimed at restoring the operational efficiency and serviceability of weapons or their components is divided into military repair, which is carried out at the bases and locations of military operating units (voiskovoi remont), mostly by the Russian Armed Forces independently; and factory repair (zavodskoi remont), which involves sending weaponry and military equipment to repair enterprises and manufacturing plants. In accordance with Russian standards, only major repairs are carried out at repair enterprises and manufacturing plants; all current repair work must be carried out by military units that operate the equipment independently or with the involvement of specialist repair units. Thus, only those systems that have suffered significant damage are sent to the factories; the military itself must repair medium and light damage. According to information released by the Russian Ministry of Defence at the beginning of 2024, of the weapons, military equipment and special equipment damaged during the war, only 7% is sent to specialist enterprises for repair. Most of the systems (66%) in need of repair are restored by military repair units. A further 22% are repaired by field teams of the Ministry of Defence’s enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;financial-mobilisation&quot;&gt;Financial Mobilisation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion above demonstrates that Russian industry has been reoriented to serve defence. This section turns to its funding. Analysis of Russia’s defence industry has chronically under-estimated its defence spending. When evaluating the level of financial support of the Russian Armed Forces, especially in terms of their ability to purchase new weapons, many researchers limit their analysis to the annual budget of Russia’s Ministry of Defence, as represented in US dollars. The budget of Russia’s Ministry of Defence in 2024 was approximately $52 billion, or approximately 15 times less than that of the US Department of Defense, and comparable to that of the UK or France. Given that Russia has a larger force and a significantly larger arsenal than the UK or France, and further expanded production after 2022, the dollar value of the defence budget clearly does not reflect defence spending. As Richard Connolly has observed, Russia’s defence expenditure is considerably higher when compared using purchasing power parity, which produces a level of expenditure commensurate with the results prior to 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with a higher baseline of expenditure prior to the war, Russian expenditure on defence has also grown considerably since 2022. Total funding for Russian defence, security and intelligence in 2024 is about $150 billion (non-PPP comparison), with defence amounting to approximately 38.6% of the total budget and about 6.7% of Russia’s GDP. Organisations such as the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute exclude security and intelligence funding from calculations of Russian defence expenditure, as this includes a range of non-defence activities. While this was a defensible position prior to 2022, it is difficult to justify since the invasion. There are more than 25,000 troops of the Russian Guard operating in the occupied territories in Ukraine, fielding some 520 armoured fighting vehicles, 140 artillery pieces and 22 helicopters. The FSB (Federal Security Service), meanwhile, has established a large presence in the occupied territories that is critical to Russia’s counterintelligence regime there. Russia’s special services have also played a major role in financing the recruitment of personnel in Ukraine. Although security spending should not be counted as only related to defence, a significant proportion of it has directly contributed to the war effort since 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the additional expenditure in the defence budget, furthermore, goes to financing the invasion in Ukraine, and the share of these funds intended for defence purchases is significantly higher than in Western countries. Thus, in 2022, the volume of the state defence order amounted to about $27 billion. In 2023, it was increased 1.5 times, and continued to increase in 2024. To cover such high expenditure, a significant part of the funds is raised using bank loans, where the main role is still assigned to Promsvyazbank (PSB). Since 2019, the Russian government has designated PSB as a support bank for servicing the defence industry. At the same time, the government signs long-term contracts with defence enterprises. Payments must be made after several years and, to fulfil the contract, the enterprises receive a targeted loan from PSB. This makes it possible to order and receive weapons for amounts that are significantly larger than the combined annual procurement budgets of the defence and security agencies. With the sufficiently high discount rate (16%) of Russia’s Central Bank and expensive loans provided at 18–19% per annum, defence industry enterprises receive loans in the range of 5–6%. This is ensured by subsidising the difference on the part of the government, as well as providing soft loans by the banks themselves, which then receive compensation from the Central Bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside the higher than usually acknowledged baseline of expenditure on defence in Russia, the significant expansion of the defence budget since 2022 and the favourable structures of loans to accelerate the availability of funds for defence enterprises, defence has drawn on budgets outside spending allocated to the Ministry of Defence. When assessing the real level of Russia’s cost of waging war in Ukraine, significant expenditure is borne by civil department budgets or is compensated by state and sometimes even private company funds. In addition to the state programmes “Development of the defence-industrial complex”, “Ensuring the country’s defence capability” and others, the military nature of which is understandable, the budgets of formerly civilian programmes are also used to finance the needs of the defence-industrial complex. These include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Space activities of Russia” and “Development of the nuclear power industrial complex” (about $1 billion per year).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Development of the electronic and radioelectronic industry” (more than $2 billion per year).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Scientific and technological development of the Russian Federation” (Ministry of Education and Science, about $15 billion per year).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Economic development and innovative economy” (Ministry of Economic Development, more than $4.2 billion for the period 2022–24).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Development of industry and increasing its competitiveness” (Ministry of Industry and Trade, more than $7 billion in 2024).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Development of the aviation industry” (about $10 billion by 2030 – Rostec will receive most of the funds) and others.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all funds in each budget line are diverted to military expenditure. However, the emergence of a centralised planning process for military-industrial coordination within the presidential administration has allowed for investments from these budget lines to significantly contribute to the defence industries, through investment in machine tooling, training, logistics and other expenditures. These would otherwise be borne by the defence budget. The involvement of these programmes in defence-related activities is indicated by the decision of the Russian government not to publish data on their implementation. In addition, Roscosmos took a legislative initiative to classify information about all commercial operations of its companies to “protect suppliers”. The Russian government also decided not to publish data on several programmes in the field of international cooperation, in particular “Foreign Policy Activities” and “Support and Promotion of the Russian Language”. This may indicate that these programmes are used to finance the foreign operations of Russian special services. The Russian Fund for the Support and Protection of the Rights of Compatriots Living Abroad (known as Pravfond), which was officially supposed to provide legal assistance to Russian expatriates, was used to conduct Russian influence operations in 48 countries – the majority in Europe – on which millions of euros were spent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;expanding-production&quot;&gt;Expanding Production&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The output of Russian defence industries has increased due to the effectiveness of the measures outlined above. When it adopted a strategy premised on outlasting Ukraine and its international partners, Russia based many of its industrial targets in 2022 on an assessment of anticipated production in NATO countries. These assessments assumed that industrial mobilisation would be taking place across NATO, albeit unevenly, by 2023, and would reach the planned levels of output in 2024. To overtake the West, Russian enterprises began to work in three shifts, six days a week. At the end of 2022, Russian experts believed that Russia was four months ahead of the West in setting up arms production. This was evaluated as an extremely positive result, since, according to them, “the one who starts the military assembly line first gets an undeniable advantage”. Importantly, the failure of NATO countries to demonstrate alacrity in military-industrial investment at this time contributed to the Kremlin’s optimism over the long-term trajectory of the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In parallel with the maximum development of existing industrial capacities, the Russian government began to actively invest in the creation of new production facilities. According to analysis of satellite images since February 2022, many Russian defence enterprises were expanded, and some were built “from scratch”. This applies to enterprises engaged in the production and maintenance of ammunition as well as UAVs, combat helicopters and explosives. According to Putin, during the first year and a half of the invasion, Russia created 520,000 new jobs in the defence industry. The process of building up defence and industrial capacities has continued. In 2024, almost $1 billion was spent on the renewal and expansion of defence-industrial plants in Tatarstan alone. A significant part of these funds went to the development of the Kazan Gunpowder Plant. Notably, these funds are not government expenditures, but Rostec’s own investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The level of combat readiness of the troops depends not only on the amount of allocated funds, but also on the efficiency of their use. It is important to note that the main military-economic approach to providing the Russian Armed Forces with the necessary weapons and military equipment is to maximise their military-economic efficiency, which is determined by “the level of damage inflicted on enemy objects at a certain time and at a certain cost of material resources”. This determines the preference for cheaper, mass samples, as well as the restoration and modernisation of existing weapons, including those that are in “deep conservation” warehouses. This approach is particularly noticeable with Russian armoured vehicles. Of the 2,100 tanks that were delivered to the Russian Armed Forces in 2023, only 210 were new tanks and more than 800 were modernised T-72s. The remaining tanks were restored T-72s and T-80s, as well as some obsolete T-62s. There were also T-55s/54s, which are mostly used as self-propelled artillery to fire from closed positions, as well as to strengthen defence lines as long-term firing points. For comparison, in 2023, Ukraine received 70 Leopard 2s, 31 Abrams M1s and 14 Challenger 2s, none of which were new, as well as about 100 Leopard 1s manufactured in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has taken the same approach with guided aerial bombs. These have become one of the primary weapons of the Russian Aerospace Forces in the war. In production and, as a result, use, preference is given to the conversion of conventional unguided aerial bombs (FAB-250, FAB-500, FAB-1500 and FAB-3000), large stocks of which were left over from Soviet times, to guided glide munitions with a range of up to 70 km. Such a transformation is carried out by installing a mounted planning and correction module (UMPK) developed by the Russian enterprise Basalt, which is part of Rostec. The UMPK is a Russian analogue of the American JDAM. The relatively low price of the kit, which was about $20,000, attracted the Russians at that time. The UMPK is much simpler than the JDAM. In addition to the relatively accurate kits equipped with a satellite and inertial guidance system, capable of hitting targets at 40–70 km, the Russians also produce and use even more simplified versions that have only an inertial guidance system, and even uncorrected ones that are equipped only with folding wings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of cheaper but more primitive modifications of the UMPK inevitably decreases accuracy. This is compensated for by the use of heavy high-explosive aerial bombs weighing 1,500 kg and 3,000 kg, as well as cluster and vacuum bombs, which significantly increase the area of effect. Thus, when using the FAB-3000, the radius of complete destruction of buildings is 18 metres, the lethal impact on manpower is 40 metres, and the infliction of severe but non-fatal injuries is 160 metres. Since the Soviet reserves are finite, production of the FAB-3000 has resumed in Russia, and production of the FAB-1500 and FAB-500 is also ramping up. Currently, Russian industry is trying to adapt UMPK kits for its stocks of FAB-5000 and FAB-9000, which will likely be used to destroy large industrial buildings, port and railway infrastructure, and warehouses, causing significant damage to residential areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Partial success with the use of UMPK will probably inspire Russia to look for other relatively cheap solutions that can advance the mass production and use of high-precision weapons. Such solutions could include Russian analogues of the precision guidance kit (PGK) M1156, which turns unguided 155-mm projectiles into guided ones (estimated price of the kit is $12,000), as well as the AGR-20 advanced precision kill weapon system ($20,000), which turns unguided Hydra 70 rockets into precision ones. The Russian defence industry is trying to move in this direction. Among the projects that are receiving special support, it is worth highlighting the OU-122 system, which equips unguided 122-mm projectiles for the Grad and Tornado-G MLRS with a guidance system with an accuracy of up to 10 metres, as well as the Russian complex Ugroza, which turns Russian unguided S-5, S-8 and S-13 rockets into precision munitions. It is also possible to substitute the expensive Krasnopol laser-guided 152-mm projectile and return to the Dynamika module, which was a Russian analogue of the PGK M1156 for projectiles of 152-mm calibre and above, and costs less than $1,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to produce means of destruction in the volume that meets the requirements of a full-scale war (primarily artillery shells and missiles, the production of which has increased in Russia since the beginning of 2022 from 14 to 22 times, depending on type) directly depends on the availability of the necessary amount of explosives, rocket fuel and some other chemical substances. In Russia these are called “special chemistry”, following the Soviet tradition. Notably, before 2022 Russia was one of the world leaders in the production of explosives, and yet since the full-scale invasion, billions are still being invested both in the modernisation of existing enterprises and in the construction of new special chemical enterprises. The Ministry of Industry and Trade is responsible for the financing and implementation of these investments in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main tasks is to achieve complete independence from foreign supplies. Russia successfully circumvents sanctions by purchasing raw materials – even from NATO countries – to produce explosives. However, the Russian leadership does not favour this. To reduce dependence on imports, Russia is searching for and using alternative technologies. For example, Russia is not a producer of cotton, which is necessary to produce nitrocellulose which, in turn, is the main raw material in the production of gunpowder and other explosive substances. To improve its own supply, the Russian government is investing in the development of technology to produce nitrocellulose from wood and flax. According to statements from Rostec representatives, industrial production has already started and there are plans to increase the share of gunpowder produced from such nitrocellulose to 60–70%. While European explosives manufacturers are concerned about the reliability of the supply of cotton from China, the world’s largest cotton producer, research is also being carried out in China to produce nitrocellulose from wood. According to researchers, this will not only expand the raw material base, but also reduce the cost of production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of Russian government policies are reflected in the year-on-year production figures so far during the war. Many Western commentators have assumed a high level of corruption and thus inefficiency in Russian defence production. There is corruption, certainly, but this has not prevented Russian industry from meeting its allocated targets. In summer 2023, Russian industry provided the Ministry of Defence with an assessment of what it was likely to deliver in 2024. In 2022, Russian industry had produced 250,000 152-mm artillery shells, which had risen to 1 million in 2023. In 2024, the projected output was 1.325 million 152-mm rounds. In practice, Russia produced just over 1.3 million 152-mm rounds. Russian industry projected that it would produce 800,000 122-mm shells and managed to meet this target in 2024. Growth in 2025 will continue, especially later in the year as new special chemistry factories begin to reduce limitations on available propellent and high explosive to fill shells. Russian industry managed to produce 420 out of a target of 460 Kh-101 missiles in 2023, and, in 2024, this rose to over 500. Production of 9M723 ballistic missiles rose from approximately 250 in 2023 to more than 700 in 2024. UMPK production has also grown precipitously, from only a few thousand units in 2023 to around 40,000 units in 2024, with more than 70,000 ordered for 2025. UAV development is also expanding, with the production rate of Geran-2 one-way-attack UAVs reaching 30 units per day by the end of 2024. Armoured vehicle manufacture, including artillery production, has remained steady at around 2,000 tanks and 3,000 other armoured fighting vehicles per year, although only about 10–15% of these are new-build. However, Russian industry is rapidly acquiring barrel machines and working to expand production lines to increase the output of new-build armoured vehicles. Although output is increasing, it will be lower than current refurbishment rates. The figures speak for themselves in demonstrating that Russia has managed to significantly increase production of its critical weapons systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, an examination of the measures that Russia has adopted makes both the scale of its industrial output and the speed of expansion comprehensible. The current Russian defence-industrial policy is characterised by the following factors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A high level of coherence due to the extensive preparation and planning of the defence-industrial mobilisation process, which was adhered to and implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A high degree of centralised control following the establishment of a centralised coordinating mechanism to manage the process of defence-industrial mobilisation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The establishment of several elements of a war economy, including: industrial mobilisation; the introduction of the appropriate legal regime, which allows the government to set direct tasks to both state and private companies that produce weaponry and military equipment and their components, or produce or extract the necessary raw materials for their production; and the authority to set prices, and to limit the labour rights of employees.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A ready availability of funds, due to the growth in budget for the production and development of weapons, which is a result of significant increases in the direct budgets of the Ministry of Defence and other paramilitary bodies that are directly involved in the war, as well as the allocation to the war of budgets of a wide range of civilian departments and organisations (Ministry of Industry and Trade, Rosatom, Roscosmos, Ministry of Education and Science, RAN and others). Taking into account this level of militarisation of officially civilian programmes, the real level of budgetary funding of the Russian military’s defence industry programmes is significantly higher than indicated solely by the size of the Russian defence budget, which is about $150 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A high level of attracting state and private bank credit to produce weapons and military equipment, with reimbursement by the Russian Central Bank of part of the interest on such loans. This allows defence-industrial enterprises to attract loans at 5–6% per annum in roubles. Such lending allowed for an increase in the volume of the state defence order in 2024, rising probably to more than $50 billion per year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A high level of investment in the modernisation of defence-related existing enterprises, as well as in the creation of new enterprises. Such investments are made from the enterprises’ own funds, the majority of which are state-owned, and from state programmes that are not formally related to the war and are aimed at ensuring Russia’s economic development, enabling import substitution.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maximising the combat effectiveness of weapons – according to the Russian criteria for this – by giving preference to mass, cheap samples of weapons and military equipment, and to the restoration and modernisation of existing systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A reduction in the cost of services for the production and maintenance of weapons and military equipment due to the introduction of partial de facto labour mobilisation. This allows for the involvement in production and logistics of conscripts undergoing military service in special repair units, as well as the involvement of students who receive minimal payment for their work, and prisoners whose work is close to unpaid.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This level of industrial mobilisation exposes the Russian economy to the risk of growing economic instability over time and will have significant negative long-term consequences for Russian society if it is sustained. In the medium term, however, these policies are enabling Russia to massively increase output of military equipment. Moreover, a large proportion of the funds dedicated to this expansion represent capital investment in industrial capacity such that large-scale production can continue with reduced funds. Thus, unless there is a rise in political instability, it is likely that Russia will be producing large quantities of military equipment for a protracted period, even if there is a forced rebalancing of the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-europe-blasé-faire-defence-economics&quot;&gt;II. Europe: Blasé-Faire Defence Economics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standing before the Bundestag on 27 February 2024, then Chancellor Olaf Sholtz pronounced that, “The twenty-fourth of February 2022 marks a watershed in the history of our continent”. The full-scale invasion of Ukraine left Europeans feeling suddenly insecure, and galvanised a wide range of pronouncements pledging support for Ukraine, commitment to NATO and condemnation of Russia. In Germany, a special €100-billion fund was allocated to the Bundeswehr. And yet, despite large amounts of money being made available and near-universal rhetorical commitment to boosting defence, European defence production languished for more than a year. European countries have struggled systematically to convert capital and intent into production output. Understanding why they have failed requires an examination of the policy dilemmas that have hampered the allocation of funds, the regulation that has limited its effective expenditure, and the issues of supply chain resilience and competition that have limited value for money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;money-to-munitions&quot;&gt;Money to Munitions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion many states pledged lethal aid. The desperate need to push equipment into Ukraine that would make an immediate difference with little training or support meant that man-portable anti-tank and air defence systems were prioritised, along with small arms. Thus, European countries began to send NLAWs, Panzerfaust-3s, Javelins, Karl Gustav recoilless rifles, Stingers, Marlet and Starstreak MANPADS to Ukraine. Although individually effective, the impact of these gifted weapons paled in comparison with the stocks of weapons Ukraine already possessed. Nevertheless, when Ukraine managed to blunt Russian advances more successfully than the country’s international partners anticipated, it also found itself running short of artillery munitions and other core platforms. Ukraine’s partners lacked either large stockpiles or latent production capacity for these items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial decisions on allocation of funds were straightforward and went in two directions: funding for replenishment of stocks of gifted weapons, such as NLAW; and funding for new platforms relevant to NATO’s conventional deterrence, such as F-35 purchases. For most European countries, however, there were some key policy challenges in how to allocate funds for Ukraine’s enduring resistance. The first challenge was simply a question of time. Although national stocks are not publicly disclosed, it is evident that Western European states had just weeks of artillery ammunition in stockpile. The problem was that while they could contract to expand production, their stockpiles were inadequate to bridge the gap until new production could come online. Russian forces prepared to press hard against Ukrainian troops in Donbas in April 2022. In response, European governments mostly prioritised purchasing ammunition from the international market on the basis that this would provide a more immediate benefit to Ukraine and a more predictable supply in the short term for the purposes of planning. The shorter delivery times were also politically attractive and fuelled the rounds of announced support packages. Leaders used these to demonstrate to their domestic audiences that they were making good on their rhetorical commitments to Kyiv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first orders to the defence industry were to replace the man-portable weapons that had been donated. Subsequent discussions arose on orders for artillery ammunition. This discussion became problematic. Most European states were only willing to propose orders to replenish their own stocks, or else wanted to make large one-off orders that could not be met by existing capacity and were also not long term enough to support capacity being increased. Companies therefore started to add orders sequentially to their order books. However, while governments proposed more contracts, the result was simply to extend the delivery timetable. Companies had no assurances from governments that orders would continue over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For governments, three main factors limited willingness to make long-term investments. First, they were unsure how long the demand would last. Second, the core requirements for the Ukrainian military were not assessed to necessarily be the same as for a NATO military – raising the question of opportunity costs. In some cases, ramping up production was seen as coming at the expense of NATO modernisation. Third, many countries worried about the competitiveness of an industry over the long term. For example, even if the UK ramped up munitions production, it was feared that it would produce fewer rounds – likely at an uncompetitive price point – than Germany. The risk, from the UK’s point of view, was that it would spend significant amounts to expand production capacity, and then have to subsidise an uncompetitive production line for a protracted period when there might well be a supply glut and demand slump across NATO. This led many countries to hold off placing orders. Countries such as Finland moved faster, but, initially, this simply placed their orders higher in the order books. In 2022, orders did not expand production capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For countries on NATO’s eastern flank, the industrial paralysis that was afflicting Europe in 2022 was a cause of alarm. NATO members were depleting their stockpiles but failing to invest in industrial capacity to sustain Ukraine’s or NATO’s ability to fight. In this context, the Estonian government began to agitate for an EU commitment to supply Ukraine with 1 million rounds of 155-mm ammunition within a year. The EU as an institution was exceedingly reluctant to take on this task. Article 41.2 of the Treaty of Rome states that “Operating expenditure to which the implementation of this Chapter gives rise shall also be charged to the Union budget, except for such expenditure arising from operations having military or defence implications and cases where the Council acting unanimously decides otherwise”. Although the Article refers to “operations” rather than industrial activity, the European Commission has interpreted it as preventing the EU institutionally from spending on orders with the defence industry. Nevertheless, the Estonians correctly pointed out that with each European state making its own orders to industry, the orders were small, but, if combined, would potentially be large enough to make it commercially viable for companies to invest in expanded production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estonia’s diplomacy achieved its objective of galvanising a political realisation of the importance of key war materials. However, it did not resolve the industrial problem. The EU, unable to fund defence procurement under its own interpretation of its mandate, instead set about negotiating framework agreements with defence companies to produce rounds at a fixed price, through which member states could each spend. This was to turn multiple small orders into one large one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mechanism, while innovative, ultimately failed, for one simple reason: the companies had no idea how many rounds were going to be ordered. The price set, therefore, reflected the fact that companies might need to have capital to invest in scaling production, or might need to retain small production lines with significant overheads. The result was an agreed price point of €4,000 per round, which many member states viewed as too expensive and therefore continued to try to draw up contracts directly with companies. Member states also did not like the idea of funding an EU project that would place orders outside their own territory. The result was that from an ambition to deliver 1 million rounds in 12 months, the EU managed to contract through its framework agreements 40,000 to be made in the first year, and a further 40,000 the following year. With member states refusing to put money forward, the project was given political protection by member states counting their own purchased rounds as contributing to the 1-million objective, so that the EU claimed to deliver 500,000 rounds within a year. This reflects what was eventually delivered to Ukraine, but a large amount of this was purchased from the international market, and not from new production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sensitivities over spending among Ukraine’s international partners were exacerbated by Russia’s coercion of Europe by constraining energy supplies. Across the continent, as the cost of energy spiked, governments had to reallocate spending in their budgets to subsidise energy and to build new infrastructure to expand liquefied natural gas capacity. This put pressure on European treasuries during a period of economic stagnation. It also created a political problem. Although European publics were largely supportive of Ukraine, private polling across the continent tended to show that defence was not a top priority other than in states along NATO’s eastern flank. Politicians, therefore, largely saw the diversion of major spending from other portfolios to defence as a vote-loser, whereas gifting stores or diverting existing defence expenditure to support Ukraine was a vote-winner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EU members were politically sensitive to price, and therefore spurned the European Defence Agency’s framework agreements. However, confidence in their direct contracting proved limited. Early in the conflict, arms companies suggested that with modest investment, they could significantly boost output of shells. When these proposals were examined, however, it was discovered that the speed at which companies could expand production was far lower than originally anticipated. To understand why, it is necessary to outline what is required to produce a shell. A shell must have its casing forged, be filled with high explosive and have a fuze added. In general, forging and fuze production can be expanded quite easily. Filling is more complicated. A shell is filled with high explosive in a temperature-controlled environment, where the temperature is slowly lowered so that the explosive in a batch of shells is set in an even manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most filling facilities were not working at capacity at the beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. However, each type of shell uses the same infrastructure. Thus, companies quoted a capacity in response to government enquiries. However, orders made for either 155-mm, 105-mm, 122-mm or 152-mm howitzer shells, or 120-mm or 125-mm tank rounds, or 120-mm, 81-mm or 82-mm mortar bombs, suddenly took up the available filling capacity for other orders. When filling capacity hit a ceiling, the challenge in expanding production became regulatory: more locations needed to be certified to handle high explosives. Despite ministries of defence perceiving the urgency, the need to handle such matters with alacrity was not felt across government departments. These issues, however, were teething problems compared with the supply chain challenges that subsequently emerged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many arms companies, when approached by governments, quoted what was feasible in terms of output from their own production facilities. But this assumed a ready supply of raw materials. With small orders across Europe, manufacturers of high explosive and, more importantly, explosive propellants, had consolidated into a small number of suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There had been limited demand for highly enriched nitrocellulose, as the precursor for propellent powders, for decades. Suddenly, demand far exceeded supply. This had several consequences. The cost of explosive energetics rose steeply and drove up the price per shell. Prior to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, 155-mm rounds cost between $800 and $3,000 (the higher cost reflecting framework agreements where companies held cold production lines ready for government). This rose to $6,000–$8,000 per round. At the same time, Russia had fixed the price for 152-mm ammunition from its domestic industries at around $1,000. Furthermore, while a certain amount of nitrocellulose may have been available on the market, and companies could assess how many shells they could produce based on that amount, the fact that governments were contracting domestic manufacturers in isolation saw these companies bidding against each other for these supplies. Beyond inflated costs, this also meant that where a European defence manufacturer succeeded in increasing production, it was often at the expense of another European company, so that while governments across Europe invested in munitions production, output remained far below both the projections of the manufacturers and the requirement from Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major barrier to scaling the whole munitions enterprise was that key parts of it – especially nitrocellulose enrichment – had been offshored to China. In consequence, Western companies lacked not only the facilities and machinery, but also the skilled workforce to begin production. For industries, such as explosives production, where entry into the workforce required recruitment, potential vetting and a high level of sign-off from governments, private industry was again faced with the challenge of being asked to make investments in areas where the demand from government might be short lived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2024, European investment in munitions production had started to see results. Germany and the Nordic states, in particular, had increased their levels of output. But production nevertheless continues to be significantly below demand. Ukraine needs approximately 2.4 million 155-mm rounds a year to confidently hold its defence line. Between the US and Europe, Ukraine received approximately 1.6 million rounds in 2023 and 1.5 million in 2024, and the consequences can be measured in lost personnel, equipment and, eventually, terrain. European governments continue to scour the international market to make up the shortfall. And while diplomatic efforts to convince countries with relationships with Russia – including Serbia, Egypt and others – to arm Ukraine have yielded results, it is nevertheless embarrassing that this is proving easier than increasing domestic production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are four lessons that can be identified in this sorry story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, reflexive secrecy among NATO members – on production capacity for ammunition – has shielded democratic governments from accountability for a hollowing-out of the sector and limited the ability for coordination of production among allies, without significantly improving security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, governments have not questioned the resilience and depth of their supply chains. This has made it hard to anticipate the impact of large injections of capital into arms production in terms of the capacity to scale production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the chronic tendency to try to protect domestic manufacturing has driven intense competition among allies. This has meant investment was devalued, rather than used to encourage collaboration to maximise the efficiency of production across the continent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, a desire to run defence industries to sustain the industrial requirements of a war purely based on free-market economics without price controls – but in a heavily regulated sector – meant that governments maximised risk to investors, while also driving up costs on themselves. The resulting incentive structure was one that left private businesses lacking trust and unwilling to commit capital, and governments unable to provide certainty to investors as to whether regulation would be sufficiently flexible to meet the demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, European governments pursued a form of blasé-faire economics, in which they wanted the private sector to solve the problem without creating any incentives or a regulatory environment that would allow it to do so. The conclusions are that governments need to retain effective data on their supply chains, have robust plans for expanding production, cooperate proactively with allies to efficiently burden-share and be much more interventionist in the business to ensure appropriate outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;stockpiles-safety-and-obsolescence&quot;&gt;Stockpiles, Safety and Obsolescence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside failing to scale production of basic ammunition natures for three years while massively driving up the price of war materiel, European defence-industrial policy also failed to replenish stockpiles of precision weapons. The UK, for example, still has not replaced the man-portable weapons that it gifted to Ukraine in 2022, although it has signed contracts to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first reason for the failure to replenish precision weapons stocks is a consequence of the order profile within many precision weapons portfolios in Europe. Since the end of the Cold War, the anticipated expenditure rates of precision weapons have been low. Nevertheless, countries have wanted to maintain the competitiveness of their munitions. The approach has been to order a small production run of a given complex weapon, and then to contract the same business to develop a future and more-capable munition to be produced in similarly small quantities – often at smaller quantities owing to increasing costs. Thus, companies such as MBDA have been encouraged to design a weapon such as Stormshadow, build a specified number and then move to the design of future capabilities that keep pace with enemy defences, closing down the previous production line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consequence of these iterative improvements is that there is little emphasis given to retaining the capacity to manufacture more of the previous generation of capability. In the case of man-portable complex weapons production in the UK, this became evident when orders were placed to replenish stocks, only for the delivery schedule of new munitions to be set out to 2026. There were several reasons for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was the need to set up the production line and hire staff. But more consequential was the need to manage obsolescence. Because the original production had been concluded, some of the sub-components were no longer being produced, while the small numbers of components needed made re-establishing production of the sub-components uneconomical. This meant that the manufacturer had to redesign how to make the munition before it could set up new production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another reason for small order volumes is the carriage life of munitions. Over time, weapons degrade and this can reach a point when they are deemed to be insufficiently reliable to be depended on in combat. For this reason, most countries specify a lifespan for a munition after which it needs to be disposed of. This means that if a certain number of munitions are expected to be used, the purchase of any further munitions will not only be wasted but will also impose further costs in safely disposing of the munitions. Russia does not have this approach and continues to store extremely old munitions. In many cases, this has reduced their reliability. In others, where inspection has determined that the munitions are not in a condition for use, it has provided a base for refurbishment of munitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evidence suggests that the assessed lifespan of most Western munitions is considerably greater than is currently reflected in regulation. Not all countries certify weapons for the same period of time, but there is limited evidence to suggest that the countries that certify weapons for a longer period have correspondingly serious safety issues. Across NATO, there is sufficient evidence to extend the shelf life of a large proportion of munitions in some territories. Furthermore, there are conditions in which a munition is no longer suitable for its originally intended purpose. Weapons carried on aircraft, for example, can become fatigued because aircraft expose them to significant G-forces, temperature and pressure changes and therefore pose a flight safety risk if they are retained on aircraft weapon stations. However, Ukraine has demonstrated that many of these munitions can be usefully stockpiled and used in a ground-launched role. The result is that it should be possible to significantly increase both the size and lifespan of a stockpile in Europe simply by reassessing existing regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problems of obsolescence and small stockpiles were not confined to munitions. The UK, for example, initially gave Ukraine 14 Challenger 2 main battle tanks (MBT), out of a fleet of 227. This was despite the UK intending to upgrade only 148 Challenger 2 MBTs to the Challenger 3. In part, the reason for the tiny fleet being donated stemmed from shortages of spares packs so that a larger fleet would see availability diminish rapidly for both Ukraine and the UK. Again, many of the components of the spares packs were no longer being manufactured, such that new production had to be established.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the demand for armoured vehicles grew from across Europe, it became apparent that stockpiles of these vehicles were limited. This partly stemmed from a tendency to sell off old military surplus vehicles to private companies. In the UK, for example, the Treasury charged the military for the assessed depreciation in value of a given system held in storage. This meant that the armed forces were actively disincentivised by penalties from retaining equipment in stores. The tendency was therefore to pay for the removal of sensitive equipment and weapons from vehicles, and then to sell the hulls to private companies. In Belgium, this policy was followed in 2006 with the sale of the country’s fleet of Gepard self-propelled anti-aircraft guns for about €15,000–€20,000 each. However, in 2023, when the Belgian government wanted to donate these vehicles to Ukraine, the company was offering to sell the vehicles back to the Belgian government for a cost significantly in excess of €500,000. The company argued that, to be effective, the vehicles would need their electronics and, in particular, their radar repaired, and that as the targets they would be used against had changed and the old components were obsolete and no longer available, the radar should also be upgraded. Additionally, the contracts were sales, and not storage contracts, and so the company could increase costs reflecting the urgency of demand and it was its decision as to whether the vehicles were sold. The Belgian government therefore could not control the timeline of retrieving the equipment from storage. No agreement was reached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other issues that constrained the acceleration of expanding production were export controls and intellectual property (IP). To continue with the example of the Gepard, ammunition for the weapon was scarce as it had been withdrawn from service in most European operators in the 2000s. Switzerland had produced the ammunition, but, as a neutral country, it did not grant permission for its use in Ukraine. This required production to be established outside Switzerland, further delaying the delivery of key systems. In this instance, the workaround was simple because the IP for producing 35-mm shells was available elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With other systems, IP posed more of a problem. For example, EU investment in expanded 155-mm production did not address a key challenge. States had deviated from Standard since the Cold War. So, whichever 155-mm systems were invested in risked favouring some countries with investment over others – giving them economies of scale in production and thus a long-term structural advantage in the market. Furthermore, if production capacity supported specific systems, it would structurally advantage their associated specialist ammunition producers. Even where obsolescence meant that key parts were no longer produced, and the number of systems being serviced made it uneconomical to restart production of the relevant spares, there was nevertheless reluctance in some quarters to share technical drawings or other IP with Ukraine, where workshops might begin making the spares necessary to keep the vehicles in the fight. The intricacies of the various debates over IP and permissions to release equipment are less important than the overall effect. When Europe needed to surge both supply to Ukraine and production of supporting systems, these complications slowed and introduced uncertainties into planning that had a tangible negative effect on equipment reaching Ukraine in a timely manner or at a reasonable cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it should be noted that regulation across Europe has significantly undermined the ability to rapidly develop systems to retain competitiveness. UAV and air defence development is one of the fastest-growing areas of competition in Ukraine. Both Ukraine and Russia have developed an insatiable demand for UAVs, which are employed on a wide range of tasks, from reconnaissance and deception, to both tactical and operational strike. Given that Europe has a large aeronautical industry – European states have extensive experience in manufacturing UAVs, and access to many of the supply chains to obtain the relevant components – this is an area where European states should have had a significant advantage in mobilising to meet demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most UAV development, however, although often drawing on expertise from across Europe, has been in Ukraine. The reasons for this largely relate to price and regulation. Most European states strictly regulate airspace and expect UAVs to be approved for operation by civil and military aviation authorities. The actual regulations are often more permissive. However, at the beginning of the war in Ukraine, militaries were extremely conservative in this area. The view in many militaries was that while they might have the authority to sign off on risk, if they did so and something went wrong, their permissions would be curtailed, threatening their mission. Across Europe, ministries of defence were largely prepared to suffer mission failure as long as they achieved procedural success. This speaks to wildly inappropriate career incentives in the civil service and militaries within these government departments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been consequences of tight regulation for UAV manufacturers. They have faced the need to design a UAV, and then to keep the production capacity and engineers employed throughout the testing and evaluation period, after which they might receive a contract – probably for a small number of platforms since European militaries are not losing them at comparable rates to the Ukrainian military. Since the UAVs supplied to Ukraine would often fail the regulatory hurdles for adoption into NATO forces, the equipment supplied to Ukraine could not be sold back into European militaries, but instead has had to go through significant subsequent modification. The result was often a 10-fold increase in cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although not a UAV project, the same factors meant that a £20-million contract to deliver a capability to Ukraine came with an estimated cost of £200 million to bring the same system into service with the British Army in comparable numbers. In the UAV space, it is not uncommon for a platform that would cost £2,500 if manufactured for Ukraine to cost between £8,000 and £16,000 if made for the British military. The consequence of this is that European governments – while investing heavily in capability development for the Ukrainians – have not seen that investment drive a parallel modernisation of their own forces. This has, in the longer term, created a divergence of interests between money spent on Ukraine and money spent on force modernisation. But the reason for that divergence is largely regulatory and could be closed with effective policy. Necessary changes include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A reappraisal of electromagnetic spectrum legislation and flight safety regulation to prioritise enabling the military and experimental capabilities, especially in specified geographic areas around military testing sites.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A reduction in support for defence venture capital and an increase in support available to scale ventures that have a proven track record.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alterations to the budgeting for military units to encourage the stockpiling of equipment and the building up of equipment reserves.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An audit of ammunition life, handling procedures and risk management to simplify the stockpiling, storage and handling of munitions, and to align regulation of NATO members.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The examination of the terms of reference appointing staff to oversee programmes so that authority to take risk rests with individuals who are being assessed on the effect they achieve against objectives, rather than their adherence to existing policy; if the trajectory of existing policy is towards mission failure, they should be obligated to change the policy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, therefore, looking at stockpiling and regulation across Europe reveals the reality that militaries are not rewarded or resourced to maintain large stockpiles of equipment. Governments pursue outsourcing to a degree that gives them an inability to control the timelines on access to stockpiles or reserves of equipment. The rules on stockpiling also contribute to a tendency to accept obsolescence entering the supply chains for critical systems, impeding their reintroduction into service. Moreover, safety regulations based on projected degradation – despite real-world data to the contrary – significantly increase the cost to European states of both storing and manufacturing critical defence materiel. Preparing Europe for an industrial war, therefore, requires a re-examination of the incentives on these matters, and, in particular, consideration of how those incentives manifest when action must be taken quickly to achieve mission success. The inadequacy of the current architectures speaks for itself. Three years into the largest security threat to Europe since the Second World War, European NATO still cannot meet the basic defensive needs of one country under war conditions. A great many officials will make excuses for the individual failings outlined in this paper. There is – it seems – always a list of reasons for making the wrong decisions. The question that Europe must answer is how it can ensure that it does not find itself in this position again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-ukraine-the-start-up-war-machine&quot;&gt;III. Ukraine: The Start-Up War Machine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s industrial response to Russia’s full-scale invasion is vitally important to evaluating the industrial balance of the conflict. However, this cannot be fully understood without a brief appreciation of the condition of Ukraine’s defence enterprises prior to the invasion, where there was both latent capacity and systemic decay. This chapter therefore begins with an overview of the post-Soviet legacy of Ukraine’s defence industries, before examining efforts after 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;dismemberment-of-an-inheritance&quot;&gt;Dismemberment of an Inheritance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1991, a significant part of the Soviet military-industrial complex was in present-day Ukraine. It consisted of more than 3,594 enterprises and scientific organisations that produced military and dual-purpose products, with a total of about 3 million personnel. Almost 700 enterprises, including 205 industrial associations and 139 scientific and industrial organisations, with a total of 1.45 million personnel, were directly engaged in the production of military products. Ukrainian scientific research institutions were involved in a high proportion of Soviet fundamental and applied scientific research in the field of security and defence. Ukraine produced intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) (including the SS-18 Satan), aircraft carrier cruisers (including the nuclear-powered super aircraft carrier Ulyanovsk), cargo planes (including the world’s largest An-225 and An-124), main battle tanks (the T-64 and T-80), air-to-air missiles, anti-tank missile complexes and a long list of other hi-tech weapons and military equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of Ukrainian enterprises servicing defence declined rapidly after the fall of the Soviet Union. The number of defence-related factories declined by more than 50% by 1993, and there was a massive reduction in orders. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Ukraine not only stopped buying new weapons for a time, but also became the object of forced demilitarisation, during which weapons and military equipment were destroyed or even transferred to Russia at the expense of Western partners. Ukraine renounced 176 ICBMs (130 SS-19s and SS-24s), about 2,000 strategic nuclear warheads and about 4,000 tactical nuclear warheads. Demilitarisation also affected conventional weapons. As part of the Nunn–Lugar programme, for example, in the late 1990s, Ukraine transferred part of its fleet of strategic bombers to Russia: eight Tu-160 bombers; three Tu-95MS bombers; and 19 Tu-22M3 bombers. Russia was also given 581 Kh-55 cruise missiles with a range of 2,500–3,500 km and 386 Kh-22 cruise missiles with a range of up to 600 km.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, it is these strategic bombers that Russia is using to launch missile strikes on Ukraine. To understand how significant the Ukrainian contribution was, it is worth noting that according to experts’ estimates, today Russia has no more than 60 Tu-22M3s, of which only half are in a state of combat readiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the mid-1990s to the early 2000s, Ukraine was also forced to destroy 60 Tu-22Ms of various modifications – nine Tu-160s and 21 Tu-95MS – and 487 Kh-55 cruise missiles. In fulfilment of disarmament obligations to the US, 132 mobile operational-tactical missile complexes (Elbrus) with a flight range of up to 300 km, and 185 ballistic missiles were decommissioned. In 2012, S-200B air defence systems, with a range of up to 250 km, were withdrawn from service. The formal reason was that these complexes could potentially use missiles with a special nuclear warhead to destroy group targets. Under the terms of its cooperation with NATO, Ukraine also carried out the systematic destruction of its own conventional ammunition, light weapons and even small arms. Since 2006, 133,000 tonnes of ammunition, 1,000 portable anti-aircraft missile systems, and 1.5 million units of small arms have been destroyed in the course of NATO’s Partnership for Peace and its provisions on the destruction of “excess ammunition”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;preserving-skills-and-capacity&quot;&gt;Preserving Skills and Capacity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian military, meanwhile, was also diminished. The Ukrainian defence industry lost the large internal orders that had previously underpinned its capacity. Instead, legacy Ukrainian industry focused on servicing the lifecycle of weapons and military equipment inherited from the Soviet Union, with new investment focused on modernisation rather than replacement. For the majority of Ukrainian defence enterprises, the only way to survive was to find foreign customers in the market for Soviet legacy arms. In a short time, Ukraine entered the list of the world’s largest arms exporters and had significant success, including in competition with Russia. One example of its competitiveness was the contract for the supply of 320 T-80UD tanks to Pakistan from 1996 to 1999. To fulfil the order, the Malyshev plant increased production to 110 tanks each year, just a fraction of the company’s total capacity to produce up to 900. At that time, the entire budget of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence for the procurement of weapons allowed only for the purchase of a couple of dozen tanks per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the fall of the Soviet Union, the number of people in the defence industry declined rapidly, while approximately 95% of all products of Ukraine’s defence industry were exported. Until 2014, a significant proportion of these exports also went to Russia, which was never able to completely replace Ukrainian products. Even after the start of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine in 2014 – when Ukraine stopped military-technical cooperation with Russia – Moscow remained dependent on the supply of a number of important elements. Of note are the Ukrainian Motor Sich engines for Russian helicopters and airplanes and gas turbine engines for Russian warships produced by the enterprise Zorya-Mashproekt in Mykolaiv. In addition, Ukraine refused to continue servicing the Russian SS-18 Satan intercontinental missile systems, which were developed and produced in Ukraine at the Yuzhmash enterprise, and the SS-19 Stiletto, whose control system was developed in Kharkiv by the Hartron enterprise. Some experts believe that Russian aggression against Ukraine is partly due to Russia’s need to regain control over the Ukrainian defence-industrial complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paradoxically, the need for Russia to purchase products from the Ukrainian defence industry was one of the factors that allowed this industry to survive until 2014, and the Russian aggression that began in 2014 became an impetus for its subsequent development. After the Russian invasion of Crimea and, later, Donbas, Ukraine faced a de facto embargo on the sale of Western weapons to it, which lasted in various forms until 2018, when the US government finally approved the export of lethal weapons to Ukraine. Under such conditions, the Ukrainian defence industry became almost the only source of increasing the capabilities of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. As in the case of Russia after 2022, initially Ukraine’s main emphasis was not on the production of new items, but rather on the restoration and modernisation of equipment that was in long-term storage. As of September 2014, when active hostilities in Donbas were suspended by the start of the Minsk negotiation process, Ukraine restored 12,000 units of military equipment, a significant part of which was restored by the repair units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In the following years, the main priorities of the Ukrainian defence industry became the replacement of Russian components necessary for the maintenance of existing weapons and military equipment, as well as rearmament due to the development of new systems. As of the beginning of 2021, Ukraine managed to replace at least half of all Russian components, and start serial production of a whole series of systems that were to prove their high efficiency during the full-scale invasion. In particular, these included the Neptune anti-ship missile complex, the Bogdan self-propelled howitzer and the Bukovel electronic warfare complex. However, this still leaves Ukraine dependent on sourcing some components from the international market, or from Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the start of Russia’s invasion in February 2022, the Ukrainian defence industry consisted of more than 300 enterprises, institutions and organisations involved in the development and production of weapons and military equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The total number of workers in the defence industry was more than 250,000. Most of these enterprises were state-owned, and most of them were managed through the Ukroboronprom state corporation, which included 118 of the largest defence industry enterprises of Ukraine. The enterprises of Ukroboronprom were engaged in: aircraft construction and aircraft repair; production of high-precision weapons and ammunition; production and repair of armoured vehicles; production of radar, electronic warfare and communication systems; and shipbuilding. The Ministry of Strategic Industries was responsible for the formation of the state military-industrial policy, which covers the activities of both state-owned and private enterprises of the defence industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;redirecting-the-enterprise&quot;&gt;Redirecting the Enterprise&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the Ukrainian defence industry had wide-ranging structural issues in terms of investment in facilities, its ability to generate revenue for investment from government contracts and limited access to international partnerships, the fact that the state had so much control over it proved significant during the initial transition to war. Ukraine did not implement formal industrial mobilisation. The share of the Ukrainian budget directed to the development of the defence-industrial complex and the expansion of production capacities was also much more modest than Russia’s. In 2022, only $60 million was allocated for these purposes. This rose to $300 million in 2023 and $1.2 billion in 2024. These funds were insufficient to either establish significant industrial concerns from scratch, or incentivise independent market actors. However, because Ukraine had large existing enterprises over which the state had control, these funds could go directly into restarting production. The presence of a large number of existing enterprises, as well as hundreds of thousands of qualified engineers and workers, whose jobs had previously been sustained by defence exports, was extremely important. They made it possible to provide immediate repair and maintenance to the Armed Forces of Ukraine for the country’s own and captured military equipment, as well as to establish repair and maintenance of Western equipment, and support and increase the production of ammunition and other weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite modest investments, Ukraine managed to significantly increase the production of weapons at existing enterprises. Moreover, it launched new ones during the first two and a half years of the war. The production of weapons and military equipment in Ukraine tripled in 2023, and, according to then Minister of Strategic Industry Oleksandr Kamyshyn, should have grown on a similar trajectory throughout 2024. In autumn 2022, the production of 152-mm artillery shells, used in the Soviet self-propelled howitzers Akatsiya, Msta-S and Hyacinth-S, began in Ukraine for the first time. In September 2024, Ukraine disclosed that it was producing 155-mm projectiles used in NATO artillery systems in Ukraine. This became possible thanks to the transfer of a licence for the production of these projectiles by the Norwegian government, and the provision of relevant machines by another state. According to Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, every second piece of ammunition used in the combat zone, as of October 2024, was produced in Ukraine. This applies not only to artillery shells, but also to mortar bombs of 82-mm and 120-mm calibres, the serial production of which was established by Ukroboronprom and Ukrainian private companies together with partners from NATO countries. The cost of ammunition produced at Ukrainian enterprises is also significantly lower than prices on the world market. NATO buys 155-mm shells for $4,000–$8,000, whereas Ukrainian shells of the same calibre cost about $1,500. Ukraine, however, suffers from challenges in scaling the production of charges, just as in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has found the development and expansion of indigenous missile production more challenging. Prior to the full-scale invasion, the main effort was the restoration of tactical-operational missile complex “Tochka-U”. There was also ongoing work to develop a coastal defence cruise missile P360 Neptune as part of the Ukrainian navy’s strategy of coastal defence. This project was accelerated after the full-scale invasion to protect Ukraine’s coastline, which led to a successful engagement in April 2022 against the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet, the cruiser Moskva. Subsequent work was undertaken to modify the Neptune to engage land targets. The capability that emerged had a functional range of 400 km with a 350-kg warhead, compared with the 200-kg warhead of the original anti-ship missile. This “land-Neptune” was used successfully against a number of Russian targets in Crimea and the oil terminal of the Kavkaz port in Russia. A longer-ranged variant of Neptune has since been developed, known as “Long-Neptune”, with a reported range of 1,000 km. In some respects, the return on investment for this programme is quite impressive. Only $40 million was spent on the development of the entire RK-360MC complex, including the cruise missile, command post, launchers, and transport and charging vehicles. At the same time, limited funds and restrictions on access to components have significantly limited Ukraine’s ability to scale the output of such programmes. Ukraine has pursued a number of parallel defence programmes, including for ballistic missiles, and a range of jet-powered one-way-attack UAVs and cruise missiles. Although production of these systems collectively is currently small, it is anticipated that the output of these systems will increase significantly in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The significance of these efforts to the outcome of the war is evidenced by the resources Russia has devoted throughout the conflict in targeting the Ukrainian defence industry with long-range strike. As a result of attacks on defence enterprises during the full-scale invasion, at least 100 workers have died. To identify the locations of defence production, Russian special services actively used the shortcomings of the openness of Ukrainian registers. Such shortcomings allowed them to identify the addresses of production premises, as well as the names of managers and owners of enterprises. To reduce the threat, from the first days of the invasion, Ukraine actively used dispersion and organised the production process in such a way as not to accumulate significant volumes of finished products and components in one place. There was a protracted debate over the relocation of production facilities to hardened and subterranean structures. Early in the war, dispersion was preferred to reduce the disruption of output. However, following Russia’s increasingly intensive strikes throughout 2024, the government is now actively investing in the construction of protected locations for defence manufacture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;harnessing-private-investment&quot;&gt;Harnessing Private Investment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Ukroboronprom and its subordinate enterprises have had success in expanding the production of critical weapons systems and developing key classes of complex weapons, the concentration of the defence industry under government ownership has been criticised within Ukraine. It is widely argued that the government was not able to invest in emerging technologies such as UAVs to properly enable their development. The restrictions on profit margins for sales to the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence prior to the full-scale invasion also limited the capital available to invest. Nevertheless, at the start of the invasion, a large number of Ukrainian private companies sought to transition their activities to defence production and, in the initial phases, were not especially motivated by profit. When in 2022 it became clear that UAVs were a transformative capability for reconnaissance and strike, Ukraine also found that it could not source enough robust UAVs from the international market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, an indigenous manufacturing ecosystem emerged. Although the UAV manufacturing ecosystem in Ukraine comprises more than 120 companies, it may be subdivided into three broad categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first tier are companies with the technical expertise to design and produce highly effective UAVs and to update them to remain effective in a contested electromagnetic environment. There are, in effect, fewer than 15 such enterprises and they often have close relationships with particular units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. This enables rapid testing, evaluation and therefore refinement of capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second tier contains companies that can design and produce simple UAVs that are moderately effective. Companies in this tier can also produce UAVs designed by the more capable enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third tier consists of companies that can replicate simpler successful designs but are not able to design effective UAVs. This comprises the bulk of enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of entities in this ecosystem drives an extremely fast adaptation cycle. However, it is also quite inefficient in terms of the speed that it can scale a given capability. The failure to consolidate many of the lower-tier enterprises means that there is a higher-than-necessary overhead cost for output. Nevertheless, output of UAVs has climbed month-on-month so that Ukraine now produces more than 100,000 UAVs, of all types, per month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the UAV enterprise is the most widely promoted, it is not the only area of private defence innovation. Another good example is the distributed air defence enterprise, the backbone of which is the Sky Fortress sensor system, which uses distributed microphones across Ukraine to detect and track the acoustic signature of aerial targets transiting Ukrainian territory and thereby provide live tracking for the coordination of air defence groups. The key part of this system is its ability to accumulate the acoustic data in real time and undertake the algorithmic analysis of the acoustic data. The initial development of this system was achieved at a cost of about $5 million. The scaling of the system was achieved by using commercially available sensors and bearers so that parts of the system could be maintained and updated quickly and cheaply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private companies have also begun to emerge in the production of legacy military systems, including armoured vehicles, artillery systems and even missiles. In 2024, the Ukraine’s private company KZVV began to produce 15 Bohdan self-propelled artillery systems of 155-mm calibre each month. Such levels exceed France’s monthly production of the CAESAR wheeled howitzer. In sum, as of 2024, Ukraine’s defence-industrial complex, together with private companies, covers 500 enterprises, employs 300,000 personnel, and is an important element of the Ukrainian economy. In 2023, of the 4.9% increase in Ukrainian GDP, 1.5 percentage points came from the defence industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, a lack of funds remains the main challenge for Ukraine’s defence industries. Of the $40 billion in Ukraine’s defence budget for 2024, $30 billion was spent on salaries and other payments to military personnel, and only $6 billion was assigned to the purchase of weapons. At the same time, the lack of long-term contracts with the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence, or special government bank interest compensation programmes (as introduced in Russia), have made it impossible to attract bank funds for crediting operations of the defence-industrial complex. The government attempted to resolve this problem in November 2024, when it adopted a programme of preferential lending to defence enterprises at a rate of 5% per annum. Although this is a step in the right direction, the size of the loans (about $2 million for working capital up to three years and about $10 million for investment projects) will not meet the problem of underfinancing of the industry. The Ministry of Strategic Industries continues to assess a significant level of slack capacity in Ukraine’s industries owing to a lack of finance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is likely that foreign purchases of defence materiel from Ukrainian defence enterprises or joint ventures are the key to addressing this issue. An example of the former approach was the Danish government’s decision in early 2024 to finance the production of 18 Bohdan self-propelled howitzers, which could subsequently be gifted to the Armed Forces of Ukraine. They were manufactured and handed to the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence two months after the contract was signed. In September 2024, the Danish defence minister signed a further agreement with his Ukrainian counterparts for an additional $630 million of investment under this scheme. It is worth noting that most of this amount, almost $440 million, will be financed by Russian assets frozen in Denmark. In October, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence announced that Lithuania plans to finance the production of the Ukrainian rocket-drone Palyanytsia for $10 million. At the beginning of November 2024 Norway also signalled its intention to start purchasing weapons for the Armed Forces of Ukraine from Ukrainian manufacturers. Since September 2024, Ukrainian manufacturers have also been invited to tenders held for weapons purchases by the UK and Latvian ministries of defence. Financing the Ukrainian defence industry is important to ensure jobs and the stability of the Ukrainian economy in the event of a ceasefire or similar pause in high-intensity fighting, and will reduce what may otherwise be required in financial aid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The model of a joint venture has significant additional long-term benefits. First, it means that Western governments can order from their own industrial manufacturers. However, the cost of production can be driven down by producing elements of a system in Ukraine. It also means that systems with sensitive elements – such as guidance units – for which countries may be reluctant to transfer IP, can be added into weapons where much of the body and other sub-systems are manufactured in Ukraine. Finally, there is the opportunity for this to create a bridge from Soviet legacy systems to Western systems, allowing Ukrainian joint enterprises to compete with Russia for contracts around the world. A good example here is projects relating to air defence. Due to the shortage of ammunition for the Soviet air defence systems, which remain in service with the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the Buk and Kub systems are being adapted so that they can use AIM-7 Sparrow anti-aircraft missiles. NATO has a significant interest in maintaining large-scale production of air-to-air missiles because of the centrality of airpower in its way of war. Moreover, this project is extremely important because it shows how cooperation between Ukrainian and Western defence industries can find solutions that allow Russia’s role in the market for the maintenance of Soviet systems to be replaced, even where Russia has a complete monopoly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, therefore, Ukraine has been able to significantly increase its defence-industrial output with the assistance of its international partners. There were two critical enablers for this expansion: the large pool of talent available because of the previously high level of defence-industrial production from the 1990s; and the significant level of government control of the defence-industrial sector, which allowed for the rapid pivot of activities. Access to capital, however, was a major constraint on defence production and innovation prior to, and during, the full-scale invasion. The question is whether market power among Ukraine’s international partners can be harnessed to expand the production capacity of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparing the Russian, European and Ukrainian defence-industrial response to the 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine reveals important lessons on how to effectively translate investment into defence-industrial output. These lessons relate to financing, the amount of latent capacity, the level of government control, and the regulatory environment of the products that emerge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On preparation, one of the clear differences between Russia, Europe and Ukraine is that Moscow had a mobilisation plan and stockpiles from which to draw. The mobilisation plan included legislative changes. The Russian industrial-mobilisation process was largely successful. Ukraine lacked such a clear plan but had many of the same mechanisms in place due to its Soviet legacy. It was therefore able to implement a level of industrial mobilisation, albeit at a slower rate. European states either had no plan or did not activate it. Nor did they have the data to rapidly develop and execute a plan. This lack of preparedness meant that European states were slow and took many false steps. The lesson is simple: NATO members need industrial annexes to their national defence plans and these should be deconflicted between members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contrast in government involvement in military-industrial processes is also important. In Russia and Ukraine, the government retained an extremely high level of ownership over defence enterprises, which allowed them to be highly responsive to government direction. In the US, the law allows the government to direct companies to service the defence industries, and key areas such as ammunition production remain part of the Department of Defense. These arrangements have made it possible to significantly expand output. Other countries such as France, where the government retains significant control over defence industries, have also largely succeeded in meeting planned output increases – with an increase in production of artillery systems and a steady increase in shell production – although their plans were not especially ambitious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of Europe, however, the market has proven a very poor driver in response to the conflict. The incentives of the market – increased profits – are not necessarily aligned with maximising the volume of materiel produced for a given level of investment. Moreover, governments did not incentivise private industries to behave constructively. The refusal to give long-term orders or to consolidate orders, for example, made it very difficult for defence companies to justify the risk of expanding capacity rather than extending existing order books. The lack of government involvement in much of the supply chain also meant that governments lacked the data to understand where expanded capacity would most effectively enable increased production. Orders for shells without investment in special chemistry, for example, drove up prices more than it increased output. At the same time, governments did not create or enact legal mechanisms that would have allowed them to impose a sense of mission on defence industry. Given that governments are the customers of these enterprises, and there is limited investment beyond government, it is evident that the state did not exercise the leverage it could have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latent capacity is also relevant for industrial readiness. In Russia, there was significant latent capacity in its defence industries: civilian industries were pushed into the defence sector. In Ukraine, there was similarly significant underuse of the defence-industrial base prior to the full-scale invasion. More importantly, both countries had significant reserves of trained scientists and engineers with experience in the defence sector who could be brought back into the industry. This was existentially important to Ukraine. Across Europe, there is a large pool of talent in these areas, but the lack of mobilisation left a significant body that was not related to defence. Moreover, with very few countries producing defence materiel throughout the supply chain, there was significant unevenness in the availability of trained personnel. It has been especially difficult to attract workers to areas such as special chemistry, an area from which Europe divested for a long period. Thus, even where companies have tried to expand, they have struggled to find the right talent. The main impact of this has been to extend the lead times on capital, which has led to increased outputs. A key question for Europe’s readiness for a major conflict, therefore, is to understand the areas where it has surplus talent in one country that is needed in another, or where there is simply a lack of skills and it is worth investing to train personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The financial landscape also differed. Russia has made massive investments in the defence industries, going well beyond the funds allocated to defence within the state budget. Such investments represent the partial mobilisation of the economy to a war footing, which has allowed Russia to significantly expand and modernise its defence-industrial enterprise, although this is at the expense of the rest of the economy, including critical sectors such as education and health. Much of the investment has gone into expanding production facilities, as up-front costs. It is anticipated that, in 2026, funds will be redistributed to other ministries, but this will not reduce the level of orders placed with the defence-industrial enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine had both similar latent capacities and high levels of state control of the sector. However, the government did not move to a full mobilisation footing. The lack of funds for the sector has also remained a major limiting factor in the expansion of critical defence enterprises and the scaling of production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Europe, in aggregate, large sums of money were made available. However, the investments in each country represent very modest increases in investment, such that they have not stimulated a proportional increase in defence manufacture. Relatively small, one-off orders have generally not incentivised the defence sector to expand its production capacity. Investment has also overwhelmingly focused on products rather than fundamentals in the supply chain, such that investment has driven competition in the higher tiers of the supply chain and increased cost, rather than expanded output. The profile of investment, therefore, has been poorly suited to enabling an expansion of defence-industrial output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European countries should not embark on a level of mobilisation at the expense of the wider economy, as pursued in Russia, and the prioritisation of R&amp;amp;D spending in many European enterprises has undoubtedly produced highly capable weapons. However, NATO does emphasise the importance of deterrence to prevent the outbreak of war. Deterrence is psychological. In this context, the European response to the invasion may be deemed a failure: Russia assessed the policies that were pursued and deemed them inadequate. It is worth emphasising that a relatively modest increase in expenditure across NATO could have had a significant effect on Russian calculations, if that money translated into tangible outputs. At present, the debate on budget inputs across NATO is largely divorced from the debate about military outputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it is worth comparing regulation. In Russia, regulation has proven extremely lax for the storage of ammunition, working conditions and quality control. This has led to munitions striking Russia rather than Ukraine and stores being detonated by small numbers of low-yield munitions, and has arguably made defence-industrial output less efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Ukraine, the freedom to test equipment under battlefield conditions as well as easy access to training areas has enabled rapid R&amp;amp;D for both Ukrainian and European defence enterprises. At the same time, failures of security at enterprises have exposed them to significant risk from the Russian special services, while information handling and the approach to IP during the war has arguably reduced the willingness for collaboration from international partners, and the availability of investment capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Europe, the general approach to regulation has been detrimental to increased defence production. In the first instance, restrictions on access to testing and evaluation facilities have led to large numbers of systems being produced that do not meet requirements. This is only discovered at a late stage. Where effective systems have been procured, the risk that businesses must take on in developing them before they are certified has hugely increased costs. Planning laws and other processes have also increased cost and reduced the speed at which defence enterprises can expand. Moreover, few countries have demonstrated a joined-up approach to such issues in government so that the UK, for example, has yet to achieve its announced ambition of expanding 155-mm artillery manufacture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the greatest difference, and the most important area of policy consideration, is that Russia and Ukraine ultimately have a single authority responsible for the enterprise. In Europe, each country is too small to be self-sufficient but there is no multinational coordination of the defence industry. Member states have opposed the EU playing such a role. NATO lacks authorities and information. As competitors, European defence enterprises tend to be very secretive about their capacity with both other governments and other companies. The result is that there is neither efficiency nor the data and authorities anywhere to rationalise the process. Coherence of multinational supply chains is in the interests of all European NATO members if they need to transition to war. So, whether in NATO or the EU, the establishment of an entity with this responsibility seems critical. If Europe wishes to deter war, it must demonstrate that it is developing the capacity to wage it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past several years, ransomware attacks have become a persistent national security threat. Attacks against hospitals, schools and businesses of all shapes and sizes have normalised what should be intolerable: organised cybercriminals regularly disrupting and extorting victims, causing misery in the process and undermining the UK economy and society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite some operational success and increased international collaboration against ransomware criminals, significant policy interventions have not been forthcoming. The UK government, like many other national governments, has received criticism for its lack of progress on ransomware. In December 2023, for instance, the parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy published a report that argued: “If the UK is to avoid being held hostage to fortune, it is vital that ransomware becomes a more pressing political priority, and that more resources are devoted to tackling this pernicious threat to the UK’s national security.” Much of this criticism has been directed towards the Home Office, which is the lead department for the government’s counter-ransomware strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After several years of development, the UK government has launched a consultation on a set of legislative proposals that aim to reduce the impact of ransomware on the UK and increase the amount of intelligence available to operational agencies on incidents and payments. The consultation has three main proposals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A targeted ban on ransomware payments for regulated critical national infrastructure (CNI) sectors and the public sector.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A new ransomware payment prevention regime, which would require victims to acquire authorisation from the government before they can proceed with a ransom payment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A mandatory ransomware incident reporting regime.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation on these proposals closes in April 2025. If legislated in their current form, the proposals would significantly change the experience of UK ransomware victims and arguably represent the most consequential intervention by any national government on ransomware to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 25 February 2025, RUSI convened a half-day workshop to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the government’s proposals. Thirty-eight participants took part in the workshop. Most were senior stakeholders from industry, including chief information security officers representing CNI sectors, and senior managers and practitioners from law firms, incident response firms, cyber security vendors and cyber insurers. Additional participants were drawn from regulators, civil society, UK government and UK law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The half-day workshop was broken into three main sessions. In the first substantive session, a Home Office representative provided a brief overview of the proposals, which was followed by a moderated Q&amp;amp;A.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second session, the workshop participants were divided into three breakout groups. Each breakout room had the same task: to assess the proposals in relation to the government’s stated objectives. These are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;to reduce the amount of money flowing to ransomware criminals from the UK, thereby deterring criminals from attacking UK organisations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;to increase the ability of operational agencies to disrupt and investigate ransomware actors by increasing our intelligence around the ransomware payment landscape&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;to enhance the government’s understanding of the threats in this area to inform future interventions, including through cooperation at international level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final session focused on asking participants to discuss alternatives to the government’s proposals. Workshop participants also reflected on whether their perspectives on the proposals had changed following the breakouts, and if so, how. To facilitate candid discussion, the workshop was held on a non-attributable basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;proposal-1-payment-ban-for-public-sector-and-regulated-cni-providers&quot;&gt;Proposal 1: Payment Ban for Public Sector and Regulated CNI Providers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the ransomware challenge is the issue of incentives around ransom payments. Ransom payments sustain the ransomware business model. The high profit margins of ransomware have drawn more cybercriminals into the ecosystem and enabled operators to expand their capabilities. Although there is some evidence that the number of victims paying and the revenues generated fell in 2024 – likely due to the impact of law enforcement operations and increased organisational cyber resilience – ransomware remains lucrative for many operators and affiliates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over recent years, the question of whether to ban ransomware payments has become one of the thorniest and most contentious in cyber policy. Proponents of a ban argue that because payments perpetuate the criminal business model, banning them will remove the primary motivation for ransomware attacks. To date, policymakers in multiple countries have largely resisted these arguments due to opposition from industry, concerns about “revictimising” victims and uncertainty about the effectiveness of a ban.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK government has proposed a partial payment ban for ransomware. The ban will cover all public sector bodies and regulated owners and operators of CNI. The government’s logic for the ban is that removing the ability to monetise ransomware will make the UK public sector and CNI “unattractive propositions for ransomware attacks” and therefore deter criminals from targeting UK organisations. At present, the government has not committed to saying how the ban would be enforced or whether criminal or financial liabilities would be levelled against organisations that flout it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the workshop, participants were asked to assess the payment ban against the government’s stated aims, whether it was fair to victims, and what possible intended and unintended outcomes it could create. In general, participants were negative about the assumption that the proposed ban would have a significant impact on the volume of ransomware incidents in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although some participants agreed that the proposed ban would probably reduce the number of payments that would go to criminals, there was scepticism about whether this would represent a significant blow to the profitability of ransomware, given that UK victims probably represent only a single-digit percentage of global ransomware victims. Even more scepticism was expressed about the government’s assumption that the proposal would ultimately deter attacks against the UK public sector and CNI. This is because most ransomware operators are opportunistic, rather than seeking to target specific victims. A joint National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and National Crime Agency (NCA) 2023 white paper on ransomware explicitly assessed that “the majority of the initial accesses to victims are gained opportunistically and are not targeted against a particular organisation or business sector”. One participant argued that even if we assume ransomware operations are targeted, cybercriminals are unlikely to have a rigorous understanding of how the UK defines and regulates CNI. The possibility that the proposal has been developed based on a misguided assumption of how ransomware criminals operate led another workshop attendee to remark that the Home Office “has gone into this with one eye open”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some participants argued that the proposal could end up creating more harm than benefit for the UK if essential services experience sustained disruption or businesses are forced to declare bankruptcy because of the cost of business interruption. A particular concern among participants was the possibility that organisations with limited financial and technical resources to improve their cyber resilience – such as schools, local councils or small businesses – could be disproportionately affected by the proposed ban.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to mitigate this could be to ensure that more financial and/or technical support is made available for organisations and sectors covered by the proposed ban. Indeed, some participants viewed this as an essential precondition for implementing the ban. However, this would require a significant step change in how the government supports victims of ransomware and other cybercrimes. At present, the UK state provides very limited incident response or financial support for organisations affected by ransomware, even in the public sector. There is currently no suggestion in the consultation documents that the government intends to change its existing approach. Several workshop participants noted that this (and other aspects of the consultation) raised concerns that the proposals have been developed in a silo from other government departments and agencies responsible for cyber resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, participants were sceptical about the sustainability of a hardline ban. For instance, if a ransomware attack against a public sector or CNI entity presented a serious risk of threat to life should the ransom not be paid, the government would be put in the challenging position of deciding whether or not it should follow (or uphold) its own law. At this stage of the consultation, the government has declined to discuss the possibility of exemptions and thresholds. If a hardline ban is upheld, lives could be put at risk in extremis. If exemptions were created (pre-emptively or reactively), ransomware threat actors could use this as a rationale to insist that public sector and CNI victims can or should pay a demanded ransom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final theme of the workshop discussions on the proposed ban centred around compliance and enforceability. While there was a consensus that many organisations would comply with the ban, it was noted that some would seek ways around it. Several participants from incident response vendors and law firms, for instance, argued that some large, privately owned CNI providers would potentially try to divert ransom payments via offices in other jurisdictions or through subsidiaries. Other participants raised questions about effective compliance with the ban for organisations at the other end of the spectrum: SMEs. For instance, ensuring that SMEs in affected sectors are even aware of their obligations under the ban will require the government and regulators to put significant resources into awareness-raising initiatives and campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-takeaways-and-recommendations-for-the-government&quot;&gt;Key Takeaways and Recommendations for the Government&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the workshop discussions, the following key takeaways and recommendations were identified for the government on the proposed payment ban:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While there is an ethical case that UK taxpayer money should not be used to fund payments to criminals, there is considerable scepticism among industry stakeholders that the government’s proposal will reduce the impact of ransomware on the UK. The government should consider the argument that the ban will not achieve its objective of deterring ransomware attacks against the UK public sector and CNI. As part of this, the government should encourage ransomware threat intelligence specialists in the NCSC and NCA to provide private feedback on the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The government should develop incentives, as well as punishments, to ensure that the ban is fair and that organisations comply with it. This will likely involve expanding the types of financial and technical support available to victims of ransomware in affected sectors. There was a strong sense among workshop participants that a precondition for legislating a ban should be improving support available to affected SMEs and public sector organisations with smaller budgets or limited access to central government funding.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, if the government is committed to the ban, it should consider how to ensure that multinational companies or companies headquartered in other jurisdictions comply with the ban. Ultimately, this may rest on other countries following the UK’s lead and implementing their own bans. The possibility that some multinationals may circumvent the ban also highlights that its effectiveness may rely on internationalising it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;proposal-2-the-ransomware-payment-prevention-regime&quot;&gt;Proposal 2: The Ransomware Payment Prevention Regime&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present, British ransomware victims who are considering a prospective payment do not need to engage with government or law enforcement entities. Where a payment is ultimately made, neither the victim nor their third-party support needs to report this payment to any relevant public body; however, some do so on a voluntary basis. The Home Office believes that there is scope to engage with – and potentially influence – the ransomware victim journey, by requiring that ransomware victims engage with a suitable government entity when they are considering making a ransomware payment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this effect, the government is proposing a ransomware payment prevention regime, which would force UK organisations to engage with a vested authority to request authorisation before they can make a prospective ransomware payment. The vested authority – a proposed new 24/7 unit – would review the case and determine whether authorisation can be granted. During the workshop Q&amp;amp;A, Home Office officials suggested that an initial response would be provided to the victim organisation within a target 72-hour window. Such a payment authorisation regime would be the first of its kind – for ransomware payments – either in the UK or internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the workshop Q&amp;amp;A, Home Office representatives indicated that the decision to authorise (or not) would be based on sanctions risk (for instance, whether a payment could go to North Korean entities), possibly with the addition of other weighted factors. (At the time of writing, Home Office representatives have not outlined what these additional weighted factors might be.) Once authorisation was granted, the victim organisation would be able to take its authorisation certificate to its chosen ransomware payment intermediary and proceed with the payment. It is important to emphasise that under the proposals as currently worded, a ransomware payment by a UK-based organisation made without explicit authorisation would, in effect, be illegal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop highlighted that several aspects of the proposal require clarification. For instance, it is not clear whether a victim organisation would have the right to appeal a negative decision. It is also unclear how this law would interface with firms which have a multi-jurisdictional presence and which could, in theory, make a payment from outside the UK without liaising with the authorisation regime in the UK. The Home Office is reportedly aware of these issues and is considering them as part of ongoing internal deliberations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workshop participants were forthcoming and forthright in their views about this proposal. Perspectives were shared on: the degree to which the proposed authority could operate effectively; whether it is an appropriate use of resources; and whether there are risks of unintended consequences. On balance, views on the proposal were generally negative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerns were raised about whether the prospective authorisation unit could provide a clear response within a sufficiently rapid timeframe. Participants were worried that the unit could under-deliver on the 72-hour turnaround (for instance, during busy periods). Some participants also noted that, in their view, 72 hours was too slow. This highlights the diverging priorities of victim organisations and government in the event of a ransomware attack. The victim organisation, which may be in the initial phase of a severe forced crisis, will want to quickly develop an assessment of its options for containment and remediation. The payment of a ransom may be one option among others; in extremis, it may be the most expedient, the “least worst” or even the only option available. In contrast, the government’s priority – as an external observer – would be to not only assess the rationale and legality of the proposed payment, but also impose time delays on the victim’s decision-making, in order to counter a rushed decision to make a ransom payment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, participants recognised that if the government’s intention is to throw “grit” into the ransomware response ecosystem and “scare” victims into applying serious thought about whether or not they should pay a ransom, the proposal would partially achieve this. Previous research has highlighted that “taking time” in the aftermath of a ransomware incident can reduce a victim’s propensity to pay a ransom. Participants from the ransomware response ecosystem noted that from their experience, the added “nudge” of a government, regulatory or law enforcement agency becoming aware of a prospective payment may make some victim organisations less inclined to seriously explore a payment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants also felt that to make the proposal meaningful, the government would need to “stick its neck out” and provide clarity on what constitutes a sufficient sanctions check. At the moment, while there are some commonalities, ransomware sanctions check procedures vary between different firms. Participants suggested that the government could, by publishing clear guidance alongside the formation of the new unit, provide a legal benchmark and counter permissive interpretations of sanctions compliance that may be present among some industry actors. This would be a significant step change in the government’s approach to ransomware sanctions, as the current approach offloads all responsibility onto victims, insurers, payment brokers and financial institutions. At present, while sanctioned entities have almost certainly received payments, no sanctions enforcement has taken place in the UK – or indeed internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, some participants noted that they were sceptical that the UK government would actually provide clarity or take a position on sanctions checks. In their view, it was much more likely that the government would continue to offload responsibility onto industry. Nonetheless, the unit would presumably need to have access to its own sanctions data, an ability to make a judgement call, and a means of conveying its judgement in a meaningful way to a victim organisation. Participants noted that it was unclear whether government or private sector intelligence (or a combination) would be used to inform the authorisation decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants raised concerns about the ethics of the proposed law and unit, as the government could, in effect, “play God” and determine whether a business goes bankrupt due to a ransomware breach. While this hypothetical scenario assumes that a ransom payment would both be affordable and resolve the encryption/exfiltration issue, participants emphasised their disquiet that a government body should be able to make such a high-stakes decision about the future viability of a UK organisation that has been the victim of serious organised crime. Participants suggested that this potential risk could be more pronounced for SMEs, which they referenced as the “bread and butter” of the UK economy. A common phrase through the workshop was that where punitive measures are to be applied against victims of serious organised crime, the UK government should offer more “carrot” to accompany the “stick”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-takeaways-and-recommendations-for-the-government-1&quot;&gt;Key Takeaways and Recommendations for the Government&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The workshop suggested that there is probably considerable opposition to the proposed payment authorisation regime in parts of industry involved in ransomware response.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the proposed regime does go ahead, the Home Office should provide clarity on a number of aspects of its design and implementation. These include but are not limited to: appeal processes; type and levels of censure for non-compliance; rationale for authorisation and denial; and the role of loopholes, including payment organised outside of the UK. These are important elements that will define the success and failure of the proposed regime and therefore should be subject to additional public consultation at the earliest possible opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As with the other proposals, the government will need to dedicate considerable resources to raising awareness among SMEs about their obligations under the payment prevention regime. The government may well be underestimating the amount of resource required to raise awareness among SMEs, given their challenges with cyber security and general capacity for compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Home Office may want to give concerted thought as to whether the payment authorisation regime is the most effective means of achieving the government’s goals, and whether, at an estimated £17.3 million per annum, the new unit would present a cost-effective intervention against ransomware.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;proposal-3-a-mandatory-ransomware-incident-reporting-regime&quot;&gt;Proposal 3: A Mandatory Ransomware Incident Reporting Regime&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present, ransomware breach reporting in the UK is patchwork and ad hoc. In essence, multiple UK entities may receive voluntary reports from ransomware victims. Additionally, the voluntary nature of ransomware reporting means that victims may decide not to report their breach. They may also decide that the nature of their breach does not necessitate a report to the Information Commisioner’s Office (ICO), as data subjects may not be impacted. The lack of a singular catch-all entity to report to – and issues with synchronising existing reporting – means that it is not possible to map the scale and depth of ransomware incidents in the UK. To design and implement suitable interventions, it is necessary to be able to map the problem with sufficient accuracy. The current lack of reporting on ransomware attacks also hinders the ability of future victims to learn from the experiences of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Home Office is proposing a new mandatory reporting regime for ransomware incidents. Victims of ransomware would have an initial 72-hour window to report an incident after it has been discovered. The victim would then be expected to submit a full report within 28 days. This proposed reporting requirement would be in addition to existing requirements to report a data breach to the ICO and other relevant regulators. As one ex-law enforcement officer noted during the workshop, the UK does not typically have a policy of mandatory reporting of crime – although the UK’s Crime and Policing Bill, introduced to Parliament in February 2025, includes provisions to introduce a new statutory duty for professional child-support stakeholders to report suspected cases of child abuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the workshop Q&amp;amp;A, Home Office representatives noted that they are deliberating as to whether reporting should be threshold-based, and if so, what the threshold would be. The core purpose of the mandatory reporting regime would be to build the national UK situational awareness of ransomware, which, at present, is based on a patchwork of mandatory reporting to the ICO (and other regulators) and voluntary reporting to the NCSC and law enforcement (typically through Action Fraud).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the three proposals, the reporting regime was the most warmly received by workshop participants. Participants viewed it as the most cost-effective of the three proposed interventions. There was also a sense that it had the least risk out of the three proposals of causing or exacerbating harm to victims of serious organised crime or of displacement and unintended consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, there was also a pronounced sentiment in the workshop that mandatory reporting was a necessary precondition before the other proposals could be legislated – that is to say, in the absence of a clearer national picture about the scale and depth of ransomware incidence in the UK, proposals 1 and 2 are premature and are based on imperfect or even faulty impact assessments. Participants described the degree of the “known unknown” of the UK’s ransomware threat intelligence picture as more pronounced compared to other analogue or digital threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants emphasised that any mandatory reporting regime would need to be “low lift” for the victim organisation and empathetic to its circumstances at a time when it is in crisis and may not have a clear picture as to what has occurred. Participants noted that some organisations may not conduct a forensic investigation of the incident and may not be in a position to provide a detailed report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is often the case with discussions about public–private cyber threat intelligence sharing, some participants expressed a view that the channel of information should be two-way or quid pro quo; for instance, a victim organisation could be presented, after its initial report, with information about the type of ransomware which was used in its attack. This information could be used by the victim and its third-party support to inform forensics, remediation and recovery efforts. Research has highlighted that ransomware victims can feel that they report into a “black hole”, with limited or no tangible acknowledgement from the public entity that they report to. There is arguably an opportunity to support the formation of a more tangible feedback loop. To maximise the utility of gathered data, the Home Office – and wider government – should consider how the NCSC and the national, regional and local law enforcement community can be primed to best make use of the data to support victims, inform operational activity and bolster prosecutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, while the “displacement” effect or unintended consequences of a mandatory reporting regime are likely to be more limited than those relating to proposals 1 and 2, there may still be some ripple effects. Participants from the incident response sector emphasised that in “almost all” of their cases, the client would agree to voluntarily report the incident to law enforcement. This may include phone calls with police, site visits and so on. There is, however, a perception across government that ransomware incidents are significantly under-reported. Assuming participants spoke in good faith, it should be noted that their attendance may represent a selection bias: industry stakeholders who are willing to engage in person at an event relating to a government ransomware consultation may be more likely to encourage their clients to voluntarily report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the workshop highlighted that there is a potential risk that a mandatory reporting regime would reduce the flow of voluntary reporting, as ransomware victims may look to prioritise their mandatory reports and see this as replacing the voluntary ones. In principle, this may not be an issue; information about the incident would still be reaching central government and could filter through to the relevant regional and local law enforcement entities. However, possible consideration could be given to whether voluntary reporting brings informal benefits (either to the victim organisation, third parties or the government) that could be hindered by the introduction of mandatory reporting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, at present, the projected private and public familiarisation costs for the mandatory reporting regime are £970,000 and zero respectively. Depending on where the proposed reporting threshold eventually sits – and especially if smaller SMEs are included – thought should be given as to how this budget can be used most effectively and, if necessary, whether the budget should be increased to amplify reach across the UK economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-takeaways-and-recommendations-for-the-government-2&quot;&gt;Key Takeaways and Recommendations for the Government&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was a broad consensus among workshop participants that the UK’s ransomware reporting landscape is, at present, confusing, overlapping, and ineffective at developing a true national threat intelligence picture. If the views of workshop participants are a litmus test of vested stakeholders, a mandatory reporting regime may be regarded as having more support than the other proposals in the consultation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The government should consider that increasing data on incidents will not necessarily lead to more law enforcement interventions against ransomware threat actors, unless relevant agencies have more resources. Operationalising more intelligence on ransomware incidents and criminals will probably require a significant change in how cybercrime units are funded, particularly within the NCA.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Home Office should continue internal deliberation and provide clarity as soon as possible on the suggested thresholds and definitions for a prospective mandatory ransomware reporting regime. There may also be an opportunity to consider implementation of a twinned reporting mechanism for ransomware payments, where victims are mandated to inform the government if they have made payment. Basic reported information could include the original ransom demand, the ransom paid, the ransom note and the wallet details. This could be a lighter-touch way for the government to gather insights on ransomware payments – and “throw grit” into victim decision-making – without implementing a payment authorisation regime.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Home Office would also need to give concerted thought as to how mandatory reporting mechanisms would be harmonised with existing reporting. This includes reporting within the UK (to the ICO and other regulators) and outside the UK. It should also be noted that this deliberation about mandatory reporting takes place against the backdrop of severe criticism of the UK’s main cybercrime reporting entity, Action Fraud, which has been described by the parliamentary Justice Committee as “not fit for purpose”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
