  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China seeks to fully control Taiwan through three distinct but interrelated campaigns: persuasion, coercion, and compellence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;American policy’s focus on compellence marginalizes strategies that counter China’s persuasion and coercion campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China is more likely to achieve its goals through persuasion and coercion or a form of compellence, such as a blockade of the island, short of an amphibious invasion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The US must urgently rethink its defense of Taiwan so that it blocks all three roads to Chinese victory.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;executive-summary&quot;&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;US policy to defend Taiwan from Chinese aggression is overly focused on the risk that China will attempt an amphibious invasion of Taiwan. The US is not paying sufficient heed to Chinese efforts to regain control of Taiwan through persuasion and coercion, and US strategies to block a Chinese invasion may actually undermine efforts to block the persuasion and coercion roads to Chinese success. Xi Jinping likely prefers to accomplish his aims by means short of war. Those roads offer Xi the prospect of success at much lower risk and cost than fighting a war. The US must develop strategies to defeat these campaigns while deterring an invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing faces a difficult set of choices between military considerations and geopolitical dilemmas that US discussions of a putative Chinese invasion often fail to consider adequately. A militarily optimal Chinese invasion strategy would require that the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) strike American bases in Japan, a US treaty ally, and Guam, US territory, early in a conflict. Such attacks would bring the US fully into the war and expand the conflict to include Japan and other East Asian states. American strategists may worry that the US would not commit fully even after Guam was attacked or that the Japanese would try to remain neutral, but neither scenario is likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi has no reason to be confident in outcomes that would be optimal for China. Such attacks, after all, would be even more radical moves than Vladimir Putin’s have been in Europe. American strategists cannot take for granted that the US and its allies will behave optimally, but Xi cannot dismiss the possibility that they would. He will thus face an unpleasant choice once he decides to invade — accept the risk of expanding the war greatly or leave fully operational the bases from which a possibly devastating US military response might come. These considerations, among others, make strategies of persuasion, coercion, and military isolation short of invasion far more attractive to Xi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s persuasion and coercion campaigns target the will of Taiwan, the United States, and America’s allies to support and defend the island. Ongoing Chinese demonstrations of military capability accompanied by “lawfare” — the weaponization of legal arguments for political purposes — and information operations aim to convince the American people, US allies, and the Taiwanese people that the Taiwan issue is a domestic Chinese matter that other countries should leave to Beijing to “resolve.” They also try to demonstrate that Taiwan is not defensible and that any use of force to resist Chinese aggression would result in a catastrophe for Taiwan and any intervening force. China’s persuasion campaign works to rewrite history and convince other nations of things that are not true in order to erode resistance to its aggression against Taiwan. China’s coercion campaign is a form of “violent bargaining” meant to use means short of large-scale war to force other nations to comply with its demands and defer to its interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China also aims by persuasion and coercion to set the conditions for a campaign of compellence: the use of force through blockade or invasion. That is why it is vital Washington not allow Beijing to isolate Taipei, push America into a standoff defensive posture that pulls the bulk of its military forces outside the Chinese anti-access and area-denial (A2/AD) zones within which US forces are most at risk, and undermine US efforts to build a coalition. A blockade accompanied by other means of isolating Taiwan is an attractive option for China. Beijing could force ships en route to Taiwan to stop for inspections, disrupting the supply of resources to the island. The Chinese Communist Party could then attempt to use the PLA to convince the American people and US allies that a US response to break the blockade would be escalatory. Chinese persuasion and coercion campaigns are meant to induce precisely such responses should Beijing escalate to the overt use of force on a limited basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US must urgently reorient its approach to defending Taiwan against all three of China’s roads to controlling the island. Deterring and ability to defeat an invasion are necessary but insufficient conditions for success in maintaining the status quo: a de facto independent Taiwan. US approaches to those challenges must reinforce rather than undermine US and coalition efforts to defeat China’s persuasion and coercion campaigns. US strategy for defending Taiwan must defeat each of China’s interrelated campaigns separately and all of them together. Policymakers must explain and defeat Chinese information operations aimed at the American and global publics so that they understand and can resist China’s persuasion campaign. The US must demonstrate its commitment to the defense of Taiwan to its own public, Taiwan and potential coalition partners, and Xi himself. America must defend the rules-based international order specifically as it applies to Taiwan against the incremental escalations of Beijing’s coercion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has been moving along three roads to fully integrating Taiwan into the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and extinguishing Taiwan’s autonomy: persuasion, coercion, and compellence. American policy has focused increasingly on preventing China from seizing Taiwan by force — blocking the compellence road. But China can still secure its goals through persuasion and coercion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Xi Jinping likely prefers those roads to the much riskier path of overt military attack on the island. Blocking the Chinese roads through persuasion and coercion is not a marginal task, nor is it inherent in the effort to deter or defeat a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. The current US approach to blocking the compellence road may in fact increase the likelihood that Xi will reach his objectives by these other two paths. The US must urgently rethink its approach to the problem of defending Taiwan’s autonomy so that it blocks all three roads to PRC victory rather than focusing on only one — at the expense or even to the detriment of defending Taiwan against ongoing persuasion and coercion campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;persuasion&quot;&gt;Persuasion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can easily overstate the Chinese preference for “winning without fighting” or ascribe to Chinese military thought an intellectual patent on an idea that other societies and cultures value and share. Frequent and facile references to Sun Tzu’s aphorism that “those who render others’ armies helpless without fighting are the best of all” contribute to this danger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that repetition of this aphorism has made it seem trite, however, does not strip it of its force in Chinese thought. The concept of buzhan ersheng (不战而胜) — to “subdue the enemy without fighting” — has been a cornerstone of Chinese strategic thinking for centuries. The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has pursued a massive military reform and modernization program since 1993 in preparation for modern, great-power warfare, even as Beijing has intensified a coercion campaign that uses real and threatened power to achieve its aims. But China has not abandoned the psychological strategies that helped the CCP successfully topple the Republic of China (ROC) during the Chinese civil war and take over mainland China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of so shaping an adversary’s understanding of the world that it voluntarily chooses one’s own preferred course of action is a highly evolved part of Chinese strategic thought and practice. The idea of causing the enemy to perceive its own benefit in choosing the path most favorable to oneself is heavily discussed in Sun Tzu, encapsulated in the observation that “what causes opponents to come of their own accord is the prospect of gain.” Mao Zedong translated that aphorism into an accessible analogy, describing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;three ways to make a cat eat a hot pepper: stuff it down the cat’s throat, disguise the pepper by wrapping it in cheese, or grind the pepper up and spread it on the cat’s back. In the latter case, the cat will lick itself, thinking it is doing something for itself when it is actually doing what you want. This is the essence of strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soviet theorists expanded on this idea in considerable and meticulous detail under the rubric of “reflexive control.” Soviet writer Vladimir Lefebvre described reflexive control in the following manner:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In making his decision the adversary uses information about the area of conflict, about his own troops and ours, about their ability to fight, etc. We can influence his channels of information and send messages, which shift the flow of information in a way favorable for us. The adversary uses the most contemporary method of optimization and finds the optimal decision. However, it will not be a true optimum, but a decision predetermined by us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflexive control is at the heart of Russian information operations and hybrid war theories. The CCP has long studied and learned from Russian thought and experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mao’s theory of how to prevail in war was based on what he called the “three magic weapons.” The CCP, or politics, is in the lead. It wields armed force together with “the united front” to “storm and shatter the enemy’s positions.” Armed force is calibrated to support the ongoing work of political struggle to defeat an enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PLA has always had robust political warfare units alongside its conventional units. Its General Political Department (GPD) was devoted to undermining enemy morale and building international support. The GPD helped build the United Front with the Kuomintang (KMT) against the Japanese while subverting the KMT military to further its aims in the Chinese civil war. The GPD was reorganized in 2015 into the Central Military Commission’s Political Work Department. Its responsibilities are to conduct the “three warfares”: public opinion warfare, legal warfare, and psychological warfare. This department, along with the new Strategic Support Force, where the PLA’s cyber, space, electronic warfare, and information warfare units reside, is responsible for conducting political warfare in peace and war, including the ongoing coercive campaign against Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing’s theory of victory rests on the destruction of Taiwan’s morale: If Taiwan believes that the US will not or cannot help undermine China’s escalating threats, it will have to accede to Beijing’s demands. Taiwan is a small, isolated island with little acceptance as an independent state. It is sui generis in international relations. Absent US support, it is not difficult to imagine morale on the island collapsing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s persuasion campaign is thus aimed at not only Taiwan but also the US and its key allies and partners. Beijing continues to use all the tools at its disposal to drive general acceptance of the reality it desires to instantiate — that Taiwan is part of China, not an independent country, and that all other states agree with that premise. Its goal in doing so is to achieve preemptive recognition of its objectives and thereby collapse Taipei’s will to resist by demonstrating that Taiwan is fully isolated and alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This objective is the primary motivation behind the CCP’s constant efforts to rewrite history and current events in what often appears to be a ham-fisted way. The CCP has thus continually portrayed itself as the victim and the US and Taiwan as the aggressors in the cross-Strait dispute, despite enormous concessions and diplomatic generosity by Washington and Taipei. This argument resonates in parts of the nonaligned world and among potential US partners who would rather stay neutral in a conflict over Taiwan and more broadly in the US-China global competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even as the CCP engages in highly destabilizing shows of force, it accuses the US and Taiwan of violating an “agreement” that was never made, in which the US supposedly recognized Beijing’s right to control Taiwan’s affairs. A brief excursion into the actual history of PRC-ROC relations — and America’s relations with both — is necessary to understand the scope and scale of Beijing’s revisionism as part of its persuasion campaign to isolate Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ROC, not the PRC, was China’s sovereign government after the fall of the Qing dynasty. Though the ROC never controlled all the lands it claimed, it had all the trappings and juridical elements of a state for most of the period in which it ruled mainland China. The ROC conducted all official diplomatic business for China before the CCP’s victory in 1949. The ROC was part of the grand alliance in World War II and a charter member of the United Nations Security Council. Consistent with the prominent role it was to have after the war, the ROC, not the CCP, accepted the surrender of the Japanese on Taiwan. The CCP only came to power after its violent rebellion against the duly constituted ROC government run by the KMT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CCP prevailed on the mainland, but the ROC survived and retreated to Taiwan. The CCP governed, had sovereignty, and was the legitimate ruler only over the mainland of China, while the KMT had sovereignty and legitimate rule over the island of Taiwan and the offshore Matsu, Pescadores, and Quemoy islands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CCP consistently denies and attempts to persuade others to deny the historical and geopolitical reality that there have been two Chinas since 1949: an ROC on Taiwan and a PRC on the mainland. The US recognized the ROC (including its claims to rule all of China) from 1949 to 1979 and the PRC (which also claims to rule all of China) from 1979 onward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shift in US recognition did not change the reality of the two Chinas. The US made a policy choice to accommodate the PRC, a decision that had no bearing on the continued reality that the ROC legitimately governed Taiwan. Though the US made an enormous concession to its erstwhile enemy by switching its official recognition from the ROC to the PRC and abrogating its treaty with the island, the ROC still ruled Taiwan and had sovereignty over its people. The shift in US recognition was not accompanied by a formal agreement that the CCP was the legitimate ruler of Taiwan and that the ROC was therefore illegitimate. Beijing demanded such an agreement, but it only received an “acknowledgement” from Washington of the CCP’s position that Taiwan was a sovereign part of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when the US broke formal ties with Taipei — but still refused to recognize the CCP’s formal claims — the US Congress protested and enacted with bipartisan support the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), which provides the legal basis for strong if unofficial relations with Taiwan today. The US thus never officially recognized China’s claim of sovereignty over Taiwan. Washington’s robust political, commercial, cultural, and educational ties with Taiwan are required by law. The PRC knows this yet insists that the US can somehow stop supporting Taiwan. Further, the US has a legal requirement to help Taiwan resist coercion. The TRA was passed in 1979, yet China continued with the process of diplomatic normalization. It thus implicitly acknowledged that US unofficial relations with Taiwan are part of what Washington calls “our one China policy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CCP not only denies this reality but also portrays itself as an aggrieved party, despite the concessions the US has made to its demands. The US shifted its recognition from the ROC to the PRC at a time when China was especially weak: ravaged by Mao’s Cultural Revolution, threatened by the Soviets with nuclear war, and readying for war with a Vietnam that was becoming hegemonic and hostile. It has still not acknowledged this tremendous US concession, but rather continues trying to force more change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand Beijing’s persuasion campaign, it is useful to understand what the US did not agree to in its “One China” policy and what Congress insisted on through the TRA and associated actions. First, the US does not take a position on Taiwan’s sovereignty. It insists that the dispute over sovereignty between Taipei and Beijing is to be worked out peacefully, without preconditions. That is why the TRA’s language requiring the US to resist Chinese coercion of Taiwan is so crucial: Washington has always maintained that Taiwan should not have to negotiate with a gun pointed at its head. That the US does not take a position on sovereignty does not negate Taiwan’s sovereignty; under international law, Taiwan is a sovereign entity. The US is making a reversible policy concession to the PRC in not officially recognizing the ROC, and it certainly never agreed to the “One China” principle (as opposed to America’s “One China” policy), which Beijing tries to persuade countries to accept. The supposed “principle” is that Taiwan has always been part of the PRC. The principle is a lie — Taiwan has never been part of the People’s Republic of China. It has been part of past Chinese empires (as well as Dutch, Portuguese, and Japanese empires), but it has never been part of the political entity that is the PRC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the US never agreed to cut off unofficial ties with Taiwan or limit the seniority of officials who conduct the operations of this unofficial relationship. Indeed, the presidents of Taiwan and the US can meet if they so choose. Such meetings cannot have the trappings of official state meetings because treating the Taiwanese leader as the president of Taiwan would violate America’s definition of its “One China” policy — not because it would violate international law or any promise to Beijing. Yet the PRC protests meetings between lower levels of the US government and Taiwanese officials, increasingly through demonstrations of force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, while the US stated in a 1982 diplomatic communiqué that it would cap arms sales to Taiwan, it made abundantly clear that this cap was contingent on China’s commitment to peace as manifested in China’s military posture. But China’s military posture has grown more menacing. Given Washington’s historic position that it will calibrate its Taiwan policy based on the threat China poses to Taiwan, the US has no formal obligation to limit its military relationship with Taiwan. It has limited this relationship as a concession to China. But it can exercise with and train the ROC armed forces, and it can sell any military equipment it deems necessary to keep the peace across the strait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, the US never agreed to limit Taiwan’s international political and economic identity. Washington can push for Taiwan’s participation in any international organization for which statehood is not a requirement. China has in the past acquiesced to Taiwan’s participation as a separate legal entity in the World Trade Organization. China, not the US, has changed policy. Beijing is trying to persuade the US and its allies that the “One China” principle governs cross-Strait relations, that Taiwan is part of the PRC, and that the US is abrogating promises to China to this effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US must undermine this persuasion campaign and provide its allies with the political cover to develop the kind of relations with Taiwan that they want, free from Chinese intimidation. There is simply nothing provocative about this policy. The US promised not to unilaterally confer diplomatic recognition on the ROC, and it is abiding by that promise. On the other hand, the PRC is not abiding by its promise of peacefully resolving its differences with Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;coercion&quot;&gt;Coercion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CCP has not been content to rely on persuasion to secure final control of Taiwan, of course. It has long accompanied its persuasion campaign with an expanding coercion effort. This effort fits with Thomas Schelling’s definition of coercion as a kind of “violent communications about intentions and commitment.” Schelling’s insight was that the power to hurt gives states tremendous bargaining power. Expounding on his work, scholar Tami Davis Biddle evokes one of the most memorable scenes in modern cinematic history to explain how coercion works: In The Godfather, Don Corleone tells his consigliere that he will make a noncompliant movie producer an “offer he cannot refuse” to get him to do something he otherwise would not do. Following a famous scene involving a decapitated horse’s head, the producer subsequently hired the don’s friend for an important role in an upcoming movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The movie producer felt he had to comply or face more harm. This cinematic example helps illustrate the PRC’s coercion tactics toward the US and Taiwan. No serious analyst doubts that Beijing is willing and able to inflict harm against Taiwan and the US if they do not comply with its demands. The act of being coerced is thus a psychological process. The coercer must manipulate the mind of the coerced. As Schelling says, the power to hurt is a bargaining power. The willingness to use it is diplomacy — “vicious diplomacy, but diplomacy.” This strategy is an exploitation of fear. Arguably, a state’s leverage over another is at its greatest when its adversary believes it has not yet used all its power, that any display of force is a restrained one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The PLA’s Theory of Coercion.&lt;/strong&gt; The PLA has been interested in US theories of coercion since the first Gulf War. Coercive strategies fit well with a CCP strategic culture that emphasizes the ability to manipulate an adversary’s psyche through stratagems. According to Mark Stokes, in the late 1990s the PLA began to theorize that US aerospace coercion was related to China’s own concepts of stratagem, which it calls moulüe (谋略). Military force could be used to attack “an opponent’s cognitive processes.” Military strategies of this kind require specific calculations of where pressure or manipulation can be applied to achieve political objectives. The PLA theorizing about coercive tactics closely resembled Mao’s writing about the so-called magic weapons of warfare. Force and political manipulation were tightly sewn into strategies that manipulate the enemy and make them concede before all-out warfare is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PLA theorists wrote about the coercion of Taiwan in the context of achieving limited political objectives, short of what could be achieved through an invasion and occupation of the island. Force would be modulated based on the objective and level of resistance to it. Deterring de jure independence requires a certain level of force; forcing agreement with different forms of unification requires more force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These PLA writings coincided with the onset of the PLA modernization program in 1993. By the beginning of the 21st century, the PLA was deploying a lethal, precision-guided missile force positioned across the Taiwan Strait, enabled by a modernizing comprehensive command, control, communications, and computers and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (known as C4ISR) program. Indeed, the PLA aerospace force was the leading edge of the modernization program. At the same time, the PLA was developing anti-access and area-denial (A2AD) capabilities that raised the costs of US intervention on Taiwan’s behalf. The political message to Taiwan was clear: The PLA could inflict great harm on the island, and the US would not want to risk making a costly defense of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the PLA acquired new capabilities, it developed new options to deter Taipei’s moves to formalize its de facto independent status, co-opt Washington to contain such perceived moves by Taiwan, and set conditions for intensification of the use of force across the strait. PLA authors stressed that the threat or actual application of force is necessary to ensure its goals regarding Taiwan, and Washington understood the consequences of crossing Beijing’s ever-changing political thresholds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PLA continues to debate the efficacy of demonstrations of power to affect political dynamics. The 2020 version of the Science of Military Strategy describes weishe (威慑), often translated as “deterrence,” as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;a method of military conflict to achieve a political goal based on military strength . . . and determination to use strength [that] makes the other side face unworthy or even unbearable consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intended political outcome of this method of military conflict is to make the adversary “give in, compromise, or surrender,” ideally without having to engage in large-scale fighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PLA may use military conflict at a low level to achieve a political goal. The Science of Military Strategy identifies “warning military strikes” as part of strategies to both forestall adversary actions and coerce compliance. Indeed, limited uses of military strikes against precise and specific targets can showcase the ability and determination to achieve military and political objectives and may obviate the need for larger military campaigns and operations. The PLA does not see itself as moving through distinct phases of war, from “shaping” and “influence” operations to “kinetic” use of force operations. Rather, it intertwines shaping and influence operations with kinetic operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All militaries are instruments of politics, but in the PRC the relationship has historically been more direct. The PLA is the party’s armed wing, not China’s professional military. The PLA’s foundational purpose is to help the party win political struggles and develop new political realities. In turn, the CCP’s main purpose is to expand its power over territory and peoples. The party’s history as an insurgency engaged in “people’s war” informs its current conduct as it expands its writ over Hong Kong, Tibet, and Xinjiang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Taiwan’s case, the CCP seeks to expand its political power over new territory and 24 million additional people that is has never ruled. This is difficult to do and would require much more force than any of the other populations and territories it now controls. The PLA is thus a crucial tool, and intensifying applications of actual — rather than “only” demonstrations of — force may be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coercive campaign offers the PRC distinct advantages over a campaign to invade and occupy Taiwan. It also provides Beijing flexibility to continually redefine what it considers the bounds of acceptable political behavior by Taipei and Washington. First, unlike a campaign of brute force annihilation, Beijing can redefine success if it needs to. Second, Beijing’s negotiating leverage keeps increasing as the PLA grows stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The coercive campaign offers the PRC distinct advantages over a campaign to invade and occupy Taiwan.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CCP’s coercion campaign has expanded even as Taipei has made concessions. The ROC abandoned its claim to be the sole legitimate ruler of all of China in 1991. In effect, Taiwan declared peace, abandoning its stated policy of unification through force, and aligned its polity with geopolitical realities. The overwhelming majority of Taiwanese residents did not come to Taiwan during the KMT retreat, and they had no say and little interest in perpetuating the Chinese civil war. They disagree with Washington’s “One China” policy and never had a say in its foundational 1972 statement that “all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain there is but One China.” Yet they have accepted it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A substantial group of voters now supports Taiwan’s newer Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), an erstwhile opposition party that rose to power as part of the independence movement in Taiwan. But the once-oppressed DPP voters made an enormous concession by accepting that they were citizens of the ROC, not of a new state called Taiwan. The ROC is a preexisting political entity whose existence the CCP recognizes in practice even while denying its right to rule over anything. Any declaration of the existence of a new Republic of Taiwan would seem to Beijing a declaration of independence and therefore an escalation rather than a concession. But the US does not support such a political escalation and thus this option is all but impossible. Rather, the US supports the political status quo, which means that the ROC rules Taiwan and the PRC rules mainland China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taipei also suspended martial law in 1987, which had been put in place to fight Communist subversion and infiltration. It made political changes to better reflect the reality that its government only has sovereignty over the people and territory of Taiwan, though it did not formally amend its constitution to relinquish its claims to mainland China, which ironically would have angered the PRC. The ROC thus set the conditions for a diplomatic breakthrough across the strait. Officials from each side of the strait met to work out practical matters of cooperation, from the governance of postal services to consular services. The two sides implicitly agreed to compromise on a political formulation, now referred to as the 1992 Consensus. They agreed to disagree on the meaning of “One China.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ROC’s unilateral abandonment of the threat of force and the forfeiture of claims of jurisdiction over the mainland should have been the basis for a lasting peace. But Beijing’s response to Taipei’s cessation of a state of hostilities was an escalation of its coercion campaign. Before Taiwan’s first democratic election in June 1995, Taiwan’s president, Lee Teng-hui, made a high-profile visit to his alma mater, Cornell University. The PRC then conducted a series of missile tests in the waters surrounding Taiwan and other military maneuvers in response to what CCP leaders called Lee’s attempts to “split the motherland.” The US and Taiwan had never formally agreed to limit the visits of Taiwan presidents, and the US does not agree that there is a “motherland” that Taiwan is trying to “split.” There has never been a single political CCP-run entity that included Taiwan. This was a provocative escalation by Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PRC initiated another set of missile tests in the run-up to Taiwan’s first presidential election in 1996 in an attempt to frighten Taiwan’s electorate into voting against Lee and compel the US to rein in what they called Taiwan’s pro-independence forces. In 1999, Lee suggested the two sides negotiate on a “special state-to-state basis” in an effort to break Taipei and Beijing out of a diplomatic stalemate, just seven years after its partial breakthrough. The response from Beijing was a stepped-up rhetorical assault with escalating military maneuvers. Beijing focused on Lee’s use of the term “state-to-state,” despite Lee’s use of the modifier “special” to connote something less than official country-to-country relations. His creative formulation was meant to co-opt independence-minded Taiwanese while providing Beijing with a face-saving way to conduct relations with Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s efforts to normalize relations based on a reasonable diplomatic formula that recognized CCP rule over the mainland while avoiding declaring Taiwanese independence were seen in Beijing as dangerous “splittism” (the term the CCP uses for political separatism). Beijing pocketed Taiwanese concessions as it had previous American concessions, but it failed to make any concessions of its own. Moreover, the PRC treated these concessions as provocations justifying further demands and coercion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This response was delivered by the Chinese General Secretary Jiang Zemin at the height of the US effort to integrate China into the global economy and establish warm commercial relations with Beijing. It occurred as the US dramatically downsized its military following the end of the Cold War. There was certainly cause for Beijing to worry about the military balance with the US after America’s thumping of Saddam Hussein’s military in 1991 — and the prodemocratic rhetoric of both the George H. W. Bush and Clinton administrations. But US actions indicated that the threat to the PRC was receding rather than growing. The Chinese coercion campaign thus began during a time of peace and prosperity for Beijing, when it enjoyed friendly relations with the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countries and companies had rushed into China to explore commercial opportunities while the PRC embraced foreign expertise and know-how. The Soviet Union had collapsed, removing a long-standing threat to Beijing’s north. Beijing’s ideological problem remained, however: Democracy in Taiwan undermines the CCP’s core tenet that democracy is unsuitable for the Chinese cultural context. The existence of a legitimate constitutional government actually ruling Taiwan, moreover, discredited the CCP’s claim to speak for all Chinese people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having received US and Taiwanese concessions as if they were acts of escalation, the CCP learned during this period of peace and Western outreach and engagement that threats of force could push the US to pressure Taipei. The US sent ships to the Taiwan Strait in response to Chinese missile tests in 1995 and 1996, to be sure. But the PRC convinced then-President Clinton to publicly affirm China’s position on Taiwan, rather than Taipei’s or Washington’s, while speaking on Chinese soil in Shanghai. Beijing demanded that President Clinton repeat the so-called three nos: that the US would not support (1) Taiwan independence, (2) “Two Chinas” or “One China One Taiwan,” or (3) Taiwan’s efforts to participate in international organizations in which statehood is a requirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The events of 1995–97 also exposed the PRC’s relative military impotence at that time, as the PLA had no military answer to the arrival of US warships in the strait. But Beijing accomplished the political outcome it sought, despite its military weakness, through an apparent escalation that was not backed by actual capability. It made a political demand of Washington based on a military bluff, and Washington complied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A DPP government under Chen Shui-bian was elected in 2000, partially in reaction to China’s military intimidation. As the CCP’s pressure grew on the Chen government, Taipei pushed for greater recognition of Taiwan’s independence. Yet Beijing convinced President George W. Bush to publicly rebuke Taiwan’s president in the company of PRC Premier Wen Jiabao, humiliating Chen in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Xi became general secretary of the CCP in 2012, his initial approach to Taiwan was relatively moderate. Taiwan was governed by a KMT leader, Ma Ying-jeou, who sought more conciliation with Beijing. Xi and Ma met in Singapore in 2015, the first meeting between the leaders of Taiwan and China and a notable Chinese diplomatic olive branch to Taiwan. Moreover, Xi did not protest when Ma took the public position that the two sides had “agreed to disagree” about the meaning of “One China,” another apparent PRC concession. The formula of “One China, different interpretations” was apparently back on the table. This formulation was in essence the same as Lee’s “special state-to-state relations” comment in 1999, as the leaders of the government of Taiwan and China met as coequals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This history is not merely of academic interest. To counter CCP revisionism, US policymakers need to understand it. And, as a matter of policy, the US should insist that Beijing does not get to choose which elected leaders of the ROC it deals with. To date, the US has not called on the PRC to return to the negotiating table with the current Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen based on this precedent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi’s relatively conciliatory approach to Taiwan did not survive Ma’s presidency, however. When Tsai succeeded Ma in 2016, Xi reverted to the previous CCP posture of threats and demands. During his meeting with Ma, Xi said that “as long as the 1992 Consensus and its core values are acknowledged, we stand ready to have contact.” Tsai did not explicitly accept the language of the 1992 Consensus, charting a different course from an agreement made by her political opponent’s party. This is, of course, the prerogative of any new government. China’s Taiwan Affairs Office criticized her and demanded that she recognize the PRC’s “One China” principle. Tsai nevertheless went as far toward conciliation as Taiwan’s new politics would allow. By 2016, the electorate in Taiwan had little connection to mainland China. The grandchildren of the old KMT were voters who had grown up in a democratic Taiwan. Ties with China were akin to those of Canadians with the US: a shared culture, history, and language but little else, despite the CCP’s insistence otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Beijing was warning Washington about Tsai’s “separatist” and independence proclivities, Tsai conceded in her May 2016 inauguration speech that “the new government will conduct cross-Strait affairs in accordance with the Republic of China Constitution, the Act Governing Relations between the People of Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area, and other relevant legislation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This statement was another major concession by a Taiwanese leader. That Tsai represented the native Taiwanese DPP yet accepted that the ROC and Taiwan were the same entity was a difficult internal political maneuver. Crucially, she embraced the reality that the PRC governs the mainland and the ROC on Taiwan does not; she thereby opened the door to diplomatic solutions similar to those of her predecessors. But for Tsai, the meaning of “One China” was to be negotiated, not simply conceded to the PRC. Washington encouraged Tsai’s concession, but it never insisted that the CCP make any similar compromise or live up to Xi’s implicit acceptance of the “different interpretations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi has years of experience dealing with Taiwan as a former party secretary of Fujian province, directly across the strait from Taiwan. He is versed in Taiwanese politics and knows that Tsai went as far as she could go on the issue of “One China.” Yet he chose to escalate the coercion campaign, blaming Tsai for recalcitrance. The US and its allies should have made a more concerted effort, beginning then to call on Xi to return to the negotiating table and not escalate his disagreements with Taiwan’s new government through force and diplomatic pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon after Tsai was elected, Beijing pressured Panama and São Tomé and Príncipe to shift diplomatic relations from the ROC to the PRC. Beijing shut Taiwan out of international organizations, such as the International Civil Aviation Organization and the International Criminal Police Organization, among others. During Tsai’s presidency, the CCP has pressured companies ranging from United Airlines to Snickers to call Taiwan a province of China or face economic penalty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing also accelerated its campaign of military coercion following Tsai’s accession. The PLA increased the frequency of bomber circumnavigations of Taiwan in late 2016 and made such circumnavigations an enduring reality for the Tsai administration. By late 2017, PLA bombers and support aircraft circumnavigated the island. Beijing modified a civil aviation route near the centerline of the Taiwan Strait in January 2018 to allow commercial airlines to fly over open ocean in the strait, severely taxing Taiwan’s air defense system and air traffic controls. Since February 2018, the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) intensified a pattern of flights through the Miyako Strait, off the east coast of Taiwan in the Philippine Sea, and the Bashi Channel. These flights demonstrate the PLAAF’s ability to “break” the first island chain and establish air dominance over key lifelines for Taiwan and its geographical connection to the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2019, two PLAAF fighters crossed into Taiwan’s side of the median line — an unofficial boundary between Taiwan and the PRC not challenged by the Chinese military since 1999. The military maneuvers were accompanied by statements from China’s Taiwan Affairs Office and the PLA’s Eastern Theater Command about their necessity to guard against “separatists,” as if the PLA were conducting legitimate counterterror operations. In September 2020 a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman stated, “There is no so-called median line in the Strait.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This line had been another means of keeping peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. The CCP’s violation and rejection of it was an incremental move to claim the waters and air around Taiwan as its own. The PRC continued this coercive campaign by increasing air incursions into the Taiwanese Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ). Taiwan recorded 969 incursions by Chinese warplanes into its ADIZ in 2021 — more than double the roughly 380 carried out in 2020. In 2022, total Chinese air incursions into the ADIZ were 1,115. The PLA continually issues threatening messages in native Taiwanese dialects and allows military commentators to describe the ability of their jets to decapitate the Taiwanese leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These PLA operations are part of Chinese cognitive warfare, what Taiwan calls “cognitive domain warfare” or renzhi yu zuozhan (认知域作战). A Taiwan defense analyst has captured the purpose of this aerospace campaign: “PLA exercises first create an environment of fear, and then the responsibility of causing tension is blamed on ‘Taiwan’s ambitious politicians.’” The CCP aims to influence Taiwanese and American politics through the tension it creates. In manipulating the information space through demonstrations of force, its goal is to get important audiences in Taipei, Washington, and allied capitals to believe more pliant Taiwanese leaders could make this threat go away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CCP has thus put the Taiwanese under the constant threat of ever-escalating violence and political pressure. One purpose of these shows of force across the strait is to coerce the US to change its policy, curtail its relations with Taiwan, come closer to the CCP’s definition of what “One China” means, and force Taipei to come with it on that journey of concessions. The second purpose is to wear down Taiwan’s resistance, undermine DPP rule, and persuade the Taiwanese of their own accord to elect and follow leaders who will concede to China’s demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PRC can fully secure its objectives vis-à-vis Taiwan if it achieves either aim. Taiwan cannot continue to resist growing PRC pressure without the active support of Washington and its allies in and beyond the region. If Beijing can reduce or break that support, Taiwan will have no option but to give the PRC what it desires. The CCP can succeed even more fully if it can actually break the will of Taiwanese supporters of policies of autonomy and resistance and elevate compliant Taiwanese politicians to power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;US policy risks making a grave error by seeing China’s expanding military operations around Taiwan only through the prism of preparations for an invasion. Those operations may be part of such preparations and may help with them in various ways, but they are also strategic undertakings in their own right and are directly aimed at accomplishing Beijing’s goals. Developing strategies to deter or defeat a Chinese invasion of Taiwan may be ineffective or even counterproductive in preventing the PRC from subjugating Taiwan through a combination of these coercion efforts and the continuing persuasion efforts that accompany them, as we consider below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A strategy to protect Taiwan’s autonomy and freedom from Chinese control requires blocking the persuasion and coercion roads to PRC domination of the island and deterring or defeating the compellence road. A US counter-persuasion and -coercion strategy should be focused, tightly sequenced and phased, and deliberate. Chinese political and economic moves to undermine Taiwan’s isolation should be coordinated with demonstrations of US and allied force that can ensure open strategic lines of communication and resupply around Taiwan. The increasingly myopic focus on the supposedly imminent Chinese invasion threat can seriously hinder or prevent entirely the development and implementation of such a strategy. This outcome may be in part what China seeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;compellence&quot;&gt;Compellence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PRC has unquestionably been developing the capability to compel Taiwanese capitulation by force if coercion and persuasion fail, but Xi’s determination to move to compellence and the imminence of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan both require more rigorous interrogation than either is currently receiving. It would be more strategically apposite for the US to approach concerns about an impending Chinese invasion in the context of ongoing Chinese persuasion and coercion approaches. An invasion or other compellent strategies are possible, but such scenarios would be escalations of current campaigns carrying significant risks and downsides for Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The narrow focus on the threat of Chinese invasion, moreover, marginalizes an alternative compellence strategy that would flow far more naturally from China’s persuasion and coercion efforts — a strategy of isolation. The US would do well, therefore, to take a step back from the increasingly frantic discussion of ways and means to deter or stop a cross-Strait invasion and instead reconsider the PRC strategic context from which any such decision and operation would emerge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China did not begin its military modernization with the express purpose of invading Taiwan. As we have stated, the PLA modernization campaign started in the early 1990s, when the PRC observed America’s military modernization demonstrated in the deserts of Iraq and Kuwait. The Gulf War shocked the world’s major militaries by demonstrating that a highly trained, professional, all-volunteer force equipped with precision strike and stealth capabilities could humiliate the world’s fourth largest army rapidly and with extremely low casualties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian military theorists were seized by this phenomenon and pushed for the modernization and professionalization of the Russian military in the following decades. Many other countries began abandoning long-held conscription practices and turning to professional volunteer militaries equipped with more advanced technology. The Chinese did the same and for the same reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;US policy risks making a grave error by seeing China’s expanding military operations around Taiwan only through the prism of preparations for an invasion.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defense analysts have grown increasingly concerned that the PLA has a set goal of 2027 to invade Taiwan, based on comments by outgoing commander of US Indo-Pacific Command Adm. Phil Davidson (ret.). But the primary importance of 2027 is that it is the 100-year anniversary of the PLA’s founding and is thus likely a deadline for it to reach new modernization milestones. The PLA can likely already conduct an invasion if ordered, albeit with high risk; as the modernization process continues, and in every year that passes, the PLA will have more capability to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PLA’s modernization effort is general-purpose, rather than narrowly optimized for a cross-Strait invasion. It began at a time when the PRC was pocketing US and Taiwanese concessions and increasing its demands; it continued through periods of apparent Taiwanese and American conciliation of Beijing and through periods of easing of tensions between Beijing and Taipei. Xi may have accelerated the expected date of completion of this decades-long general military buildup, shifting it into a specific preparation for a particular invasion scenario, but there is no direct and publicly available evidence of this assessment. US policymakers would do well to question the notion that this program’s date of completion represents some kind of specified invasion date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The modernization program naturally enhances the PRC’s military abilities to invade Taiwan even against US resistance, but it also enhances the PLA’s abilities to pursue another form of compellence — isolation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isolation.&lt;/strong&gt; A strategy of isolating Taiwan by air and sea flows naturally from China’s ongoing persuasion and coercion efforts. Those efforts explicitly aim to get the last few states that diplomatically recognize Taiwan to shift their recognition to Beijing. They aim to cajole states and businesses to accept and promulgate the Chinese version of the Beijing-Taipei relationship, rather than Taiwan’s — a form of informational isolation. That aim includes efforts to prevent other heads and senior leaders of foreign states from visiting Taipei or receiving Taiwanese officials in their capitals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is thus in part also a strategy of diplomatic isolation. And Beijing constantly presses other countries to refrain from providing Taiwan with military equipment — a form of military-cooperation isolation. One set of aims of the current coercion and persuasion efforts is thus to use means short of the actual use of force to cut Taipei’s connections to the outside world, other than those that might run through Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The natural next escalation in these efforts is not invasion, but rather adding the overt use of force to complete the isolation. Beijing could declare a quarantine or blockade of Taiwan on some pretext and deploy its maritime power and airpower to enforce such a policy. The blockade need not be total from the start. The PRC could begin by deploying ships covered by aircraft around the island to inspect all vessels entering and leaving Taiwan’s ports for some claimed contraband — advanced weapons systems, perhaps. Beijing could similarly insist on inspecting aircraft, although attempting to enforce such a demand without actually shooting down civilian aircraft would be challenging. How many civilian aircraft, on the other hand, would continue operating through skies full of PLAAF aircraft threatening to down them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If such initial efforts failed to bring Taipei to a position satisfactory to Beijing, the PRC could escalate further to an actual blockade. Taiwan is unalterably dependent on external resources to survive, so it is almost impossible to imagine that a protracted blockade could fail to secure Taipei’s surrender on almost any terms Beijing might dictate. Moreover, given its unique lack of official status in international affairs, it may be especially vulnerable to demonstrations that it can be isolated. It would be difficult to muster the kind of defiance that Britain did under attack from Nazi Germany: Taiwan lacks Britain’s long history and strategic traditions, general cohesion, and unbreakable morale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This form of compellence not only is the most natural and obvious progression from the current PRC campaigns but also seems to present a far more attractive balance of risk and reward to Beijing. It does not in principle require the PLA to engage in combat. If Taiwan’s supporters make clear they will not challenge such a blockade, then Taiwan might surrender without fighting. If either Taiwan or its supporters decide to challenge it, moreover, they run the risk of appearing to have fired the first shot, provided the PRC has arranged matters such that running the blockade requires shooting at ships or aircraft blocking routes to ports or airfields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the PRC has not managed such an arrangement, then the PLA might need to shoot first, but it might begin by hitting a civilian plane or ship. Such an action would obviously incur outrage and opprobrium, on the one hand, but it would also place Taiwan and its partners in the position of having to decide how to respond. That position would likely be uncomfortable, as competing pressures to respond to the Chinese action and support Taiwan would be offset by fears that the pro-Taiwan coalition would be initiating a war. To see this dynamic at work, we have only to look at the extensive Western discourse about the fears of prompting Russian escalation by providing defensive systems to Ukraine following Moscow’s unprovoked and illegal invasion. The West’s early wavering about supporting Ukraine against a blatantly illegal and unjust invasion requires considerably more attention than it has received, since it offers Beijing encouragement as it considers escalation toward Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isolation strategy has some downsides for Beijing, to be sure. It would be an obvious escalation to the use of force and could trigger the US and regional states to mobilize for war, thereby depriving the PRC of the element of surprise it might otherwise hope to achieve at some level in a no-notice invasion scenario. If the US and its partners responded to the isolation rapidly and in force, Beijing could find it has made the prospects of a successful invasion much worse by bringing its adversaries’ advanced military capabilities into the vicinity of Taiwan without interdicting them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PRC would thus need to be prepared to choose either of the two most plausible actions in response to the deployment of considerable US and allied firepower toward Taiwan: de-escalate and await another moment or escalate to regional war. If the strength and determination of the US and partner response seemed to Beijing too high to challenge, then the PRC could back away, accept a temporary defeat, and develop alternative approaches for another try later on. Beijing could prepare in advance to mitigate the unpleasantness of having to climb down by defining a lesser political objective that it could be reasonably sure to accomplish — or plausibly claim to have accomplished — before it had to back away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PRC could alternatively ensure that its initial preparations for the isolation campaign include preparations to escalate to major conflict if a US-led coalition challenged it seriously. This approach might not be easily distinguishable from preparations for a full-scale invasion in that it would likely include putting in place all the capabilities needed to exclude US-led forces from the vicinity of Taiwan and drive off or destroy any already near the island. It might include the preparation of an invasion force, depending on whether Beijing believed it could achieve its aims by the escalatory application of the isolation approach. The PLA would face a potentially much worse military position at the start of such an escalation than it could hope to face in a surprise invasion scenario, but Beijing might also calculate that the threat of invasion could reduce the willingness of the US-led coalition to push matters to full-scale war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time-space relationships could also be central to any PRC isolation approach. The PRC appears to believe it is developing a strong network of collaborators and fellow travelers in Taiwan and that its own political warfare elements on the island may be able to paralyze initial Taiwanese responses and quickly sap the island’s will to resist. An isolation strategy would almost certainly begin with the successful isolation of the island by air and sea; any response to break blockades or quarantines would likely take days or weeks to negotiate and then bring into effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial shock of isolation could engender strong psychological effects, especially if China manages to cut Taiwan’s internet connectivity and other means of communicating with the outside world. Beijing might calculate that its efforts and agents could bring Taiwan to surrender before the US is able to break through Taiwan’s isolation. The PRC leadership is moderately likely to be wrong in such a calculation; overestimating one’s ability to break the will of an adversary is one of the most common mistakes in coercion and compellence strategies. But miscalculation would change the outcome, not the decision to make the attempt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Beijing pursued an isolation strategy, it would undermine the prospects of an immediate escalation to full-scale attack. But this approach is still attractive as it offers the possibility of achieving Beijing’s aims without having to engage in a complicated amphibious invasion. An isolation strategy poses a potentially higher risk that the PRC might have to back down in an embarrassing fashion, but it offsets that risk by offering a climbdown before major hostilities break out and therefore before China suffers significant combat losses. It also flows most naturally from the long-standing persuasion and coercion campaigns China has been pursuing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Invasion.&lt;/strong&gt; Xi might nevertheless decide not to bother with isolation efforts, instead driving straight toward his final objective via invasion. The Chinese idealized version of this strategy would of course be attractive to Beijing: A brief period of increased tension covers the execution of well-planned and rehearsed PLA mobilization for an invasion. A short air-missile campaign shatters Taiwan’s defense and government structures while Chinese political warfare agents on the island become active, wrecking any hope of coherent Taiwanese preparations for defense. The massive Chinese fleet sweeps quickly across the strait and begins disembarking troops and vehicles onto Taiwanese beaches almost before Taipei knows what’s happening, and Chinese troops raise the PRC flag over government buildings in Taipei while policymakers in Washington and Tokyo debate what to do. Xi makes a speech from the Presidential Office in Taipei, and “splittism” is forever defeated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is unlikely that even Xi seriously entertains this fantasy. The statements and actions of American and Japanese leaders and officials offer no reason for Xi to be confident that the US and Japan (or Australia) would stand idly by and watch this spectacle. On the contrary, from the PRC’s perspective, President Joe Biden has been setting informational and military conditions to prepare to defend Taiwan against an invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi has clearly also been observing the disastrous Russian invasion of Ukraine that highlighted additional factors of concern. The Russians thought they had thoroughly penetrated Ukrainian society and government with their own agents and fellow travelers and built a campaign on the assumption that Ukrainians would not fight. They were wrong on all counts. The Russians also wildly overestimated their own military capabilities and competence and underestimated the inevitable effects of battlefield friction. The PLA is almost certainly more competent and able to handle friction than the Potemkin army with which Russia invaded, but friction is real in any war and the more so in complex large-scale amphibious invasions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese military leaders and Xi himself must therefore take seriously the possibilities that Taiwan will fight and that the political warfare efforts on the island will be only partially successful, that the US and its allies will respond with force rapidly and determinedly, that the PLA will not perform optimally, and, even if nothing else does, that the friction inherent in war will lead to setbacks and losses. None of these observations are groundbreaking. They serve only to say that Xi must recognize the high risks associated with invading Taiwan — unless he is a thoroughgoing fool, which he does not in any way appear to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear enough that an island of 24 million people cannot hope to defeat the massed forces of a country of 1.4 billion. The best that Taiwan on its own could hope would be to inflict painful losses on an invading Chinese force. Properly equipped and determined to fight, Taiwan might be able to do so. We shall set aside further consideration of this aspect of the scenario, however, to focus on those that are more dangerous to Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debate roils the US national security establishment about America’s capacity to stop a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. Some argue that the PLA’s ballistic, cruise, and now hypersonic missiles render America’s aircraft carriers hopelessly vulnerable and that China’s air and missile arsenal and A2AD systems force the US to rely on bases far from Taiwan and on long-range standoff missiles alone, ultimately dooming any chance the US might have to stop the attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much hinges in these scenarios on when and whether Beijing would attack US bases at Guam and Okinawa, at least, and on assumptions about America’s ability to use bases in South Korea and the Japanese home islands. If the US retains the ability to use Guam and Okinawa, so the reasoning often goes, then it might be able to challenge the PLA’s ability to cross the strait or at least to impose losses that Beijing would find unbearable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These discussions are important for considerations of invasion scenarios. One struggles to recall a successful amphibious invasion in the era of combat aircraft conducted without at least localized air supremacy. Amphibious ships are large, vulnerable targets whose sinking entails the deaths of hundreds or thousands of soldiers and the loss of large amounts of vehicles and supplies. Few if any militaries have been willing to risk sailing them to shore in the face of enemy aircraft or an enemy’s ability to concentrate volumes of high-payload munitions on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China cannot deprive the US of all ability to strike a PLA landing force. Long-range stealth bombers can refuel out of the A2AD bubble and fire missiles, some of which will almost surely hit and destroy their targets. US attack submarines and other platforms can fire volleys of cruise missiles that PLA air defenses will not completely shoot down. If China invades and the US is determined to defend Taiwan, the PLA will take losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scale and consequences of those losses depend heavily, however, on whether the US can use its carriers and regional bases. The more of those assets the American military can use, the more severe the damage it can impose on the invasion force, possibly up to and including its destruction. That is one of the reasons many discussions of a Chinese invasion scenario assume that the PLA would attack US bases on Guam and Okinawa, at least, and possibly on the Japanese home islands. They often assume that South Korea would not allow the US to use its bases on the Korean Peninsula in a war that, in principle, interests Seoul very little.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese military technocrats would likely prefer to begin the attack in this fashion and deprive the US of as much regional capacity as possible. The geostrategic advisability of doing so, however, rests on political rather than military considerations. Would the US absorb an attack on Guam and not thereafter regard itself as at war with China? Would Tokyo regard attacks on US bases on Japanese territory as bilateral US-China affairs that do not constitute acts of war against Japan? Would the US, having lost immediate use of its other regional bases, not activate the US–Republic of Korea mutual defense treaty (which, unlike the US treaty with Japan, actually is mutual and obliges Seoul to come to the aid of the US if the US is attacked in the region)? Would Seoul refuse that activation, thereby risking the loss of its most important ally?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As both Russia and the allies have learned, no prewar assumption holds after a war begins. Ukraine’s fighting will is beyond what analysts imagined before the conflict, the US and NATO are equipping Ukraine far beyond what was thought possible, Washington has reinforced NATO forces on the eastern flank, and there are now two new NATO members under consideration. Turning back to Asia, it is hard to imagine South Korea wanting to remain neutral once Australia, Japan, and the US (and possibly some other NATO countries) are in the fight; in a scenario in which US ships, territory, and allies are struck, the US will likely pay whatever price its allies Thailand and the Philippines demand for the use of their airspace and bases in their territory. The issue of South Korean sympathy for Taiwan (or lack thereof) is a red herring. Seoul will have to make decisions in the context of the viability of its long-term reliance on the US and America’s allies — and the possible impact of refusing US requests for help on that reliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surely Xi and his lieutenants have considered the geopolitical consequences of trying to succeed operationally. If not, the China problem may be bigger than most analysts realize. In that case, either Xi is as isolated and delusional as Putin was before invading Ukraine, and therefore is undeterrable, or his grand strategic objectives have changed. From building up comprehensive national power and making incremental gains to undermine US alliances and reshape the world order, Xi would have transformed his grand strategy into one of forcefully obtaining hegemony in Asia. If Xi’s objectives have changed in such a fashion, then the US should not be preparing to counter only an invasion of Taiwan but rather a series of Chinese campaigns for hegemony. The assumption of this report is that China’s strategy toward Taiwan is part of a unification campaign, a close cousin of the successful Hong Kong, Tibet, and Xinjiang campaigns, and that any other gains Xi thinks he can secure from successful unification are secondary and opportunistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might restate these considerations more straightforwardly. A PRC invasion plan that relies on attacking Guam and US positions in Japan early in the conflict would immediately bring China into open war with the US, Japan, and possibly South Korea. US policy analysts might broodingly fear that the US and its regional allies would allow even such attacks to glance off them from a geopolitical standpoint and work to treat the war as a “Taiwan crisis” with no larger ramifications. We needn’t get into that argument ourselves to observe that Xi would, again, be a complete fool to be confident of such a response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Serious political and military leaders in Beijing must thus consider that a decision to invade Taiwan immediately confronts them with a second extremely thorny decision: Either Xi accepts the much greater risks to the success of the military operation if China does not attack US bases at once, or he must accept the real possibility that the limited invasion of Taiwan could rapidly become a full-scale regional or even global war with the US and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;An invasion would be an extraordinarily risky undertaking to any Chinese leader not besotted with his own power and deluded by stupid or dishonest generals and political advisers.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do not by any means intend to suggest that Xi might not decide that either risk is acceptable; he might. We certainly do not mean to say that strong and prompt US responses or US and American-allied escalations are certain or would be successful. Those arguing that, as things stand today, China could invade Taiwan and the US couldn’t stop the invasion might be right. Calls for increasing America’s military capabilities to defeat such a Chinese attack at acceptable costs to the US and its allies are surely cogent and should be heeded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even this cursory examination of some of the invasion-scenario implications suggests that it would be an extraordinarily risky undertaking to any Chinese leader not besotted with his own power and deluded by stupid or dishonest generals and political advisers. Most leaders would prefer less risky approaches that offer the promise of securing the same outcome at lower cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;US policy therefore cannot accept as a given that Xi is simply preparing to invade and that, when the PLA is ready, he will. We must instead reopen the aperture to see other plausible roads Xi could take to seizing Taiwan and develop strategies to block all of them rather than focusing on only one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;implications&quot;&gt;Implications&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This discussion would be of merely academic interest if preparations to defeat the cross-Strait invasion also included blocking the persuasion, coercion, and isolation-compellence roads. Unfortunately, though, the approaches generally advocated to stop the invasion actively undermine efforts to block Xi’s other roads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the invasion scenario is the only one the US and its allies plan to block, the temptation will grow to pull back from the Chinese A2AD bubble, abandon reliance on Guam and Okinawa, and focus on increasing America’s long-range strike capabilities. Maximizing perceived operational effectiveness would override geopolitical necessity. Such a move would potentiate the PRC’s persuasion, coercion, and isolation efforts. It could be the case that these efforts actually enhance America’s ability to defend Taiwan and therefore increase the likelihood the US would come to Taiwan’s defense, although we question both assumptions. But would it seem that way to the Taiwanese?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual optics of that strategy involve withdrawing visible US presence from the near vicinity of Taiwan, after all. The more imminent war becomes, under this approach, the faster US carrier battle groups steam away from the island, the more US strike aircraft fly north and west from Okinawa and Guam, and the more American military bases throughout the region move into defensive rather than offensive postures. The Taiwanese would be remarkable people indeed to observe those phenomena, see the growing concentration of Chinese military assets around their island, and conclude that they should be ready to fight to the death, confident that America will be with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Openly accepting the premise that US carriers cannot survive Chinese attacks also means openly stating that moving carriers toward Taiwan, Japan, or through the strait is always an American bluff and should not be seen as a serious demonstration of Washington’s willingness or ability to fight. The utility of such freedom of navigation operations could be questioned in any event, but accepting the widely held premises about the poor US prospects for defeating a cross-Strait invasion today makes them worse than meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These discussions all tend to undermine the likely effectiveness of any strategies the US and its partners might develop to try to block the persuasion and coercion roads to the conquest of Taiwan, but they don’t preclude the construction and implementation of such strategies. Even advocates of the standoff approach to defending Taiwan against invasion, after all, generally agree that the US should develop such counterstrategies even if they also generally dismiss the significance of Chinese persuasion and coercion campaigns through their confidence that invasion is inevitable and even imminent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most serious problem with focusing narrowly on preventing the cross-Strait invasion from standoff ranges is that it almost invites Xi to try the isolation strategy. Breaking blockades requires presence. The US certainly could use long-range precision weapons to sink Chinese ships blocking or interfering with merchant vessels trying to move into and out of Taiwan’s ports — until those Chinese ships move too close to those merchant vessels to permit their safe destruction. And driving PLAAF aircraft out of Taiwan’s skies is not likely a task that can be undertaken from far-over-the-horizon bases except by destroying all the PLAAF bases on the mainland from which such operations are conducted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even assuming that that is a feasible military undertaking, it nevertheless would move the US rapidly toward the tremendously escalatory step of conducting a large-scale air attack on the Chinese homeland. Any approach to breaking the blockade with standoff munitions, finally, requires the US to use an immediate lethal approach to respond to a Chinese effort conducted, possibly, with less-than-lethal force. It could put the responsibility for escalating to a shooting war on the US, even though China created the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main problem with approaches seeking to break a blockade from standoff distances is not that doing so is impossible but rather that promising to do so is insufficiently credible. It is almost impossible to imagine a scenario in which the Chinese begin to interfere with Taiwan’s communications and trade with the rest of the world, whereafter the US instantly responds by sinking Chinese ships. Beijing’s isolation strategy would almost inevitably have some time to work before a serious US response along these lines even started — let alone before it succeeded, if it could. Xi might miscalculate the odds of securing Taiwan’s concession in that interval, as we have observed above, but the relatively low risks he would run compared with those entailed in a full-scale invasion make it more plausible that he would accept the risk of miscalculation here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a solution to the conundrum these challenges pose to the US: Design a counterinvasion strategy that includes a counter-isolation strategy. The far-over-the-horizon counterinvasion strategy is a problem only if it precludes or excludes counterisolation efforts. The US should and, indeed, must have far-over-the-horizon capabilities in any scenario. But it must also develop ways to operate within China’s A2AD zone, including within the range of China’s hypersonic missiles. It must be able to meet a Chinese blockade effort centered on nonlethal force with a nonlethal counter-isolation effort of its own. It must avoid the optics of withdrawing its military power from the theater as the threat of Chinese attack grows and instead, ideally, create the object of credible military power flowing toward Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recognize that these demands are easy to make and hard to meet. We have no specific suggestions to offer about how to do so technically or tactically. Our purpose in this report, rather, is to say that actually keeping Taiwan free is even harder than it seems to many. We cannot reduce the problem to one specific scenario, and we actually must focus on solving extraordinarily hard military problems to enable strategies that can defeat not only the most dangerous courses of action Beijing might pursue but also the most likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late January 2023, RUSI’s Centre for Financial Crime and Security Studies (CFCS) hosted a roundtable in partnership with the Polish Institute of International Affairs in Warsaw. The discussion, held under the Chatham House rule, gathered representatives from government ministries and agencies, the private sector – including banking institutions, law firms and consulting companies – and civil society. The event was part of RUSI’s ongoing study of EU sanctions implementation and wider responses to illicit finance (Euro SIFMANet) funded by the National Endowment for Democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-polish-legal-framework&quot;&gt;The Polish Legal Framework&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roundtable opened with a candid statement from representatives of Poland’s public sector, who noted that before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, pressure to implement EU sanctions was low, as they had little or no connection with either the strategic goals of Polish foreign policy, or with individuals/entities and their assets in Poland. In view of the limited scope of those sanctions, this included the sanctions imposed on Russia in 2014. This lack of focus was also reflected by private sector participants, with one representative of the legal sector noting that sanctions had not featured in their work on transaction due diligence, despite the presence of a range of EU sanctions regimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, sanctions on Russia since February 2022 have brought to the fore the need to increase Poland’s capabilities to facilitate their implementation. Participants from the public sector stated that Poland has now cut off all reliance on Russia for its energy supply and severed most links to Russian businesses, a process termed by one participant as the ’de-russification’ of the Polish economy. With only 2.8% of Polish exports heading to Russia, Poland already had relatively limited connections with the Russian economy (for example, the country does twice as much trade with the Czech Republic as it does with Russia). In the view of roundtable participants, this limited economic connection with Russia is partly related to the countersanctions Russia has applied to Poland, for example on agricultural products. Still, following Poland’s commitment to effectively implement sanctions to weaken Russia’s capacity to fund and resource its military capabilities, the country has introduced new legislation relating to sanctions. This legal strengthening is underpinned by firm social support for countering Russian aggression against Ukraine, which incentivises both the public and private sectors to apply an unambiguous approach to sanctions implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More specifically, representatives from the Polish public sector emphasised that Poland complies not only with UN and EU sanctions, but also with UK and US sanctions, as many transactions are conducted in those countries’ currencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of the EU’s sanctions regulations and designations, in 2022 Poland introduced additional legislation offering ‘specific solutions in counteracting the promotion of aggression against Ukraine and serving to protect national security’. A representative from the National Revenue Administration (NRA) provided a detailed description of the country’s new legislative framework, in which the Ministry of Finance is charged with implementing sanctions, and can impose administrative penalties for non-compliance. Within this ministry, the NRA has the most resources to take charge of these issues and is tasked with the supervision of sanctions implementation. However, multiple other agencies have relevant competencies in the national sanctions framework. Customs authorities monitor the transit of goods, and local customs offices can conduct audits and impose administrative penalties. And while the Financial Supervisory Authority audits the financial sector, the Ministry of Economic Development and Technology issues licences for trade on armaments and dual-use goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the novelties introduced by the new legislation was the creation of a national sanctions list. The national list is managed by the Ministry of the Interior and aims to include names of persons and entities beyond those listed by the EU. In order to identify potential additions to the domestic list, Polish authorities look into entities that are not on the EU list but are identified as having Russian or Belarusian shareholders or board members. To this end, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) shares the list with Polish embassies abroad to get further information from the countries they are based in. There are currently 38 individuals and 39 entities on Poland’s national sanctions list. The representative from the NRA at the roundtable noted that some of the listed entities are companies with known links to high-profile Russian individuals established in Poland through the Netherlands, Singapore and Switzerland. The same authority explained that listing has reportedly had a meaningful impact on these companies, with some closing overnight as a result, leading to bankruptcy proceedings. In a testament to Poland’s efforts, representatives from the public sector estimated that assets amounting to €1 billion have been frozen in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As described by the NRA representative, the new sanctions Acts also imposed a national embargo on coal from Russia and Belarus, and introduced administrative penalties for non-compliance, which can amount to 20 million zlotys (around €4.2 million) and prison sentences of three to 15 years. Furthermore, Poland has also introduced new tools such as temporary compulsory administration, which was created to manage the frozen assets of entities subject to sanctions. This legal tool can be used to provide support to the workplaces of sanctioned entities, in order to enable business operations that serve a public utility to keep running, or to protect national economic interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants from the public sector were keen to emphasise that Poland is an active contributor of sanctions proposals to the EU and stated that Poland is widely regarded among member states as a good source of sanctions ideas that, they argued, would result in the design of new packages of EU restrictive measures, if not immediately, then certainly at a later date. They believe that the delay in integrating Poland’s ideas into packages at the EU level impacts the effectiveness of those packages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, a government representative described Poland as a ‘good runner’ in implementing sanctions, but emphasised that the implementation of sanctions is a ‘relay race’, in which Poland needs the member states that have closer economic links with Russia to pick up the baton of commitment to effectively implement sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;challenges-to-implementation&quot;&gt;Challenges to Implementation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;National authorities estimate the level of non-compliance among Polish businesses to be very low. In fact, representatives from the public sector added that the country’s main problem is over-compliance beyond what is legally mandated, especially from financial institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To assess the level of compliance, representatives from Poland’s financial intelligence unit (FIU) explained that the unit conducts audits and onsite inspections of obliged entities in both financial and non-financial sectors. The majority of investigations are related to customs fraud and the creation of fake customs codes. Under the new sanctions mandate, sanctions inspections have become an add-on to general anti-money-laundering inspections, and authorities have completed two inspections, with three more currently underway. Inspected institutions are most commonly banks, payment service providers, logistics companies and art dealers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative from the FIU explained that currently around seven to nine entities are suspected of having breached sanctions but noted that most of them are not Polish. A representative of another public authority added that some of these identified entities are Dutch companies transferring goods to a sanctioned Russian entity, and that their organisation is now investigating whether this was done intentionally. In this case, the source of information was the customs authorities, who have access to information related to the transfer of goods and were supported by the contribution of financial intelligence from Georgia regarding capital transfers to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, despite Poland’s efforts, participants from the public sector acknowledged that the country faces challenges in the implementation of sanctions. In particular, there are struggles with multi-layered corporate structures, and authorities described a recent example in which they identified a company that had been established in Poland by a Russian oligarch as a subsidiary of a company based in the British Virgin Islands. Representatives from both public and private sectors voiced their intention to be proactive in these operations, but reported that they sometimes face difficulties identifying these complex cases. Participants from the public sector explained that they try to reach out to the intelligence community to obtain relevant information, but its confidential nature means that this information cannot be shared with businesses. For this reason, the introduction of national sanctions lists has proved helpful as a means of alerting the private sector to individuals and entities of concern and enabling the freezing of their assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another challenge highlighted by the public sector was the confiscation of frozen assets. Representatives of public authorities explained that legal barriers continue to hinder confiscation, for example, the need to identify a connection to a criminal offence. They added that they often receive questions about the low number of assets frozen in Poland, but they explained that this matches the fact that there are very few Polish entities listed in EU sanctions lists, and trade between Poland and Russia is limited. The introduction of a domestic list aims to facilitate improvements in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, despite the confidence of the country’s public authorities in their work, representatives from the private sector voiced concerns over a lack of clarity in the sanctions rules themselves and noted that there were issues related to interpretation of these measures. Participants noted that freezing accounts is simple, but freezing tangible property presents added difficulties. Similarly, it was considered unclear as to what the approach should be in the case of a company where only a small portion of the shares is held by a sanctioned oligarch. These doubts were described by representatives from the banking sector as a major source of uncertainty for businesses, which fear not only the financial penalties associated with facilitating sanctions evasion, but also the reputational implications, the latter being described by a representative from a law firm as the primary driver of sanctions implementation in the private sector. The same participant also observed that sanctions had brought an unexpected bonus in some cases, as they could be used to trigger ‘force majeure’ on contracts that their clients wanted to terminate with Russian clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative from the MFA explained that the ministry had received around 2,000 requests from the private sector for support on interpretation of sanctions regulations, and noted that they had replied to most of them, with the most common questions (and accompanying answers) published on the Ministry of Finance’s website. In contrast, the private sector expressed disappointment at the lack of outreach from the public sector and explained that, while information might be public, authorities should nevertheless approach businesses to raise awareness, provide guidance and support their implementation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representatives across all sectors also shared concerns related to the evasion risks posed by transactions with regional neighbours of Russia such as Turkey, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and China. Representatives of Polish public authorities added that they are unable to collect information from entities abroad without the support of the authorities in the relevant jurisdiction, who can of course refuse to cooperate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representatives from the MFA described foreign direct investment (FDI) as a powerful tool to circumvent sanctions, through mechanisms such as the ‘citizen by investment’ schemes (also known as ‘golden passports’). Participants from both public and private sectors also discussed the use of active financial measures, whereby a rival can make strategic use of investments or donations into another state’s economy to gain influence in that society with the underlying intention of undermining its stability. These concerns make the screening of FDI an essential task, and yet participants complained that there is no unified procedure on FDI at EU level. Instead, FDI screening is at the discretion of individual member states, whose current approach, according to the Polish MFA, is to primarily look into investments in specific sectors, such as security or national infrastructure. However, these sectors are not the only ones that can present opportunities for bad actors to gain influence over another country, with participants from both public and private sectors expressing unease about foreign actors financing the targeting of civil society, donating to cultural and educational institutions, or funding extremist political campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representatives of national authorities explained that they are currently awaiting a judgment from the European Court of Justice regarding Malta’s ‘golden passport’ scheme, also noting that loopholes in the Austrian scheme remain and have not yet been investigated. The EU is taking small steps to regulate investment schemes, through non-binding guidelines rather than via direct regulation. In fact, a representative from the MFA stated that efforts made to improve FDI screening and increase information-sharing come predominantly from the private sector. In this regard, the MFA representative recognised that Poland needs to improve its tools and analytical models to make sure no business under its jurisdiction has connections to a listed entity either in the country or abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;roundtable-recommendations&quot;&gt;Roundtable Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants from the public sector expressed a belief that the most significant restrictive measures issued by the EU have been already adopted and there is little need for new sanctions; however, implementation is key and thus the main proposal from this sector is to focus on closing loopholes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision by the EU to de-SWIFT Russian banks was an impactful measure. However, not all Russian banks were banned from SWIFT, which undercuts effectiveness and – as noted in previous SIFMANet roundtables – leaves open a loophole for abuse. A proposal put forth by the Polish MFA during the roundtable was to de-SWIFT all remaining Russian banks. However, representatives from all sectors predicted possible pushback in some cases, noting the reluctance of countries such as Germany or Italy to take measures against Gazprombank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representatives from the private sector also agreed on the need to target professional enablers, such as lawyers and accountants, within member states. These actors are supposed to be gatekeepers of the EU’s financial system but, without adequate regulation, they often serve to facilitate active financial measures from rival states and advance the interests of hostile actors in undermining the security and stability of the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants from both public and private sectors also voiced concerns over the lack of available measures for taking steps against third countries for hosting Russian assets and/or facilitating evasion. The same participants did note the latest steps taken by the EU towards allowing for the sanctioning of third-country entities, in the most recent revision of Regulation 269. However, representatives from the public sector added that they expect challenges in achieving consensus among all 27 member states over imposing these sanctions, given a historical aversion to extra-territoriality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeking to provide new creative proposals, participants from the private sector discussed leveraging the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) to further restrict Russian business. CBAM is a mechanism, expected to be operational from October 2023, through which non-EU businesses must fulfil the climate standards applicable to EU member states in order to import goods into the Union. However, several participants from the public and private sectors doubted the viability of using this tool for the implementation of sanctions, given that its mandate is entirely for environmental purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion also addressed the possibility of instrumentalising the debt that third countries, such as Serbia or Bosnia, have with the EU or the IMF as a means of applying pressure to encourage their compliance with sanctions. However, participants discussed the likelihood that this step would meet countermeasures from affected countries. For example, Turkey could leverage its migrant deal with the EU in retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, attendees agreed that it is crucial to keep political attention and pressure sustained over time to make sanctions effective. To succeed, public sector participants highlighted the need to improve the communication and publicity around sanctions, in particular the impact they are having in restricting the Russian economy, to encourage both citizens and private businesses to commit the necessary resources to ensure sanctions are implemented effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（6日）踏入審訊第20天。區諾軒今繼續接受盤問，庭上首次披露他今年1月在獄中向鄭達鴻撰寫的私人信件，區形容鄭達鴻被公民黨「連累」，又指若非公民黨忽然「搶疆」開記者會（會上楊岳橋承諾若政府不回應五大訴求，會否決所有議案及財政預算案致特首下台），他和李予信的處境會截然不同。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒又確認，港島區僅在首次會議談及否決預算案，而協調機制初稿文件稱「會積極」運用權力否決僅是戴耀廷看法，用以「迎合」不同意見，「叫唔上係一個共識」；又同意即使初選條款字眼為「會」運用權力否決預算案，也不代表參選人會「無差別」否決，指「狄志遠最近都話佢否決財政預算案」，有被告發笑。法官又問及，當時有沒有參選人認為不應綑綁對否決預算案的立場，區表示：「總有人冇表態，疑點利益應該歸於被告」，多名被告大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒主動補充沈旭暉35交流會-指沈與戴概念好唔同-只望立會過半&quot;&gt;區諾軒主動補充沈旭暉35+交流會 指沈與戴「概念好唔同」 只望立會過半&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒上周五下午開始，接受代表鄭達鴻及梁國雄的資深大律師潘熙盤問，區提及公民黨因有人參選功能組別，對否決財政預算案表達擔心。區諾軒今坐下後即舉起右手，主動向法官提出，想就早前供詞做一點修正和補充。修正方面，區諾軒早前曾稱港島區於2020年6月舉行第4次會議，當時戴耀廷着與會者由一人投4票轉為投1票。區今更正港島於6月並無會議，「4票轉1票」的決定是在5月17日的會議作出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於補充，區上周五曾提及沈旭暉於2020年3月舉行35+交流會，他今指望在辯方盤問前，「完整地講返一次沈旭暉35+交流會個發展。」區指，在2020年，「35+」說法不止戴耀廷有講，沈旭暉亦曾在報章提及，「但個概念係好唔同， 沈旭暉只係期望民主派立會過半。」區指，沈約於3月招聚了一班有興趣參選功能組別的人士作意見交流，該些人後來定期有交流意見，區本人亦有參與其中，包括工程界黃偉信、批發及零售界張秀賢、飲食界林瑞華，及進出口界的本案被告林景楠，但區補充林在6月19日「突然轉為想選新界東」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指功能組別參選人指支持35-但不支持綑綁對預算案立場&quot;&gt;區指功能組別參選人指支持35+ 但不支持綑綁對預算案立場&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區指，除林景楠外，其餘各人在7月初陸續召開記者會或表明有意參選，並曾向他表示：「佢哋都支持35+，但係佢哋唔支持就住財政預算案嘅立場有一個捆綁」，並記得黃偉信曾公開講過反對無差別否決財政預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在法官李運騰詢問下，區諾軒指沈只是舉行過首次交流會，之後並無出席功能界別的定期會面，但區本人則有參與其中。他並確認，此為早前在法庭供稱，對否決預算案「有唔同意見」的功能組別參選人士，但不包括衞生服務界，戴耀廷亦只曾就地區直選和超級區議會舉辦協調會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指林瑞華表達對否決預算案有兩難-但不肯定幾大程度代表黨&quot;&gt;區指林瑞華表達對否決預算案有兩難 但不肯定幾大程度代表黨&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉一度問區是否完成補充，區指「想做埋個結尾」，有被告發笑。區並補充除黃偉信外，至於其他參選功能組別人士有否公開表達反對否決預算案，「因為我還柙兩年，就掌握唔到相關資料。」法官李運騰指他們更關注2020年的情況，區續指是望回答上周潘熙有關公民黨否決預算案立場的問題，並指儘管公民黨於3月25日舉行記者會，但林瑞華想法「一路都係有顧及業界利益」，並曾向他表達過「對於否決預算案有兩難」，惟區指，林的說法「幾大程度代表個黨」需要更多論據支持，柯耀林和彭卓棋等人發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方向區諾軒確認錄影謄本內容-遭官打斷指毋需發問&quot;&gt;辯方向區諾軒確認錄影謄本內容 遭官打斷指毋需發問&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;資深大律師潘熙其後引述錄影會面謄本，區曾指新界東第二次會議前，社民連黃浩銘曾致電他，指不要胡亂答應就否決預算案達成共識，謄本寫區理解似乎已有人醞釀向大會「逼供」。潘熙欲澄清區的意思是否「逼宮」，惟法官陳慶偉打斷指「OK, move on」，法官陳仲衡亦指意思很明顯，毋需提問，陳慶偉着他要問適合（sensible）的問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙其後又引區諾軒有關九龍西協調會議的錄影會面謄本，指岑子杰曾表示「講抗爭，大家點會唔諗起社民連，不過社民連都係一個濟弱扶傾嘅政黨」，又指不能承諾必定否決財政預算案，因若政府有民生項目如全民退保，「社民連係要贊成。」潘熙向區確認供詞是否正確，惟陳慶偉打斷指已聽取過相關證供，看不到謄本與庭上供詞有任何分別，又指潘熙是資深大律師。陳仲衡亦指「move on」是要「move forward」，不是要兜圈。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;港島協調機制初稿稱會積極用權否決預算案-區確認非與會者共識&quot;&gt;港島協調機制初稿稱「會積極」用權否決預算案 區確認非與會者共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙其後就港島區3月26日首次協調會議發問，指當時戴耀廷雖提及「積極」運用權力否決預算案，但會上是否沒有就此達成共識，法官陳慶偉即指司馬文表達反對。潘熙同意，但指他想知道會議最終是否無達成任何共識，因區諾軒似乎沒有清楚表達。法官陳慶偉指「這是完全清楚的」，陳仲衡亦指他一直理解會上無共識。陳慶偉並向潘熙指，「重複與說服是兩個概念。（“Repetition and persuasion are two different concepts.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙其後再引區諾軒錄影會面謄本，提及九龍西第二次會議後，他與戴耀廷和趙家賢曾就否決財政預算案的立場討論，區曾指民主黨和社民連表達關注，認為戴「冇理由唔理唔同人嘅睇法而去表達一個咁激進立場」，戴耀廷回覆用「積極」一字，能讓參與者有「唔去否決嘅空間」。潘熙續向區諾軒展示「35+立會過半計劃 民主派港島協調機制（初稿）」的文件，提及「會積極」運用權力否決財政預算案字眼，區確認戴是於首次協調會議後直接傳予他，及向他指有傳予其他參與者，但「那時沒有（港島區 WhatsApp 群）組」，「我唔知佢有冇妥為發畀其他人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙續問，該份文件是否並非代表會上的共識，法官李運騰指該文件涵蓋很多內容，認為潘應想就第二段提問，可直接發問，法官陳慶偉亦提醒「一個籠統的問題只是會換來一個籠統的答案（“A general question attracts a general answer.”）」。潘續改問，文件第二段是否並非會上共識。該段提及參與協調者「認同若民主派能取得立法會一半以上的議席，會積極運用立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案，迫使特首回應五大訴求，特赦抗爭者、令相關人士為警暴問責、及重啟政改以達雙普選。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒稱港島僅首次會議觸及否決預算案-叫唔上係一個共識&quot;&gt;區諾軒稱港島僅首次會議觸及否決預算案 「叫唔上係一個共識」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區確認不是與會人士的共識，「因為會議入面有異議」。法官李運騰續指，有趣的是文件名為港島協調機制初稿，但事實上會上並無共識，問區是否知道為何戴耀廷加入該段。區回應，「我會話呢個係戴耀廷嘅共識，就唔係參與者嘅共識」，彭卓棋、陳志全等被告發笑。李運騰指他不明白，因「共識」意指最少兩個人的共識，如何能說是戴耀廷自己有共識。區遂指，因會議過程，「我相信我都講得比較清楚，就係佢（戴耀廷）見到有異議，就用呢個字眼去統攝唔同人嘅觀點。」林卓廷疑惑反問：「統攝？」鄒家成、彭卓棋等發笑。法官陳仲衡提議用「accommodate」翻譯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙續問，是否即戴耀廷希望其他人同意但卻沒有共識，區同意。潘續問，在第二及第三次協調會議後，與會者就否決預算案是否最終沒有達成共識，區回應：「第一次會議有討論，但之後冇再觸及，所以叫唔上係一個共識。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒稱戴耀廷用會積極字眼統攝不同人觀點-後改用迎合&quot;&gt;區諾軒稱戴耀廷用「會積極」字眼「統攝」不同人觀點 後改用「迎合」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後庭上再提到「accommodate」，傳譯主任一度猶豫如何翻譯，區指可用「統攝」，並說「我忽然諗唔到一啲更簡單嘅字，對唔住」。法官李運騰一度提議用「summarize and capture」，法官陳慶偉則問：「Which 統、which 攝？」林卓廷等被告大笑，區指是「統治個統，收攝個攝、攝影個攝」，再致歉指「諗唔到更易嘅字」。陳慶偉續指，很少聽過此字，認為統指「統一」、攝指「震懾」，或有威嚇控制的意思，又說：「You see, I want to 『統攝』 my staff.」區笑指「我都被威脅」。區其後指，認為以「迎合（accommodate）」來表達其想法較恰當。潘熙一度提議用「包容」，惟陳慶偉再打斷：「No, thank you, next.」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;下午休庭後，法官陳仲衡指在午飯時搜尋「統攝」意思，發現有「to exercise control over」或「to govern」的意思，區重申認為「迎合（accommodate）」是較切合的說法，並確認他今早證供應指「迎合」，而非「統攝」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒曾受訪指候選人對35有兩種不同想像&quot;&gt;區諾軒曾受訪指候選人對35+有兩種不同想像&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙其後展示區諾軒2020年4月的 Facebook 帖文，轉載《蘋果日報》的訪問〈【立法會選舉】民主派或五區齊初選定出線權 區諾軒：以「35+」否定中共極權路線〉，提及：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;「區稱，按其觀察，不同派系代表都期望未來能於選舉組合出基本綱領，但具體做法仍未有共識，指公眾或候選人都對『35+』有兩種不同想像。」⋯⋯「其一是透過議會過半提高民主派的議價能力及政治力量，爭取五大訴求，『至於點樣爭取係冇人傾落去嘅，亦都好難去傾，因為牽涉到到時個政治局勢係點』。另一種是不惜攬炒，否決《財政預算案》等向北京施壓，『寧願你（北京）做得最赤祼，咁你唔好再令香港存有任何幻想』。」&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒稱簽署墨落無悔減低參選人模糊性走盞空間&quot;&gt;區諾軒稱簽署「墨落無悔」減低參選人「模糊性」、「走盞」空間&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙問，以區理解，是否傳統泛民抱有第一種想像，區同意。法官陳慶偉問是否包括公民黨，區則稱公民黨3月25日召開記者會，「我好難將佢哋歸類落去呢個類入面。」庭上早前播放片段，時任公民黨黨魁楊岳橋曾在記者會承諾若政府不回應五大訴求，公民黨將否決所有議案及財政預算，令行政長官解散立法會重選及辭職。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/wYAJZEB.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 資料圖片：楊岳橋（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙續問，以區理解，能否說該兩種想法於整個初選過程也持續？區則指兩種立場的角力到6月有變化，「特別係墨落無悔嘅簽署出台啦」，但同意聲明出台後該角力仍然存在。法官陳慶偉問及「墨落無悔」聲明有何意義，區重申民主派有不同光譜的人，「如果有一啲聯署要人表態，會減低個模糊性。」法官李運騰問「模糊性」是否指「彈性」、有空間「走盞」，區同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區認有候選人提及必定否決財案-惟不肯定誰說&quot;&gt;區認有候選人提及「必定」否決財案 惟不肯定誰說&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙其後展示新界西協調機制文件，區諾軒早前供稱只有該區用「會」運用權力否決預算案而非「會積極」，認為「會」的意思較為確定。潘熙問2020年3月至6月是否有不同人提議不同字眼，區指看不到其他人在4月至5月時「係咁關注個字眼問題」，指首次出現是新界東5月5日的第二次會議，圍繞使用「會」抑或「會積極」，而「會積極」一字較早出現。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙續問，是否有其他候選人曾指「必定會否決財政預算案」，區指要視乎當時不同人的公開言論，「我好難話邊個真係咁講，以免不公」，傳繹主任一度問「咩話？」，區說「唔……唔好講」，有被告發笑。區其後在法官陳慶偉詢問下，確認當時有被告曾提出相關說法，但他不確實記得是誰說。法官問及是在什麼場合提到，區指在後來的選舉論壇或競選活動，「的確有部分人有呢個咁嘅主張。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問有沒有人認為不應綑綁否決財案立場-區總有人冇表態疑點利益應該歸於被告&quot;&gt;官問有沒有人認為不應綑綁否決財案立場 區：總有人冇表態，疑點利益應該歸於被告&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區在盤問下同意，除了「必定會」、「會」及「會積極」否決預算案，尚有第四種主張，即認為不應綑綁參選人對否決預算案的立場。法官李運騰續問，至6月尾7月初的選舉論壇，還有沒有參選人抱持第四種立場，區答：「總有人冇表態嘅，疑點利益應該歸於被告」，多名被告大笑。法官陳慶偉再問，有沒有人曾明確表示該立場，區指是早前提及的功能組別參選人，但其餘人有否說過則「冇掌握」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙續問，即使只使用「會」而非「會積極」字眼，也不代表必定「無差別」否決預算案？區指「我即時都諗到有三個可能」。潘熙一度指不需知道所有可能性，惟法官陳仲衡提醒屆時控方覆問問及時，辯方便沒機會澄清。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區同意會用權否決預算案不代表會無差別否決&quot;&gt;區同意「會」用權否決預算案不代表會「無差別」否決&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙續容許區解釋，區指該三個可能分別為「我淨係話我會否決財預算案」、「我會否決財政預算案係為咗爭取五大訴求」及「我乜都唔理，總之我點都係否決財政預算案㗎啦」。法官李運騰問及第一和第三的分別，區解釋就第一點，只是說會否決預算案「可以有好多原因 ，重點係你為咗乜」，又指「狄志遠最近都話佢否決財政預算案」，有被告笑說「嘩」。區諾軒最終再同意潘熙指，即使沒有「積極」一字而只用「會」，也不代表當選者必須「無差別」否決預算案，「所以我會話係為乜（否決）。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方展示區諾軒予鄭達鴻信件-指公民黨記招連累鄭及李予信&quot;&gt;辯方展示區諾軒予鄭達鴻信件 指公民黨記招「連累」鄭及李予信&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙其後引述區諾軒今年1月尾寫給鄭達鴻的4頁信件，指控方於2月11日將信件納為「未被使用材料（unused materials）」。庭上展示信件其中一段：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;「港島的狀況幸好較其他區好，但始終主要關鍵，是個人的行為、言論。Michael 多言論上硬傷；Clarisse 較好，我猜，你的關口是黨的活動行為連累吧。作為外人，我是不太明白 CP 的人想什麼。佢地三個 PG + 落口供，他們該有和你交流，你也明白此中邏輯吧？（還是根本各顧各的…）問題是，他們說的內容的程度是不足的，大概不去到實質過程、實據，是不行的（看看我）。（註：需陳述主要犯案事實，為司法提供客觀證據…）這裡便牽涉做人道德問題：己所不欲，勿施於人，盡可能也不該傷害到人。可其實你縱觀各資料之多，令我不時想，究竟有同冇人講，係咪已不太有分別…」&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙問，以區理解，是否即鄭達鴻的行為不如其黨激進，惟法官陳慶偉指潘熙是要求區諾軒就鄭的思想作供，着他問下一條問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙續問，區指鄭被黨行為「連累」是什麼意思，區指若公民黨曾舉辦一些活動，如3月25日記者會，而鄭達鴻又有參加，「咁的確係一個連累嘅意思嚟」。法官陳仲衡提醒，區諾軒如何理解該記者會與法庭如何理解無關，法官陳慶偉亦着他問另一條問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙續引信件最後一頁的一段：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;「不知有否和你說過，區某踏入政壇，伊始自 2007 年 CP 實習計劃，不是 DP… 我決定選 DC 時無揀 CP 去左 DP，多少係不太 buy 好民粹主導的路線，不是說 DP 便好，它有它問題，只是聯想到我們的苦難 —— 若 CP 不是 2020 年 3 月不知想什麼忽然『搶疆』開 press con，汝等處境必截然不同，那不是搶民粹又為何？有必要嗎？這也不是你和信可左右，結果誤了你們。當然，我人生裏連累人的也不少，正如 Margaret 說，民主運動總是牽牽絆絆。展望將來，需要的理論基礎更高，也不是沒想過，這兩年，區某讀了很多中國自由派的書藉，我認為將來倘尚有人有志，該學學錢理群、張千帆、章詒和怎樣在內地生存、知進退。只是，區某氣數已盡，此事一過，能否仍立於天地之間，尚未可知，君亦宜珍重、保重。」&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意，「這也不是你和信可左右」中的「信」指李予信。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被問鄭達鴻有否參與決定召公民黨記者會-區我係一個外人唔知道人哋黨嘅運作&quot;&gt;被問鄭達鴻有否參與決定召公民黨記者會 區：我係一個外人，唔知道人哋黨嘅運作&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙續問就3月25日記者會，區諾軒是否認為鄭達鴻和李予信相較其他公民黨立法會議員譚文豪、郭家麟及楊岳橋，較沒有話語權。法官李運騰指，那是要求證人猜測，反問如何協助其當事人？法官陳慶偉並指若他是潘熙，會問區，舉行記者會是否主要是公民黨黨魁或立法會議員的主意。區答「我係一個外人，我唔知道人哋黨嘅運作」，但「喺得立法會開，就即係立法會議員開啦」。潘熙其後就下一議題發問，惟螢幕仍展示信件，區稱：「不如閂咗封信先啦，如果唔用……私人信件啊」，有被告發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙其後問，區諾軒早前作供曾提及「鬥黃」，會否認為公民黨3月25日記者會亦可歸類為「鬥黃」。主控萬德豪指證人無法回答此問題，法官陳慶偉亦指潘熙可以叫其當事人作供，潘指會認真考慮。潘熙再問，以區理解，鄭達鴻是否被迫參與「鬥黃」，再遭法官阻止，李運騰指若辯方無證據顯示證人對此有個人認知，辯方只是問及其意見。潘熙一度改問據區理解，鄭達鴻是否會無差別否決財政預算案，惟陳慶偉再稱「no, next」。李運騰亦指，若潘熙認為證人知道相關事實，便可直接提出，否則其問題會引來異議，陳仲衡亦指潘的問題「突然（out of the blue）」。潘熙一度欲解釋，惟陳慶偉連說四個「next」，潘遂就其他議題發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下午續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/D0pdA5d.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（6日）踏入審訊第20天。區諾軒今繼續接受盤問，提及《國安法》前及剛生效後，均相信作為憲法專家的戴耀廷指初選不違法，惟政府7月9日指初選或違法後，他開始「響起問號」，並在初選結束、中聯辦於7月14日譴責初選違法後，不單決定退出初選，「而且盡我全力去解散整個初選」，並向時任政制及內地事務局政治助理吳璟儁徵詢補救措施。區在庭上補充，是在看過《國安法》33條自動放棄犯罪可減輕處罰的條文作此決定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區最終於7月15日宣布退出初選工作，趙家賢亦於翌日退出，戴耀廷之後亦宣布休息。區在臨散庭主動提及，他們數人退出後各區有剩餘工作無任何牽頭人能處理，並指希望上述情節，「能夠為整體嘅同案搵到好嘅求情同從輕發落嘅基礎」，有被告面露愕然和發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒稱參與者國安法可能改變否決財案立場-惟認個人無認知&quot;&gt;區諾軒稱參與者《國安法》可能改變否決財案立場 惟認個人無認知&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒繼續接受辯方盤問。代表鄭達鴻和梁國雄的資深大律師潘熙午休前問到，《國安法》落實後，以區理解，初選參與者就否決預算案有否改變立場，區答「可能有，要睇個根據係邊」。控方指是問及意見，法官李運騰遂改問區是否認知有參與者改變立場，區答「有呢個可能，但我的確冇清楚嘅資訊」，他個人亦沒有認知。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉再指，若他是潘熙，會向區指出他曾供稱，有候選人在《國安法》後問戴耀廷否決預算案會否違法，可理解為有人對此表達擔心，區同意。陳再補充，但這會否影響他們否決的立場則是另一回事，區亦同意。潘熙再問，至《國安法》公布前，區個人是否不清楚公民黨就否決預算案的立場，區指他「冇進一步資訊」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指曾相信否決預算案合法當時確實係冇為意有問題&quot;&gt;區指曾相信否決預算案合法：當時確實係冇為意有問題&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙下午續就區認知初選是否違《國安法》盤問，其中戴耀廷曾多次發文指初選不違法，潘展示區諾軒錄影會面謄本，提到「始終戴耀廷係一個香港大學嘅法律教授喇，咁佢有佢嘅專業喇，我諗相信好多人都信任佢嘅專業嘅」，區確認知道戴於2020年已在港大教授近30年、曾任法律系副院長，故當戴耀廷談及對《基本法》理解，「當時我哋都信佢係專業。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙其後展示戴耀廷於2020年5月12日《明報》文章〈「支持否決」不能成為DQ理由－－再論立會否決財政預算案的憲制設計〉，提及「基本法的條文並沒有規定立法會否決財政預算案只能單純因為財政預算案的內容」，區同意戴嘗試解釋為何認為否決預算案是合法，而他當時沒有質疑戴的看法，因為相信戴是憲法專家。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意，當時認為否決預算案令政府回應五大訴求是合法的，並指「我當時確實係冇為意有問題」。至於其他參與者是否都有同樣想法，他指「我冇辦法進入其他人嘅心境」，但不少民主派同事過往多年均否決財政預算案，亦未見有問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙其後引述2019年5月18日立法會有關《逃犯條例》修訂的會議紀錄，當時區諾軒曾發言指如非必要也「不想以否決預算案作為迫使政府撤回《逃犯條例》修訂建議的手段」，但指「這可以是其中一種做法」，區確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;提名表格有擁護基本法條款-區相信亦盡力確保參選人擁護&quot;&gt;提名表格有擁護《基本法》條款 區：相信亦盡力確保參選人擁護&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙其後問及初選提名表格，區確認於2020年6月設計。潘引表格條款「我特此聲明，我會擁護《基本法》和保證效忠香港特別行政區」，並引區諾軒錄影會面謄本談及，「其中有一樣呢，係希望保護返啲參選者喇」，又指希望參與者聲明擁護《基本法》與效忠特區，是「製作呢個表格嘅時候，有拎過出嚟討論嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙問區在2020年6月設計表格時，是否相信參加初選不會違反相關條款。區回應，「我當時相信，亦都盡過力確保大家都係擁護《基本法》同效忠香港特別行政區。」區亦同意當時仍認為運用《基本法》權力否決預算案是合法，至於其他人的想法，他無法代入，但相信不少人分享同樣看法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷國安法後稱初選不違法會繼續-區提底線指官方機構指違法就要考慮停止&quot;&gt;戴耀廷《國安法》後稱初選不違法會繼續 區提底線指官方機構指違法就要考慮停止&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙續就《國安法》落實後的情況發問，展示區諾軒書面供詞，提及他「一直很憂慮初選有沒有違法」，和留意政府或官方有否指出初選違法，並向戴反映相關問題，指犯法與否不是他「說了便算」；又指很多候選人曾問戴初選有否違《國安法》，但戴「一直說看不出有違法之處」。區在盤問下同意，戴耀廷在《國安法》落實後指否決預算案不違法，並重申：「法律上佢的確係有佢嘅專業意見，我冇辦法挑戰佢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙其後展示戴耀廷7月1日與趙家賢的 WhatsApp 對話，提及「這是我（戴）給個別團隊的訊息」，指《國安法》後有人擔心會否違法，但戴認為否決預算案是《基本法》賦予立法會的憲制權力，不可能是《國安法》第22條顛覆國家政權下的「非法手段」，特首解散立會亦不構成嚴重干擾和阻撓政權機關依法履行職能；而初選資金全為本地所得，應不會違《國安法》第29條勾結外國勢力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴總結「35+的目標要否決財政預算案，應沒有觸犯國安法 」，並在最後指「我的看法是初選會繼續。對我的想法，你有甚麼意見，敬請告知」，區確認收到該訊息。被問及有何回應，區指「佢給出咗一個法律嘅理解，我給出我嘅政治判斷」，向戴指「合唔合法就唔係佢講咗算嘅」，並提出一條底線，「如果有官方機構話初選係犯法呢，我哋就要考慮停止初選活動啦。」法官李運騰問及，該討論有否在 WhatsApp 記錄，區指沒有，僅他與戴耀廷在該訊息發布後進行對話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;曾國衛79指初選或違法-區指信戴法律觀點惟政治上開始響問號&quot;&gt;曾國衛7.9指初選或違法 區指信戴法律觀點惟政治上開始響問號&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙再引戴耀廷7月7日《蘋果日報》文章〈民主派 35+ 初選會否觸犯國安法〉，及7月9日時任政制及內地事務局局長曾國衞指初選或違《國安法》後，戴耀廷的 Facebook 回應，均強調否決預算案是《基本法》賦權，不會違《國安法》。法官陳仲衡留意到後者無提令特首下台，區同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙再引述7月9日初選記者會，區曾指「冇諗過」民主派做團結協調的工作亦會被指違法，又指搞初選多年，「卻喺今次要用一啲咁嚴重嘅指控去恐嚇參與嘅香港市民」，指會「盡我哋最大嘅努力去處理今次情況」，戴耀廷會上亦再次指初選不違法。潘熙問，區當時是否仍信初選不違法，區再重申：「法律上我信任咗戴耀廷當時既觀點，政治上，我開始響起問號，呢個係基於我嘅政治判斷。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指仍辦初選因對法律未有正確認識沒足夠時間冷靜思考&quot;&gt;區指仍辦初選因對法律未有正確認識、沒足夠時間冷靜思考&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續解釋，當時「一啲親建制嘅輿論，作出咗一定程度嘅指控」，而若官方機構都開始指控，他認為「政治上是一個警號」。法官陳仲衡問，既然政府初選前已指初選或違法，為何當時仍繼續舉行，區解釋「我當時的確對法律未有正確認識，舉例說非法手段係乜嘢」，而且「初選當時已經如箭在弦」，7月9日舉行記者會、翌日警方已到香港民研搜證、11及12日已是初選，「我的確冇足夠嘅時間冷靜思考。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒稱不少人問戴耀廷初選是否違法-但無仔細問否決財案是否違法&quot;&gt;區諾軒稱不少人問戴耀廷初選是否違法 但無仔細問否決財案是否違法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區同意，截止初選投票日，記者和參加者不時問戴耀廷初選是否違法，但各人問題都「泛泛而談」，「未必去到否決財政預算案咁詳細，只係問犯唔犯法」，亦不記得誰發問。他又提到，戴耀廷對是否違法的回應包括《國安法》第29條勾結外國勢力，「咁所以當時趙家賢係用過好多努力去睇嗰啲資金有冇問題。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙一度問，直至2020年7月，是否不同人在《國安法》下有不同關注，惟控方指問題籠統，法官李運騰亦指不同人必然對事情有不同看法。潘熙改指出，至7月11日，香港民研鍾庭耀曾關注初選是否違《國安法》，區同意，亦同意戴回應參選人提問指初選不違法，但理解沒有參選人詳細問及「否決財政預算案」會否違法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區於中聯辦譴責初選違法後決定退出-指曾約見吳璟儁問補救措施&quot;&gt;區於中聯辦譴責初選違法後決定退出 指曾約見吳璟儁問補救措施&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙其後引中聯辦7月14日發表的〈嚴厲譴責反對派策動非法初選 破壞立法會選舉公平 決不允許外部勢力操控香港政治事務〉，指初選違法，問區是否在該聲明發出後決定退出初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區回應：「我唔單止係退出，而且盡我全力去解散整個初選」，指他在聲明發出後已決定將整個組織初選的機構停止工作。區指，他第一步嘗試約見時任政制及內地事務局政治助理吳璟儁，徵詢任何補救措施，並主動建議若組織者一起退出是否可行做法，而據其憶述，吳回應「只能夠盡量做」。區指，他其後往戴耀廷港大辦公室指應要退出和解散初選，戴當時指「要啲時間諗一諗」。區並將決定告知趙家賢，趙指只要區退出，他當日亦會退出，結果區於7月15日退出初選後，趙於7月16日亦宣布退出，戴耀廷之後亦宣布休息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指決定退出因國安法指自動放棄犯罪可減輕處罰&quot;&gt;區指決定退出因《國安法》指自動放棄犯罪可減輕處罰&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區解釋，當時在 Facebook 發文宣布退出35+工作，並記得是早上9時，在西九龍法院審理8.18流水式集會案前。法官李運騰一度問，當日亦有抗爭派發表聲明，問哪者為先，區指是其帖文先發出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指有一點想說清楚，指他「當時睇咗國安法第33條(1)」，而作出此決定。根據《國安法》第33條(1)，「在犯罪過程中，自動放棄犯罪或者自動有效地防止犯罪結果發生的」，能使「對有關犯罪行為人、犯罪嫌疑人、被告人可以從輕、減輕處罰；犯罪較輕的，可以免除處罰」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱希望所述情節能為整體同案搵到好嘅求情同從輕發落嘅基礎&quot;&gt;區稱希望所述情節能為整體同案「搵到好嘅求情同從輕發落嘅基礎」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙續問，以區理解，當時中聯辦是否沒有清楚解釋初選為何違法，區指「佢哋係表達過佢哋嘅觀點」，而他當時已覺得，「無論如何都要停止個工作」。潘熙亦問及「親建制輿論」是否無解釋為何初選違法，區再指他們有很多觀點，「但你唔知邊個觀點先係權威。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡問，但區曾任立法會議員，是否不需戴耀廷意見，都知道可根據《基本法》權力否決預算案，區同意，但指始終戴耀廷是港大法律系教授，曾參與《基本法》起草委員會諮詢，「我作為後輩，佢係有權威。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙再展示戴耀廷7月14日 Facebook 帖文，對中聯辦稱初選是「典型的涉嫌犯法」，嚴正指出完全不合常理，區指在網上看過相關文章，但沒有在當天見戴耀廷時談及。區其後主動指出，「我淨係想就住退出嗰度做一句補充啫」，指他們幾個主要人士退出後，「喺香港島、九龍西同埋新界東其實仲有一啲剩餘嘅工作，結果係冇任何牽頭嘅人可以處理得到，可以查閱得到 WhatsApp 紀錄入面嘅對話」。他並指：「我希望上述嘅情節，能夠為整體嘅同案搵到好嘅求情同從輕發落嘅基礎」，鄒家成一臉愕然，其後發笑，鄭達鴻、何桂藍等人也有發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件周三（8日）下午續。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件編號：HCCC69/2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表包括資深大律師潘熙、大律師沈士文、張耀良、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等，本身是大律師的劉偉聰則自辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪被告包括獲准保釋的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信10人，及還柙的何桂藍、吳政亨、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及余慧明6人。&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>獨媒報導</name></author><summary type="html">區諾軒獄中曾去信鄭達鴻 指公民黨「搶疆」開記者會連累鄭及李予信 區諾軒稱中聯辦譴責後盡全力解散初選 望退出後情節為同案覓從輕發落基礎</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">【初選47人案・審訊第十九日】</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-03-03-trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-19.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="【初選47人案・審訊第十九日】" /><published>2023-03-03T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2023-03-03T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-19</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-03-03-trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-19.html">&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;區諾軒開始接受辯方盤問 指2020年3月曾舉行「沈旭暉35+交流會」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/qZp13NB.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今踏入審訊第19天。區諾軒下午開始接受盤問，庭上披露其錄影會面紀錄，區曾提及不同光譜的民主派對如何落實五大訴求有不同看法，未必想特首下台或癱瘓政府；又指2020年2月與公民黨會面，當時有功能組別議員的公民黨對否決財政預算案表達擔心，認為會對該些議員構成很大壓力。惟被問及公民黨2020年是否一直抱有同樣看法，區則稱「唔能夠咁武斷」，只能講及該次會議的意見。區在盤問下又承認，2021年7月至8月共錄取了7次錄影會面，並曾獲警方開啟其手機「行事曆」以整理供詞。他亦首次透露2020年3月曾舉行「沈旭暉35+交流會」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒21年7月錄首份口供-稱民主派對實踐五大訴求手段有不同看法&quot;&gt;區諾軒21年7月錄首份口供 稱民主派對實踐五大訴求手段有不同看法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;上周已完成主問的區諾軒，今午開始接受辯方盤問，由代表鄭達鴻和梁國雄的資深大律師潘熙開始。潘熙先指出，區諾軒於2021年7月至8月曾錄取共7次錄影會面，分別在7月27日錄取第一次、8月3日錄取第二及三次、8月6日錄取第四、五及六次、8月12日錄取第六次，區同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙其後引區諾軒首次錄影會面謄本，談及於2020年2月會見公民黨梁家傑的情況。區提及，後來就如何落實五大訴求引發「好重點嘅爭議」，因當時戴耀廷的說法很細緻和具體，但對很多「民主派」的人物來說，「佢哋嘅諗法只不過係讓到更加多民主派代表進入議會」，可能不斷「講五大訴求嘅說話」，但不一定服膺於「特首下台」或「癱瘓政府」的想法。區表示，實踐的手段根據不同政治光譜會有不同想法，但當時一直都未有釐清。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒在盤問下，同意當時提及的「民主派」是包括公民黨及社民連，並同意早前曾供稱民主派有傳統泛民、激進泛民和本土派等不同光譜。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒稱公民黨有功能組別議員-對否決預算案提出擔心&quot;&gt;區諾軒稱公民黨有功能組別議員 對否決預算案提出擔心&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙續就2020年2月區諾軒和戴耀廷與公民黨執委會見面盤問，區承認當時「分唔到邊個係當時嘅執委」，但他提到出席的梁家傑、譚文豪、余若薇、陳淑莊和賴仁彪5人都是「有影響力嘅人物」，並在法官陳慶偉詢問下，指被告鄭達鴻當時「不在場」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/FWAjVJJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 鄭達鴻&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒同意，當時會上除了陳淑莊指公民黨望推林瑞華參選功能組別飲食界，亦有提及郭榮鏗是法律界議員。潘熙再引述區諾軒錄影會面謄本，提及當時公民黨有「提出過一啲擔心」：「如果你話係人人都要走去否決呢個財政預算案嘅⋯⋯咁你咪搞到佢哋（功能組別議員）好大壓力囉。」區解釋，功能組別議員「好難會背棄業界去否決財政預算案」，如政府大幅撥款增聘教師，教育界立法會議員亦「好難話去否定呢樣嘢」，故公民黨有此擔心。區亦形容，該說法當時在民主黨、公民黨和社民連，「都不時聽到。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區同意否決預算案困難視乎政見-20年3月曾舉行沈旭暉35交流會&quot;&gt;區同意否決預算案困難視乎政見 20年3月曾舉行「沈旭暉35+交流會」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙續問，當時公民黨擔心的事情，其他政黨是否都有同樣看法，舉例社民連曾指預算案若包括全民退休保障，社民連會投贊成。區表示，岑子杰和代表梁國雄的陳寶瑩在協調會議上都表達過相關看法。潘熙續指，事實上否決財政預算案的困難亦同樣適用於地區直選和功能組別，視乎相關人士政見，區同意。潘再問該種擔心是否至2020年5月尾至6月初仍存在，區指若根據協調會議的情況，他會說至5月中仍存在。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙其後引區諾軒第五份錄影會面謄本，提及6月初一個交流會，林瑞華亦有出席，會上林指他雖屬公民黨，但亦積極考慮參選飲食界，有表達過同樣的「關心」和「憂慮」。區同意，該「關心」是他上述所說，不能很輕易地同意否決財政預算案。區並主動補充，雖稱該交流會於6月發生，「但係睇返我嘅行事曆，發生呢件事原來係2020年3月」，在「沈旭暉 35+ 交流會」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問公民黨是否整個2020年抱持同樣擔心-區唔能夠咁武斷&quot;&gt;官問公民黨是否整個2020年抱持同樣擔心 區：唔能夠咁武斷&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘熙續問，以區理解，能否說整個2020年，公民黨對於無差別否決財政預算案都不能有整體立場，此時主控周天行起身，質疑證人不能回答此問題。法官陳慶偉亦指該問題並不是很好，並直接問區，以他理解，公民黨是否在2020年一直抱有同樣的看法，區回應：「唔能夠咁武斷。」潘熙續指，那區稱公民黨的「擔心」，最遲於何時仍持續，能否說直至2020年7月仍持續？區回應：「我只能夠講係該次會議佢哋嘅意見，就難以推論佢後邊嘅諗法有冇轉變。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱曾獲警方展示手機行事曆&quot;&gt;區稱曾獲警方展示手機「行事曆」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰其後問及，區諾軒提到的沈旭暉會議，是先或後於3月25日的公民黨記者會舉行，區答：「我冇行事曆喺手，但係就我憶述，應該未過該次3月25號嘅記者招待會」，即沈的會議早於公民黨記者會。法官陳仲衡問及該「行事曆」，區解釋「喺整理我嘅供詞嘅時候，我曾經獲警方開啟返我嘅手機，睇得返案發時每一日我做啲乜」，並確認要答李運騰的問題，需要重看其手機。案件下周一續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黃碧雲林卓廷僅同意與自己相關的事實&quot;&gt;黃碧雲林卓廷僅同意與自己相關的事實&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，控方昨日讀出其中13名被告的同意事實，今早分別讀出黃碧雲、何桂藍和林卓廷的同意事實，3份內容均較13人的一份為少，而黃碧雲和林卓廷的內容又比何桂藍一份為少。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其中由大律師沈士文代表的黃碧雲和林卓廷，僅同意與他們本人相關的事實，包括他們分別於6月20日及19日向民主動力提交提名表格、於6月25日及28日參與初選論壇、及向選舉事務處提交選舉單張和參與初選。二人又同意其個人發布的帖文、文章和片段，被捕後家中及電子器材被檢取的證物，及案發時個人的背景，包括黃碧雲案發時為立法會議員，任期於2020年12月1日結束，而林卓廷兼任立法會議員及區議員，立會任期於同日結束。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於其他所有被告發布的帖文、影片及行為，如戴耀廷、區諾軒和吳政亨的文章，吳政亨發起「三投三不投」的過程，趙家賢被搜得的 WhatsApp 對話，其他被告報名參與初選及獲發按金收據，抗爭派記者會及相關立場聲明，報名參選、被DQ和沒有報名參選立法會的被告名單，及其他被告的背景、拘捕和搜獲的物料等，均沒有在二人同意事實提及。其他組織如民主動力和香港民意研究所的資料，以及參與舉辦初選論壇的媒體等，二人亦沒有同意。不過二人有同意警方於2020年12月，向《獨立媒體》、《立場新聞》、《蘋果日報》發出提交物料令。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，同意事實提及黃碧雲於「2020年7月1日至2021年1月7日」，在香港沒有案底，法官陳仲衡一度關注該寫法，是指被告該段時間沒有案底，抑或直至當時沒有案底，控方回應是後者，遂將所有被告承認事實的寫法改為「直至2021年1月7日」沒有案底。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何桂藍同意事實不包括戴耀廷文章抗爭派記者會&quot;&gt;何桂藍同意事實不包括戴耀廷文章、抗爭派記者會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於何桂藍，同意事實與13被告大致相同，包括吳政亨發起「三投三不投」、民主動力和香港民研的資料等，惟不包括所有戴耀廷的文章、Facebook 帖文和 YouTube 片段；各被告發布「墨落無悔」的帖文及其他競選帖文和影片；7月15日抗爭派記者會的出席名單及其後發布的〈抗爭派立法會參選人立場聲明〉；及警方向媒體發出的提交物料令。代表何的大律師 Trevor Beel 在首兩周審訊曾表示，戴耀廷不會出庭作供，質疑其文章僅屬「傳聞證供」，控方須證明涉案文章由戴所寫；又指無證據何曾出席抗爭派記者會及在會上發言。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何桂藍同意事實不包括被捕後搜得的物料&quot;&gt;何桂藍同意事實不包括被捕後搜得的物料&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就初選論壇，何桂藍只同意2020年6月5日至7月4日曾舉行初選論壇，但沒有同意舉辦論壇的媒體及論壇出席者。何的同意事實亦提及所有其他被告被捕後被搜得的證物，唯獨不包括從她本人搜得的物料，她亦不同意證物鏈。Beel 表示，任何從何桂藍搜得的物品都不會同意，會要求傳召警員舉證，又指不明白為何「T裇」也相關，惟李運騰指，附表沒提「T裇」，只是與競選有關的物品。Beel 又提到，並不同意任何被告報名立法會選舉後被裁定無效，但控方並無回應其修訂。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何桂藍修改至直至2021年12月無案底12人改為至2023年3月無案底&quot;&gt;何桂藍修改至直至2021年12月無案底、12人改為至2023年3月無案底&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，何桂藍的同意事實，原列明「直至2021年1月7日」何沒有案底，惟辯方提出望改為「直至2021年12月12日」。法官李運騰問及，法庭是否要考慮何桂藍擁有良好品格，又問在同意事實加入該段落有何用意，主控萬德豪指若被告在本案發生後再犯案，或不能視為具良好品格。法官陳仲衡提及，被告於案發期間犯案會影響法庭對其犯罪傾向的評估，但於案發後、開審前犯案，又會否影響對其犯罪傾向的評估？萬德豪指，此情況被告亦會被視為有案底。李運騰續指不希望知道詳情，法庭亦只會考慮同意事實上的資訊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方休庭後再提出修訂，將昨日13名被告同意事實有關案底的描述，由「2020年7月1日至2021年1月7日」沒有案底，改為「直至2023年3月3日」，鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信、吳政亨、鄒家成及余慧明12人均沒有案底，不包括梁國雄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件編號：HCCC69/2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表包括資深大律師潘熙、大律師沈士文、張耀良、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等，本身是大律師的劉偉聰則自辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪被告包括獲准保釋的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信10人，及還柙的何桂藍、吳政亨、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及余慧明6人。&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>獨媒報導</name></author><summary type="html">區諾軒開始接受辯方盤問 指2020年3月曾舉行「沈旭暉35+交流會」</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">【初選47人案・審訊第十八日】</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-03-02-trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-18.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="【初選47人案・審訊第十八日】" /><published>2023-03-02T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2023-03-02T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-18</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-03-02-trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-18.html">&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（2日）於西九龍裁判法院（暫代高院）續審。李予信早前打泰拳而受傷留院，缺席昨日審訊，他今日如期出庭應訊，庭上所見精神不俗，不過法官警告若果類似情況再度發生，他便不會繼續獲准保釋。本案共有4個版本的控辯雙方同意事實，控方讀出其中一份由13名被告所同意的事實，當中披露警方根據《國安法第四十三條實施細則》附表7第3條，於2020年12月24日獲高院簽發提交物料令，要求《獨立媒體》、《立場新聞》、《蘋果日報》向警方提供或交出與案相關物料。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李予信昨出院-今日如期到庭&quot;&gt;李予信昨出院 今日如期到庭&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李予信因打泰拳而受傷留院，缺席昨日審訊，案件押後至今日續審。他今日如期到庭應訊，庭上所見精神不俗。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;甫開庭，代表李予信的大律師關文渭通知法庭，李昨日於早上10時05分獲批准出院。法官李運騰聞言指出：「即是昨日當你在庭上作出申請時，你的當事人已經出了院？」關大律師強調他其時並不知悉相關資料。李官指，如果關大律師是在知悉當事人已出院的情況下作出申請，那他便是藐視法庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關大律師就其當事人所引致的打擾向法庭道歉。惟李官指李予信浪費了百萬元的公帑，並警告若果類似情況再度發生，他便不會繼續獲准保釋。關大律師指李現已知道他不應再參與危險運動。李予信與事務律師溝通後，關大律師補充指雖然李於10時05分獲批出院，但直至10時15分才獲醫院通知。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;同意事實現4版本-控方開始讀出&quot;&gt;同意事實現4版本 控方開始讀出&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表之一、署理助理刑事檢控專員羅天瑋接著讀出控辯雙方同意事實，由於不同被告所同意的內容不同，因此共有4份不同版本。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;首份版本獲13名被告同意。除黃碧雲、何桂藍和林卓廷之外，其餘13名被告皆承認以下事實：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;民主派初選（又名「民主派 35＋公民投票（初選）」）於2020年7月11至12日在香港舉行。2020年立法會換屆選舉原訂於2020年9月6日舉行，但特區政府於7月31日宣布鑑於新冠肺炎疫情，行政會議決定延遲選舉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;當時立法會換屆選舉擬選出70名議員，其中35席來自地區直選，另外35席來自功能組別。而初選涉及5個直選地區，包括香港島、九龍西、九龍東、新界西和新界東；以及2個功能組別，包括區議會（第二）功能界別和衞生服務界。本案第6至第47被告均參與其中及為初選參選人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷區諾軒公開帖文和電腦物料列證物&quot;&gt;戴耀廷區諾軒公開帖文和電腦物料列證物&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;警方將 Facebook 專頁「Tai Yiu Ting 戴耀廷」所發布的帖文、該專頁所轉載的不同媒體內容，以及戴耀廷 YouTube 頻道所發布的影片保存及列為證物。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於區諾軒，警方把他所撰寫的文章及 Facebook 專頁帖文保存及列為證物。區諾軒於2021年1月6日被捕時，偵緝警員11027檢取了一部屬於他的電腦，從中取得相關物料，同樣被列為證物。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;吳政亨發起三投三不投-住所搜獲蘋果頭版廣告交易收據&quot;&gt;吳政亨發起「三投三不投」 住所搜獲蘋果頭版廣告交易收據&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吳政亨（又名李伯盧）發起「三投三不投」運動。吳被捕時，警方於其住所檢取了一份2020年7月3日的《蘋果日報》頭版廣告，以及一份交易收據，顯示吳轉帳13萬5千元給蘋果日報有限公司。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「三投三不投」運動在不同時期採用不同名字，在2020年3月19日至5月24日期間名為「立會要初選 『三不投聯署』」，在同年5月25日至9月19日期間名為「『三投三不投』 立會初選聯署」，並在同年9月20日起名為「街頭議會」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「『三投三不投』 立會初選聯署」設有網站，網站截圖及英文鑑證本分別被列為證物。約於2020年3月19日，「三投三不投」設立Facebook專頁，至同年9月，該專頁改名為「街頭議會」，截至11月27日，逾6千人讚好該專頁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;約於2020年4月，吳政亨成立 YouTube 頻道，由該頻道發布的影片、相關謄本和英文鑑證本皆列為證物。&lt;/p&gt;

These span the levels of conflict and range from strategic miscalculation and a centralised command structure inherently unable to adapt and react to poorly conceived and executed operational plans to tactical errors.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;All have contributed to the prolongation of what Vladimir Putin had seemingly planned as a short ‘special military operation’ into the first mass mobilisation of the Russian population since World War II and continued escalation. From the Western perspective there have been lessons to draw from the conflict and the Ukrainian armed forces’ robust defence of their sovereign soil.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tenacity of Ukraine’s troops has been buoyed by an influx of modern weaponry from NATO and the West since the Russian invasion began in February 2022. But preceding these important imports was a coherent package of support to the Ukrainian defence and security sector from the UK and its allies, which began in 2014 and – at the time of writing – appears to represent a successful case of upstream capacity building and investment that contrasts sharply with the chaotic collapse of Western support in Afghanistan. Does such an approach provide a model for future defence engagement activity or is there a danger of drawing premature conclusions from an ongoing war? And do we risk being too selfcongratulatory by linking our support with the successes of those unified in their fight for the survival of Ukraine as a nation state?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the first question to consider though is why the British Army should occupy itself with such endeavours? The answer to which should be relatively fresh in Western military minds – capacity building aims to avoid the messy outcomes often associated with peacekeeping and stabilisation operations. As Nilsson and Zetterlund write: “Fragile countries are to be strengthened so that they can shoulder their own problems, thereby reducing the need for international assistance”. The paradigm of capacity building is not without issue. It is poorly defined and can range from a short, simple training course in a specific skill through to a multi-departmental effort orchestrated over months or years with significant resource. It can span a broad spectrum of activities – from short-term training teams through to institutional reform. The selection of the capacity to be built is important. Indeed, “building the ‘wrong’ capacity or strengthening the ‘wrong’ actors might make a conflict even worse”. Capacity building is similar to security force assistance, although is generally considered to have a wider remit where force footprints are small and often focused on basic tactical training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;post-crimea-commitment&quot;&gt;POST-CRIMEA COMMITMENT&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expansion of the UK’s commitment to the development of Ukraine’s defence and security sector began in earnest after the Russian invasion of Crimea in 2014. There were two significant strands to this: Operation Orbital – the provision of training and support to the Ukrainian armed forces (primarily in the land domain) and assistance, afforded to the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine and wider government, in implementing security sector reforms. In summary, the blend of tactical training and equipping the Ukrainian armed forces was paired with the longerterm institutional changes required at the operational and strategic levels. These efforts complemented both the NATO-led assistance to the country as an enhanced NATO partner nation and unilateral engagement. Ukraine has been part of the US National Guard State Partnership programme since 1993. This offers, among other training opportunities, low level non-commissioned officer leadership training. The surge of the UK efforts since 2014 came during a period of increased focus on what the Chief of the General Staff at the time outlined as defence engagement, one pillar of which was the development of regional capacity to enable security concerns to be dealt with by their respective regional governments. This built on concepts first articulated in the Strategic Defence and Security Review in 2010, which viewed Defence playing a key role in early, upstream capacity building to preventthe causes of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;“Operation Orbital deployed in 2015 with a focus on training, mentoring and advising local military personnel and with the intent to improve the capacity and capability of the Ukrainian armed forces on a sustainable basis.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following a similar model to previous training missions (including in Afghanistan), Operation Orbital deployed in 2015 with a focus on training, mentoring and advising local military personnel and with the intent to improve the capacity and capability of the Ukrainian armed forces on a sustainable basis. By February of last year, more than 22,000 Ukrainian troops had received British training. A subsequent focus on planning, operations and low-level leadership assisted in the development of a cadre of well trained, tactically astute officers and soldiers capable of planning coherent military activity at the tactical level supported by and set within an operational framework. This was in tandem with NATO and other unilateral support to Ukraine, with multi-national training teams regular visitors to the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/k9Cl3Aa.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concurrently, pre-dating the recommendations of the Integrated Review, Operation Orbital was enhanced by UK support to theUkrainian Ministry of Defence and other government departments to drive security sector reform and improve areas such as procurement that had previously been open to corruption. The increased workload in Ukraine was supported by a reinforced defence section, employed within the embassy in Kyiv, further improving and exploiting efforts from the Ministry of Defence, Foreign, Commonwealth &amp;amp; Development Office and partners across government. This encapsulated the all-encompassing, whole of government approach to national security later detailed in the 2021 Integrated Review. It is partly this exploitation of existing synergies of the work completed by partners across government that have made the capacity building in Ukraine a comparative success and potentially a useful model for further upstream projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-lessons-can-we-learn&quot;&gt;WHAT LESSONS CAN WE LEARN?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The models currently in use for engagement activity (such as the Methods of Effect model) place the emphasis on what activity we will undertake in a given country and how we measure its effectiveness. There is less attention paid to the underlying suitability of a country or understanding if the model used is the correct one for the circumstances prevalent in that country. The war in Ukraine has been one of national survival with the majority of society united in its determination to expel the Russian invaders, a unifying factor that has undoubtedly played a significant part in the defence of their homeland. The fight has been in many ways a conventional, metal-on-metal battle rather than a counter-insurgency conflict (as some commentators considered it would develop into). The government and military have acted in tandem with a united and obvious intent, and Ukraine has welcomed efforts to develop its capacity and supported them internally. In previous upstream capacity building efforts this has not always been the case, with the Clausewitzian trinity of the political, the military and the public bodies divided and disconnected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;“The government and military have acted in tandem with a united and obvious intent, and Ukraine has welcomed efforts to develop its capacity and supported them internally. In previous upstream capacity building efforts this has not always been the case.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Logistics have also been relatively straightforward. For the UK and many other European nations, it has been comparatively simple to move massed materiel across the Continent – although this supply chain is now being severely tested as the battle continues. The unity of the Ukrainian response and the country’s relative proximity should not, however, detract from what has been a coherent, layered and connected example of defence overseas engagement working to develop capacity and capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/WHZDbg6.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, if the aim of upstream capacity building is delivering sustainable peace and stability, then it could be argued that the evolution of the Crimea crisis into a wider, conventional war suggests that international endeavours in Ukraine have been in vain. To do so would be harsh, given the Kremlin’s true intent towards Ukraine has gained significant clarity since 2014 and the limited options open to dissuade Putin from his current course, and should not deter the UK from continued investment in capacity building across the globe. Equally, the fruits of the multi-layered capacity building labour are clear. The enduring presence from 2014 to prior to the Russian invasion of last year has assisted in Ukraine’s defence. The basic measure of effectiveness with a desired end state of a capable and resilient Ukrainian Armed Forces and security sector has been achieved. It is Russia’s ongoing struggle against this capable, determined resistance that will have a deterrent effect. This effect demonstrates part of the utility of capacity building and other activities that fall under the defence engagement concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ZAhdrlP.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;“The vision is to enable the Ukrainians to export parts of the programme and deliver them domestically. This is a key point for capacity building. It should not be entirely transactional from the donor to the partner nations.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conflict also raises questions about the effectiveness of the UK’s and NATO’s deterrence posture. Russia was not deterred by economic sanctions, diplomatic pressure or the limited presence in Ukraine of UK, NATO and Western allies in a training capacity. Indeed, the presence of Western force elements could have played into Moscow’s narrative of NATO encroachment and confrontation with Russia. This narrative has been amplified during the conflict with the Kremlin pushing its perception of a battle between Russia and the West both internally and increasingly across the global south. Although the deterrence measures taken prior to the conflict failed on several fronts this should not lead to an abandonment of the concept. What does deter aggression is a capable opposing force able to inflict damage and sustain a defence. In Ukraine, this form of capable deterrence has been further enhanced by the rapid influx of advanced, Western weaponry that has been used to inflict punishment on the attacker. A lesson and deterrent, perhaps, for future aggressors. In a hark back to the proxy wars of the Cold Warera, Ukraine is now awash with a spectrum of capabilities from Western allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s cross-governmental approach and close liaison with international partners such as NATO has partly realised the vision of the Integrated Review for a coherent approach to upstream capacity building to promote stability. It is this, working alongside a united, legitimate political body with popular support, that provides a potential template for future capacity building efforts and highlights the benefits of UK investment after the debacle of withdrawal from Afghanistan. Our continued training engagement through Operation Interflex – the successor to Operation Orbital outlined below – assists in what must be a capability interoperability and integration-atspeed issue for the Ukrainian armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;op-interflex&quot;&gt;OP INTERFLEX&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;British forces left Ukraine only days before the Russian invasion. The following months saw partner nations begin to send equipment to Ukraine and devise other packages of support along several lines of effort. In June 2022, whilst on a visit to Kyiv, then-UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a major programme to train Ukrainian soldiers. This announcement developed into Operation Interflex – an endeavour that has seen Ukrainian troops trained by the British Army and partners in the United Kingdom, with a stated aim of training 10,000 soldiers every 120 days. The threeweek package covers basic infantry skills such as marksmanship, medical training and cybersecurity and partner nations such as Australia and New Zealand, as well as representatives from members of the Joint Expeditionary Forces, including Estonia and Denmark, have lent expertise to the effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An event hosted by the Royal United Services Institute and attended by representatives from Land Operations Command and 5th Battalion, The Rifles in November provided a number of insights on Interflex. After the initial rotations, the course was increased from three to five weeks as a result of the feedback loop received from units returning to Ukraine. The syllabus would be familiar to anyone who has undergone initial military training, although it is possible to see the influence of the specific conflict being prepared for. The course includes teaching on the law of armed conflict, trench warfare, marksmanship, section defence and urban training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as the five-week basic combat course, a second five-week junior leadership course aimed at junior non-commissioned officers and sergeants has been taking place. This concentration added command and leadership training as well as the military decision-making process. Soldiers are given instruction on how to coach marksmanship, complete commanders’ checks, are drilled in simulated mounted tactics and receive counterunmanned aircraft systems training. The vision is to enable the Ukrainians to export parts of the programme and deliver them domestically. This is a key point for capacity building. It should not be entirely transactional from the donor to the partner nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measuring the effect of such efforts can be difficult. Indeed, Western forces have been involved in other capacity building enterprises which have not been successful. Both Iraq and Afghanistan offer examples of vast investment in time and resource where the trained forces have not stood up to scrutiny. Both forces quickly capitulated in the face of Islamic State and the Taliban respectively, leaving Western forces embarrassed. Recent analysis has looked to determine the reasons for this issue. As Robinson argues, the gap between the imported army concepts and recipient culture was vast. The leading power brokers in both states did not want to create the liberal moderate state of Western peace builders’ imagination, and therefore the military transformation was out of step with that of the civilian sector. Ukraine, on the other hand, is more closely aligned with European sensibilities, both geographically and culturally. Indeed, anecdotal evidence from soldiers who have returned to the front after receiving British training is positive. In one example, a subsection of a Ukrainian unit that repulsed a Russian assault was asked by their commander about the source of their tactical knowledge. “This is what we were taught to do in UK training,” came the response. Another front-line Ukrainian commander whose unit took part in the Battle of Kherson stated that “we are delighted with the high level of preparedness of soldiers we are receiving from the United Kingdom who have been trained by Op Interflex”. Of course, it is unlikely that the Ukrainians would publicly admit that the training was not having the desired effect so some of the praise may also have some value in encouraging partners to keep up support. However, capacity building has its limits. There was never a chance that Orbital would put Ukraine on a peer level with Russia and as such, NATO support has been, and – without a finish line in sight – will continue to be necessary going forward. This speaks to the importance of drawing a clear end point to efforts, rather than becoming stuck as permanent trainers to a population for extended periods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;other-best-practice&quot;&gt;OTHER BEST PRACTICE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conflict in Ukraine has offered other examples of successful capacity building which might provide a model to build upon. Professional military education is one such area, and one that often does not receive the same level of coverage as combat training. The Defence Education Enhancement Programme is a joint US-NATO endeavour to professionalise the officer and noncommissioned officer corps of partner nations, and first came into being in 2007. It aims to establish “effective, self-sustaining defence institutions” and the Ukrainian chapter became the largest in the world in 2013. These efforts to “help the Ukrainian military transform from a rigid centralised Russianstyle operational decision-making process to one where junior and mid-level leaders are expected to take initiative on the battlefield” have been credited with enabling Ukraine’s forces to operate with an agility and dynamism absent from their adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ryWnqBn.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sustainment is another area which has received attention during the conflict. US European Command and the Institute for Security Governance, part of the US Defence Security Cooperation University, began a programme in 2016 to help Ukraine establish effective sustainment planning protocols. US support to Ukraine was such that it overwhelmed the Ukrainian ability to incorporate repair and sustainment into its own organic capability. As a result, the US had to cover this burden, which in turn sapped resource from providing new equipment and support. Among the success stories is the pilot effort to improve domestic sustainment of the high mobility multi-purpose wheeled vehicle (or Humvee as it is more commonly nown). Initiatives included servicing centres, developing maintenance manuals and creating a mobile repair unit. Since the invasion in 2022, this issue has become exacerbated with a plethora of weaponry and equipment flooding into Ukraine. Indeed, byone analysis, the Ukrainian armed forces are operating 14 different artillery systems, “each with distinct maintenance and ammunition requirements, creating a tangle of logistics challenges”. This reinforces the importance of having institutions which have the capacity to absorb such increases in burden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/REm1hE2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two examples are useful to stress the importance of institutional capacity building over simply running training courses. Attempting the former is rife with vulnerabilities and each scenario will require a bespoke approach which takes heed of culture, history, and the complexities of organisational change programmes. It is also important to consider civilian elements of capacity building, as it is not purely a military sport. The Polish Medical Mission – a non-governmental organisation – provided bespoke deliveries of medical equipment to 50 hospitals from June to December 2022. Crucially, the logistic chains required to support deliveries to hard-to-reach areas in a conflict zone are now developed and remain established so they can be used going forward. Israel, which has received some criticism for not supporting Ukraine with military equipment, provides another example. A civilian-run field hospital was deployed to Ukraine for six weeks in the spring of 2022. The facility provided battlefield care but also prioritised wider local capacity building, delivering training in a variety of techniques to circa 800 Ukrainian medical personnel. The capacity to treat wounded people and return them to the fight is vital and is an area of expertise in which the British Army is highly skilled and experienced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upstream capacity building offers a means by which the British Army can contribute to peace and security, advance the vision of Global Britain and make use of its deep and well-developed experience throughout the defence lines of development – from doctrine development, sustainment and combat training to professional education and medical knowledge. The ongoing example of Ukraine shows the utility of long-term commitment to a force to provide vital capacity with which to counter aggression. It has also shown how resource intensive successful capacity building can be, and there is no end in sight to the support currently being given. This may become unpalatable to decision makers as time goes on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The example of Ukraine also provides a useful distinction from the seemingly failed attempts to build armies in Iraq and Afghanistan. Rebuilding military forces and attempting to forge a functioning state with imported idealshas been proven to be a losing mission. Conversely, Ukraine’s cultural similarities and relative stability appear to have afforded the atmosphere necessary for successful capacity building. It is difficult to conclusively prove the correlation/causation link between capacity building activities and the effectiveness of a country’s armed forces but there is clear evidence of an enhancement of Ukraine’s military prowess. Whether attributable in part to multinational efforts or not, there is plenty of progress to be seen when you compare the events of 2014, when a much smaller Russian force was able to achieve its objectives largely unchallenged, to today’s well-orchestrated defence and counter-offensive operations.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;李予信打泰拳受傷留院 押後續審 官提醒勿參與危險運動&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5WGgLZH.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（1日）踏入審訊第17天。其中李予信因打泰拳，疑腦震盪留院，法官認為不能在被告缺席下繼續審訊，終決定押後，案件或於明午或周五早上再續。此外，代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 表示控方昨天新呈800頁文件，包括3份有關證物鏈的證人供詞，其中一份為負責獲取新界西影片的證人陳鑫（音譯）。控方擬就其中一人申請匿名令，惟官着控方待李予信出庭再處理。法官陳仲衡一度提醒獲准保釋的被告，不要參與任何危險的運動，法官陳慶偉指「試想想這裡一天需要多少法律開支」，法官李運騰亦補充，不僅是律師，外面也有警察駐守，「我們說的是每天數百萬元」，相關做法似乎並不負責任。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;撤口罩令首天-大部分被告無戴口罩&quot;&gt;撤口罩令首天 大部分被告無戴口罩&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;今天是政府撤銷口罩令第一天，還柙的被告在開庭前陸續被帶往被告欄，除了梁國雄外，其餘還柙被告均沒有戴口罩，而看管他們的懲教人員卻有戴口罩。在延伸庭的8名列席認罪被告馮達浚、朱凱廸、梁晃維、譚凱邦、岑敖暉、黃之鋒、袁嘉蔚及吳敏兒，亦全沒有戴口罩，開庭前互相談笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於獲保釋的劉偉聰、楊雪盈、鄭達鴻、彭卓棋和陳志全庭上沒有戴口罩，黃碧雲、何啟明、施德來、柯耀林則有戴口罩。3名主審法官及大部份律師均沒有戴口罩。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李予信因泰拳受傷留院-官稱不能在被告缺席下繼續審訊&quot;&gt;李予信因泰拳受傷留院 官稱不能在被告缺席下繼續審訊&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;甫開庭，代表李予信的大律師關文渭指，李在上周日（26日）玩泰拳期間受傷，疑受腦震盪，他如期出席周一（27日）的聆訊，但其間感到非常不適，亦有嘔吐，最終在昨日（28日）送往屯門醫院急症室治療，醫生囑他留院觀察，但李望法庭繼續審訊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰一度形容，李予信在保釋期間參與「本來就危險」的運動，關文渭回應「所有運動都可以是危險」，法官陳慶偉則舉例不包括桌球和扔飛鏢，關文渭重申僅是意外。陳慶偉問及有否醫療證明，關引述醫院指要出院才能簽發，亦不肯定李現時情況或何時能上庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰認為，在沒有醫療證明下，不能單憑辯方的說法確定李予信情況，亦認為不能在被告缺席下繼續審訊。控方代表、副刑事檢控專員萬德豪表示會採取行動去確認辯方的資料是否正確，又指今日原訂在庭上讀出控辯雙方承認事實，而李予信早已同意了相關事實，理解辯方獲指示在李缺席的情況下繼續審訊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰重申，不認為在被告缺席下繼續審訊是合適做法，認為應押後。關文渭指，會嘗試要求主診醫生簽發醫療證明，並理解李予信已轉至觀察病房。法官陳慶偉決定，今天不會繼續聆訊，並着各方今午通知法庭李予信的狀況，以決定明午是否如常開庭，並暫定星期五早上續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何桂藍大狀稱昨收3份新證人供詞-控方欲為其中一人申匿名令&quot;&gt;何桂藍大狀稱昨收3份新證人供詞 控方欲為其中一人申匿名令&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 其後指，昨天收到控方800頁新文件，包括已核證的英文譯本，以及5項新材料，其中有3份新的證人供詞，均與證物鏈相關，包括負責獲取新界西相關影片的證人陳鑫（音譯）、TVB助理新聞製作總經理葉炳棠和另一負責搜證的警員。Beel 指，3人供詞均於案件開審後，分別於2月21日、23日及13日才錄取，表示幾乎從未聽聞這樣的情況，又強調該些供詞應一早準備好（“All these statements should be taken long time before.”）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續指，他亦尚未有機會閱讀該些供詞，並表示他與 Beel 有同樣不滿（“I share your dissatisfaction.”），亦認為有關證物鏈的證據，理應在很早以前便處理好（“… should be obtained long long time ago.”），但認為 Beel 現時仍有時間考慮。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;散庭前，控方代表萬德豪欲替剛才 Beel 所提及的其中一名證人申請匿名令，惟遭法官陳慶偉打斷，指待李予信出庭才處理。據了解，另外兩項新材料涉何桂藍 Facebook 內容及抗爭派記者會片段謄本。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官提醒被告勿參與危險運動試想想這裡一天需要多少法律開支&quot;&gt;官提醒被告勿參與危險運動：試想想這裡一天需要多少法律開支&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，法官陳仲衡特意提醒獲准保釋的被告們，不要參與任何危險的運動（“Please don’t engage in any dangerous sports.”）。法官李運騰補充，本案牽涉很多律師和人士，似乎亦不是負責任的做法（“… doesn’t seem very responsible either, given the number of counsels and people involved in this case.”）。法官陳慶偉亦指，「試想想這裡一天需要多少法律開支（“Think about the legal expenses for one day here.”）」，李運騰再補充，不僅是律師，外面也有警察駐守，「我們說的是每天數百萬元。」（“Not only about number of counsels, but number of police officers deployed outside, we are talking about millions of dollars everyday.”）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件編號：HCCC69/2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;列席認罪被告全被安排於延伸庭就坐&quot;&gt;列席認罪被告全被安排於延伸庭就坐&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表包括資深大律師潘熙、大律師沈士文、張耀良、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等，本身是大律師的劉偉聰則自辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪被告包括獲准保釋的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信10人，及還柙的何桂藍、吳政亨、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及余慧明6人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;列席認罪被告包括馮達浚、朱凱廸、梁晃維、譚凱邦、岑敖暉、黃之鋒、袁嘉蔚及吳敏兒，全被安排在延伸庭就坐。&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>獨媒報導</name></author><summary type="html">李予信打泰拳受傷留院 押後續審 官提醒勿參與危險運動</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">On Shifting Ground</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-02-28-on-shifting-ground.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="On Shifting Ground" /><published>2023-02-28T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2023-02-28T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/on-shifting-ground</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-02-28-on-shifting-ground.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This paper asks what factors have helped or hindered the UK in pursuing a ‘Global Britain’ agenda in Ethiopia. The paper also tests common assertions around the effects of Brexit, reductions in the UK aid budget, and the merger of two government departments, the Department for International Development (DFID) and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2016, successive British governments have sought to emphasise that a post-Brexit UK would be outward-looking, collaborative and influential. A series of speeches and policy statements have emphasised the pursuit of prosperity and an intention to capitalise on previous investments in overseas aid, trade, defence and diplomacy. In March 2021, the UK government published its Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy. The document reiterated these themes and referenced East Africa for increased UK engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, a RUSI research team has set out to examine how the UK has deployed its development, defence and diplomacy toolkit in four countries in East Africa in support of this agenda. The project, entitled ‘Furthering Global Britain? Reviewing the Foreign Policy Effect of UK Engagement in East Africa’, asks what factors have helped or hindered the UK in pursuing a ‘Global Britain’ agenda in Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia and Sudan. The research also tests some common assertions around the effects of Brexit, reductions in the UK aid budget, and the merger of two government departments, the Department for International Development (DFID) and the Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office (FCO) into the Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Development Office (FCDO).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper sets out the research findings on the UK’s relevant engagements in Ethiopia, focusing on 2015 to the present. It finds that the UK has made some limited progress on aspects of its foreign policy agenda in the country. Examples can be found of UK action contributing towards positive outcomes, including through forging partnerships; combining defence, diplomacy and development aid; and pursuing trade and prosperity agendas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis suggests, however, that the UK has indeed been constrained by a number of internal factors: smaller and unpredictable budgets; the unplanned merger of the FCO and DFID; the absence of a detailed strategy for Ethiopia; and weaknesses with leadership. And while the UK is still regarded as a capable and relevant actor, with skilled personnel and a measure of influence in certain areas, the overall picture is one of diminished status. Aid cuts are a factor. Losing the DFID brand has also been a net negative. Leaving the EU has not presented insurmountable practical difficulties, but it is seen by many as diminishing UK influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overriding limiting factor for UK action in Ethiopia in recent years has, however, been a worsening operating context since a change in Ethiopia’s leadership in 2018. Initial hopes for reform and greater openness have been dashed by a series of political decisions, and the devastating war in Tigray. A severe drought across the Horn of Africa has accentuated these difficulties. Widespread insecurity, hunger and violence have resulted. Decades of socioeconomic progress, achieved in part through close partnership with the UK, have been reversed. These events have upended Ethiopia’s relationship with the outside world, and the country’s trajectory is uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite tensions and challenges, the UK has successfully maintained relationships with a range of actors through its work in Ethiopia. It has also adapted to events and made positive contributions, even with reduced resources. The UK’s future strategy and approach should reflect lessons learned on the nature of the Ethiopian state, the sources and limitations of influence, and the UK’s particular contribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the June 2016 Brexit vote, successive UK prime ministers Theresa May and Boris Johnson repeatedly made reference to ‘Global Britain’. The phrase attracted widespread commentary, much of it quizzical or critical. It was, however, an attempt to signal – albeit in boosterish language – a sense that the UK would remain an outward-looking country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2021, the UK government published a policy paper, Global Britain in a Competitive Age: The Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy, commonly known as ‘The Integrated Review’. The document recognised a more competitive global context than in earlier years but reiterated the now familiar ‘Global Britain’ themes. It signalled a wish for the UK to play a proactive role in global affairs, work in partnership with others, and better integrate foreign policy, defence, trade and international development efforts. Africa was referenced in terms of forging partnerships and pursuing shared goals such as prosperity, democracy and security. The policy paper also referenced overseas aid, while leaning strongly towards promoting trade, economic resilience and the alignment of international development with wider foreign policy. Eastern Africa was highlighted as a region for increased UK engagement. Specific references were made to Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia and Sudan, and in the case of Ethiopia to working in partnership ‘to further our shared prosperity goals, our democratic values and our security interests’ and to investing in ‘regional stability, moving towards closer defence cooperation with … Ethiopia if the situation there allows’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, a RUSI research team has set out to examine how the UK has deployed its development, defence and diplomacy toolkit in Eastern Africa in support of its Global Britain agenda, looking at how it has sought to bring about positive change in the countries in which it is working while also securing secondary, largely geopolitical, benefits in the national interest at a time of domestic and international change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through a two-year research project, the team has sought to test some of the assertions that have been made around Brexit; the reduction in the UK aid budget from 0.7% of Gross National Income (GNI) to 0.5%; the increases in the defence budget; and the creation of the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp;amp; Development Office (FCDO) from the merger of the Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office (FCO) and the Department for International Development (DFID) announced in June 2020. The project, entitled ‘Furthering Global Britain? Reviewing the Foreign Policy Effect of UK Engagement in East Africa’, asks whether these structural changes have helped or hindered the progress of recent UK governments’ Global Britain policy agendas in the region, while seeking to identify factors that may have contributed to or limited the UK’s ability to project influence. It aims to answer the following research questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How effective has the UK been in making a positive difference in relation to Global Britain objectives in the region in recent years, particularly via development aid, diplomacy and defence engagement?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What impact have recent structural and policy changes such as Brexit, aid cuts and the creation of the FCDO had on Global Britain outcomes?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How does the UK’s approach and impact differ from those of others?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How do UK aid priorities for Eastern Africa align with those of the region’s governments, and what are those governments’ expectations of and recommendations for the UK?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research methodology consisted of a review of selected policy literature and semi-structured interviews. Interviews were used to identify factors that recurrently enabled or constrained UK actions, particularly with reference to positive outcomes to which the UK was thought to have contributed. Data on UK aid, defence and diplomatic engagement in the four focal countries covering the period 2015–2022 is used as a reference point to identify UK policy objectives and trends over time. The intention is to provide an overview of the realities of UK engagement in each country over a six-year period and to identify the factors that were most salient in driving outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper offers the project’s findings on the UK’s engagement in Ethiopia. It is based on a review of key secondary sources and 58 interviews with government officials, staff from multilateral organisations, and predominantly Ethiopian interviewees from academia, civil society, media and business (see Annex).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter I provides background on Ethiopia–UK relations and summarises the UK’s major policy interests and its main investments in international development, diplomatic and defence engagement in the country in recent years. From within this broad portfolio of work, Chapter II highlights several examples of UK action that have contributed to positive outcomes in Ethiopia. Chapter III identifies key factors that have constrained or enabled UK action in this period. The paper concludes with commentary and analysis of these factors in relation to the project’s research questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper should be read in conjunction with upcoming companion papers on the UK in Kenya, Sudan and Somalia, and an earlier publication that sets out the project methodology in depth and offers more detail on UK investments in the region. A synthesis paper that combines findings from the four focus countries will follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethiopia is the most populous country in Eastern Africa, with approximately 120 million citizens alongside significant numbers of refugees. Diplomatic relations with the UK were formally established in 1841. In 1868, a 13,000-strong British force invaded what was then Abyssinia to free British nationals who had been held hostage by Emperor Tewodros II as a tactic to secure military aid from Queen Victoria. From 1935 to 1936 Ethiopia fought and lost the second Italo–Ethiopian war. Its reformist emperor Haile Selassie went into exile in the UK. A British imperial force invaded again in 1940, ousting the Italian army and restoring the emperor to power in 1942. He remained in power for the next 32 years, eventually being overthrown by a military junta (the Derg) in 1974 following a bitter civil war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 1991 to 2018 Ethiopia was governed via a system of ‘ethnofederalism’. This gave autonomy to major nationalities within a polity dominated by the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), the leading actor within the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), the coalition that had ousted the previous regime in 1991.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overseeing a poor and diverse population, deferring democratisation, and committed to a state-led economy, the EPRDF sought legitimacy via economic growth. Under one-time president and later prime minister Meles Zenawi, the country achieved enviable rates of growth. In the mid-2000s it became the fastest-growing economy worldwide, registering an annual growth rate of over 10% between 2004 and 2009, and it acted as a cheerleader for international development in global forums. Approximately one-third of the country’s national budget of $9 billion came via foreign, mostly Western, aid. Seeing Ethiopia as a quintessential ‘developmental state’, the UK became a staunch partner to the EPRDF. The UK–Ethiopia relationship was built initially in the 1990s, on UK prime minister Tony Blair’s rapport with Prime Minister Meles Zenawi. Via the now-defunct DFID, the UK aligned strongly with the EPRDF’s development agenda, providing direct budget support and funding initiatives linked to government service delivery. Ethiopia at times became the largest single recipient of UK bilateral aid globally, much of it channelled via the government in support of service delivery. This left the UK open to criticism when the Ethiopian government fell short on human rights. Western donors at times tried but largely failed to use ‘conditionalities’ to push democratisation and human rights agendas. The brief move by Western donors to pause and then restart budget support in response to state brutality linked to national elections in 2005 is one example of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time, the EPRDF came to play a notable role in the formation of the African Union (AU), the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, negotiations on international development and climate change, and more. Ethiopia made a substantial investment in peacekeeping. From the 2000s onwards, Ethiopian troops were major contributors to the AU in Somalia (AMISOM), the UN Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS), the UN Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA), and the UN–AU Mission in Darfur (UNAMID). The Ethiopian National Defence Forces (ENDF) received training and income, while the Ethiopian government shaped politics and security in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meles continued Ethiopia’s long tradition of diplomatic balancing, managing cordial relationships with Western and non-Western powers from the US and the UK to Russia and China. He positioned the EPRDF as a US ally in the War on Terror, again projecting influence (including an invasion of Somalia in 2006), but also combating perceived security threats and opponents at home. Ethiopia also aligned with US policy on sanctions on Eritrea and the role of the International Criminal Court in Sudan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK supported and cooperated with Ethiopia on all of the above. In the mid-2000s, DFID championed ambitious security sector reforms in Ethiopia. These did not proceed, but for six years ENDF officers up to the Chief of Staff attended exchange visits and training courses on security sector management in the UK. UK–Ethiopia security cooperation later attracted the attention of legal activists and human rights campaigners, who questioned the wisdom and appropriateness of support and training for institutions with poor human rights records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite a troubling record on democratisation and human rights that included repression of political opposition, censorship and cancellation of elections, the EPRDF remained dominant until 2018. Internal population movement, uneven growth and demands for greater freedoms eventually fractured the alliance. By 2018, Ethiopia faced rising insecurity, popular protests and simmering conflicts in states including Afar, Somali Regional State and Oromia. In March, Abiy Ahmed, leader of the Oromo People’s Democratic Organization, was elected EPRDF chair. One month later, he was appointed prime minister. In December 2019, erstwhile members of the EPRDF created a new ‘Prosperity Party’ (PP) coalition, which incorporated new parties into the ruling coalition, but omitted ethnically based parties, including the now-disaffected TPLF. The stated PP/Abiy policy agenda included increased political freedoms, economic liberalisation and privatisation of state-owned enterprises. The poverty reduction and rural development agendas of previous EPRDF governments were jettisoned. Abroad, and by some at home, Abiy was welcomed as fresh and dynamic. However, notwithstanding the high-profile release of political prisoners, he and his allies began sidelining opponents and creating space for promised privatisation and economic liberalisation. Loosening the grip of former EPRDF members, including the TPLF, was key. While taking steps to centralise governance and unlock sections of the economy controlled by TPLF affiliates, Abiy also apparently agreed with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki and Somalia’s President Mohamed Abdullahi ‘Farmajo’ to act militarily against the TPLF. Meanwhile, internal rivalries and repression mounted, notably in 2020 towards Oromo opposition groups. In 2021, delayed national elections allowed Abiy to win popular endorsement for the PP agenda. The PP secured a resounding victory. Yet significant parts of the country were unable or unwilling to participate due to boycotts and insecurity. Allegations of manipulation were widespread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tigray was one regional state to boycott the national election. The TPLF had been returned to power there via a state-level election on 9 September 2020. Although declared successful by the Tigray election commission, the federal government, which at that point had postponed elections citing the Covid-19 pandemic, considered the process to be illegal. Tensions between the TPLF and federal government erupted into violence in November 2020. What was originally a political fight quickly grew into an internationalised civil war overlaid with harsh rhetoric, including mutual accusations of terrorism and genocide. Ethiopia’s national army, the ENDF, was backed by Eritrea and Somalia, as well as by sub-national special forces and ethnic militias, in a series of battles against the Tigray Defense Forces (TDF). Several hundred thousand have likely perished. Human rights organisations have documented atrocities and war crimes on all sides. The Ethiopian federal government faces the most damning criticism for using collective punishment against Tigray by stopping all government services, communications and media coverage and blocking humanitarian aid deliveries. Harassment and detention of not only Tigrayans but also other political opponents, journalists and critics has been marked. Many thousands have been displaced or have faced starvation due to crippling inflation and a severe economic contraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above events have changed Ethiopia’s relationship to the outside world. Security in the region has been reconfigured as Abiy brought in Somali and Eritrean forces to fight the TPLF. The UAE, Turkey, Iran and possibly China are thought to have provided military assistance to the federal government. Reports of atrocities, amplified by diaspora and social media, have drawn public condemnation from governments such as the US, the Republic of Ireland, the Netherlands and the EU. Many aid donors consequently stopped (the EU, the World Bank) or reoriented programmes away from central government channels, and a US preferential trade agreement was cancelled. While expressing concern and condemning atrocities, the UK approach has overall been more circumspect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Violence in Tigray has ebbed and flowed since breaking out in November 2020. A humanitarian ceasefire announced by the federal government in June 2021 was not fully honoured. Hostilities broke out again in August 2022, again involving Eritrean forces. In November 2022 a cessation of hostilities agreement was brokered by the AU, with US and Kenyan support. Implementing this agreement will be hugely challenging – a resumption of violence is a plausible scenario. At the time of writing, Ethiopia’s trajectory remains highly uncertain, not only due to the Tigray war but also because of the current political polarisation, unresolved grievances and conflicts in many parts of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;uk-policy-priorities-and-engagements&quot;&gt;UK Policy Priorities and Engagements&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section offers a summary of the UK’s engagements from 2015 to 2022 in the areas of development, diplomacy and defence in pursuit of its policy objectives outlined above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Development and Humanitarian Engagement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of the past 20 years, Ethiopia has been the leading recipient of UK bilateral aid globally. Expenditure averaged around £300 million per annum between 2016 and 2020. This made the UK the second-largest donor after the US (see Figure 1), contributing around 11% of Ethiopia’s recorded aid income, as reported via the OECD’s Development Assistance Committee (OECD–DAC). Approximately 60% of the UK’s bilateral aid budget has typically been channelled via central government programmes, the bulk allocated to multi-donor, multi-year funds that supported delivery of basic services. The UK also made significant Official Development Assistance (ODA) investments in other sectors such as drought response, water and sanitation, and refugee and migrant support. Smaller programmes have focused on human rights, peace and stability, and economic development. Examples include £6.5 million for the textiles industry, with subsidies to business parks to support their recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, and to fund TradeMark East Africa’s programme to reduce barriers to trade across the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After decades of high aid allocations, from 2019 a sequence of events meant that the UK bilateral aid budget for Ethiopia began to shrink. Changing ministerial priorities brought a slight reduction in the budget from 2019 (£299 million) to 2020 (£254 million). The Covid-19 pandemic triggered further cuts, as economic forecasts took a downturn, followed by a reduction in the aid budget from 0.7% to 0.5% of GNI in November 2020. By 2021, UK bilateral spending had roughly halved compared to 2019. Despite briefly allocating more than the UK in budgetary terms in 2020, Germany returned to typical spending levels by 2021, as did other leading donors. The exception was the US, which markedly increased spending, mainly on humanitarian relief. The remaining UK bilateral aid allocation to Ethiopia of £120 million in 2021 was £134 million lower than the allocation in 2020. This was the largest cut – in absolute, though not proportional, terms – of any country’s budget worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reductions were accompanied by reallocations to different sectors following a series of natural disasters, shifting ministerial priorities, Covid-19 and the Tigray war. To give a sense of the changing priorities: in 2020, the UK allocated £254 million of bilateral ODA to Ethiopia. Humanitarian aid (£103 million) accounted for 40% of this budget, as compared to 15% in 2013. Health accounted for £55 million, other social infrastructure and services £29 million, and government and civil society £14 million. Expenditure on economic development and defence engagement (mostly non-ODA-funded) was cut to a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diplomatic Engagement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as supporting international development work, the UK’s diplomatic interest in Ethiopia has historically focused on issues ranging from trade promotion to migration, counterterrorism cooperation and the Ethiopian involvement in peacekeeping. Considerable energy has also been absorbed on consular cases involving dual nationals. Diplomatic relations were tested in early to mid-2021, as Western criticism of the Ethiopian government’s blockade of Tigray and reported human rights abuses led to recriminations. As explored below, the UK has taken a lower profile approach to the Tigray war than more prominent critics, such as the EU, the Republic of Ireland and the US, which quickly paused aid packages and publicly condemned Ethiopian government actions. The UK has attempted to position itself as constructively critical, while continuing to route its aid via government. Throughout the course of the Tigray war the UK has sought diplomatic engagement with the Ethiopian federal government at the highest level, lobbying for improved humanitarian access, ceasefires and talks. It has not invested high levels of political capital, however. For example, senior ministerial visits have been infrequent: in December 2022, recently appointed foreign secretary James Cleverly visited Ethiopia almost two years after his predecessor-but-one, Dominic Raab, who visited in January 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defence and Security Engagement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK government has maintained a relationship with the Ethiopian Ministry of National Defence for over two decades and has a permanent defence attaché in the country. Defence-related expenditure is below £1 million per annum, mostly drawn from regional defence and Conflict Stability and Security Fund budgets with competing priorities, among them AMISOM. Prior to the partial withdrawal of ENDF troops from AMISOM in 2021, Ethiopia’s support to the mission was the UK’s principal focus. Many AMISOM troops have received training from the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK ambition on defence in Ethiopia has declined over time. From contemplating costly support to security sector reforms in the mid-2000s, the UK moved from running courses for senior government officials on security sector management to halting most cooperation outside peacekeeping training during the difficult transition years since 2018. Since that date, UK defence engagement has mainly focused on education and training in non-combat areas linked to the Ethiopian Peace Support Training Centre. Cooperation on counterterrorism has all but stopped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;overview-of-selected-outcomes&quot;&gt;Overview of Selected Outcomes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter highlights a number of outcomes to which UK action has contributed in Ethiopia, whether through international development cooperation, defence engagement or diplomacy. The examples below are drawn from interview data, with interviewees identifying cases from within the wider UK portfolio of work in the country, as outlined in Chapter I. The cases – which interviewees viewed as broad examples of success – identify and analyse key factors that have enabled or constrained the UK’s attempts to further its stated Global Britain agenda of cultivating partnerships and linking development, defence, diplomacy and trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;telecoms-sector-liberalisation&quot;&gt;Telecoms Sector Liberalisation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the PP came to power in December 2019, following the EPRDF’s dissolution, major sectors of the Ethiopian economy were dominated by state monopolies and closed to foreign competition. In 2018, DFID and Department of International Trade (DIT) teams opened discussions with the government about liberalisation and privatisation. With the UK offering a £100-million grant for economic reform, the PP government committed to opening up the banking and telecoms sectors. The UK then provided technical support by funding a high-level adviser to help government develop policy options. A ‘Homegrown Economic Reform Programme’ followed, which included plans to restructure agriculture, manufacturing, mining, tourism, and information and communications technology, and open each to external competition. The World Bank and the IMF subsequently announced US$3 billion in loans to support planned reforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK embassy decided to focus on the telecoms sector, perhaps as a model for others. This had a growing domestic market and solid infrastructure, thanks to the state-owned provider Ethiotel. Regional and international competitors were theoretically available to drive down prices. The FCDO funded an Ethiopian adviser, formerly of the IMF, to support the federal government on strategy. The World Bank then agreed to allocate grants and loans via a multi-donor trust fund. This was for technical assistance for telecoms liberalisation, which the UK also part-funded through an economic assistance programme, the Ethiopia Investment Advisory Facility. Former DFID development staff worked closely with former FCO political staff, the ambassador and the DIT delegation that was also housed at the embassy, who provided diplomatic and lobbying support and legal advice and outreach to UK companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2020, the Ethiopian government announced that two new telecoms provider licences would be put out to tender, establishing competition for Ethiotel. Shortly afterwards, Ethiotel halved its tariffs and built new towers across the country. The UK then funded the World Bank to develop another options paper to move the liberalisation process forward. Initial interest was shown by companies including Vodafone/Safaricom, MTN, Orange and Etisalat (UAE-owned). But tendering took place amidst news of the Tigray war. Only two bids were received, at lower values than anticipated. A bid from MTN worth approximately US$600 million was rejected by Ethiopia. In June 2021, the winning ‘Global Partnership for Ethiopia’ consortium was awarded a licence. Its bid, with a direct equity investment quoted at US$220 million, consisted of a mix of public and private investors: the UK’s Vodafone, with backing from the UK’s Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) Group, Kenya’s Safaricom, South Africa’s Vodacom Group, the US’s Development Finance Corporation, and Japan’s Sumitomo Corporation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viewed in terms of the UK’s own agendas on prosperity and integrated approaches, the bidding process was a success. Embassy staff note that the winning consortium likely benefited from longstanding DFID support to Ethiopia’s industrial park development in the decade before, underscoring the value of long-term relationship building. Development, trade and diplomatic engagement had been used in a joined-up way. The winning bid was also seen as distinctive due to the involvement of the CDC Group, which directly addressed the UK’s prosperity agenda. And – at least on paper – the bid included commitments on women’s empowerment, new technologies, access to education, the investment of more than US$8 billion, impacting over 1 million jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new Safaricom Ethiopia network went live in Addis Ababa in October 2022. Western hopes that Abiy’s government would liberalise other sectors have not, however, materialised. The federal government’s attention has for now shifted to maintaining foreign currency flows and stabilising the country’s wrecked economy. An early return to the liberalisation policy agenda, including moves to introduce more competition in the telecoms sector, looks unlikely. Critics, meanwhile, have noted the lack of a societal consensus on the PP’s rapid privatisation and liberalisation agenda, and expressed doubts about the intentions of a government which has no shame in using policy agendas to isolate opponents. For supporters of the EPRDF government’s economic model, there is also suspicion that introducing foreign competition will lead to expatriation of profits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;support-to-basic-services&quot;&gt;Support to Basic Services&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK development assistance to Ethiopia has a long history of providing budgetary and technical support via government institutions. Ongoing examples are: the Sustaining and Accelerating Primary Health Care in Ethiopia programme, worth approximately £288 million, delivered with the Ethiopian Ministry of Health; and a Rural Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) programme, costing £106 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OECD–DAC donors have taken different positions on working through the federal government of Ethiopia since the outbreak of the Tigray war in November 2020. The EU ceased budget support to the government two months later. While continuing people-focused ‘human development’ projects, the World Bank followed. Despite reduced budgets and a reorientation towards humanitarian relief, in areas such as health, education, water and sanitation, the UK continued to provide financial aid and technical assistance to government departments. It also continued to play a strong technical role in donor–government coordination meetings. The UK stood with a minority of OECD–DAC donors including Germany, Italy and Nordic countries in maintaining support to the federal government’s programmes. It initially argued that prolonged aid withdrawals would further weaken government systems and put additional stress on a crisis-affected population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The net effect of aid cuts and stoppages is difficult to ascertain in the midst of a war, drought and economic contraction, but access to and quality of health and education in Ethiopia are believed to have declined as a result. By continuing to work with the Ethiopian government, however, the UK attracted criticism for ‘soft-pedalling’ on human rights and accountability. Questions can be also raised about the effectiveness of only one leading OECD–DAC donor using a reduced aid budget to maintain the social systems of a state with little professed interest in social services and a war to fight. The federal government did not move to replace donor funding when aid cuts were announced, prioritising above all its security agenda. Moreover, national budgeting trends since 2018 show the Ethiopian government drastically deprioritising basic services, in line with the PP leadership’s interest in the private sector and infrastructure development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to arguments about the rights and wrongs of maintaining government systems, UK officials defended their approach as a way of avoiding alienating their Ethiopian counterparts, and as a means of maintaining dialogue and influence at a technical and political level with the federal government, bilateral and multilateral donors, international financial institutions (IFIs), and indeed Tigray’s leadership. In early 2022, the UK sought to use its IFI board membership, alongside its bilateral donor relations, to lobby the World Bank to restart ‘pro-poor’ programming – on condition that the federal government showed some progress on providing humanitarian access and service delivery in Tigray, increased state expenditure on service delivery elsewhere, and worked towards a cessation of hostilities. Although the political and development sections of the embassy collaborated on this, there was no significant progress for months to come. A World Bank programme worth US$300 million was nevertheless approved at board level in April 2022, part-allocated for victims of sexual violence but also for reconstruction and water, sanitation and education support via the Ministry of Finance. Critics, including the local EU delegation, were fearful that this prematurely rewarded sluggish government moves to conclude the war. However, by July 2022, the European Commission had approved €81.5 million, mostly for health and education in conflict-affected areas, to be channelled through NGOs, the UN and member-state development agencies. Its much larger (around €1 billion) multi-year development budget remains on hold due to outstanding concerns, including around human rights monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the exact sequence of events allows for different interpretations, the Tigray war erupted again in August 2022. As a result, the very limited humanitarian access that had been provided to Tigray stopped. Tigray’s services remained entirely cut off until December 2022, while countrywide service delivery has been degraded across the board. With a new phase of the Tigray conflict in full swing, the UK hardened its position, now arguing against any new World Bank spending until a cessation of hostilities was agreed. It also reportedly lobbied against an IMF mission to Ethiopia that could potentially have unlocked a valuable foreign currency loan. The question of whether to adopt a ‘politics first’ or a ‘development first’ approach, and under what conditions development aid should restart, continues to be debated, both within and between bilateral and multilateral donors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This example illustrates the dilemmas and limitations of delivering aid amidst conflict, and in a ‘non-developmental’ state. It points to the value of aligning political and technical approaches, the importance of maintaining multiple relationships, the need for flexibility, and the potential reputational costs of pursuing a minority position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;political-negotiations-in-somali-regional-state&quot;&gt;Political Negotiations in Somali Regional State&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more than two decades, an armed movement, the Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF), has fought for self-determination for Somalis in the Somali Regional State (SRS) of Ethiopia. In 2012, the Kenyan government began to mediate peace talks between the Ethiopian government and the ONLF. The initiative followed many months of quiet background diplomacy with the involvement of UK-based NGO Conciliation Resources (CR), which advised the parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CR provided negotiation trainings and advice for six years, helping to develop a ‘roadmap’ for peace. In October 2018 a peace deal, the Asmara agreement, drafted with inputs from CR, was signed in Eritrea by the ONLF and the Ethiopian federal government. It put an end to hostilities and opened the door to the ONLF leadership to transition into a political party and take part in formal politics. CR has since accompanied the actors, providing advice and organising learning visits and technical support to the Ethiopian Federal Reconciliation Commission formed in 2018. CR also assisted in the establishment of the Somali Regional Reconciliation Commission, which is now operational. CR’s work has also included supporting civil society groups with the capacity to represent victims of human rights abuses to articulate their needs within the peace process, and the inclusion of marginalised groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work was initially funded by the UK and Swiss governments from 2012 to 2014, and later by the Swedish government. Despite strong interest from the UK embassy, funding was episodic, coming from different instruments over time with stops and starts. This frustrated organisational planning. Nevertheless, the involvement of a British-funded NGO gave the UK a conduit to promote a more inclusive process. Marginalised, including rural, populations have been able to participate in the regional political process, and it has been suggested that the initiative contributed to the later formation of a women’s caucus in the Somali regional parliament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some have argued that the Somali region peace initiative contributed to wider peace and stability in the region. The Somali region did see reduced violence in the wake of the Asmara agreement, and both an FCDO project completion report and an independent review assess the CR project as having made a positive contribution to stability. But key provisions of the Asmara agreement are still to be implemented, and although SRS is relatively stable compared to Oromia or Tigray, regional elections in 2021 saw a boycott by opposition parties. The Asmara agreement did not prevent a longstanding border dispute with the neighbouring Afar region from flaring up. Combined with a regional drought, this has seen significant displacement and killings. To the extent that the region has seen some progress on stability, wider political changes likely acted as enablers: a rapprochement between the Eritrean and Ethiopian federal governments; Addis’s removal of a repressive regional governor, Abdi Iley, in 2018; and a change in the ONLF’s leadership. At the same time, CR proved adroit in capitalising on these dynamics, with UK backing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An indirect benefit to the UK government has been improved political access in the region. In parallel, the UK was also focusing its attention on sub-national (Somali-dominated) political entities across Ethiopia’s international borders – from Somaliland to northern Kenya and Somalia’s federal member states. Cross-border collaboration and the movement of goods and people across Ethiopia’s international border into northern Kenya and Somaliland has also improved. CR’s work and the UK’s political and financial support will only have contributed to, rather than delivered, such outcomes. The context in the Somali region and neighbouring territories remains daunting. The engagement could still have enduring effects, however. For the UK, it illustrates that combining long-term, low-key investments with political savvy and a trusted partner can bring results under the right conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;peacekeeping-training&quot;&gt;Peacekeeping Training&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted above, the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) has long maintained a relationship with the Ethiopian Ministry of National Defence. From 2010 to 2020, exchange visits and security sector management courses were run for senior military and political figures, including a defence minister. These are thought by the UK to have been highly regarded in Ethiopian government circles, and to have given the UK leverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around 2018, MoD support moved to focus on strengthening the Ethiopian International Peace Support Training Institute. Established in 2011, the centre was conceived as centre of excellence for training and deployment of military and civilian peacekeepers to AU and UN missions. Ethiopian military graduates receive training on a range of non-combat skills relevant for deployment in peace support operations. Donors include Japan, Germany, the US and the UK, each of whom has invested around £1.5 million. While Germany funded a research facility, accommodation and a canteen, Japan and the UK funded the construction of classrooms and delivered training in non-combat subjects such as combating sexual and gender-based violence, strategic planning, humanitarian law and countering IEDs. UK funding supports around 90 students per annum. Post-training evaluations are positive overall, although students often ask for more practical or combat-oriented training. The UK estimates that around 75% of Peace Support Training Institute graduates go on to serve in peace support operations. Missions such AMISOM have relied heavily on Ethiopian contributions, arguably helping to contain Al-Shabaab in southwest Somalia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as development work is sometimes claimed to aid wider foreign policy objectives, UK defence-related projects (peacekeeping training and beyond) are thought by the MoD to have offered the UK access to and influence with political decision-makers. Earlier security sector management training courses helped to open discussions about improving governance and accountability within the security sector, previously a DFID responsibility. But although the UK and Ethiopian defence ministries are still in routine contact, the Tigray war, weaker government-to-government relations and lower UK budgets make this agenda unrealistic for the medium term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;crisis-response--the-tigray-conflict&quot;&gt;Crisis Response – The Tigray Conflict&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a slow start, the UK mounted diplomatic, humanitarian and consular responses to the November 2020 outbreak of conflict in Tigray. As part of the diplomatic response, then foreign secretary Dominic Raab met Abiy in Addis Ababa on 22 January 2021, urging an end to violence and humanitarian access and action on human rights. In May 2021, the UK Special Envoy for Famine Prevention and Humanitarian Affairs and the FCDO Director General for Africa visited Tigray, before calling for a humanitarian ceasefire. Efforts were also made to bring pressure to bear at the UN in New York and to reach out to the head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, a UK national.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, the UK’s humanitarian contributions were significant. For example, data from the UN’s Ethiopia Humanitarian Fund Annual Report for 2021 shows UK contributions at US$18.3 million. At embassy level, humanitarian advisers mobilised funds from crisis reserves and sought reallocations from development budgets. The UN Ethiopia Humanitarian Fund places the UK as the second-most generous humanitarian donor in 2021, after Germany, which spent US$24.7 million, and ahead of the US, which spent US$12 million. A series of UK funding announcements were made through 2021 and early 2022. In October 2021, £29 million was announced for those affected by the conflict. On top of an existing allocation of £76 million in humanitarian support, in January 2022, £5 million in new funding was announced for a drought in the south, £5 million for health and education services for people affected by conflict, and £4.5 million for peacebuilding and human rights. The embassy meanwhile sought to maintain relations with the federal government at working and senior political levels, lobbying repeatedly for humanitarian access and respect for international humanitarian law, possibly even hoping for a mediation role for the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tigray blockade policy and reports of battlefield atrocities drew UK ministers into public criticism of the federal government in 2021. UK officials nevertheless counselled that ‘megaphone diplomacy’ was unlikely to work. The UK sought to build a ‘critical friend’ profile for itself in-country instead. Attempts to maintain a nuanced UK position may have had benefits in private but in public, the Ethiopian government responded negatively to all critics, fostering a blanket social media campaign that denounced ‘anti-Ethiopian’ ‘imperialists’. Some observers, including many Tigray activists, meanwhile suspected the UK of soft-pedalling on human rights, due to, variously, double standards, racism or commercial interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering the diplomatic aspects of the crisis, UK–Ethiopia relations were tested in November 2021 when Tigrayan forces advanced south from Tigray towards Addis Ababa. The UK government drew down diplomatic staff and called on UK nationals to leave. Other countries followed. The rapid process of withdrawing some 50 out of 70 diplomats from the embassy angered federal government officials and loyalists, many of whom saw the move as affirming a Tigrayan position, or pro-Tigrayan claims of impending victory. The withdrawals may have been a sensible proactive measure but proved unnecessary when US diplomatic pressure and ENDF drone attacks forced a TDF retreat. UK staff began to return five to six weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has since sought to maintain its ‘critical friend’ approach in Ethiopia, using working-level channels while seeking influence up to prime ministerial level. Lobbying for improved humanitarian access, a ceasefire and possible talks continued, bilaterally and with allies, throughout 2022. The scale of humanitarian need continued to grow, however. A humanitarian ceasefire first agreed in March 2022 was not adhered to. Conflict then restarted in August. At the time of writing it is debatable whether the UK approach or the more public and strident positions adopted by others have shifted federal government behaviour. Much is not yet in the public domain. It is too early to know whether the November 2022 agreement brokered by the AU in Pretoria and Nairobi will shift the dynamics between Tigray and Addis. The UK remains officially supportive of AU mediation efforts. Although it did not play a role in the Pretoria peace negotiations of October 2022, it may be hopeful of playing a more direct role in future, building on the ‘critical friend’ approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;enablers-and-constraints&quot;&gt;Enablers and Constraints&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter II highlighted positive examples of the UK’s development, diplomacy and defence engagements in Ethiopia. Drawing on these examples and on supplementary interviews, this chapter identifies the key factors that appear to have constrained or enabled the UK’s actions in pursuing the Global Britain agenda in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;operating-context&quot;&gt;Operating Context&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussed, the operating context in Ethiopia has worsened markedly since 2018. A country once seen as a strong partner for international development, a fledgling trading partner, and a regional stabiliser, is now a major stability risk due to political intransigence and miscalculation. This is a highly challenging context in which to execute UK policy objectives. Longer-term agendas that have featured prominently in UK policy, such as trade and development, now have an uncertain future. Ethiopia’s stuttering political transition means a loss of direction and vision. It has also reversed hard-won socioeconomic development gains, causing widespread insecurity, inflation, starvation and death, conditions that will pose challenges for decades. The worsening context needs to be factored in when assessing the UK’s progress on its Global Britain agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;resources&quot;&gt;Resources&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK built a strong reputation for itself in Ethiopia over the last two decades, driven in large part by substantial allocations of ODA that helped to fuel impressive reductions in poverty. Given the centrality of aid to the UK–Ethiopia relationship, a more than 50% budget cut has posed real challenges. Reductions in UK aid budgets have registered strongly with UK partners, and at working level with government. Informed Ethiopians feel the UK is losing influence as a result. Reduced budgets have, however, spurred some innovative thinking, with attempts to involve such organisations as HM Revenue and Customs, Ofcom and the City of London in telecoms work, and to ‘crowd-in’ World Bank funding for basic services and ‘social safety net’ programmes as a way of substituting for a reduced bilateral development budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The November 2020 announcement of the reduction in the UK aid budget to 0.5% GNI ushered in a period of ongoing uncertainty. Due to constantly shifting priorities, budgets and ministerial turnover, budgeting horizons have shrunk to one year at best. By mid-March 2022, the 2022–23 bilateral aid budget total for Ethiopia still had not been agreed. This negatively impacts the ability to plan, deliver and maintain good relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More positively, as budget cuts fall on programmes, not operations, staffing levels in Ethiopia were broadly maintained by the FCDO and MoD in the period 2015–21. The number of development (formerly DFID) advisory posts has somewhat reduced. The DIT, meanwhile, has increased its presence, appointing a director to head the office in Addis Ababa and recruiting additional staff to pursue a more joined-up approach to trade and development, in line with the Global Britain agenda. Research suggests that FCDO staff are perceived by counterparts in civil society, government and bilateral and multilateral agencies as bringing valuable technical skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strategy&quot;&gt;Strategy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the EPRDF years, socioeconomic development, closely followed by stability and counterterrorism, was uppermost among the UK’s objectives in Ethiopia. These objectives were felt to be consistent with other goals, and it was assumed that stability and poverty reduction would over time contribute to democratisation and improved governance. Post- 2016, UK governments leaned further towards pursuing trade and mutual prosperity, as set out in the 2021 Integrated Review. The arrival of the 2018 Abiy government was seen as a great opportunity. Critics have accused the UK of adopting a naïve ‘blank cheque’ approach to the Abiy transition, and in the years 2019–21, the UK approach was found wanting. Many now see the UK – and indeed other Western countries – as lacking clear objectives or a viable strategy for Ethiopia. Certainly, the UK, despite macro-level strategies such as the Integrated Review and the FCDO’s unpublished strategy for Africa, has not had a detailed strategy to guide decision-making across all sectors of its engagement in Ethiopia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;structure&quot;&gt;Structure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent years have seen incremental progress on joining up the UK’s development and diplomatic efforts in Ethiopia. This is partly due to the changing country context, which for a short time appeared encouraging for foreign trade and investment. But the shift towards more integrated working across different arms of the UK government in Ethiopia was initiated by the UK government’s overall post-Brexit foreign policy, later accentuated by the merger of the FCO and DFID.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FCO–DFID merger process has not been much noticed outside UK government circles. For more than two decades, DFID built an enviable reputation for the UK in Ethiopia, with its technical leadership and generous funding, and among those Ethiopians who follow international development debates, most expect the UK’s reputation to suffer as a result of DFID’s closure. Internally, although other events – for example, the Covid-19 pandemic and aid cuts – have been in play, the merger process is seen as time consuming and difficult. Business processes have had to be revised repeatedly. Working practices are now settling down, and the concept of integrated working is becoming more normalised, regardless of formal working arrangements. Examples of this cited by interviewees include international development staff becoming better at spotting trade opportunities, and humanitarian advisers better at factoring in the political context around famine and access questions in Tigray. At the same time, interviewees note that political staff have worked more closely with development colleagues to lobby the Ethiopian government, and to lobby IFIs to link future lending to conflict de-escalation, humanitarian access and respect for humanitarian law. Transitioning formerly separate staff into fully integrated teams, particularly with a significantly larger (former) DFID presence, is, nevertheless, taking time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;leadership&quot;&gt;Leadership&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political instability in the UK, with high rates of ministerial turnover and public questioning of politicians’ integrity, has left many Ethiopians doubtful about UK leadership. UK ministerial attention to Ethiopia is meanwhile seen as having declined from previous years, with no senior ministers visiting between January 2021 and December 2022. This has been noticed by Ethiopians, with comparisons made with France, Canada and the US, each of which is seen as having attempted to address the Tigray war at a presidential and prime ministerial level with more consistency than the UK, via ongoing calls, visits and statements. Periodic clampdowns on African migration, work permit restrictions and reports of worsening living conditions in the West are also negatively influencing attitudes towards the UK and the West. Some Ethiopian interviewees felt, however, that Western legitimacy problems dated back as far as the 2003 Gulf War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;relationships&quot;&gt;Relationships&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has maintained a range of productive relationships in Ethiopia and with regional and international partners. This includes European and Euro-Atlantic countries, from Canada to the US, Japan, and many others with whom the UK has cooperated successfully on trade, defence, development and humanitarian agendas. It also includes multilateral agencies and IFIs in relation to which the UK is both a donor and a partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end of DFID, however, along with Brexit and budget cuts, has led many to assume that British influence is in decline. It is common to hear that the UK must have lost ‘traction’ by leaving the EU. The UK has significantly reduced influence over EU aid allocations, and UK officials no longer attend routine EU cooperation meetings, such as those of the EU Heads of Mission. This has necessitated developing workarounds, meeting in other forums and communicating informally. Interviewees reflected that at times, officials have had to work harder to maintain relationships with the Ethiopian government. Other interviewees felt that moving outside EU decision-making circles has made the UK freer in its bilateral dealings with Ethiopia and freed up time previously spent on intra-EU negotiations and administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK established a good reputation for itself in Ethiopia on the basis of DFID’s leading financial and technical role in international development. Evidence of Western donor influence over successive Ethiopian governments’ handling of sensitive issues around governance, human rights and democratisation is, however, hard to find. Nevertheless, Ethiopian observers have tended to see the UK as technically competent on international development questions, but less principled than countries such as the Republic of Ireland, Denmark or Sweden on matters of human rights and democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the close alignment of the two countries’ governments prior to 2020, the Tigray conflict has upended the UK–Ethiopia relationship. With the Abiy government’s lack of interest in poverty reduction, the development-oriented foundations of the UK–Ethiopia relationship have been shaken. A falling aid budget only accentuated this problem. Meanwhile, muted UK criticisms of Ethiopian federal government strategy have left relations intact but strained. There has been no public acknowledgement of the UK’s attempt to distinguish somewhat its own approach from more strident (for example, EU, Irish and US) positions on the conflict. Views may be different behind closed doors, as the apparently productive meetings between the new UK foreign secretary and Abiy in December 2022 suggest. At the same time, some have drawn conclusions from the fact that a leaked Ethiopian foreign ministry re-engagement strategy towards Western actors did not distinguish the UK as having its own position on the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethiopian perceptions of external actors have been strongly influenced by the question of their position on the Tigray war. Those sympathetic to the opposition often see external actors, including the UK, as negligent for not holding the federal government and Eritrea to account. The reasons offered vary from callous disregard to an interest in commercial deals with Ethiopian companies and the federal government. A contrast is often drawn between strenuous Western support for, and investment in, Ukraine, and limited efforts to assist Tigray. Conversely, those more supportive of the federal government’s Tigray strategy tend to condemn foreign criticism as imperialist or as embodying double standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, the fast pace of the Tigray war seems to have wrongfooted the West at points. The US, the EU and the UK have all arguably struggled to adjust their approach to events and have changed tack more than once. For example, while the US proved a useful co-sponsor of the recent Pretoria peace talks, initial public condemnation from the US State Department in the early stages of the Tigray war was bitterly received by the federal government and not forgotten. The hand of non-Western powers has probably been strengthened in comparison. Given recent tensions, Ethiopia arguably sees Russia, Turkey (a supplier of drone technology to the ENDF), and China (supportive of non-interference via the UN) as its staunchest allies. This could change. As the history of Western and Soviet relations with Ethiopia in the 1970s and 1980s shows, Ethiopia can pivot quickly in favour of perceived interests. And the UK’s less strident positioning might yet bear fruit, with access maintained and relationships forged, as in the recent apparently productive discussions between the UK foreign secretary and the Ethiopian prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis in this paper suggests that the UK has been able to make limited progress on aspects of its ‘Global Britain’ agenda. Examples can be found of the UK combining defence, diplomacy and development, pursuing trade and prosperity agendas and – in a more mixed fashion – forging partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has been constrained by a number of factors: smaller and unpredictable budgets; an unplanned institutional merger; the absence of a focused in-country strategy; and weak leadership. At the same time, the FCO–DFID merger and ODA budget cuts spurred fresh thinking about leveraging different relationships and funding sources. But benefits around joined-up working have, at least in the short term, probably been eclipsed by losing the well-known DFID brand. Leaving the EU has not been a major constraint. It is, however, seen as reducing UK influence by Ethiopian observers, even if offering new freedoms. While the UK is still regarded as a capable and relevant actor, with skilled personnel and a measure of influence in certain areas, the overall picture is one of a relative decline in status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key issue, however, has been the changed operating context since 2018. Early promise has yielded to widespread insecurity, hunger and violence in Ethiopia, reversing decades of socioeconomic progress. The PP leadership has pursued zero-sum politics and turned away from poverty reduction and the ‘developmental state’ rhetoric of its predecessor. Ethiopia may be facing its most difficult challenges in recent history. Any shared vision for the future has gone, and the situation could worsen before it improves. It is no longer possible for external actors to ‘align with’ the Ethiopian government, deploying aid as a foundation for wider socioeconomic development and stability. This change, coupled with wartime conditions, also limits the immediate relevance of UK defence engagement. On the other hand, it is perhaps too early to judge the utility of the UK’s ‘critical friend’ diplomatic stance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Provided it is prepared to make fresh choices, despite its declining influence, the UK may be able to build on its current position. If the November 2022 cessation of hostilities holds, it will provide a basis for confidence building between Tigray and Addis Ababa. It will not, however, resolve the deeper issues, which require careful stewardship of multiple peacemaking, dialogue, reconciliation and accountability processes. The UK could, in theory, work with others in support of such efforts, providing technical leadership on a number of critical peacemaking and reconstruction questions in which it has expertise, from ceasefire monitoring to stabilisation, peacebuilding, governance, security sector reform and transitional justice. Learning from the past, however, a principled and coherent stance should be sought on these policy agendas among as broad a range of international actors as possible. While recognising the limited influence that external critics and donors, including the UK, have had on Ethiopian governments’ decision-making, questions of rights, accountability, self-determination and democracy should inform clear benchmarks for working closely with or through government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2023, the Centre for Financial Crime and Security Studies at RUSI convened a roundtable in partnership with the Institute for International and Strategic Affairs in Paris. The discussion, held under the Chatham House rule, gathered representatives from government ministries and agencies, the private sector – including banking institutions, law firms and consulting companies – and civil society. The event is part of RUSI’s ongoing study of EU sanctions implementation and wider responses to illicit finance (Euro SIFMANet), funded by the National Endowment for Democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sanctions-implementation-in-france&quot;&gt;Sanctions Implementation in France&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roundtable opened with a description of the political and operational context within which France is currently implementing sanctions. On the one hand, while the international political discussion is regarded as having achieved consensus on the need to implement sanctions and now focuses on ensuring their effective implementation, in France there remains a debate as to whether sanctions are worth imposing, driven primarily by far-left and far-right political parties, representing only 15% of the French population and yet constituting a very vocal minority. As further testament to the political context of France, participants at the roundtable from the private sector noted that the statement by French President Emmanuel Macron on the need to keep communication channels with Russia open was ill-received abroad but not, to the same extent, among the French population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the operational framework for implementing sanctions, a representative from Direction générale (DG) du Trésor (French Ministry of Finance) described the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as the ‘negotiating party’ in sanctions, while DG Trésor oversees implementation. Unlike other countries in the SIFMANet project, France has not had to introduce new laws to ensure it is able to effectively implement the restrictive measures on Russia that have been introduced since February 2022, but DG Trésor has reportedly doubled the number of staff dedicated to sanctions, as well as improving its internal departmental cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underlying the confidence displayed by officials in France’s ability to implement sanctions on Russia is the belief expressed by the public sector in France’s strong level of knowledge and experience in implementing sanctions, built on prior experience of responding to previous UN and EU sanctions regimes, as well as national sanctions for terrorist financing. This estimation is reflected in the latest Mutual Evaluation Report of France by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in May 2022. The strength of understanding of anti-money-laundering and counterterrorist-financing (AML/CFT) risks in the French financial sector, and its supervisors, is a key pillar on which the implementation of Russia sanctions relies. For example, representatives from DG Trésor highlighted the benefits they believe stem from a robust national AML/CFT system, suggesting that as trade flows largely involve financial institutions, and French banks have strong AML/CFT transaction and client monitoring systems, they are in an ideal position to also monitor for activity in breach of sanctions, and thus ensure the compliance of their clients. The French sanctions implementation system has thus placed banks on the front line of sanctions implementation, relying on their AML compliance capabilities, which require them to report any suspicious transactions to Tracfin, France’s financial intelligence unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, the unprecedented range of restrictive measures imposed by the EU on Russia now poses a new challenge for France’s capabilities. As noted above, the level of knowledge and experience of the financial sector is assessed positively, but, with the introduction of sectoral sanctions, the non-financial sector – labelled by the FATF as Designated Non-Financial Businesses and Professionals (DNFBPs) – also faces the task of implementing sanctions, often for the first time. Of note in the discussion was the risk described by DG Trésor that companies often do not understand their value/supply chains in detail and thus face difficulties identifying where restrictions need to be implemented, and smaller companies face issues related to overall awareness of sanctions and capacity to absorb the extra work required. Thus, the expertise of DNFBPs is insufficient, with authorities highlighting the real-estate sector in particular. DG Trésor emphasised that it does not expect companies to have a complete understanding of the sanctions regimes from the beginning, and that it provides support to the private sector to ensure that their implementation improves over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One area of concern is de-risking, triggered by concerns in the private sector – particularly among banks – that they do not have sufficient information about their customers to ensure compliance with sanctions requirements. This is a longstanding problem connected with sanctions regimes and – like authorities in many other countries – DG Trésor noted that they cannot control the commercial decisions of the private sector and thus de-risking is inevitable, as private sector actors seek to manage the risks they perceive from the raft of sanctions aimed at Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the controls exercised by the authorities in France, the French Prudential Supervision and Resolution Authority (ACPR) checks how designation measures are implemented in the banking sector. The ACPR has conducted onsite inspections at banks to check their systems, looking at the use and effectiveness of the private vendor screening systems on which they rely heavily. Representatives from DG Trésor noted that financial institutions can have varying degrees of risk sensitivity and set their systems accordingly. This results in differing outcomes in the effectiveness of banks’ sanctions screening efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, DG Trésor contended that a combination of a strong national AML/CFT framework, rigorous implementation of that framework by financial institutions, and a robust supervisory regime provides confidence that sanctions are being properly implemented in France. Exceptions exist, however. For example, representatives from DG Trésor noted that the agency supervising the real-estate sector has also conducted inspections, with less encouraging results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In relation to enforcement against sanctions circumvention, customs authorities are legally charged with monitoring circumvention, which is a criminal offence in France under the French Customs Code, and the same authorities are active in the freezing and management of assets other than real estate, such as yachts and artwork. A representative from DG Trésor estimated that assets frozen in France now amount to around €1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the positive picture painted by the public sector, representatives from civil society noted that there is still a lack of data transparency to assess whether sanctions are being well implemented. In this regard, the discussion also addressed the recent ruling by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) limiting public access to beneficial ownership registries, which some participants from both public and private sectors admitted disagreeing with. A remaining weakness of the company registries in France is found in the lack of beneficial ownership information for companies registered before 2017. While companies registered in the last five years had to provide information on this, companies registered before that date have still not submitted it. The problem of multiple registries existing in the country was intended to be solved with the introduction of a new unified registry in January 2023 that would integrate all registries into a unique resource. At the time of the roundtable, this new registry was closed to public access in accordance with the ECJ ruling. However, on 19 January 2023, the day after the roundtable, France reopened its registries to the public until such time as a new framework is implemented that will give access to those with legitimate interest, which will include civil society and journalists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;international-challenges&quot;&gt;International Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the overall agreement among participants at the roundtable on France’s capabilities to implement sanctions, concerns were raised by all participants across both sectors about the ongoing implementation challenges at EU and international levels. Consistent with previous SIFMANet country visits, there was a consensus among participants that lack of harmonisation among member states at EU level poses a major challenge to the effective implementation of sanctions. The fact that sanctions are adopted at EU level but implemented by member states leads to a divergence in implementation as a function of political will, national legal frameworks and private sector interpretation. An example shared by a representative from the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), not related to Russia, involved a sanctioned bank in Myanmar that owned the majority of shares in a subsidiary. In this case, some member states believed it acceptable to do business with the subsidiary bank, while others did not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MFA representative also described the asymmetries between the EU and the US in implementing sanctions. Before February 2022, sanctions were said to be a source of transatlantic tension, but this changed after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, with ensuing close coordination of mission across the Atlantic, although designations and implementation are not fully aligned. Despite this broad alignment of purpose, the failure of the EU to match the vigour with which the US implements sanctions is notable and represents a systemic vulnerability in the Western response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As sanctions implementation challenges have grown in the EU, the question of a centralised EU sanctions authority has increasingly arisen. Representatives from the MFA pointed to the coordination of implementation and enforcement achieved in the US via the role of the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). They also noted the extent to which US sanctions can have extraterritorial application, as well as the US’s ability to impose secondary sanctions on third countries that engage with sanctioned entities, thus providing a far greater reach and degree of deterrence than EU sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In line with what has been revealed in the transatlantic dialogue on Iran sanctions, most participants in the roundtable, from both the public and private sectors, expressed concern about the implications of US secondary sanctions, but did acknowledge that the EU could make greater use of its existing tools, for example the size and reach of its economy, and legal provisions that do allow for extraterritorial reach of EU sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was less agreement among participants on the utility of creating an EU-level body designed in the style of OFAC, in charge of implementing sanctions in a uniform manner across the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a description of the wider international context, a participant from the private sector presented a study that found that two-thirds of the world’s population lives in countries that are neutral or positive towards Russia and have not condemned its invasion. Thus, some countries embrace approaches that support the avoidance and evasion of EU and allied country sanctions. Examples include countries seeking opportunities to ‘de-dollarise’, and the emergence of alternatives to the SWIFT payments messaging system, such as the People’s Bank of China’s Cross-Border Interbank Payment System.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of sanctions evasion, representatives from the MFA noted that Russian circumvention networks operate at a very low level and are often difficult to identify. They agreed that smuggling networks that enable countries like North Korea or Belarus to evade sanctions are not big enough to support the significantly larger size of the Russian economy. However, participants from both the public and private sectors noted that Russia can obtain the knowhow from Iran on how to evade sanctions, particularly related to energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;next-steps-for-the-eu&quot;&gt;Next Steps for the EU&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted above, roundtable participants were not convinced that establishing an OFAC-style body in the EU would be an appropriate step forward, and judged that such a move might be met with resistance from those who increasingly call for greater sovereignty of member states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants considered that an intermediate step might be the creation of an EU High Representative on Sanctions to facilitate coordination (it is worth noting that the US State Department has long had an Office of Sanctions Coordination headed by an ambassador). In this sense, the appointment of former EU Ambassador to the US David O’Sullivan as International Special Envoy for the Implementation of EU Sanctions was regarded as a positive step at EU level, to improve the dialogue with third countries regarding Russian circumvention of sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was also agreement that the EU must make more use of its economic heft to promote compliance in the world. A consensus of views from both the public and private sector described the oil price cap as a successful tool in getting third countries to support measures to restrict the funding of the Russian war machine, as it allows such countries to support the West while at the same time bringing benefit to themselves through their compliance. Participants from both the public and private sector agreed that the EU still has tools to leverage in this regard. For example, Regulation 269/2014 was amended several times in 2022 and now allows the EU to sanction non-EU companies for engaging in business with EU-sanctioned companies and facilitating the circumvention of sanctions; and the EU also has a collection of ‘high-risk’ lists that it can use to indicate heightened financial crime risk (specifically related to money laundering and tax evasion).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the roundtable unanimously concluded that the EU must persist in improving the effectiveness of its sanctions regime by defining and clarifying designations and being consistent – that is, ensuring harmonisation of sanctions enforcement across all member states. As a participant remarked, ‘2022 was the year for designing sanctions; 2023 is the year to implement them and close loopholes’.&lt;/p&gt;

The Ukrainian military has also performed remarkably well against a much larger and initially better-equipped Russian military, in part due to the innovation of its forces.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prussian general and military theorist Carl von Clausewitz wrote that war is filled with unpredictability and that “in war more than anywhere else in the world things happen differently to what we had expected.” Just ask Russian political and military leaders in charge of the war in Ukraine today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most interesting puzzles is how Ukraine — which has a significantly smaller military, weaker military capabilities, a limited defense industrial base, and a smaller economy — was able to blunt a Russian blitzkrieg and then conduct a series of counterattacks against dug-in Russian forces. Before its invasion in February 2022, Russia had nearly five times as many military personnel as Ukraine, a defense budget eleven times larger, an economy almost eight times larger, and significantly better military capabilities. Examples of Russian capabilities included advanced fighter aircraft (such as the Su-34 and Su-35), artillery (such as the 2S7 Pion, BM-21 Grad, and 2S4 Tulpan), main battle tanks (such as the T-72 and T-90), nuclear weapons, and one of the world’s most feared offensive cyber capabilities. Yet Russia’s preponderance of power has failed to deliver it swift victory on the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand how the war has proceeded and how it may change in the future, this analysis asks three main questions: What is the current state of the war? What factors — particularly Ukrainian military innovation — have contributed to battlefield performance? What are the future prospects for continued Ukrainian innovation and the requirements for additional Western assistance in a war of attrition?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer these questions, this analysis adopts a mixed-methods approach. It draws on interviews with individuals involved in the war, including those who have fought on the Ukrainian side and those who have provided technical support to the Ukrainian military. It supplements these interviews with primary and secondary sources, as well as satellite imagery. Finally, it builds an operational-level map of the Ukrainian battlefield to highlight the force disposition and territory that Ukraine has retaken throughout the war. A separate document explains the methodology used to build the battlefield map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This analysis makes three main arguments. First, the war in Ukraine has become a war of attrition characterized by dug-in forces, trenches, human-wave attacks, artillery barrages, and high casualties on both sides. Russia likely suffered more combat fatalities in Ukraine in the first year of the war than in all of its wars since World War II combined, including the Soviet and Russian wars in Afghanistan and Chechnya. The average rate of Russian regular and irregular soldiers killed per month in Ukraine over the first year of the war was at least 25 times the number killed per month in Russia’s war in Chechnya and at least 35 times the number killed per month in the Soviet Union’s war in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Ukraine has performed extraordinarily well against an adversary with a significant advantage in material resources. One factor that has likely contributed to Ukraine’s performance is military innovation, exemplified by Ukraine’s utilization of unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) in combined arms operations. Many of Ukraine’s innovations have come from the bottom up, thanks to a military environment that encourages and enables junior officers to seek innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, while military innovation will be necessary as the war continues, it will not be sufficient to outweigh the matériel needs of the Ukrainian military, such as air defense systems, long-range artillery, armored vehicles, fighter aircraft, munitions, spare parts, and logistical resources. The West, including the United States, should prepare for a protracted war and long-term support to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of this brief is divided into four sections. First, it provides an update on the war, including through an operational map of the battlefield. Second, it examines the role of military innovation. Third, it assesses Ukrainian military innovation. Fourth, it assesses the future implications of Ukrainian innovation and foreign assistance in a war of attrition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;war-of-attrition&quot;&gt;War of Attrition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has become a war of attrition. Ukraine and Russia have constructed trench systems and made heavy use of artillery. Russia has employed human-wave attacks against fixed Ukrainian positions, including frontal assaults that attempt to seize ground by sheer weight of numbers, rather than by superior positioning or effective combined arms employment. Neither side has gained much territory since Ukraine’s successful offensives in late 2022, even as casualty rates have increased. Both militaries have suffered significant damage to their weapons systems. For example, Russia lost approximately 50 percent of its modern T-72B3 and T-72B3M main battle tanks since the war began, along with roughly two-thirds of its T-80BV/U tanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attritional nature of the fighting can also be seen in the overall disposition of Russian and Ukrainian forces, as illustrated in Figure 1. Both sides face one another along a front stretching for 500 to 600 miles. Rather than massing armored formations at decisive points, both sides have distributed infantry across the front lines, with artillery in support. Although the nature of the fighting could still change, most signs point to a prolonged war of attrition in eastern and southern Ukraine, including the Russian military’s failure in February 2023 to achieve a rapid armored breakthrough near the southern town of Vuhledar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Russian and Ukrainian Force Disposition, February 2023.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS compilation and analysis of multiple sources.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A war of attrition is one in which the belligerents attempt to wear each other down through piecemeal destruction of matériel and personnel. The essence of an attrition strategy is best described by Clausewitz, who wrote that it is a mistake to believe that there is “a skillful method of disarming and overcoming an enemy without causing great bloodshed.” Instead, Clausewitz contends that “war is an act of violence pushed to its utmost bounds” and that the side “that uses force unsparingly, without reference to the bloodshed involved, must obtain a superiority if his adversary uses less vigor in its application.” In attrition warfare, the belligerents are mainly concerned with overpowering their adversaries in a series of bloody set-piece battles that minimize exposure to enemy fire. These battles are characterized by high casualties, huge expenditures of matériel, and minimal movement of front lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In attrition warfare, a successful offensive operation pushes the defender backward along a front line, much like a bulldozer. There is limited expectation of delivering a knockout blow in which a specific action quickly renders the opponent unable to fight. The victorious side is instead the one that can more readily replace the soldiers and equipment — including long-range artillery and armored vehicles — that are lost in huge numbers. Even in cases when it is ultimately successful, attrition warfare carries huge costs. To win a war of attrition requires a willingness to absorb considerable casualties and significant losses of equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nature of the war in Ukraine can be most clearly seen in the fighting for Bakhmut, a small city in the Donetsk region of Ukraine. For months, Russian forces have relentlessly shelled the city, fought house to house, and used human-wave attacks to overwhelm Ukrainian defenders. Spearheaded in recent months by the Russian private military company Wagner Group, Russian efforts to take Bakhmut have included recruiting vast numbers of prisoners from around the country to throw at the front lines — in addition to the use of regular Russian soldiers. The Russian military has utilized three waves of fighters in some areas: a first line of contractors and green conscripts, whose casualty rates are often high; a second line of replacements; and a third line of relatively competent Russian forces. Russia is accepting enormous casualties in return for only small amounts of territory. Despite intense fighting throughout the winter, Russia has only captured approximately 400 square miles of Ukrainian territory across the entire eastern front since September 2022. As Figures 3.1 and 3.2 show, there are numerous signs of attrition warfare, including defensive infantry trench systems, anti-tank ditches and berms, and impact craters from artillery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the fighting today has devolved into a war of attrition, Russia appears to have initially employed a blitzkrieg strategy intended to win the war quickly. In February 2022, Russia concentrated ground forces at multiple points along Ukraine’s borders and attempted to pierce the front lines, race deep into Ukraine’s rear areas with the aid of air and naval power, and overthrow the government of Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Unlike a war of attrition, a blitzkrieg strategy relies on fast-moving armored and mechanized units to penetrate into the adversary’s weakly defended rear to destroy the informational, logistical, and political infrastructure on which an army depends. Russia likely based its strategy on several faulty assumptions, including that the Ukrainian population would not fight for a Zelenskyy government the Russians accused of being deeply corrupt, the Ukrainian military would be quickly overwhelmed, and the West would not support Ukraine and risk another “forever war” less than a year after the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Russia controlled approximately 7 percent of Ukrainian territory. Within a month of the invasion, Russia controlled nearly 30 percent of Ukrainian territory, including large swaths of eastern Ukraine stretching from the southern Kherson Oblast to the northern Kharkiv Oblast, as well as a sizable chunk of territory reaching from Ukraine’s northern border to outside the capital of Kyiv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian advance soon stalled, however, and Ukrainian counteroffensives in the spring of 2022 repelled Russian forces from north of Kyiv and retook territory across much of the eastern front line, reducing total Russian territorial control to approximately 20 percent. A second wave of successful Ukrainian counteroffensives liberated more territory on the Kharkiv and Kherson fronts in the late summer and fall of 2022, reducing Russian control to approximately 17 percent, where it remains today. Figure 4 illustrates liberated areas of Ukraine (in blue) between March 2022 and February 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evolution of the war to one of attrition poses significant military and political challenges for Russia, especially since the Russian military is absorbing fatalities and casualties at rates it has not experienced since World War II. Estimating fatality and casualty numbers is notoriously difficult, in part because all sides have incentives to misrepresent such figures and in part because of the difficulties inherent in collecting data during active combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to CSIS estimates, there have been approximately 60,000 to 70,000 Russian combat fatalities in Ukraine between February 2022 and February 2023. These estimates include regular Russian soldiers from the Russian armed forces, Rosgvardiya, Federal Security Service, and Federal Guard Service; fighters from pro-Russian militias, such as the Donetsk People’s Militia and Luhansk People’s Militia; and contractors from such private military companies as the Wagner Group. Overall, Russia has suffered roughly 200,000 to 250,000 total casualties — personnel wounded, killed, and missing — during the first year of the war. These casualty estimates also include regular Russian soldiers, militia fighters, and private contractors from the Wagner Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some types of authoritarian regimes are willing to accept high casualties in interstate conflicts, but Russian casualty numbers are unprecedented for post-World War II Russia. As highlighted in Table 1, the number of Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine during the first year of the war was likely greater than the entire number of Russian soldiers killed in every war Russia has fought since World War II combined. The number of Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine in the first year was roughly two to five times greater than the number of Russian soldiers killed in Chechnya over nearly a decade a half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rate of attrition is also much higher in Ukraine than in any Soviet or Russian war since World War II. Russia suffered an average of roughly 5,000 to 5,800 regular and irregular soldiers killed per month in Ukraine over the first year of the war. In comparison, Russia suffered somewhere between 13,000 to 25,000 fatalities in Chechnya over a 15-year period (with a three-year pause), an average rate of between 95 and 185 soldiers killed per month. The Soviet Union also suffered roughly 14,000 to 16,000 combat fatalities in Afghanistan, an average rate of between roughly 130 and 145 soldiers killed per month. Vladimir Putin has thus far been willing to accept large numbers of Russian fatalities and casualties and has suffered limited political repercussions. But it is unclear that he will be able to do so forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1: Russian Forces Killed in Selected Wars Since World War II.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ compilation. See endnote 29 for complete list of citations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Russian fatalities in Ukraine pale in comparison to the Soviet death rate in World War II, the political context is extremely different. The Soviet Union suffered between 8 and 11 million military fatalities and another 14 million civilian fatalities following Germany’s invasion in 1941. However, the Soviets were the defenders at the start of the war and were, therefore, fighting a war of survival. Such casualties were a necessary cost of national existence. But Russia is currently the aggressor in Ukraine, where it is engaged in a war of choice against a country that poses no meaningful threat to Russia’s survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Russia invaded Ukraine from an apparent position of strength, countries with a significant material advantage — a larger population, a larger or more industrialized economy, a larger military, and greater military expenditures — are not guaranteed victory in war. Russia lost to Japan during the 1904–1905 Russo-Japanese War, despite having more naval ships, guns, and people. Israel repeatedly defeated its Arab foes in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, 1967 Six Day War, and 1973 Yom Kippur War. The limits of material preponderance are true even of wars of attrition. As one study concludes, “the cost of an attrition strategy is always high” and “success is relatively uncertain.” As some analysts have noted, wars of attrition may actually favor the weaker side, including if weaker militaries can find ways to fight more innovatively than their stronger enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;military-innovation&quot;&gt;Military Innovation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several factors help explain battlefield performance in conventional wars. They include a combination of the military balance (especially the quantity and quality of troops and weapons on both sides), strategy, tactics, morale, combat motivation (what some have called the “will to fight”), force employment, and political and military leadership. Military outcomes are generally not easy to predict, despite Napoleon’s comment that “God is on the side of the big battalions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military innovation is likely one important factor in determining battlefield success. As used here, military innovation involves a change in the conduct of warfare intended to improve the ability of a military to generate combat power. A change in the conduct of warfare does not necessarily require a change in military doctrine, but it does involve change at the operational level of war. Change could occur throughout the entire military, or it could be a narrower segment, such as a military service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet military innovation is difficult to achieve. Over 400 years ago, Machiavelli wrote: “And it should be considered that nothing is more difficult to handle, more doubtful of success, nor more dangerous to manage, than to put oneself at the head of introducing new orders.” Innovation can occur during peacetime when leaders — especially military leaders — respond to changes in the international landscape and create environments that facilitate and encourage junior officers to pursue innovations and new ways of war. But it is impossible to predict the future with certainty, and militaries face incentives to avoid change or hedge between alternate futures rather than commit fully to an innovation that has not been proven in combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wartime allows for testing innovations against a real adversary but comes with its own obstacles. Militaries must balance the incentive to innovate against the daily need to defeat an enemy who is trying to kill their members and destroy their organizations. There is often insufficient time to assess wartime conditions, reformulate strategic conceptions, and build new forces before the outcome of a war is largely determined. Old and new methods can be tested in combat, but time constraints and limited intelligence make it difficult to take advantage of any apparent innovations in time to win the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, military innovation does occur during wartime, especially when operational control is decentralized, as was the case with the U.S. Navy submarine force during World War II. Innovation does not necessarily require substantial resources; major innovations have occurred during periods of constrained resources at least as often as during periods in which budgets were large and growing. Key resources for innovation are talented military personnel, time, and information — not money. Junior officers may be particularly important. Several important wartime innovations (such as the tank and microwave radar) and organizational innovations (such as strategic targeting for U.S. bombers) were pursued from the bottom up by junior officers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ukrainian-innovation&quot;&gt;Ukrainian Innovation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military innovation is one factor that likely explains how Ukraine has overcome its disadvantages, though it is clearly not the only factor. The Ukrainian “will to fight,” political and military leadership (including that of President Zelenskyy), strategy, and force employment have all likely mattered, as has military, economic, and diplomatic support from the West. But innovation increases the ability of a weaker military to reverse the gains of a stronger one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also reason to believe that innovation may grow even more important as the war grinds on. Ukraine can win a war of attrition if it can impose greater losses on Russia than it suffers in any given engagement. Although continued Western aid, clever strategy, and sound force employment will contribute to such an outcome, new ways of fighting that improve the efficiency of Ukrainian forces will also be important for winning a long war of attrition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One example of Ukrainian innovation has been the use of UASs in combined arms warfare — the blending of infantry, direct and indirect fire, aviation, and other joint capabilities to achieve political and military objectives. Ukraine is hardly the first country to use UASs in conventional warfare, but its employment of a wide variety of UASs in a large number of missions and its integration of UASs into more sophisticated targeting complexes have differed significantly from what came before — particularly Azerbaijan’s use of UASs against Armenia in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has operated several types of UASs in combined arms warfare. One has been the Bayraktar TB-2, a medium-altitude, long-endurance UAS, which was extensively used in the early phase of the war. The TB-2 can perform a range of intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and attack missions. Ukraine has operated small A1-SM Furia flying-wing UASs for day and night reconnaissance, hand-launched Leleka-100 and Spectator-M mini-UASs for artillery spotting and aerial reconnaissance, the UA Dynamics-made Punisher UAS for striking military targets, and larger PD-1s and UJ-22s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian forces have also utilized off-the-shelf commercial UASs, such as the DJI Mavic quadcopter. Mavics have been particularly useful for battlefield intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance for frontline forces. In addition, the United States has provided Ukraine with several loitering munitions — UASs intended to locate and destroy a target by detonating against it — such as the tube-launched Switchblade 300 and the long-endurance tactical Phoenix Ghost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has utilized these UASs to conduct several types of missions as part of combined arms warfare, such as target identification for artillery and aircraft, strike, battlefield awareness, and information operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Target Identification: Ukraine has used UASs to identify targets for artillery and aircraft. For example, Ukrainian ground forces have used forward-deployed UASs to detect Russian infantry units. This information is then distributed to command-and-control centers, who then pass it on to Ukrainian units operating 122-mm howitzers and other systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strike: Ukraine has utilized UASs for strike missions, including against land, air, and maritime targets. Ukrainian Bayraktar TB-2 drones have struck numerous Russian targets, such as howitzers, main battle tanks, supply trucks, towed artillery, maritime vessels, command posts, logistics depots, and Buk, Tor, Strela, and ZU-23 air defense systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Battlefield Awareness: Ukraine has used UASs for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions to monitor Russian activity and facilitate battlefield awareness. The sensors on some Ukrainian UAS platforms can collect signals intelligence, record video, and collect other information for operational use by ground and air forces. These capabilities have also allowed UASs to be useful for battle damage assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Information Operations: Ukraine has utilized UASs for information operations, such as showing successful strikes and placing them — overtly or covertly — on social media platforms such as Twitter, Telegram, and TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, Ukrainian forces have utilized software packages that are often developed and deployed by volunteers. The most well-known of these applications is Kropyva, an intelligence mapping and artillery software populated by information from UASs and other sources. Forward-deployed tactical units have downloaded the software and continuously updated it on handheld tablets and computers. Kropyva allows Ukrainian units to plot both enemy and friendly positions. It uses short-wave and digital radio stations compatible with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s security communications standards and is relatively easy to use. Other home-grown software solutions include GIS Arta, ComBat Vision, and the recently deployed Delta situational awareness and battlefield management system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/TNKk0oL.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5: Kropyva Defense Mapping Software.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Army SOS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has also leveraged Starlink to integrate some of its systems, another tactical innovation that has allowed Ukraine to overcome Russian jamming. Starlink is a commercially owned satellite internet constellation developed by SpaceX to provide high-speed, low-latency broadband internet using advanced satellites in low earth orbit. Starlink has enabled members of the Ukrainian organization Aerorozvidka, for instance, to carry out intelligence collection and fire support operations against Russian positions. Some Ukrainian UASs rely on Starlink against forward-deployed Russian forces, and Ukrainian forces and civilians use Starlink to communicate using encrypted satellite communications. Overall, Starlink has helped blunt Russia’s attempts to jam signals, block the internet, and undermine Ukrainian command-and-control capabilities. In addition, some Ukrainian troops have strapped Starlink user terminals to drones involved in strike operations, allowing the craft to be steered with the help of the internet connection provided by satellites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other Ukrainian military innovations include placing Harpoon anti-ship missiles on flatbed trucks for ground-based, stand-off attack; mounting grenades and other improvised explosive devices on UASs, including Mavics; utilizing “swarming” tactics with multiple UASs; and using 3D printers to build plastic harnesses with light sensors and a mechanical clasp that snap onto UASs and carry grenades. Overall, Ukraine has used its military innovations to help defend against Russian advances, conduct counterattacks in eastern and southern Ukraine, and improve overall battlefield performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But obstacles to innovation remain. According to CSIS interviews, the lack of official Ukrainian government support discourages adoption of volunteer-made systems, which prevents the military from scaling their use across the force. Some officers fear the consequences of using a system they lack official permission to use. Others lack the communications hardware required to take advantage of potentially valuable software. The use of commercial quadcopters is also hampered by the makers’ efforts to prevent users from integrating them into military systems, which involve firmware changes between models and increasingly restrictive application programming interfaces. The absence of government funding also means that platform usage is constrained by developers’ ability to raise funds from individual donors. Ukraine has begun taking positive steps to enable the innovation already happening in the country by officially sanctioning the use of the Delta management defense system on the battlefield, but a more comprehensive and systematic approach would be better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Ukraine attempts to maintain its innovation advantage, it should avoid apparent innovations that decrease combat power or forestall victory. Innovation is an inherently risky process. Some research suggests that the innovation process goes wrong when a military cannibalizes an old capability to create a new one, ignores the risks associated with a particular innovation, or rushes the vetting process in order to speed deployment. Innovation can also fail if it contributes to a flawed theory of victory. Ignoring the risks of innovation and rushing through the vetting process are real risks — and the current informality of Ukrainian innovation could exacerbate them. Volunteer developers are unlikely to have the necessary capacity to evaluate all the risks because they lack access to classified data and specific analytic expertise held by military or intelligence bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;future-implications&quot;&gt;Future Implications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine is far from over. Ukraine’s achievements on the battlefield have been the result of several factors, including Russian failures and Ukrainian successes. Military innovation has been — and will remain — important. But the Ukrainian military should formalize the current system of domestic innovation and create structures and organizational processes to monitor its successes and failures. To maximize the power of these innovations, Ukraine should give units the permissions necessary to formally adopt the tools they are already using. The military should also consider creating an analysis center to evaluate the impacts of bottom-up innovations on combat performance and other measures of success. With that data and analysis in hand, the Ukrainian military can then make better-informed decisions on which innovations to scale up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign partners should also consider providing financial support to this infrastructure or the innovators themselves, who currently depend mostly on crowdfunding. Increased funding would empower Ukrainian innovators who are currently constrained by the need to support themselves while donating their time and expertise. Funding would also provide another way for governments to provide “nonlethal” aid to Ukraine if forced to do so by domestic political constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the war of attrition continues, however, it is unlikely that military innovation will be sufficient to outweigh the matériel needs of the Ukrainian military. The West, including the United States, should prepare for a protracted war and long-term support. Ukraine’s needs have evolved from the initial stage of the war when it needed short-range defensive weapons, such as Javelin anti-tank and Stinger anti-air missiles, which were helpful to conduct defensive operations against advancing Russian forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with training and intelligence, Ukraine now needs advanced systems to conduct offensive operations in a protracted war, such as air defense systems, long-range artillery, armored vehicles, fighter aircraft, and munitions, along with spare parts and training. These types of munitions, weapons systems, and matériel are essential to assisting Ukrainian forces conduct effective counterattacks against dug-in Russian forces. Figure 6 shows the impact craters from artillery in yet another example of attrition warfare. Even defenders in a war of attrition need to pursue operational offensives to wear down the enemy, reduce pressure on vulnerable areas, and satisfy political audiences at home and abroad to continue support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/3643Ysg.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 6: Artillery Impact Craters near Pavlivka, Ukraine.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, wars of attrition are insatiable consumers of munitions, and their heavy use takes a toll on weapons systems and platforms. On some days the Russian military has launched 50,000 artillery shells at Ukrainian military and civilian positions. Supporting Ukraine through a prolonged war of attrition means supplying them with the munitions the Ukrainian military needs. Ukraine has a strong track record of innovating and integrating Western weapons systems into its military operations over the first year of the war. It should be able to effectively integrate new weapons systems into its arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, more Patriot surface-to-air missile systems would be useful. So would MGM-140 Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS), which are surface-to-air missiles that can be fired from a High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), which Ukraine already possesses. ATACMS can be fired three times the distance of standard rockets, allowing Ukrainian ground forces to move farther away from Russia’s deadly long-range artillery. Tanks and infantry fighting vehicles are essential to providing fire support and carrying infantry into battle. Abrams, Challenger 2, and Leopard 2 tanks will be helpful, along with AMX-10 RC armored fighting vehicles. But continuing support for these vehicles — including spare parts, munitions, and trainers — will also be critical. MQ-1C drones would provide helpful intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and strike capabilities to Ukrainian forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Ukraine’s Soviet-era air force needs more, better aircraft to outcompete Russia in a war of attrition. Combat losses in the past five months have cost it over 50 combat aircraft out of an original fleet of approximately 124 combat aircraft. With fewer aircraft available, each plane endures more sorties and wears down faster. Without replenishment from the West, Ukraine could lose the ability to defend its airspace and target Russian ground forces, potentially allowing Russia to resume its blitzkrieg. The U.S. Air Force is divesting more than 200 A-10s, F-15s, and F-16s to make room for sixth-generation fighters, hypersonic weapons, and other systems. Ukraine could use some of these aircraft — along with trainers and spare parts — particularly for close air support missions to aid Ukrainian ground forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine needs munitions, weapons systems, logistics, training, and intelligence at the appropriate scale. Russia still has an advantage over Ukraine in the number of munitions and the quality of some weapons systems — such as long-range artillery, advanced fixed-wing aircraft, and naval capabilities — though Ukrainian military innovation has been impressive. U.S. and other Western military aid to date has been helpful, though sometimes too slow. Moving forward, the U.S. and Western defense industrial bases will be essential for a long, grinding war of attrition.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;控方就「共謀者原則」交25頁證據列表 公民黨抗爭派記者會等均用以指證所有被告&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/XtmBULM.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，16人否認「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，今（27日）踏入審訊第16天。控方今表示已完成區諾軒的主問，並向辯方呈交「共謀者原則」下針對各被告的25頁證據列表，列出會依賴的文章、帖文及影片等。控方確認，本案協議於2020年2月中已由戴耀廷和區諾軒二人達成，而列表上的所有證據均用以指證所有被告，即使他們當時未加入串謀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;有辯方律師質疑，列表範圍廣闊，包括公民黨和抗爭派記者會片段、社民連網站、甚至個別被告FB帖文，問是否全用以指證所有被告，控方確認。法官李運騰指，控方立場是否合理有待辯論，並預料本案將牽涉兩方面法律爭議，包括「共謀者原則」是否適用於當時尚未變成違法的協議（《國安法》於2020年6月30日才生效）、及當時尚未參與其中的被告。法官陳慶偉批准將案件押後至周三（3月1日）續審，以讓辯方審視文件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方完成主問-今交共謀者原則證據列表&quot;&gt;控方完成主問 今交「共謀者原則」證據列表&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方上周五表示主問大致完成，並會於今天交代如何援引「共謀者原則（co-conspirator’s rule）」舉證，即依賴其他被告的什麼言行指證其他被告。主控萬德豪今甫開庭表示，沒有其他問題要問區諾軒，亦已向辯方呈交「共謀者原則」下針對各被告證據的列表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉問及，列表上是否只限於區諾軒的證供，抑或是控方依賴的全部證據。萬德豪回應是本案依賴的全部證據，即包括還未向區諾軒展示的證據。法官陳仲衡亦提及，該列表只列出文章、Facebook 帖文、影片及影片謄本等文件證據，問會否包括區諾軒庭上口供，萬指會待區完成作供後再說明。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方稱協議於2020年2月由戴區二人達成-所有證據均用以指證所有被告&quot;&gt;控方稱協議於2020年2月由戴區二人達成 所有證據均用以指證所有被告&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡指出，列表第一篇文章〈立法會奪半的最後拼圖，原來只需教中小企咁做！〉並未由區諾軒提過，控方同意。法官陳慶偉遂指，該文章於2020年2月15日發布，問控方是否認為協議在當天已達成？萬德豪同意，並指協議是由戴耀廷和區諾軒達成。陳慶偉遂問，除了戴區二人，該文章是否還用來指證任何人？萬德豪回應該文章是用來指證所有共謀者，即使他們當時還未加入串謀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰表示，控方的立場是否成立有待辯論，可留待控方案情完結時聽取雙方的陳詞。陳慶偉再問控方，其立場是否列表上所有證據均用來指證所有被告（“They are against all the defendants?”）？萬德豪指那是正確的，陳續指相信辯方亦需時消化他所澄清的內容。陳慶偉其後欲釐清列表上所有證據均由控方依賴時，一度未能找到適合字眼，萬德豪補充，控方是以所有證據來指證（implicate）所有被告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方稱範圍廣闊需時審視及索指示-官批准押後至周三&quot;&gt;辯方稱範圍廣闊需時審視及索指示 官批准押後至周三&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表林卓廷及黃碧雲的大律師沈士文其後表示，控方25頁的列表範圍一如他所預期的非常廣闊，又指雖並非現時作陳詞，但仍望提出觀察，顯然該列表的大部分證據，雖或可證明串謀或協議已存在，但不可能（no way）用以證明部分被告曾參與串謀。他望控方收窄證據範圍，指若範圍如此廣闊，辯方需就每項證據作出爭辯，亦需時處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰表示明白辯方關注，但現時並非處理該議題的適當時候。沈士文回應，辯方需時審視及就有關文件索取指示，以及準備對區諾軒的盤問，望押後至周三續審。大律師 Trevor Beel 等均表示同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉認為，給予辯方時間審視該冗長的文件（lengthy documents）是公平的做法，批准押後至周三早上，屆時可先處理承認事實。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官提法律議題-包括達成協議時未違法被告未加入串謀-原則是否適用&quot;&gt;官提法律議題 包括達成協議時未違法、被告未加入串謀 原則是否適用&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表鄒家成的大律師陳世傑其後再問，是否稍後才處理共謀者原則是否適用的問題。法官李運騰同意，指援引該原則其中一項要求，是被告作為共謀者的表面證供成立，故須待控方舉證完畢才能決定。法官陳慶偉亦指本案有4名被告任控方證人，現時僅區諾軒完成主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑再欲澄清，是否即文件上所有證據均會用以援引「共謀者原則」，法官同意，陳慶偉並重申據控方立場，該「串謀（conspiracy）」於2月15日已達成。陳世傑一度更正當時並未成為「串謀」，陳慶偉回應他只是廣義地使用該字，稱「串謀」不一定指「刑事串謀（criminal conspiracy）」，亦可指「協議（agreement）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰其後主動指出，預料本案有一些法律爭議需處理，包括若該協議達成時尚未變成違法，「共謀者原則」是否適用（“… whether the rule can apply to an agreement which is yet to be unlawful at that time.”）；以及若被告當時尚未參與其中，「共謀者原則」又是否適用（“… whether the rule can apply to defendant at that stage yet to be a party.”）。李運騰早前審訊已曾指出，此前的初選「計劃（scheme）」或者並不違法，不過在《國安法》實施後，原本合法的行為也可變成非法，該「計劃」便成了非法的「串謀（conspiracy）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方問公民黨記者會是否用以指證非公民黨被告-控方yes&quot;&gt;辯方問公民黨記者會是否用以指證非公民黨被告 控方：Yes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表陳志全的大律師馬維騉則舉例，列表中列出公民黨和抗爭派記者會片段、社民連網站截圖，甚至個別被告如鄭達鴻的 Facebook 帖文，惟其當事人不屬公民黨和社民連，望控方澄清是否指上述證據，包括個別被告的發言，都可全用來指證其當事人。法官陳慶偉着馬維騉直接與控方商討，指法庭只處理雙方申請，而非雙方之間的爭拗。馬維騉一度指法庭可當成是他的申請，惟陳慶偉再着他與控方商討，又提醒馬只是代表其當事人一個的利益。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1DGsK0J.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 陳志全&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主控萬德豪則回覆，「答案非常簡單，只有一個字，Yes」，指該些證據均用來指證所有被告，包括陳志全。法官陳慶偉重申，該立場是否正確有待處理，但那是控方的立場。法官李運騰再問，控方是否即指公民黨的發言是指證所有被告參與串謀的證據，萬德豪確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表何桂藍的大律師 Beel 最後提出，並未承認戴耀廷的相關文章，認為控方需正式地提出（formally produce）該些證據，即交由下載文章的人就此作供，而非交由僅看過文章的區諾軒確認。他在法官詢問下同意，欲爭議就戴耀廷文章的證物鏈。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件周三（3月1日）續審。散庭時，有旁聽人士喊：「加油！」梁國雄等亦向旁聽席揮手。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件編號：HCCC69/2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪被告包括獲准保釋的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信10人，及還柙的何桂藍、吳政亨、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及余慧明6人。&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>獨媒報導</name></author><summary type="html">控方就「共謀者原則」交25頁證據列表 公民黨抗爭派記者會等均用以指證所有被告</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Ukraine War, One Year On</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-02-24-ukraine-war-one-year-on.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Ukraine War, One Year On" /><published>2023-02-24T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2023-02-24T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/ukraine-war-one-year-on</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-02-24-ukraine-war-one-year-on.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Russia’s assumption that Ukraine would fall quickly has led to an intense and protracted war.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Russia assumed that Ukrainian political opposition would be minimal, and that the ‘decapitation’ of the Ukrainian government would lead to a collapse of resistance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This did not go to plan.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late 2021, satellite imagery documented the massive concentration of Russian forces amassing on the border. Ukraine, for its part, was uncertain whether the build-up was a prelude to an invasion, and there was debate over whether it was an attempt to sow panic in Ukraine or if Russia was preparing for a more limited offensive to take Donbas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OabCwyb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 24 February 2022, the Russian army invaded on four axes. From the north, Russian troops invaded via Belarus and on an axis from Sumy to Chernihiv. In the south, the 58th Combined Arms Army pushed out of Crimea. Finally, Russian forces and proxies conducted operations in Donbas to pin down the bulk of Ukraine’s regular units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hD2OIhk.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;invasion&quot;&gt;Invasion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/LsFYFyO.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision to split a relatively small force on four axes only made sense in the context of an assumed political collapse. Against many predictions, this failed to materialise, and Russian forces failed to take Kyiv. Unprepared for a longer conflict, with many soldiers receiving little to no forewarning or even being provided with adequate maps, the Russians became bogged down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;donbas-offensive&quot;&gt;Donbas Offensive&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/gVLAHet.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having failed to take Kyiv, Russia shifted its focus to a more limited campaign to seize Donbas and make further gains in the south of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian approach was more deliberate here, and drew on the Russian army’s advantages in both artillery and capabilities such as electronic warfare (EW) complexes. At the peak of the campaign, Russia was firing 32,000 artillery rounds per day in Donbas and had emplaced 10 EW complexes on each 20 km stretch of the front. This combination of fire and information superiority allowed the Russians to inflict heavy attrition on the Ukrainians, and to take cities like Lyman, Popasna and Severodonetsk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the south, despite a protracted resistance, Russian forces succeeded in taking Mariupol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite their advantages, Russian forces sustained heavy casualties storming Ukrainian defences in areas of the country that had been steadily fortified after 2014. This was especially true of rebel troops from Luhansk and Donetsk, who were used as expendable cannon fodder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The arrival of the HIMARS and its 70 km-range M31 rocket, as well as the M270 MLRS system, altered this dynamic by allowing the Ukrainian defenders to target the ammunition depots and railheads on which Russia depended to sustain its rate of fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;counteroffensive&quot;&gt;Counteroffensive&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ewKqeNf.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By September 2022, Russia was at the nadir of its power. The force with which it had invaded was largely exhausted, and Russia’s leaders were still reluctant to order mobilisation. As such, Russia was manning a frontline of over 1,000 km with a relatively small force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine began a series of shaping operations around Kherson in late 2022, which included striking key bridges like the Antonovsky Bridge. Anticipating an offensive, Russia shifted many of its best remaining units, including units of the Russian Airborne Forces, to Kherson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine instead took the offensive in the north, where a brigade-sized Ukrainian force punched through undermanned Russian defences around Kharkiv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around Kherson, by contrast, Ukraine’s offensive was slower and more deliberate, and faced stubborn Russian resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/sNbJ2hD.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;military-state-of-play&quot;&gt;Military State of Play&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/oJ6cTPM.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under General Sergey Surovikin, Russia shifted to a defensive posture on the frontline, while conducting a strategic bombing campaign over the winter. Unlike other Russian actions, the withdrawal from Kherson was competently executed. A shift to the defensive and the introduction of mobilised forces to fill gaps on the frontline eased some of Russia’s problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was combined with an air campaign using cruise missiles and Iranian-made UAVs to target critical infrastructure, especially the energy grid. Ukraine faces a conundrum: it can protect its cities, but in doing so it expends air defence interceptors, often against replaceable targets like the Iranian Shahed-136. If interceptor stocks fall too low, the Russian air force can operate much more freely over Ukraine. Western systems such as the German-made Gepard self-propelled anti-air gun have helped alleviate this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the campaign will likely not remain defensive. Russia has mounted localised offensives around Bakhmut, relying on a combination of low-quality troops hired by the Wagner Group from Russia’s prison population, as well as more capable units both from Wagner and elements of the Russian army withdrawn from Kherson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/e0ehqlR.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The replacement of Surovikin by Valery Gerasimov, Russia’s Chief of the General Staff, as well as the further mobilisation of conscripts, suggest a potential offensive. Though some conscripts were rushed to the frontline to fill gaps, others appear to have been formed into coherent units that have not yet been committed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coming months could prove pivotal; a successful Russian offensive or further attrition of Ukraine’s forces could shift the balance. Equally, if a Russian offensive fails, it could lead to a cascading collapse of morale among poorly motivated troops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/YunawFb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Russia does stay on the defensive, however, Ukrainian forces equipped with Western armour will have to take the offensive against a more ‘primitive’ but larger and well-entrenched force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the medium term, Russia believes that the exhaustion of Western materiel and the erosion of both Ukraine’s manpower and its economic backbone will create the conditions for Russian success. If this window of vulnerability is crossed, the regeneration of Western (in particular, US) defence production and the cumulative effect of Russia’s own economic weaknesses could tilt the balance the other way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stock-take&quot;&gt;STOCK TAKE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of the war on Ukraine’s population and critical infrastructure has been immense. Millions of people have been displaced, and Russia is constantly targeting energy infrastructure with drones. The economies of both countries have taken a significant hit as a result of the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;internally-displaced-persons&quot;&gt;Internally Displaced Persons&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/NU3j8Cc.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The toll on Ukraine’s society has been huge. By December 2022, roughly 5,900,000 people were internally displaced within Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That number has recently been updated to 7.1 million by some sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A total of 12–14 million Ukrainians have been displaced overall since the war began, according to UN figures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;infrastructure&quot;&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/i5bddJC.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s air and missile campaign against Ukraine’s energy grid has focused on transformers and substations. Against large transformers, Russia uses cruise missiles like the 3M-14 Kalibr and ballistic missiles like the 9M723. Smaller substations and facilities housing personnel have been attacked with the Shahed-136.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, Ukraine’s electricity usage is at 75% of its peacetime levels, with rolling blackouts. However, the system is vulnerable to a rapid drop in functionality if multiple transformers go down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has also targeted the facilities and personnel of the Ukrainian company ZTR, which produces transformers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though winter has almost passed, other risks remain – for example, the possibility of a failure of the energy grid cascading into other areas such as military communications, logistics or the management of dams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compatibility issues constrain the direct resupply of Ukraine, and personnel may prove even harder to replace than material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-position&quot;&gt;Economic Position&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/VIwvN4b.png&quot; alt=&quot;image12&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Russia and Ukraine have economic vulnerabilities, but these will become apparent at different stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facing a crunch in hard currency due to Western sanctions and price caps, Russia can only sustain its war effort without undergoing crippling inflation by shifting budgetary allocations from civilian expenditure to military spending. Defence spending will now consume 33% of the federal budget. Even with the focus on reallocating resources, Russia has seen a rise in the federal budget from 23 trillion roubles to 29 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia will run a deficit for the first time in decades this year, and individual regional governments are also running deficits driven by mobilisation costs. As cuts to social spending cause a slowdown in consumption and mobilisation draws workers from the civilian economy, this problem will be compounded. Russia can no longer borrow on open financial markets, and is unlikely to be able to do so easily domestically. However, the country’s national wealth fund (which largely relies on revenue from hydrocarbon exports) is likely to sustain this deficit for a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with price caps, Russia’s oil revenues will exceed 2021 levels, although its revenues from gas exports will be harder to replace. Russia is adapting to the loss of revenue by raising taxes on mineral extraction for hydrocarbon companies as well as other extractive industries, which some expect to offset roughly 75% of lost revenue. Even so, the Russian state will still face a budget deficit, and higher taxes could drive capital flight if avenues for capital to leave Russia remain available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Ukraine faces a more immediately grim economic outlook, having lost 30% of its GDP due to the war (as opposed to the 3% contraction faced by Russia).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to win, given its more immediately dire economic circumstances, Ukraine needs either a decisive military victory in short order, or the ability to sustain a war economy over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia can exacerbate Ukraine’s challenges both through air and missile attacks and by resuming its blockade of Odesa on the Black Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Securing the Ukrainian economy for a long fight will require not only economic aid from Ukraine’s partners, but also the ability to secure physical infrastructure and sea lines of communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;projection&quot;&gt;PROJECTION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;industrial-base&quot;&gt;INDUSTRIAL BASE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia maintained a large pre-war defence industrial base, employing 2 million people in its defence sector. Though rates of expenditure over the last year have strained its stockpiles of key capabilities, it likely retains the capacity to build munitions such as 152mm and 122mm shells at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An increase in the defence sector’s share of the economic pie and contractions elsewhere in the economy could see the size of the Russian workforce grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are key bottlenecks in Russian defence manufacturing. First, the Russian defence sector is heavily reliant on imports of machine tools. Russia has mitigated the risks involved by increasing imports from China, but it still imported large quantities of machine tools from Germany before the war began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workforce in the 600 or so R&amp;amp;D organisations within the Russian defence industrial complex is a second bottleneck. A ‘lost generation’ of STEM-qualified employees in the post-Soviet era and a tendency for promising graduates to seek employment in other areas mean that this workforce is ageing. The flight of individuals from Russia over the last year will exacerbate this. However, this is a long-term problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Russia remains critically reliant on Western components for its more sophisticated platforms. It can offset the effects of sanctions through a variety of means, but at a cost to efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, in the short to medium term, Russia’s industrial base can generate capacity at scale, especially if the country shifts towards building large volumes of less sophisticated equipment to be manned by a mobilised force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s Western backers – particularly the US – are regenerating their own production capacity. This will likely take effect by 2025, but there is a risk of a capacity trough until this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine also retains a sizeable domestic defence industrial sector, which remains active despite Russian pressure. Challenges such as access to energy and manpower could be constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;timing&quot;&gt;TIMING&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Russia and Ukraine will face windows of vulnerability. For Ukraine, this window will be in 2023, when its resources and, in particular, its economy will be heavily stretched. Launching offensives on defended Russian positions – even with Western armour – will prove difficult. However, if the Ukrainians can induce Russia to waste manpower in offensive actions during this period, and if the country’s backers can help sustain its economy, Russia will begin to face its own resource constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, given time, a more thorough effort to equip Ukrainian forces along Western lines can be sustained. If Ukraine can cross the immediate period of vulnerability it currently faces, its prospects will improve markedly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;political-will&quot;&gt;POLITICAL WILL&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both Ukraine and Russia, political will is likely to remain high. For Ukraine, this war is existential, and polling suggests that 70% of Ukrainians wish to continue fighting. For Russia, failure in Ukraine could lead to regime collapse, which historically has preceded periods of national chaos. As such, both Russia’s leadership and its population are likely to see the costs of war as being outweighed by the costs of defeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public opinion in states backing Ukraine presents a more complex prospect. On the one hand, there has been little shift in support for Ukraine in the US and UK, despite the economic costs of the conflict. On the other hand, two major challenges persist. While publics may not blame the support provided to Ukraine for soaring food and energy prices, they nonetheless tend to blame incumbent leaders for economic hardship. Leaders such as US President Joe Biden face historically low approval ratings. This could, over time, provide an incentive to seek a settlement in the hope that an anticipated economic upturn could strengthen the position of Western leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Europe, although publics are supportive of Ukraine, large segments of the population in states such as Italy and Germany view peace as more important than the restoration of Ukraine’s internationally recognised boundaries. While there is unlikely to be any significant movement to end support for Ukraine, the risk is that sections of the population and political class may argue for linking continued support with negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Russia’s misguided assumption that Ukraine would fall quickly has led to an intense and protracted war.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A year after it began, there is still much uncertainty over what the final outcome of this conflict will be.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/2u4MPQK.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，16人否認「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，今（24日）踏入審訊第15天。控方今早續播放2020年7月9日，戴耀廷與區諾軒等於初選前召開的記招片段，並讓區諾軒閱讀另外5個記者會的錄音謄本作確認。會上戴耀廷重申初選不違法，黃之鋒及朱凱廸亦籲港人投票，黃稱要「讓北京政權知道，香港仍然有好多人係唔選擇向呢一個共產政權卑躬屈膝」，朱亦指要「畀全世界睇到香港人喺《國安法》之後係唔會向北京嘅野蠻統治屈服」。此外，柯耀林今早因誤會播片時不用到庭而遲到半小時，到達後林卓廷打趣說：「叫佢請食早餐啦！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒家成問睇咗財政預算案未柯耀林遲到半小時&quot;&gt;鄒家成問「睇咗財政預算案未」柯耀林遲到半小時&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方昨午播放部分戴耀廷、區諾軒和趙家賢於2020年7月9日召開的記者會片段，今早播放餘下片段，其餘時間讓區諾軒閱讀其他記者會謄本確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被告今早10時入庭，各被告神情輕鬆，鄒家成向旁聽席問：「睇咗財政預算案未？」，再笑說「支持」，林卓廷亦與黃碧雲交談，早前受傷的吳政亨則已拆除其三角手掛。林卓廷一度向面前的懲教用力眨眼和活動眼球，提及「最近睇緊本書，所有靈長類都冇眼眉，係得人有眼眉，點解呢？」，黃碧雲作回應後，林稱「以前係咁講，後尾發覺唔係」，並解釋眼眉和眼白是表達情感和溝通的工具。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;直至10時許，柯耀林尚未到庭，有懲教表示「爭一個」，被告欄有人提到：「今朝打畀佢，仲喺屋企」，有被告發笑，後亦有法庭職員表示：「未齊人，仲有一個未到，所以未開得庭。」林卓廷打趣說：「阿柯要請你哋食飯喎」，其後各還柙被告被帶返囚室，鄒家成一度稱：「我想留喺度喎。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至10時34分，身穿棒球褸和裇衫、微喘的柯耀林小跑着推開法庭大門，有被告說「柯耀林到啦！」，還柙被告亦即被帶返法庭，林卓廷對保釋被告說：「叫佢請食早餐啦！」鄒家成亦附和：「請食早餐喎！」案件終於10時40分開庭，代表柯耀林的大律師表示柯誤會了今早播片時毋須到庭，已向柯講解法庭的安排。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;朱凱廸籲港人勇敢投票用文明暴露共產黨野蠻&quot;&gt;朱凱廸籲港人勇敢投票：用文明暴露共產黨野蠻&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後續播放記者會片段，黃之鋒、朱凱廸等輪流發言。區諾軒不時轉身望向被告欄上方的大屏幕及旁聽席，一時托腮，一時雙手交叉握拳，一時翹起雙手。在會上，黃之鋒形容「初選係《國安法》立法之後第一次公民表態嘅機會」，籲所有港人出來投票，「讓國際社會知道香港人未投降，亦讓北京政權知道，香港仍然有好多人係唔選擇向呢一個共產政權卑躬屈膝。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;朱凱廸則提及：「大家都知道凡係共產黨要極力阻止喺香港發生嘅事，我哋就要更加令到佢搞得成功」，又指現時政府與共產黨的立場已經顯明，「初選就係一個非常之關鍵重要嘅一個過程⋯⋯畀全世界睇到香港人喺《國安法》之後係唔會向北京嘅野蠻統治屈服嘅」，籲「香港人勇敢出嚟投票，我哋用文明去暴露共產黨嘅野蠻」。朱凱廸發言前，主控周天行指朱早前未有出現，區確認朱的身份。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷重申初選不違法-若當局任意解讀大家都識得判斷香港法治狀況&quot;&gt;戴耀廷重申初選不違法 若當局任意解讀「大家都識得判斷香港法治狀況」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴耀廷重申，否決財政預算案是《基本法》賦予的權力，「呢個應該係一個常識嚟⋯⋯我諗每一個人都會知道立法會行使權力本身就係一個合法嘅行為，我又見唔到有任何嘅非法元素喺裡面。」但他亦指，知道《國安法》並非普通法，用普通法原則解讀雖沒理由違法，但若當局「鍾意任意去解讀呢個《國安法》，連一個公民一齊出嚟投票嘅行動都可以定為非法、甚至為嚴重違法嘅話，咁我諗香港就即係個法治係點樣狀況，大家都識得判斷㗎啦」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴耀廷又指，看不到初選會突然出現腰斬，亦會要求票站遵守限聚令要求。趙家賢亦強調，民主動力和香港民研舉辦初選計劃，「係一定要全部係合法嘅，我哋先至會去做，呢個係絕對清楚，我哋會做足所有措施去確保符合返香港現有或者新加嘅法例。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到DQ風險，區諾軒指「相信我哋個個都冇水晶球，因為真係唔知佢開邊路」。他自言不會十分樂觀，「而家基本上係佢哋想做乜就做乜」，但指認為初選合法，沒有問及警方部署，「都希望佢哋唔好去干預一啲合法嘅事。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒留法庭讀謄本-吳政亨與女友交流何桂藍在電腦打字&quot;&gt;區諾軒留法庭讀謄本 吳政亨與女友交流、何桂藍在電腦打字&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;播畢片段後，區諾軒確認當中情況與他出席時一致。控方其後讓區諾軒閱讀2020年6月9日、7月6日、7月11至13日5個記者會的錄音謄本，法官陳慶偉着區閱讀謄本確認與他的理解是否一致。陳慶偉續指法官將離席，留下法庭書記在場，至於律師、被告及公眾可以按其意願留下，但特別提醒勿騷擾區閱讀謄本，否則會要求該人立即離開法庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3名法官於約11時10分離去，眾被告亦陸續離開。余慧明一度留下與律師溝通，其後亦離去，剩下吳政亨一人被帶到被告欄最盡處的角落，被兩名懲教看守。區諾軒則留在原位獨自翻閱兩個大文件夾的錄音謄本，期間3名懲教人員站在他後面看守，區不時抬頭望向被告欄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在區諾軒閱讀謄本期間，吳政亨全程與旁聽席的女友以手勢交流。何桂藍於約11時半亦從囚室步回法庭，向旁聽席張望後，便默默在用來摘錄筆記的電腦打字，時而若有所思。旁聽席則尚有十數名人士留下，部分人閉目睡覺。區諾軒於12時53分表示「我睇完啦」，並獲懲教帶離法庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下午續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/URk0BsZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，16人否認「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，今（24日）踏入審訊第15天。法官李運騰今問及區諾軒口中「抗爭派」的意思，區形容他們在民主派系中站在「較進步」的位置，指「佢哋都好多元」。區又以不認罪被告為例，指鄒家成、余慧明和何桂藍3人為抗爭派，並形容何桂藍「係一個較為有左翼思想嘅人」，引起何桂藍等多名被告大笑，區一度向被告欄笑着問「準唔準確呀？我好驚我標籤錯人呀」，被法官提醒是問區的理解，不是被告的理解。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，主控周天行今展示截圖要求區諾軒認出何桂藍，惟屢被法官質疑區不在場、回應欠證據價值，且控方提問方式不恰當，有如「在律師席上作證」。區已作供10日，控方指主問已大致完結，確認下周一會說明「共謀者原則」下針對各被告的證據，並在法官提問下釐清所有被告於2020年7月1日均已加入串謀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區問為何僅衞生服務及超區參與初選-官法庭真的需要知道嗎&quot;&gt;區問為何僅衞生服務及超區參與初選 官：法庭真的需要知道嗎？&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方下午問及初選投票情況，區諾軒供稱，在7月11至12日的投票日，全港共設200多個票站，每個地方選區約佔50至60個，而除5個地方選區，功能組別只包括超級區議會和衞生服務界。控方問及原因，區解釋曾有其他功能組別想過是否搞初選，但最終只接納衞生服務界參與；至於超區則因過往都由直選產生，故亦在初選計劃內。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行續請區再解釋背後原因，但法官陳慶偉兩度問：「法庭真的需要知道嗎？（“Do we really need to know?”）」周起初說是，其後猶豫片刻，指這解釋了初選計劃的部分結構。法官李運騰問這如何幫助控方證明控罪，法官陳仲衡亦指該議題與受審被告無關，亦與法庭無關。周指他只是提供背景，將會問到相關議題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區主辦單位整體負責超區戴耀廷聯絡衞生服務界&quot;&gt;區：主辦單位整體負責超區、戴耀廷聯絡衞生服務界&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行其後問及誰負責跟進超區事宜。區解釋，就初選投票安排，組織者一直將超區與其他地方選區一併考慮，而超區協調會是「由我哋主辦單位整體去負責嘅」，包括他、戴耀廷及代表民主動力的趙家賢。他又指，他與戴耀廷均有出席超區協調會議，趙家賢則「應該冇」，至於衞生服務界則一直由戴聯絡相關人士。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問如何理解抗爭派-區稱在民主派系企喺一個較進步嘅位置&quot;&gt;官問如何理解「抗爭派」 區稱在民主派系「企喺一個較進步嘅位置」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行其後向區展示一段片段，惟法官陳仲衡即指：「作為說故事的人（storyteller），我期望你告訴我們將要展示什麼。」法官李運騰亦指，控方在展示任何證物前，應先確立基礎，先就事件發問以看證人有否相關印象。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行續問，區諾軒曾否與何桂藍親身見面（何的律師早前曾表示爭議片中身分），區稱他們曾於7月在香港島一同出席宣傳初選投票的競選活動。周問競選活動與誰有關，區答「好似係有啲抗爭派嘅人選」，鄒家成發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此時法官李運騰表示，區曾數度提及「抗爭派」，但沒有印象解釋過意思，問區「抗爭派」與「傳統民主派」的分別。區表示，「一個較好嘅歸類事件」，是初選投票日後的一個記者會，會上「參加者都係標籤自己係抗爭派」。延伸庭有被告聞言竊笑，梁晃維亦對着袁嘉蔚「戚眉」及露出笑容。控方問區如何理解此標籤，區解釋：「民主派當時嘅派系分類裡面，佢哋（抗爭派）係企得喺一個較進步嘅位置。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ZcJZ3gE.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
▲ 2020年7月15日 抗爭派記者會（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續指，「進步」亦可有不同理解，問區是指「激進（radical）」、「極端（extremist）」抑或其他。區笑着說：「佢哋都好多元嘅」，鄒家成點頭，吳政亨等亦發笑，延伸庭的袁嘉蔚、梁晃維及吳敏兒也發笑。李運騰笑指「那並沒有什麼幫助」，提議區可舉出人名。區續說：「如果我哋以不認罪嘅被告做例子啦……」被告欄即起哄，鄒家成等人說「嘩」。李運騰亦笑說：「如果這能幫助你說明，隨便。（“Well, if it helps illustrate your point, by all means.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區以不認罪被告為例-指鄒家成余慧明何桂藍為抗爭派&quot;&gt;區以不認罪被告為例 指鄒家成、余慧明、何桂藍為抗爭派&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒續說：「我嘗試向法官閣下說明，例如鄒家成係本土派啦」，他邊說邊笑着望向鄒家成，並擺動左手示意，多名被告發笑。李運騰問他是否即視「本土派」為「抗爭派」，區指「係其中一種諗法啦」。李再問其他被告的情況，區說：「如果你話何桂藍嘅話，我會覺得佢係一個較為有左翼思想嘅人」，何桂藍聞言面露驚詫，掩嘴大笑，正庭和延伸庭多名被告也發笑。區再補充：「我意思係經濟上面追求社會公平」，此時陳志全等被告也笑起上來。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指，即區諾軒認為何桂藍可被界定為「抗爭派」？區答「係」，並咧嘴笑着轉身向被告欄問：「準唔準確呀？」，何桂藍笑着反問：「我答唔答得？」，鄒家成等多名被告大笑，區再向法官笑說「我好驚我標籤錯人呀」。陳慶偉向區說，「我們是問你的理解，不是問他們的理解」，其後直接按被告座位逐一讀出名字，要求區確認他們是否「抗爭派」。問到鄒家成、余慧明及何桂藍3人時，區答「係」，至於其餘13人，區均答「唔係」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官屢質疑控方提問前未確立基礎不恰當簡直是在律師席上作證&quot;&gt;官屢質疑控方提問前未確立基礎不恰當：簡直是在律師席上作證&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續回到之前關於競選活動的問題，問區指在香港島哪裡出席，區回應「應該係東區或者灣仔區」，陳志全和林卓廷等發笑。區再說：「因為佢哋有位代表係袁嘉蔚，我曾經為佢講說話。」此時延伸庭的梁晃維即望向袁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行再問，區為何認為抗爭派「進步」，區指「主要令我有呢個印象，係喺佢哋喺初選之後舉行記招之後發表嘅言論」，並指該記招於7月15日舉行，但他不在場，今早亦沒有看過相關錄音謄本。周天行欲就該言論再發問，惟代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 質疑控方提問沒有基礎，法官陳慶偉同意，李運騰亦着控方勿就此再提問。控方續展示區諾軒提及的競選活動片段截圖，區認出他自己和何桂藍。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行其後欲再播7月15日片段，惟法官李運騰指控方似乎未說明上述活動的日期。周續問區是否記得該片段顯示什麼活動，區指是幫袁嘉蔚造勢的活動，這時延伸庭的袁手摸下巴思考。周再指區諾軒說過該活動是在7月11日舉行，惟李官指區並沒說過，周遂改為問區是否記得何時舉行，區稱「應該係初選投票日嘅時候」，延伸庭的袁輕輕搖頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/0oldmh7.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
▲ 袁嘉蔚（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行其後再向區展示7月15日記者會片段截圖，惟李運騰打斷：「再一次，你向證人展示圖片前並未確立基礎。」周稱因區沒出席該記者會，惟李即問：「那向他展示圖片有什麼意思？」周解釋只是望區辨認被告，區其後並從圖片認出何桂藍。李運騰再質疑，沒有出席記者會的區諾軒，並沒有資格就該場合作供，而控方提問時先指出這是7月15日的記者會，再要求區認出被告身分，「我不認為這是恰當的提問方式，因為你簡直是在律師席上作證。（“I don’t think this is a proper way to ask questions, because you are simply giving evidence from the bar table.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李又指，若最終沒有其他證人能就該記者會的場合作供，那區諾軒的證據價值只會很有限，周天行回應會有其他證據。法官陳慶偉即指控方大可一早說明，周說是，並指會轉為問下一個議題，陳志全、吳政亨、施德來等發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方稱主問大致上完成-下周一說明共謀者原則立場&quot;&gt;控方稱主問大致上完成 下周一說明「共謀者原則」立場&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行其後再展示九龍東的 WhatsApp 群組，區確認訊息內容正確，周並指他已大致上完成主問環節，需時翻閱筆記，以考慮有否追問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方上周確認會引用「共謀者原則」舉證，並表示會於辯方盤問前說明清楚。法官李運騰續提醒控方，主問將完結，控方須應辯方要求說明就「共謀者原則」的立場，即會依賴其他被告的什麼言論來指證不認罪被告。周天行同意，並在法官追問下指會於下周一說明立場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方要求說明串謀何時開始和被告何時加入-官稱階段尚早&quot;&gt;辯方要求說明串謀何時開始和被告何時加入 官稱階段尚早&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表林卓廷和黃碧雲的大律師沈士文提出，望控方表明串謀何時開始和每名被告何時加入，指對被告而言很重要。法官陳慶偉續指，刑事串謀並非串謀者的書面協議，人們可以隨時加入或退出。沈表示明白，並希望下周一得知相關資訊，以知道辯方盤問的範圍。陳慶偉着沈向控方提出，指如何鋪排案情由控方決定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表鄒家成的大律師陳世傑亦指，被告何時加入串謀與「共謀者原則」相關。陳慶偉同意，但認為現時只是首名控方證人的主問階段，亦尚未進入盤問，不會要求控方現時就根據區諾軒的證供說明每名被告何時加入串謀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方確認所有被告於202071已加入串謀&quot;&gt;控方確認所有被告於2020.7.1已加入串謀&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡其後提到，控罪日期為2020年7月1日至2021年1月7日，問控方是否指所有被告於7月1日已加入串謀，周天行確認。陳世傑認為並非新資訊，惟法官李運騰認為是新的說法，指被告原本有機會被指在不同時間加入串謀，惟據控方現時澄清，所有被告實於7月1日已成為「共謀者」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大律師馬維騉問，控方是否即指串謀最早於2020年7月1日出現，李運騰指不一定。馬維騉續問，法庭是否會要求控方說明串謀最早於何時出現，李運騰認為那是證據的問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方問串謀最早於何時開始-官稱不能早於國安法實施日期&quot;&gt;辯方問串謀最早於何時開始 官稱不能早於《國安法》實施日期&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉重申，刑事串謀非常流動，可能本案起初只是源於一個飯局，有戴耀廷、區諾軒和趙家賢3名發起人，然後在不同時期和階段有不同被告加入和退出，但至2020年7月1日，所有人都成了共謀者。馬維騉再問，是否即控方認為「串謀」於最初便開始，惟李運騰即指，或不應用「串謀（Conspiracy）」一字，因據控方說法，初選計劃在《國安法》實施後才變成違法，而此前只是未必違法的「計劃（Scheme）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉最後再問，法庭會否要求控方說明串謀最早於何時出現，法官重申《國安法》於2020年6月30日才實施，故非法的串謀不能早於該日期出現。陳慶偉並提醒，馬並非代表所有被告，着他集中於其當事人，馬指當然會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下周一續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，今早遲到的柯耀林，下午由棒球褸和裇衫，換回平時穿着的黑色西裝。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另區諾軒今早完成閱讀5個記者會的錄音謄本，下午向控方確認謄本「都係準確嘅記載」。控方其後要求區認出各記者會出席者，區確認，6月9日「民主派35+公民投票及眾籌行動」記者會，出席者包括他本人、戴耀廷、趙家賢、鍾錦麟；區議會主席楊彧、蔡澤鴻、程張迎、黃偉賢；區議員郭平。7月6日記者會有他本人、戴耀廷、鍾庭耀和一名香港民意研究所職員；7月11日記者會有他本人、戴耀廷、趙家賢；7月12日記者會有他本人、戴耀廷、趙家賢、鍾劍華、陳家洛、鍾庭耀；7月13日有他本人、戴耀廷、趙家賢和鍾劍華。區並確認記者會情況與他記憶中一致。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件編號：HCCC69/2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;列席認罪被告全被安排於延伸庭就坐&quot;&gt;列席認罪被告全被安排於延伸庭就坐&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表包括資深大律師潘熙、大律師沈士文、張耀良、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等，本身是大律師的劉偉聰則自辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;列席認罪被告包括馮達浚、朱凱廸、梁晃維、譚凱邦、岑敖暉、黃之鋒、袁嘉蔚及吳敏兒，全被安排在延伸庭就坐。&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>獨媒報導</name></author><summary type="html">柯耀林誤會播片毋須到庭遲到半小時 林卓廷：叫佢請食早餐啦！ 官問何謂抗爭派 區諾軒以何桂藍為例指對方有左翼思想</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">The Cost Of War To Ukraine</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-02-24-the-cost-of-war-to-ukraine.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Cost Of War To Ukraine" /><published>2023-02-24T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2023-02-24T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/the-cost-of-war-to-ukraine</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-02-24-the-cost-of-war-to-ukraine.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As the first anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion rolls around, much global attention is directed towards the battlefields in eastern Ukraine. But what has been the cost to the rest of the country of the past year of fighting?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2022, Western leaders seemed be sending a clear message to the Kremlin. US President Joe Biden said preparations were being made to ‘impose severe economic costs’, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned of ‘severe costs’ if there was ‘any further aggression’, and Downing Street said Russia could be hit with ‘swift retributive responses’. But from the moment Russian tanks moved in from three directions early on 24 February 2022, it is Ukraine and the Ukrainians who have paid the heaviest price for Russian aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-human-cost&quot;&gt;The Human Cost&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above all, there has been the cost to human life. The UN has confirmed 8,006 civilian deaths, including 487 children: victims of heavy artillery shelling, missiles and air strikes, often on their homes. The UN always caveats that ‘the actual figures are considerably higher’ because there are many places it cannot reach. Among them is Mariupol, a formerly thriving port city. An investigation by Associated Press established that in Mariupol alone, 75,000 are likely to have died as a result of the fighting. As the Russians bulldoze their homes, the majority will never get a decent burial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian government is reluctant to disclose military casualties but in December it admitted that at least 13,000 soldiers had died, and some estimates suggest as many as 100,000 casualties (dead and injured). Around 3,500 Ukrainian soldiers are currently being held as prisoners of war, with multiple reports of torture and starvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tens of thousands of civilians and soldiers alike have suffered often life-changing injuries. Foreign doctors volunteering in Ukraine have described horrific ‘First World War-type injuries’ that were worse than what they had seen in Iraq. There are many reports of sexual violence, with victims as young as four.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behind each of these numbers are many human stories. Like 3-month-old Kira, her mother Valeria and grandmother Lyudmila, who were killed when a Russian missile ripped through their apartment block in Odesa. Or 10-year-old Yana, who survived the bombing of Kramatorsk train station but lost her right leg below the knee, her left foot, and her mother. Or Roman Ratushny, a well-known civic activist, who with many others his age volunteered for the army after the invasion, and was killed in combat in Izyum a month before his 25th birthday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;economic-collapse&quot;&gt;Economic Collapse&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost to Ukraine’s economy has been devastating, not least due to the extensive damage caused to the country’s infrastructure and its most productive industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kyiv School of Economics estimates that the value of damage due to the invasion has now reached $137.8 billion (at replacement cost). This includes the complete destruction of 344 bridges, 440 educational facilities, 173 hospitals and hundreds of thousands of homes, while many more buildings have suffered extensive damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In a country that was the ‘breadbasket of the world’, the World Food Programme now provides food assistance to 3 million people monthly&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The steel industry, which before the war constituted a third of the value of all Ukrainian exports and was one of the country’s biggest employers, collapsed in 2022. Steel production fell by over 70% last year and will not be able to reach pre-war levels in the near future. One of the biggest steel plants, Azovstal in Mariupol, was totally destroyed. Many others have seen production limited, such as ArcelorMittal’s steel plant in Kryviy Rih. The latter was recently modernised for $5 billion, but is running at only 25% capacity because of chronic energy shortages and logistics problems now that it is no longer able to export by sea. This needs to be seen in context of the fact that half of Donbas, Ukraine’s industrial heartland, was already taken by Russia after 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agricultural products, Ukraine’s other major export, have also been significantly hit. 26% of cultivatable land has either been lost or damaged, or is contaminated by mines. As a result, the wheat and sunflower harvests in 2022 were down 40% compared to the previous year, and a further drop in production is expected in 2023. In a country that was the ‘breadbasket of the world’ – exporting enough before the war to feed 400 million people around the globe – the World Food Programme now provides food assistance to 3 million people monthly, and approximately 35% of Ukraine’s population is estimated to be suffering from insufficient food consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, an estimated 47% of Ukrainian companies have stopped operating, leading to a sharp fall in tax intake at a time when significantly more needs to be spent on defence. Other consequences include the collapse of the advertising market, without which media outlets are struggling to survive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having been on a positive economic trajectory following the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2022 Ukraine suffered a 30% drop in GDP, and it is now dependent on at least $3–4 billion monthly in outside budgetary support to pay for necessary government functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;life-in-a-warzone&quot;&gt;Life in a Warzone&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past eight years, since Russia’s first invasion, life was transformed for anyone living close to the frontline in Donbas in the east. In the past year, however, all of Ukraine has become an active warzone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The suspension of all air travel has become normal, with any international travel requiring long journeys, mostly through Poland. In most cities, including Kyiv, people still go to work and shops and restaurants are open, but everyone is subject to a curfew from 11pm to 5am. To conserve energy, streetlights are kept off, so it is eerily dark and quiet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air raid sirens – now often first heard through a special mobile app – and accompanying sounds of anti-aircraft fire are so frequent that many people have become numb to them and often don’t bother going to their designated underground shelters. But drones and rockets do get through air defences and continue killing civilians in their homes – as they did a month ago in Dnipro, killing 46 people, injuring 80 and leaving 400 homeless when their nine-story apartment building was hit. These attacks also cause blackouts and heating and water shortages due to intentional targeting of critical energy infrastructure, 50% of which has been damaged, occupied or destroyed. Closer to the front, such as in Kherson, people face daily shelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;An estimated 8 million Ukrainian refugees are now outside their country, and a further 5 million are internally displaced&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Living in this warzone is taking a toll on ordinary Ukrainians. According to the World Health Organisation, roughly 10 million people are potentially at risk of mental disorders such as acute stress, anxiety, depression, substance use and post-traumatic stress disorder. With millions forced from their homes and daily life including schooling disrupted, children are particularly vulnerable – as are soldiers, who suffer sleeplessness, flashbacks and panic attacks. The director of Ukraine’s newly founded and only dedicated military rehabilitation centre for post-traumatic stress says there is a need for 100 such facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who now find themselves in territory occupied by Russia are witnessing the attempted eradication of Ukrainian identity, exactly as was done in occupied Donbas and Crimea after 2014. Ukrainian-language signs have been replaced with Russian, street names are reverting to what they were during the Soviet Union (in Mariupol, for example, the Avenue of Peace was renamed to Lenin Avenue), and historical monuments have been taken down, including those to the Holodomor, Stalin’s starvation of Ukrainians in 1932–33.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most concerningly, Russia has also been operating a large-scale, systematic network of 43 camps and other facilities to ‘re-educate’ Ukrainian children. The Yale School of Public Health’s Humanitarian Research Lab has determined that at least 6,000 children, and likely significantly more, have been put through programmes aiming to make Ukrainian children pro-Russian. Hundreds of others have been taken for adoption by Russian couples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-demographic-price&quot;&gt;The Demographic Price&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion precipitated the biggest European refugee crisis since the Second World War. An estimated 8 million Ukrainian refugees are now outside their country, and a further 5 million are internally displaced. In the short term this has caused hardship and uncertainty, particularly for many women and children (men under the age of 60 aren’t allowed to leave without special permission). In the longer term, this exodus is likely to contribute to a further deterioration of Ukraine’s pre-existing demographic crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since independence in 1991, the population of Ukraine has declined from 51 million to an estimated 43.5 million (including occupied Donbas and Crimea). It has also been ageing: the fertility rate has been low for years, and in 2021 it was only 1.16, one of the lowest in the world (the replacement rate is 2.1). Whether refugees return home will therefore be critical for the country’s long-term economic recovery. Many have gone back already, and others have indicated they will do so as soon as the conflict ends. But the longer it goes on, the deeper the roots that Ukrainians will put down in other countries, finding better-paid jobs and enrolling their children in schools. A survey of Ukrainian refugees in Germany last year found that more than a third (37%) intend to stay in Germany permanently. Similar polling in Poland found that as more of them find jobs, an increasing number of Ukrainians are planning to stay after the end of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite nine rounds of EU sanctions, closely coordinated with sanctions imposed by the UK, the US and other allies, in 2022 Russia suffered only a 2–3.5% drop in GDP, much less than some had predicted. In Moscow, many Western brands are off the shelves, but there are no shortages. And 12 months on, there is no indication that Russia intends to stop its aggression or to be held accountable for the inhuman and lasting damage it has inflicted on Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪受審。何桂藍的代表大律師於審訊第5日，反對控方傳召兩名警長以「專家證人」身份就Facebook及YouTube作供，因控方太遲提供專家報告予辯方，致她難找辯方專家，最終法庭批准兩警長作供，但不代表接納報告內容。法庭今（23日）就相關決定頒下書面理由，直言控方就延遲送達報告的解釋並不合理，控方應該以嚴格的舉證基礎準備案件。惟法庭認為容許控方呈交報告未會對被告造成不可彌補的損害，亦不會影響審訊的公平性，而且可透過短暫押後或頒下相應的賠償令作為補償。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指報告延遲送達-控方無遵守有關規定&quot;&gt;辯方指報告延遲送達 控方無遵守有關規定&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方申請傳召兩名警長就Facebook及YouTube方面，以「專家證人」身份作供。《國安法》指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡於判詞指，雖然案件於2022年6月已交付至高院，但辯方卻在開審第一天，才收妥控方所有專家報告。代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel反對指，該些專家報告延遲送達，以及控方沒有遵守相關的法律規定及指示。被告將因控方傳召專家證人而受到不可挽回的損失；另外控方在沒有正當理由的情況下，公然無視專家證據的規定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方強調已盡快獲取報告&quot;&gt;控方強調已盡快獲取報告&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、副刑事檢控專員萬德豪承認控方沒有按《實務指示》遵守要求，在交付程序之前，將專家報告送達辯方。但他強調已盡快獲取該些專家報告，亦預期與辯方達成部分協議，可是最後卻未能達成協議，因此控方認為確實需要索取有關報告。但控方認為被告並沒有受任何損害。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方質疑控方一早知道會依賴甚麼證據&quot;&gt;辯方質疑控方一早知道會依賴甚麼證據&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方則指，控方在起訴時已知道會依賴甚麼證據，他們不能坐着等待視乎哪些事項獲得同意或不同意，再決定是否傳召專家證人。控方有義務盡早列出證據，尤其在具有針對性的專家證據上，以容許辯方向其他專家索取意見，以及決定是否傳召他們辯護。在現階段，辯方無法在有限的時間內找到相關領域的其他專家。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法庭認為控方解釋不合理-應以嚴格基礎準備案件&quot;&gt;法庭認為控方解釋不合理 應以嚴格基礎準備案件&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法庭直言，控方就延遲送達報告的解釋並不合理，他們應該一早知道會依賴Facebook及YouTube的片段，控方應該以嚴格的舉證基礎準備案件，而非期望會與辯方達成協議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法庭指被告夠時間索專家意見-但收報告後3星期卻未嘗試&quot;&gt;法庭指被告夠時間索專家意見 但收報告後3星期卻未嘗試&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;但另一方面，法庭考慮到現時距離傳召警長尚有一段時間，被告仍然有足夠時間考慮有關報告及索取辯方專家的意見。法庭強調，被告面對的控罪嚴重，為了司法公正，相關專家證據應該呈交予法庭並進行適當的評估。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法庭亦指，辯方指在尋找辯方專家時會遇困難的說法是推測性的，加上辯方收到報告已超過3星期，但他們仍然沒有嘗試徵求辯方專家的意見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法庭指未會對被告損害-亦不影響審訊公平&quot;&gt;法庭指未會對被告損害 亦不影響審訊公平&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法庭最後指，雖然控方未能及時將專家報告送達予辯方，但若繼續容許控方在這方面舉證的話，卻未會對被告造成不可彌補的損害，亦不會影響審訊的公平性。法庭認為，若因報告延遲而對辯方造成不便，可透過短暫押後或頒下相應的賠償令作為補償。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;考慮到上述原因，法庭決定批准控方就該4份專家報告舉證，但不代表在現階段接受報告的內容。另外，兩名警長獲批准作供，但其專家資格是否確立，以及其證據所佔的比重，則有待日後處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，16人否認「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，今（23日）踏入審訊第14天。控方續引初選組織者 WhatsApp 群組訊息發問，顯示趙家賢曾稱區諾軒和戴耀廷在協調會議傳閱「白紙黑字」協議予與會者確認，雖沒簽署但屬「互相同意的協議（mutually agreed consents）」，戴耀廷亦指新西和九東兩區參選人均同意簽署協議，並夾附在提名表格。控方其後回溯至6月14日的訊息，遭3名法官質疑不按時序發問，令人難以跟上，法官李運騰質疑控方問題「跳來跳去」，法官陳慶偉亦質疑「如果這是有陪審團的審訊，他們怎能跟得上？」，提醒控方要「記住本案的議題」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢曾稱協調會議有白紙黑字-ciruclate-畀大家確認&quot;&gt;趙家賢曾稱協調會議有「白紙黑字 ciruclate 畀大家確認」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今續引初選組織者的「PfD 35＋計劃」WhatsApp 群組訊息發問，顯示趙家賢在6月19日轉發「墨落無悔」發起人的聲明後，曾於群組稱：「屯門張可森依幾條友就擺到明要隊到行啦，仲有大家之前開咗會嘅協議，區軒同埋 benny 係有白紙黑字 ciruclate 畀大家確認，雖然冇最後簽紙，但係呢個都係一個 mututally agreed consents。」區解釋，理解「協議」是指「協調會議上面曾經傳閱嘅協議」。（編按：「ciruclate」及「mututally」分別應為「circulate」及「mutually」。）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，趙家賢「白紙黑字」指的是什麼，區指「我冇辦法代入佢個角度諗啦」，但「組合返我所憶述嘅協調會過程，我會話係第一次會議嗰個傳閱過程」。區諾軒早前供稱，部分選區首次協調會議曾傳閱「35+計劃」文件，他在法官陳慶偉詢問下表示，該文件在首次會議傳閱，而沒有在會前傳閱，至於會後傳閱的已是總結會議的各區協調機制初稿。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉遂問，組織者當時是否要求參與者對協調機制初稿提出意見，但最終沒有要求簽署任何文件？區確認。陳再問，所以趙家賢「白紙黑字」指的並非在會議上傳閱的「35+計劃」文件，而是會議後傳閱的協調機制初稿，否則趙不會形容為「mutually agreed consents」？區答：「係有一個咁嘅過程。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷619稱新西已決定簽署協議-後夾附於提名表格&quot;&gt;戴耀廷6.19稱新西已決定簽署協議 後夾附於提名表格&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，戴耀廷在趙家賢發訊息後，曾回應：「新西昨晚各參選人已決定了由他們自己簽署一份協議（內容與之前傾妥的一樣），交民主動力。民主動力之後會公布有哪人交回這協議」，及「九東則由秘書處提出一份共同綱領，包括了原先協議的內容，各參選人都同意簽署。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就新界西訊息，區確認「協議」指新西參選人報名時簽署的「民主派新西協調機制協議」。被問到「內容與之前傾妥的一樣」的意思，區指當時不知道新西「傾妥咗嘅內容」，「不過我哋事後睇到嗰個（新界西協調會議）錄影同開會嘅謄本，應該佢講緊就係新界西第二次協調會議」，而該份協議與參選人報名時夾附的文件一樣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大律師沈士文一度提出，傳譯主任漏譯了「新界西第二次協調會議」，並指現時控方圍繞新界西文件發問，但不知有何重要，因為所有新界西候選人均認罪。法官李運騰續指，如果控方有其他選區的文件，希望他們能呈上。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;九東秘書處提共同綱領-施德來夾附於提名表格&quot;&gt;九東「秘書處」提共同綱領 施德來夾附於提名表格&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就九東訊息，區表示「共同綱領」指當時九龍東候選人在提交提名表格時夾附的聲明，並解釋當時九東成立了一個推動初選的秘書處，但因他沒有去第四及五次會議，不知道秘書處狀況，只能依賴一個6月14日的訊息。被問及秘書處有什麼成員，區指他只知道蔡澤鴻會向組織者報告九東狀況，亦沒有印象有組織者是秘書處成員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後展示由施德來簽署、夾附在提名表格的九龍東「共同綱領」，區確認正是戴耀廷訊息提及的「共同綱領」。區昨提及，只有新界西和九龍東兩區候選人簽署「共同綱領」並夾附在提名表格，周天行再問組織者有否要求參與者簽署協議文件，區表示：「我們沒有要求他們簽署共同綱領。」周天行欲再追問為何不要求簽署，惟法官陳慶偉即指「Next, next.」，法官李運騰亦指早前已提及相關議題。鄒家成等被告發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方展示619訊息後再展示614訊息-官質疑難跟上&quot;&gt;控方展示6.19訊息後再展示6.14訊息 官質疑難跟上&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在展示3個6月19日的訊息後，控方再展示6月14日的 WhatsApp 訊息，惟法官陳慶偉即問：「周先生，如果這是有陪審團的審訊，他們怎能跟得上？」周天行回應現時仍然在談及抗爭派聲明的議題。惟法官李運騰指控方的問題「跳來跳去」：「5分鐘前我們在談及6月19日的事件，現在又跳去6月14日，我們覺得有點難跟上」；法官陳仲衡亦指，「你作為控方案情的說書人（storyteller），最好當然是你的故事引起我的興趣，但至少應該要容易跟得上。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行與主控萬德豪商量片刻，對要回溯之前的事致歉，但指因區提及沒有去過九東第四和第五次會議，只能依賴一個6月14日的訊息，故就此發問。法官陳慶偉續指，他們是來審理被告面對的控罪，「我們對初選的歷史不感興趣。」周天行一度再發言，惟陳慶偉即打斷指不欲再爭辯，但提醒控方「記住本案的議題（“Bear that in mind, bear what are the issues of this case.”）」。周稱「我正嘗試集中於本案議題」，陳慶偉嘆道：「Thank you.」，有被告發笑，周遂繼續就6月14日的訊息發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/x5vIP0Z.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，16人否認「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，今（23日）踏入審訊第14天。控方續引初選組織者 WhatsApp 群組訊息發問，區諾軒曾轉述九東參選人稱認為要發布一份由大會認可的公開協議，又指大會若不接納「怕兵變」。區承認，當時認為大會已無權威左右地區決定，故最終容許九東參選人簽署「共同綱領」並夾附在提名表格。區同意當時望避免民主派內鬥，指參選者有不同光譜、對協調機制有不同詮釋，若不斷公開表態會有「收窄模糊」的情況；並以九東參選人、民主黨主席胡志偉為例，指他曾稱民主黨因怕被「揪秤」而不欲簽非官方協議，惟終因組織者的容許而簽下共同綱領，區承認「有把關不力嘅責任」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，控方引述戴耀廷在中聯辦譴責初選或違法後，曾向參選者發訊息稱不提35+目的是否決每個議案和癱瘓政府，區指理解戴「想修正35+嘅講法，規避法律風險」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;蔡澤鴻稱九東欲發布公開協議-望組織者認可否則憂兵變&quot;&gt;蔡澤鴻稱九東欲發布公開協議 望組織者認可否則憂「兵變」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今續引初選組織者的「PfD 35＋計劃」WhatsApp 群組訊息發問，一度被法官質疑不按時序發問，令人難以跟上。控方其後引2020年6月14日區諾軒發出的訊息，提及九龍東開會後蔡澤鴻託他向組織者報告5點，區並說出自己的4點建議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區解釋，發訊息前收到蔡澤鴻電話，指九龍東開會後「就住是否公布一份文件表達異議」，並總結出5點。第一，他們認為「要發布一份公開協議，去說明五大訴求，缺一不可」；第二，他們要求大會認可該份公開嘅協議；第三，蔡特別強調以上理解為民主黨同意，引述民主黨立場：「只要是官方的公開協議，他們願意簽」；第四，關於「積極運用權力否決財政預算案」，蔡指「他們覺得怕DQ的話，可以避重就輕」；第五，區指蔡澤鴻稱「希望大會可以接納，如果唔係，佢怕兵變」，並在電話強調這一點。區解釋第四點時，特別提到「我唔敢講個『他們』係咪代表與會者」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區胡志偉曾稱民主黨不希望簽非官方協議&quot;&gt;區：胡志偉曾稱民主黨不希望簽非官方協議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區解釋，相信蔡提及第三點是源於較早前，他曾與時任民主黨主席胡志偉會面，胡當時表示民主黨「唔希望簽一啲非官方嘅協議」，因就處理立法會議案的立場，民主黨「覺得冇理由政府話起學校、起醫院都要否決」，而且「如果不斷有一啲公開嘅協議，恐怕會被人揪秤，有理無理都好」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於第四點「避重就輕」的意思，區解釋如之前所述，「當時嘅環境，任何人發表對財政預算案否決嘅公開言論，都會增加無法參選立法會嘅風險」，理解蔡是有此意思。控方再問他們如何避免該風險，區答：「我諗最好就係唔好…唔好表達呢啲講法啦。」此時大律師馬維騉指訊息來自沒有被控的蔡澤鴻，或構成傳聞證供，惟法官不同意，指控方是要問及區諾軒對蔡澤鴻訊息的理解，從而得出他的建議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱認為大會無權威左右地區決定-認把關不力&quot;&gt;區稱認為大會無權威左右地區決定 認「把關不力」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續引述區諾軒回應蔡澤鴻的4點建議，提及「地區的共識，我認為大會無權威左右，故順從是唯一選擇。沙盤推演，五區隨時有類近的動作，換言之我方最初的善意（防止DQ），最差局面不但不奏效，而且衍生了爭端，而且最後也白紙黑字化。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區解釋，因為九東想自行發布一個共同綱領，故當時憂慮其他選區都會有類似行為。他重申，沒有要求參與者簽署文件其中一個目的，是不欲增加參選人被DQ的風險，「所以我當時覺得，只能夠被動地應對情況」，又指「因為佢哋都講到話用『兵變』嚟形容情況嘅嚴重，我當時認為大會已經冇權威去左右佢哋嘅決定，所以我有把關不力嘅責任」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問及，區起初避免「白紙黑字」，是否想減少參選者被DQ的風險，區同意。李再問35+計劃的哪部分令他認為會導致DQ，區重申當時有輿論稱若有人參選，並「妄顧後果」運用基本法賦予的否決權，就會被視為不尊重《基本法》，故避免「白紙黑字」是「當時處理候選人嘅一種措施」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱初選者光譜不同-若公開不斷表態會收窄模糊情況&quot;&gt;區稱初選者光譜不同 若公開不斷表態會收窄模糊情況&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續引區諾軒第3點建議：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;「如今應對藍圖該是順勢而行，視乎各區意願順從之，『全國為上，破國次之；全軍為上，破軍次之』，若果不搞到鬥黃，寫了些共識了事，沒了那些關鍵DQ風險，當『執到』，最差不過是原文公開，亦沒法制止。但至少立於不敗之地，欲拆大台者再也找不到借口。」&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區重申，當時認為大會已無能力處理地區看法。法官李運騰問及「鬥黃」意思，區指「我會認為不斷逼人表達立場，哪怕佢本身未必真係支持嗰個立場，我會定性為鬥黃」，李再問是否即「人們嘗試顯得盡可能激進（“People try to appear as radical as possible”）」？區同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續解釋，「初選參與者有唔同光譜，呢個大家都理解嘅，本身大家對於個機制有唔同詮釋都係存在。如果公開地不斷去作出表態，就會有收窄咗呢啲模糊嘅情況」，亦是他指「鬥黃」的意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱無法阻止官方認證九東共同綱領-致胡志偉簽署&quot;&gt;區稱無法阻止「官方認證」九東共同綱領 致胡志偉簽署&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，他是否嘗試避免民主派內鬥，區同意，並舉例「如果冇6月14號嘅呢個事件（蔡澤鴻向他傳遞訊息），我相信胡志偉係唔會簽署呢份文件嘅」，此時被告欄內的鄒家成邊聽邊點頭。法官陳慶偉表示不太理解，指訊息提及民主黨稱除非有官方協議否則不會簽署，那區指胡志偉簽署文件是什麼意思。區解釋，正如6月14日的訊息所說，九龍東秘書處「要求大會認可呢份協議，而我哋認為冇能力阻止」，最終胡志偉並簽署九龍東的共同綱領。陳慶偉問胡為何會改變主意，區答：「就係因為有呢個官方嘅認證過程。而我當時，係冇辦法阻止。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳問區提及「官方認證」，是否意指組織者容許該份共同綱領出現及夾附在提名表格？區同意。陳再問，是否因為組織者的容許，故胡志偉代表民主黨簽署？此時代表民主黨林卓廷和黃碧雲的大律師沈士文反對，指胡並非代表民主黨，而是以個人名義簽署。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續稱「所以我話我有責任」，並確認胡志偉是以「個人」名義簽署，「唔代表黨」，並在被問及民主黨立場是否不簽任何協議時指，「胡志偉有向我作為當時嘅組織者表達過民主黨嘅立場，但最後佢做唔做，係佢嘅立場。」區確認該份共同綱領只在九東出現，陳慶偉最後問：「所以這並非官方文件？你只是容許參選人在提名表格夾附一份文件。（“So this is not official at all? You simply permit the candidates to attach a document at their wish in their nomination forms.”）」區答：「呢個係公允嘅說法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指尹兆堅稱願簽聲明但不想無限簽民間聲明-望大會轉達&quot;&gt;區指尹兆堅稱願簽聲明但不想無限簽民間聲明 望大會轉達&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，控方指區諾軒曾於6月24日在群組發訊息稱：「有一樣要求我是 facilitate 不到民主黨的，因尹兆堅昨日和我說，若明天記者會，應認同民主黨當初若簽抗爭聲明他們是願意簽，只是最後不想無限簽民間聲明，所以才不簽墨落無悔。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒解釋，尹兆堅指民主黨願意簽署聲明，但不想無限簽署民間聲明才不簽「墨落無悔」，並望區在翌日記者會上表達其說法。惟區指，「冇理由個大會去幫一個黨去講說話」，而最後亦「根本冇呢個咁嘅記者會」，故無法順應尹的要求。被問到尹的說法是他本人抑或民主黨的意見，區認為說是尹的意見比較公允。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;中聯辦譴責後戴耀廷稱不說癱瘓政府-區諾軒理解他想規避法律風險&quot;&gt;中聯辦譴責後戴耀廷稱「不說癱瘓政府」 區諾軒理解他想規避法律風險&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，在「新界西訊息發布區」群組中，戴耀廷曾於初選後的7月14日發布訊息稱：「我公開的訊息說35+目的，是運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案，今（編按：「今」應為「令」）特區政府問責。不提否決每一個議案，也不說癱瘓政府。供大家參考。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問及區諾軒，是否知道戴耀廷發此訊息的原因，區回答指：「如果時間正確，當時已有中聯辦、港澳辦譴責初選有機會犯法」，他理解戴耀廷將訊息發布「係想修正35+嘅講法，規避法律風險」。他又指，戴曾在各地區的訊息發布群組發出上述訊息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指戴耀廷想修正對否決財政預算案的說法&quot;&gt;區指戴耀廷想修正對否決財政預算案的說法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問到，區諾軒使用「修正」一詞，是否意指其說法與原本的有所不同。區表示，不爭的事實，是戴耀廷在過往數個月曾發布一系列文章 ，表達對否決財政預算案的看法，因此他在7月14日想修正有關說法。李官追問，是否代表就35+計劃目標的立場有改變，區表示：「我只能夠話佢喺呢個時間讓各位參考佢對於35+目的嘅表述。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後控方逐一展示新東、港島、超區、衛生服務等的訊息發布群組，區諾軒均確認戴耀廷曾於同日即7月14日，在各群組發布上述同一訊息，其中九龍西群組內，毛孟靜曾回覆「知道了」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，16人否認「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，今（23日）踏入審訊第14天。發起「三投三不投」、網名「李伯盧」的吳政亨於本案被控方指為初選組織者之一，控方今問及區諾軒是否認識吳，區指「直到被捕前唔認識」，只透過Facebook知道他。法官李運騰續問區被捕前是否知道「李伯盧」是35+計劃組織者之一，區答「唔知道」，只記得初選早期，戴耀廷曾表示他有與李伯盧或「三投三不投」的組織聯絡。此外，庭上播放2020年7月9日戴耀廷與區諾軒等召開的記招片段，當時時任政制及內地事務局局長曾國衞指初選或違《國安法》，戴會上強調，爭取立法會控制權要求政府問責是《基本法》賦予權力，看不到如何違法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒指不知道吳政亨為35組織者之一&quot;&gt;區諾軒指不知道吳政亨為35+組織者之一&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今早就初選組織者的Whatsapp訊息提問，主控周天行下午問及，區諾軒是否認識本案第5被告吳政亨或李伯盧，區指「直到被捕前唔認識」。控方再問區，吳政亨有沒有做過任何有關初選的事情，區指「如果你講緊李伯盧，就係舉辦咗一個『三投三不投』嘅計劃」。代表吳政亨的大律師石書銘關注，根據證供區未曾見過吳政亨及與他交談，認為控方應先問區對吳政亨的認識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方於是問，以其理解吳還做過什麼，區表示只知道案發期間吳曾透過三投三不投計劃，在網上作宣傳，「希望初選參加者遵守承諾」。法官李運騰問及區，於被捕前他是否知道李伯盧是35+計劃組織者之一，區表示「唔知道」，此時吳政亨與相隔一個位的鄒家成交談。李官追問，區是否只透過Facebook專頁或貼文知道李伯盧，區同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指戴耀廷表示曾與李伯盧聯絡&quot;&gt;區指戴耀廷表示曾與李伯盧聯絡&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大律師石書銘續指，雖不爭議部分帖文由吳政亨發出，但若區只從Facebook知道吳，則區其後的證供僅屬「傳聞證供」，不能被法庭接納，法官回應視乎控方問題。控方續問區如何得知李伯盧有舉辦「三投三不投」計劃，以及進行網上宣傳，區稱：「我只記得喺初選嘅較早期階段，戴耀廷曾經向我表示佢有同李伯盧或者三投三不投嘅組織聯絡」，但未有提及有多常聯絡對方。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9lTcLXV.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
▲ 吳政亨（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後控方改為問及戴耀廷「真攬炒十步」文章，此時吳政亨再與鄒家成交談，並相視而笑。區續指，當初是在《蘋果日報》看到有關文章。控方再指出區其中一個Facebook帖文最底有戴耀廷的名字，字體為藍色，與超連結的顏色相同。控方追問藍色字體的意思，這時在延伸庭的被告傳來笑聲，區回答是「tag」功能，曾「tag」戴耀廷的專頁，他亦同意曾看過戴的專頁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方稱證影片真實性須播6小時片段-官指可予區諾軒閱讀謄本確認&quot;&gt;控方稱證影片真實性須播6小時片段 官指可予區諾軒閱讀謄本確認&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，控方早上提及，由於有被告不承認控方片段，或需播放6月9日、7月6日、7月9日及7月15日4個記者會共長6小時的片段，由有出席的區諾軒確認，並強調播片非控方原意。控方午休前再確認會播放6月9日記招片段，法官陳慶偉問：「你想要證明什麼？」，周稱是為了證明影片真實性。法官李運騰續問，若控方能證影片真實，「你呈上這些片段有什麼目的？你想要證明什麼以支持控罪？」，周指是要依賴戴耀廷提及35+計劃的目標，以及DQ風險和參與者達成的共識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官問及誰反對片段，代表林卓廷和黃碧雲的大律師沈士文重申是「共謀者原則」的問題，指若控方表明不會以此片段指證其當事人，他就不會再反對；但若控方未能清楚說明援引的證據，他便會要求控方「嚴格舉證（strict proof）」。代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 亦指，他不爭議影片真實性，但要求控方嚴格舉證。大律師馬維騉則指，若控方會依賴記者會的發言作為援引「共謀者原則」的證據，應播放整條片段；但法官李運騰指，若向證人展示錄音謄本，讓他確認會上內容與其記憶吻合，則毋需看片。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方下午表示，會盡量透過錄音謄本的方式處理，但仍望播放7月9日的記者會片段，因有部分被告在當天記者會內沒有發言，單憑謄本難以看到他們在場的情況，包括他們在其他被告發言時給予的反應。至於錄音謄本的安排，法官李運騰建議可讓區諾軒在庭上閱讀，但不需要所有人都到庭，包括法官及大律師，以免浪費時間，又指大律師可自行安排代表到庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷指看不到初選違國安法無參選人提分裂國家言論&quot;&gt;戴耀廷指看不到初選違《國安法》無參選人提分裂國家言論&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後播放戴耀廷、區諾軒及趙家賢於2020年7月9日召開記者會的片段，會上介紹初選及籲市民投票。出席者包括戴耀廷、區諾軒、趙家賢、黃之鋒、譚文豪、許智峯、張可森、劉凱文、范國威、楊雪盈、余慧明、朱凱迪、張嘉莉、李永財、劉澤鋒、李芝融、徐子見及安德里。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴耀廷在記者會上，回應政制及內地事務局局長曾國衞曾提及，民主派初選有可能違法一事，戴指「佢指出有可能違法嗰啲地方呢，我哋都見唔到用一個常理去解讀香港嘅法律呢，係有可能違法嘅」，又強調就私隱保障方面，有《私隱條例》專家已檢視系統。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴耀廷又指，「我諗大家最關心嘅可能都係有關《國安法》嗰個問題」，但他認為「睇返我哋每一位參選人呢，係冇人提出過一啲係會涉及到分裂國家嘅言論，亦都唔係35+，我哋冇任何涉及到呢啲方面嘅主張嘅，咁所以我見唔到點樣同呢個《國安法》第20條，係有任何違反」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷爭取立法會控制權屬基本法賦予權力&quot;&gt;戴耀廷：爭取立法會控制權屬《基本法》賦予權力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴耀廷又重申35+目標是爭取立法會控制權，從而行使《基本法》賦予立法會的憲制權力向政府問責，「咁呢個係《基本法》賦予立法會的嘅權力嚟嘅，我見唔到點樣係會符合到《國安法》第22條所講嗰個非法手段」。戴又指，即使真的否決財政預算案，根據《基本法》行政長官擁有職能解散立法會，他反問：「咁點樣會嚴重阻撓咗佢去行使職能呢？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷初選使用本地資源-與外國無關&quot;&gt;戴耀廷：初選使用本地資源 與外國無關&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴又提到，《國安法》第29條涉及勾結外國勢力，他強調整個初選均使用本地資源，亦是眾籌所得，與外國完全沒有關係。他亦表示，不論是投票的市民或參選人，均是自主作決定，「見唔到點樣有任何人有能力去操控到呢一個選舉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢指表態是合法合憲公民權利-區諾軒稱無法想像局長指違法&quot;&gt;趙家賢指表態是合法合憲公民權利 區諾軒稱「無法想像」局長指違法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;趙家賢則表示，民主動力獲戴耀廷和區諾軒委託籌辦35+投票，指作為民主動力召集人，統籌選舉實務工作超過12年，對「一個坐喺局長位置都未夠半年嘅人」對初選的「關切」，「覺得好莫名其妙」。他又指，「我相信作為支持民主陣營嘅市民更加會心領神會，喺呢個咁大嘅壓力氣氛底下，我哋更加要堅定我哋嘅意志，係反映市民嘅意見，作出表態，呢個嘅表態係為咗香港係合法、合憲嘅公民權利嚟嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒其後發言，表示對於民主派想做「團結協調」的工作，卻被局長指責涉嫌犯法，直言「係無法想像」，又指自己過往多次協調初選，這次當局卻使用嚴重的指控去恐嚇參與初選的香港市民及參選人。區形容責任沉重，最重要原則是不希望有人犯險，並指預緊可能會收緊「限聚令」，籲市民遵從相關衞生措施的安排。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊雪盈稱國安法陰霾下望港人團結投票參選比以往更大代價&quot;&gt;楊雪盈稱《國安法》陰霾下望港人團結投票、參選比以往更大代價&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其他出席的被告則手持「支持民主派35+公民投票」及「7月11-12齊投票」的紙牌，並輪流發言。劉澤鋒提及進入議會將「否決政府不義嘅財政預算案」，彭卓棋團隊的李永財指要「對抗極權」，余慧明指是次初選「可能係最後一次嘅民主選舉，希望大家可以珍惜手上面嘅一票，參與一場冇DQ、冇篩選嘅選舉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊雪盈則指「我覺得每一個喺呢度參選嘅人，其實都背負住非常之大嘅責任，亦都係比以往更加大嘅代價去做呢個參選嘅決定」，又指更重要是「香港人有冇辦法喺《國安法》嘅陰霾之下走出嚟投票」，望港人團結「保護番我哋每一個香港人」。范國威指「極權政府無所不用其極咁打壓香港人」，但籲港人勿放棄，「極權政府就係要震壓民意嘅時候亦都懼怕民意。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方播放約40分鐘片段後，表示是時候休庭，明早續播放餘下片段。在完庭前，法官陳慶偉再次討論閱讀謄本的安排，指區諾軒閱讀謄本期間，三名法官將不會到庭，並會派書記作代表。他又表示大部分律師應該不會想到庭，若希望到庭的話亦可派代表。至於各被告則可按個人意願選擇是否到庭，此時林卓廷笑着說：「Of course not… never.」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;明早將會播放餘下片段，其後給予時間區諾軒閱讀謄本，法官預計下午再開庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Q4UMq81.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，16人否認「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，今（22日）踏入審訊第13天。區諾軒續作供，提及5個地方選區各有協議，當中除新界西表明「會」運用《基本法》權力否決財政預算案，其餘4區均僅稱「積極」運用權力否決預算案，並只有新西和九東兩區將協議文件附在提名表格上。庭上展示參選人簽署的提名表格，列明支持和認同協調會議共識，包括「民主派35+公民投票計劃」及其目標。法官李運騰主動指出，對表格條款第6點「我特此聲明，我會擁護《基本法》和保證效忠香港特別行政區」感興趣，區諾軒解釋民主動力設計該表格時，「希望每一個參與者都能夠奉行到第6點嘅精神。」而在本案中，8名新界西參選人均認罪，九龍東6名參選人中僅施德來一人不認罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;5區各有協議-僅新界西稱會用權否決財案並附在提名表格&quot;&gt;5區各有協議 僅新界西稱「會」用權否決財案並附在提名表格&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方早前確認會引用「共謀者原則」舉證，並會於辯方開始盤問前，交代在該原則下針對每名被告的證據。代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 今甫開庭，指若控方於主問完結才說明使用的證據，辯方或沒有足夠時間準備盤問，望能於明早前收到相關文件。法官指現時望先聽取證供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒昨供稱，5個地方選區各有一份協議，但當時因憂慮違法及令參選人取消資格，而沒有公開該文件及要求參選人簽署。法官陳仲衡問及是否5區文件均有「積極運用《基本法》權力否決財政預算案」的字眼，區欲進一步解釋，但因有被告如廁而提早休庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒今續作供，表示在2020年6月9日記者會之前，戴耀廷曾在包括他、戴耀廷、趙家賢、鍾錦麟及民主動力職員黎敬輝共5人的 WhatsApp 群組，發出以各地方選區命名的協調機制文件。他當時打開檔案，有個印象是所有文件均包括「積極運用《基本法》權力否決財政預算案」的字眼，但他指「我當時嘅觀察同事實唔係全對嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指，因他沒有去新界西協調會議，直至6月19日新界西候選人遞交初選提名表格時夾附聲明，才知道新界西文件的字眼是「會」運用《基本法》權力否決財政預算案，而其餘4區均是「積極」運用《基本法》權力否決財政預算案。區指，各區初選提名表格內容一致，但只有新界西和九龍東的候選人在交表時亦夾附其地區聲明。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷63曾擬採通稱五區及超區已達成協議&quot;&gt;戴耀廷6.3曾擬採通稱五區及超區已達成協議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後展示 WhatsApp 群組訊息，顯示戴耀廷在6月3日曾發出有關6月9日記者會的採訪通知，該採通內容為：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;「經過三個多月的努力，民主派在九月立法會選舉在五個地區直選選區及區議會（二）的協調，終達成了協議。35+協調機制計劃在七月舉行公民投票的程序，讓支持民主派的選民共同決定由哪些參選人代表民主派參與九月的立法會選舉。負責統籌協調的戴耀廷及區諾軒，協助各區協調的幾位區議會主席、副主席，及負責公民投票執行程序和民調的民主動力召集人趙家賢，會出席記者會講解協調的細節。」&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區指，採訪通知由戴耀廷撰寫，當時他認為相關內容可發放予傳媒，但趙家賢後來表示要「執一執」。法官李運騰問，是否代表當時已達成共識？區答：「我相信呢個內容係公允嘅，因為當時候佢（戴耀廷）發出咗一啲檔案啦，而都有呢個記者會嘅內容啦。」法官陳慶偉再問區與戴作為初選組織者，據他們理解，初選參與者是否在6月3日已經達成共識？區再表示「呢個係公允嘅說法」，重申共識是指戴耀廷在群組發出的文件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後展示紀錄，顯示戴於6月8日曾發出多個檔案，包括：「民主派35+公民投票」、「35+新西final」、「35+區二final」、「35+衛生服務final」、「35+九西final」、「35+九東final」、「35+新東final」及「35+港島final」，確認是達成的協議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區戴耀廷發出新西協調文件與提名表格夾附聲明一樣&quot;&gt;區：戴耀廷發出新西協調文件與提名表格夾附聲明一樣&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒又同意，趙家賢於2020年6月19日，曾將「墨落無悔」發起人鄒家成、張可森及梁晃維，質疑拒簽聲明者可無視共識的聲明轉發在群組。而區當時在群組回應：「我覺得有樣嘢要講清楚：由頭到尾我理解個協議唔係冇咗，而係冇喺記者會公開」，之後再撰〈以正視聽〉一文回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區再次確認，該「協議」指各區協調會議達成的協議。法官李運騰問到協議上有甚麼重點，法官陳慶偉表示區諾軒可參考相關文件回答。控方其後展示一份參選人提名表格，顯示由新界西參選人吳敏兒簽署，並附上題為「35+立會過半計劃 民主派新西協調機制協議」的文件。周天行其後逐項讀出文件條款，包括「五大訴求，缺一不可」，及會運用《基本法》權力否決財政預算案等，惟大律師石書銘反對，指控方若想提醒證人，應讓證人閱讀文件而非在庭上逐點讀出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒其後解釋，新界西協調文件的內容，與其他地區的協調文件「大致相同」，當中只有3點不同，包括使用「會運用」而非「積極運用」的字眼；投票人數須多於4.8萬人；及爭取的議席數目與其他區不相同。控方一度問及，該協調文件與新界西協調會議達成的共識有沒有分別？區說：「但我冇參加新界西個會議」，林卓廷等被告發笑。控方其後再展示從趙家賢擷取、由戴耀廷於群組發出的新界西協調文件，區確認，該文件與提名表格夾附的聲明條款一樣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;提名表格列明認同戴區主導協調會議之共識&quot;&gt;提名表格列明認同戴、區主導協調會議之共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後展示初選提名表格，其中一項條款為「我確認支持和認同由戴耀廷及區諾軒主導之協調會議共識，包括『民主派35+公民投票計劃』及其目標」。區表示，「協調會議共識」指剛才提及的各區協調機制文件；而「民主派35+公民投票計劃」及其目標，則指協議內提及認同「五大訴求，缺一不可」就可參與協調機制。法官陳仲衡補充，目標還包括在立法會取得過半數，區同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;參選人報名時亦要提交1萬元保證金，控方其後展示吳敏兒簽署的選舉按金收據，亦提及須支持和認同協調會議共識，包括「民主派35+公民投票計劃」及其目標，亦列明：「選舉按金將於立法會選舉後全數發還；如候選人違反上述共識，將不予發還。」控方問及條款意思，區乾笑了一下，表示：「其實呢個係民主動力嗰份文件嚟嘅，如果照字面所講就係違反呢個共識嘅話，就唔發返比個參加者。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;提名表格列明擁護基本法-區民動望參與者奉行該精神&quot;&gt;提名表格列明擁護《基本法》 區：民動望參與者奉行該精神&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰其後指，他仍在閱讀提名表格，「令我感興趣的是第6點：『我特此聲明，我會擁護《基本法》和保證效忠香港特別行政區』，是誰提出要加上去的？」柯耀林等被告發笑。區解釋：「呢個係民主動力當初設計呢份報名表嘅時候，佢地希望每一個參與者都能夠奉行到第6點嘅精神」，並確認相關條文在所有參選人簽署的提名表格均有出現。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問：「有任何跟進嗎，周先生？（“Anything to follow up, Mr. Chow?”）」周猶䂊數秒後再問區：「據你理解為何會加上這點？」大律師沈士文再反對說：「他已經答了同一條問題。」法官陳慶偉續指，該文件屬民主動力，「為何你不留待民主動力成員作供才問？」李運騰其後稱留意到時間差不多，案件押後明早續。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，16人否認「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，今（22日）踏入審訊第13天。區諾軒續作供，同意35+目標是取得立會大多數，迫使政府回應民主派訴求，當中「有一定程度」的初選參與者講過「攬炒」，區指他們認為「攬炒」是透過否決財政預算案，最後促使特首下台。區又提及，2020年6月發文回應「墨落無悔」聲明發起人時，看不到有人公開反對運用權力否決財政預算案。法官問及，是否即當時所有參與者都同意運用否決權？區表示：「我唔敢咁武斷，只係話冇人公開反對啫」，並指他於7月中已退出初選工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區不少參加者認為否決預算案致特首下台有攬炒意思&quot;&gt;區：不少參加者認為否決預算案致特首下台有「攬炒」意思&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方昨就區諾軒〈以正視聽——假如我有資格回應抗爭派立場聲明書發起人〉一文發問，當中區就「墨落無悔」發起人質疑參與者毋須簽署聲明作出澄清，區並在庭上解釋因憂慮違法及令參選人取消資格，而沒有公開該文件及要求參選人簽署。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今續引述文章第3點澄清：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;「直接點說，就算所有人都聯署簽紙，只要有人到時反悔，除了譴責，根本無法阻止。屁股決定腦袋，最具阻嚇力從來在選民，若35+攬炒，否決預算案重要，應該著力宣傳，令社會更多人站在我們一邊，令更多直選、功能界別選民敦促候選人，參與者間繼續夾到出血，效益很少。」&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到「若35+攬炒，否決預算案重要」的意思，區解釋，當時認為部分參加者「的確係相信攬炒同否決財政預算案係佢哋關心嘅議題」，而他當時認為與其敦促其他候選人，他們不如花時間宣傳理念，令更多人投票給他們。周天行續問他如何理解「攬炒」，區指理解有「一定程度嘅參加者，係有講過呢個概念嘅」，指他們認為透過否決財政預算案促使行政長官下台，是有「攬炒」的意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問是否所有參與者同意運用否決權-區唔敢咁武斷7月已退出初選工作&quot;&gt;官問是否所有參與者同意運用否決權 區：唔敢咁武斷、7月已退出初選工作&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒文章亦提及「而事實上，就不同黨派的公開回應，不見得有參與者對運用權力否決財政預算案態度保留。那大家反對的是誰？」。區解釋，在6月19日的時間點，「我睇唔到有參與者公開地反對可以運用否決財政預算案嘅權力」，故才在文中問「墨落無悔」發起人究竟反對對象是誰。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉遂問，據區諾軒理解，是否當時所有參與者都同意運用該否決權？區回應：「我唔敢咁武斷，只係話冇人公開反對啫。」周天行續問，那直至區2021年1月6日被捕，參與者的立場是否一樣？區再答：「我唔敢咁武斷，特別係我7月15號已經係退出咗相關嘅工作啦。」法官陳慶偉再問，那參與者立場直至7月15日是否一樣？區重申：「我唔敢每刻都係睇住咗唔同嘅候選人嘅立場，我只能夠話喺6月19號，我透過一個咁嘅講法嚟回應聲明書嘅發起人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行其後再問，據區的理解，參與者的立場直至7月15日是否一樣？惟代表黃碧雲和林卓廷的大律師沈士文提出反對，指「問題已經問過，證人已經答過（“The question was put, the answer was given.”）」。周天行再指只是希望作澄清，惟陳慶偉即打斷：「沒有事情要澄清，下一條問題。（“There is nothing to clarify, next question.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區無聽過人公開表明反對否決預算案部分民主派預期最壞情況致特首下台&quot;&gt;區：無聽過人公開表明反對否決預算案、部分民主派預期最壞情況致特首下台&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行續換個問法，問區有否聽過參與者在公開場合表明不同意否決財政預算案，區指「就我理解冇聽過」。周再問，是否直至他被捕那天也一樣？區再答：「我唔想將個時間拉得咁長。」周在法官問了數條問題後重新再問，那區認為他可以說出直至何時的情況？此時被告欄傳出輕聲的「唓」，區並說，「我諗較為合適係喺我仲參與35+工作嘅時候。」法官陳慶偉遂問，直至區退出初選工作的7月15日，區有否聽到參選人在公開場合表明反對運用否決權，區再答「冇聽過」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒在法官李運騰詢問下同意，35+計劃的目標是在立法會取得大多數，並迫使政府回應民主派訴求。李運騰再問，參與者是否期望「最壞情況」是導致行政長官下台？區答：「部分嘅民主派係咁諗。」李追問他是否知道其他人的看法，區說「我宜家腦裡面諗到有幾個，不過佢哋係一啲功能組別嘅參選人」，「佢哋唔係戴耀廷嘅35+（參加者）。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;executive-summary&quot;&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The UK armed forces and other European militaries have been sized, equipped and organised around the assumption that air superiority will be quickly achieved and leveraged to defeat state opponents.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia will remain an adversary for the foreseeable future and is likely to continue to rearm and rebuild large-scale conventional forces once the fighting in Ukraine ceases. It is in China’s geopolitical interests to split US and European resources and attention away from the Indo-Pacific. Therefore, China is likely to help Russia rearm once there is some form of ceasefire in Ukraine. This would significantly increase the level of threat Russia can pose in the medium term.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Chinese military threat means fewer US military assets available to reinforce Europe in a crisis. A notable risk is that Russia will take advantage of a conflict between the US and China in the Indo-Pacific to renew aggression against European NATO members or Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The likelihood of an enduring military threat from Russia and, increasingly, US commitment to the Indo-Pacific mean that European NATO air forces must take steps to urgently regenerate credible warfighting capability against Russian forces. Medium-term deterrence requires it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, almost all European air forces, including the RAF, currently lack many of the critical capabilities required to credibly be able to gain and exploit air superiority against Russian forces, or indeed any state opponent with modern ground-based air defence systems and long-range strike capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first major area of concern is the vulnerability of air forces that have, due to decades of efficiency-saving measures, ended up in a position where their combat aircraft and the maintenance capacity to support them are concentrated in a small number of main operating air bases with limited hardened shelters or ground-based missile defence systems. This makes them highly vulnerable to Russian long-range strike capabilities and so undermines their deterrence credibility and survivability in any potential conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remedying this will require a combination of dispersal, hardening and ground-based air defence protection. The optimal combination will vary depending on each air force’s current laydown, equipment and resourcing. Sweden and Finland both provide examples of air forces that currently maintain a much less vulnerable posture than most European NATO air forces. Not all aspects of their equipment or practices can be universally adopted, but there is much that could be learned.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second major concern is a lack of currency and proficiency for high-intensity mission sets among aircrew and other key personnel across most air forces in Europe. The tactics and procedures required to be effective against a state adversary like Russia are very different from those required for peacetime air policing or close air support against insurgent groups.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To regenerate proficiency in high-end warfighting mission sets, air forces must reduce discretionary commitments such as counterterrorism and international diplomacy-focused deployments. At present, with the scale of ongoing activity, most air forces, including the RAF, lack the necessary maintenance, spares and aircrew capacity to conduct focused warfighting training at scale. Overstretching fast jet fleets by trying to do everything is resulting in increasing problems with aircraft availability, and significant numbers of the most critical experienced instructor pilots and senior engineers are becoming burnt out and resigning.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The third major area of concern is that no European NATO air forces currently have sufficient expertise or the required munitions stocks to conduct suppression and destruction of enemy air defences (SEAD/DEAD) at scale. The lethality of mobile surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems on both sides in Ukraine is a vivid reminder of the consequences of an inability to conduct SEAD/DEAD at scale. Without such capacity, European NATO air forces cannot credibly achieve and exploit control of the air over a battlefield contested by Russian forces or even by near-peers such as Iran.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Weapons and aircraft already exist that are well suited to SEAD/DEAD; most notably, in terms of weapons, the GBU-53/B StormBreaker, SPEAR 3 and AARGM-ER, and in terms of aircraft, the F-35. However, these are all expensive capabilities that must be fielded in significant numbers and regularly trained and exercised at scale as part of the joint force if they are to be operationally credible. This means that European air forces that do so will pay a significant opportunity cost in terms of other potential mission sets and capability areas that will need to be disinvested in to generate financial headroom and capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is, nonetheless, vital that at least a few of NATO’s larger European air forces do regenerate a SEAD/DEAD capacity at scale against modern, mobile SAM systems. The key warfighting bottleneck standing in the way of generating sustainable European deterrence credibility against Russia (or other regional near-peer threats like Iran) is an inability to credibly establish air superiority due to lack of SEAD/DEAD capacity. Fixing this deficiency should, therefore, be seen as a matter of urgent priority.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only alternative – accepting that air superiority is not attainable over future battlefields contested by Russia or another adversary nation – would require a total redesign of NATO’s joint forces towards a force that relies on massed artillery, armour and infantry as the core of its fighting power, rather than air-delivered firepower. That alternative implies demographic, political and financial costs that far outstrip the costs of regenerating warfighting credibility for NATO air forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian invasion of Ukraine and fears of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan have forced the US, the UK and other NATO nations to once again plan for high-intensity peer warfighting as a core task for the first time since the end of the Cold War. At the same time, experience from the ongoing conflict in Ukraine has reminded air forces everywhere of many often forgotten or ignored features of peer warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Russia’s long-range precision strike campaign and successful Ukrainian strike and sabotage operations have confirmed that large fixed air bases are key targets and will be struck with accurate missile barrages during any force-on-force clash. Second, the poor performance of the Russian Aerospace Forces (Vozdushno-Kosmicheskiye Sily, or VKS) due to systemic deficits in aircrew, doctrine, planning and command-and-control (C2) staff competence has graphically illustrated the importance of regular realistic training, not only for aircrew, but for the whole airpower enterprise. Third, the war in Ukraine has graphically illustrated that the scale of weapon use in peer warfighting at scale would rapidly and dangerously deplete Western stockpiles and far outstrip existing surge production capacity. Finally, the mutual denial of air superiority for both the Ukrainian Air Force and VKS by ground-based air defence (GBAD) assets has graphically illustrated the consequences of not being able to conduct suppression and destruction of enemy air defences (SEAD/DEAD) at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Western way of warfare relies on having air superiority over any potential battlefield to provide ISTAR capabilities and precision firepower at scale through close air support and interdiction. However, if SEAD/DEAD cannot be conducted, then air superiority is impossible to attain, an inconvenient and expensive truth for air forces that have been largely optimised for operations in permissive and semi-permissive airspace for decades, and whose high-end warfighting capabilities are largely air-to-air focused. This mission-based deficit is closely linked to both aircrew training and munitions stockpile challenges, since SEAD/DEAD is a highly demanding mission that requires specialist skills and weaponry to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gap between pre-invasion expectations and the actual performance of both the Russian and Ukrainian armed forces will also have significant long-term implications for deterrence between major powers. The logistics, operational planning and training deficiencies that initially hamstrung the Russian army are likely to make all militaries more inclined to weight assessments of such factors more heavily in future when considering the conventional military capabilities of any would-be adversary. Essentially, Russia has reminded the world quite how difficult it is to plan, execute and provide logistical support and enablement on the scale required for warfighting against a peer nation. As such, in future, states are likely to be less deterred by front line force structures that conspicuously lack realistic training and exercise schedules, enabler support, logistics provision and stockpiles for spares and ammunition. Re-establishing deterrence credibility with conventional military forces, therefore, will require not only regaining key warfighting skills such as SEAD/DEAD, but also regenerating the stockpiles and realistic exercise programmes and training tempo needed to avoid hollow front line forces. For non-US NATO air forces, these challenges are much more severe than for the US since the US Air Force (USAF), US Navy and US Marine Corps all still field airpower on a large scale with a global footprint and large munitions stocks. However, the Pentagon is heavily focused on the Indo-Pacific and the threat from Chinese forces that increasingly pose a major threat to US military freedom of action. The result is that there will be far fewer US forces available to help defend Europe in any future war with Russia. This would be especially problematic for European powers if Russia took the logical step of coordinating any future armed aggression to coincide with the US being occupied by a war or serious armed standoff with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Europe itself, whether the current phase of the war in Ukraine ends in a Ukrainian victory on the ground or a protracted stalemate and eventually an uneasy ceasefire, Russia will remain a serious military threat in the three-to-five-year timeframe. The Russian political leadership class has completely committed to an ideological, and in their view existential, confrontation with the Western-led global order. Military setbacks in Ukraine have led to more extreme rhetoric and demands, and partial national mobilisation rather than withdrawal or moderation. At the same time, Russia’s economy has been badly hit by comprehensive sanctions and the demographic impact of mobilisation, mass casualties and emigration of young people. Its energy supply leverage over Europe is rapidly waning as Germany and other key customers urgently diversify their gas and oil supplies away from Russia. Political parties and media organisations that once took significant Russian funding now face public backlash in most Western countries. All these factors mean that most of the Kremlin’s so-called ‘grey-zone’ tools for competition and influence have been dramatically weakened for the foreseeable future. This will logically increase its reliance on military power to compete, and so rearmament and reconstruction of its conventional forces after the immediate end of hostilities in Ukraine will almost certainly be a priority. In this, Russia is likely to be heavily supported by China in both economic and technical terms. The Chinese government remains extremely uncomfortable with Russia’s war in Ukraine, and has shown limited willingness to provide overt support while hostilities are ongoing. However, once the shooting pauses, the fact that it is in China’s geostrategic interest to have Russia continue to tie down US and European military forces by posing a threat in Europe suggests that Beijing will support Russian rearmament efforts at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure that Russia does not have an opportunity to re-establish the conventional capability to threaten them, European NATO members must urgently regenerate the warfighting credibility of their armed forces. Although the US remains far and away the most powerful NATO member, China will force it to keep the bulk of its forces postured towards the Indo-Pacific in the coming decades. Since the air domain is where the bulk of NATO’s conventional firepower and lethality sits, deterring Russia requires European NATO air forces to regenerate warfighting capabilities so that they can defend NATO airspace and ground forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper examines three areas of challenge for European NATO air forces facing this task. Chapter I looks at the vulnerability of NATO air bases and the options for hardening or dispersal according to various existing models. Chapter II provides an analysis of NATO aircrew training and exercise practices. Chapter III looks at the twinned challenges of munitions stockpiles and SEAD/DEAD requirements. Finally, the Conclusion lays out several broad recommendations for European NATO air forces in the short, medium and longer term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reducing-air-base-vulnerability&quot;&gt;Reducing Air Base Vulnerability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 30 years since the end of the Cold War, all NATO air forces have significantly reduced the number of aircraft, bases and personnel they operate. This has, however, been accompanied by a significant increase in the theoretical combat power of most air forces, due to dramatic improvements in precision-guided munitions, targeting pods, sensors and avionics. Essentially, the aircraft and weapons have become much more capable and lethal, while also becoming more expensive and complex to maintain. This, combined with declining defence budgets, has led almost all NATO air forces to dramatically reduce the number of air bases from which they operate, and to centralise maintenance and logistics support on the remaining main operating bases to improve cost efficiency. This made sense in the absence of a credible strike threat to those air forces on their bases. However, with the return of Russia as an active adversary, European NATO air forces must confront the fact that their current force laydowns involve potentially very lethal, but nonetheless comparatively small, numbers of fast jets and enabler aircraft on a small number of main operating bases, often alongside the deep maintenance and sustainment facilities for each fleet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a major issue for the conventional deterrence credibility of NATO’s airpower, since it means that much of it is very vulnerable to destruction by Russian long-range precision strike capabilities in the event of any direct clash. Throughout the invasion of Ukraine, Russia has fired thousands of ground-, sea- and air-launched cruise and ballistic missiles against a range of Ukrainian targets with consistently sufficient accuracy to hit individual buildings from standoff ranges. The challenge for the UK and other European air forces is not necessarily that Russia would open any clash with a massive strike wave against NATO air bases (although it could, depending on the perceived stakes and risk on both sides). Rather, the risk is that NATO could be deterred from using its airpower to start degrading Russian IADS (integrated air defence system) coverage and attriting ground forces during any future Russian aggression against an Eastern European NATO member state, due to the chronic vulnerability of its combat air fleets to return strikes. Since most joint-force ISTAR capacity and precision firepower across the Alliance is delivered by air, and Western armies have very limited GBAD capabilities, this is a serious problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are essentially two potential approaches GBAD air forces can take, and in some cases already are taking, to reduce the vulnerability of their air bases. The first is hardening (which can include deploying integrated GBAD capabilities) and the second is dispersal. Both present challenges and have practical limitations and significant extra costs associated with them. Neither are a silver-bullet solution in themselves, but both offer ways to significantly reduce the attractiveness of air forces as targets for finite Russian (or other state) long-range precision strike and sabotage capabilities. Therefore, they are an essential component for NATO air forces trying to reorientate towards great-power deterrence once more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hardening involves using both passive and active defences to render air bases and the aircraft, weapons stockpiles, fuel and facilities on them less vulnerable to strikes. Passive Cold War staples such as hardened aircraft shelters (HASs) (see Figure 1) and command facilities have been replaced on many bases by commercial-grade buildings or light shelters that provide no blast protection. Even where they have been retained, the concentration of fleets on small numbers of bases means that generally there are not nearly enough HASs for all the aircraft to be so protected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/z4BX89M.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: RAF Squadron Buildings with Hardened Aircraft Shelters.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Google maps satellite image, 1 December 2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons why HASs have gone out of fashion since the Cold War is that precision-guided munitions with unitary warheads can defeat HAS protection with direct hits. However, in the context of long-range Russian missiles, as opposed to comparatively cheap Western laser- or GPS-guided bombs dropped from aircraft, they still provide very significant levels of protection, for several reasons. First, destroying multiple aircraft protected by HASs requires at least one, and sometimes multiple, direct hits with penetrating, unitary warheads on each shelter. This means that a lot of accurate, long-range and therefore expensive munitions are required for an adversary to destroy even a moderate number of aircraft using conventional strikes. Second, it is difficult to tell if a HAS is in use at any given time using overhead or orbital surveillance. Therefore, if there are more HASs than aircraft on a base, an enemy will be forced to assume that they will waste at least some weapons on empty shelters during any strike, and it will also be more difficult to track the dispersal of aircraft both on the air base and off-site for targeting purposes. This effect would dovetail extremely well with the use of realistic decoy aircraft and other deception measures to greatly increase the number of missile strikes Russia would have to plan on to achieve a given level of effect. HASs are also very useful for reducing vulnerability to more unconventional threats, since inside them aircraft are well protected against the light warheads that can be carried by small UAVs and loitering munitions, and are harder for infiltrated saboteurs to reach in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, aircraft parked under unprotected sun shelters, in non-hardened hangars or on hardstands (see Figure 2) are vulnerable to being destroyed or disabled in significant numbers by sabotage or a single missile carrying a large high-explosive fragmentation warhead or submunitions. They are also much easier to find and target using small UAVs or loitering munitions. The risk is heightened further if aircraft parked on hardstands or in hangars are not separated by raised berms to deflect horizontal blast, shrapnel and the spread of fire or secondary explosions. Even with revetments for horizontal blast protection, multiple aircraft can be destroyed or rendered unflyable by both conventional missile strikes and/or special forces using UAVs to drop explosives and cause secondary fuel fires. This was graphically illustrated by the destruction of at least eight Su-30SM and Su-24MR jets from Russia’s Naval Aviation forces at Saki Air base in August 2022 by a combination of as-yet unattributed primary and secondary explosions and fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/gdXM7hh.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: RAF Squadron Hangar with Aircraft Parked on Hardstand Area.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Google maps satellite image, 1 December 2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The construction of HASs is a relatively expensive activity, made more so by the increased space requirements for a given number of aircraft compared to large hangars, and the need to provide the requisite ground support equipment in multiple locations around a squadron site. Line maintenance also becomes more labour-intensive for ground crews if aircraft are to undergo routine maintenance tasks in dispersed HAS sites, rather than in a large central hangar or on hardstands. However, compared to the cost of combat aircraft themselves, it is relatively efficient to construct HASs when doing so will significantly improve their survivability. As an example of the rough cost and continued appeal for air forces who take high-intensity conflict seriously as a planning requirement, in July 2020 the Republic of Korea Air Force and USAF completed a joint programme to construct 20 new third-generation HASs at Kunsan Air Base for a total cost of $125 million. This is around the cost of one modern Western fighter aircraft, including engine and initial servicing contract. The relatively small size of most NATO fighter fleets, and the fact that some HAS capacity still exists at many bases, suggests that resilience against long-range missile and UAV strikes could relatively affordably be significantly improved by national or multinational HAS construction and renovation programmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another crucial element of passive hardening to make air bases more resilient in the face of standoff attacks is the ability to rapidly defuse unexploded munitions, fill in craters and resurface runways that have been damaged. Multiple runways or the ability to take off from taxiways provide additional resilience but ultimately, to remain active under fire, an air force must retain the ability to repair runways rapidly, so that an opponent would have to fire an uneconomical number of missiles on a sustained basis to keep aircraft grounded. Under existential threat from the People’s Liberation Army’s long-range missile arsenal, the Republic of China [Taiwanese] Air Force has long maintained rapid runway repair teams and equipment at each base, and the Israeli Air Force does the same to avoid being grounded by Hizbullah rocket strikes. However, in most European air forces the specialist engineering support units that provided a rapid runway repair capability during the Cold War were disbanded in the 1990s and 2000s due to the lack of an obvious threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is far more expensive to harden C2 facilities, munitions and fuel bunkers. This is not only because they are larger, but also because they need to be assured to a greater degree than each individual HAS due to their value as targets for limited stocks of expensive ballistic missiles able to penetrate significant depths of concrete. Providing such defence requires burying these facilities under large amounts of earth and reinforced concrete. As such, dispersing these functions across smaller, more numerous nodes with reduced signatures may be more viable than buried hardening as a route towards reducing their vulnerability within the budgets available. It is also significantly more difficult to provide HAS protection for large enabler aircraft like tankers and AWACS than for fighters, meaning that a greater reliance on dispersal (including potentially at civilian airports) and active hardening through air defence systems at main operating bases may be a better route for reducing the vulnerability of these critical assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Active hardening for airpower on the ground involves the ability to intercept and shoot down incoming missiles, in addition to traditional ground-based force protection such as that provided by the RAF Regiment for the UK against infiltration or special forces attacks. Integrated air and missile defence (IAMD) requires a layered and seamlessly interconnected system of sensors to provide early warning and tracking of incoming threats, and shooters to intercept the missiles. For the defence of facilities in the homeland, IAMD capabilities also require assured and seamless deconfliction with civilian air traffic activities and other military flying. These integration and networking requirements drive up cost and personnel demands on top of the sensors and interceptor systems, which are themselves very expensive. For example, Bahrain recently paid $2.5 billion for 60 Patriot PAC-3 missiles, 36 Patriot PAC-2 GEM missiles, nine M903 launchers and two AN/MPQ-65 radar sets, along with control stations and other associated equipment. This would be roughly sufficient to protect one site from a large-scale ballistic missile attack, or two sites from a smaller-scale attack. In terms of air defence systems focused on cruise missiles, a contract to produce six batteries of medium-range NASAMS systems for Ukraine was valued at $1.2 billion in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The high cost of providing modern GBAD, particularly in layered form, has itself become a driver of further air base consolidation in recent years. The Royal Norwegian Air Force is closing Air Force Base Bodø and concentrating its F-35 fleet on only one main operating base (Ørland) and one forward base (Evenes). The logic is that with a limited number of bases to begin with, it is better to concentrate forces on one base around which more effective layered air defence can be sited. It is certainly the case that an active hardening approach using layered ballistic and cruise missile defence systems is easier to finance, deploy and sustain if it only has to provide protection to a small number of main operating bases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, since Russia has a significant arsenal of advanced ballistic missiles with terminal manoeuvring and decoy-launching capabilities, and the air-launched hypersonic Kh-47M2 Kinzhal and naval hypersonic 3M22 Zircon missiles, even layered defences that have a high degree of efficiency against traditional cruise missiles and less advanced ballistic missiles cannot fully protect air bases. On the other hand, modern advanced quasi-ballistic and hypersonic threats are available to Russia in relatively limited quantities, rely on valuable and scarce launch platforms to get within range of many Western European targets, and would be in demand for a wide range of target sets. The demonstrated ability of modern Western medium- and short-range air defence systems like NASAMS and the IRIS-T SLM to achieve a very high probability of kill against even advanced Russian cruise missiles like the Kh-101 and 9M728 in Ukraine shows what could be achieved in terms of threat reduction against the bulk of Russia’s long-range firepower with even a single battery at each major air base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second major approach to reducing the vulnerability of air forces on the ground is dispersal. At the most basic level, this involves increasing the number of targets an opponent has to try to hit, and complicating their targeting process by moving assets between air bases and support facilities regularly. Among European nations, Sweden has taken the dispersal approach the furthest in terms of the ability to operate away from main operating bases for sustained periods under realistic combat conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a medium-sized fleet of 95 operational Gripen C/D fighters, and 60 new Gripen E jets on order, the Swedish Air Force operates from five home operating bases, but for its wartime posture maintains the ability to operate from 11 main bases, 12 forward operating bases and 21 reserve bases. To further increase dispersal options it also maintains highway strips, and some bases have multiple runways with redundant taxiways connecting them to multiple hardstand areas. Sweden also maintains GBAD capabilities to further increase resilience against Russian strikes. However, this ability to operate dispersed requires an air force and aircraft designed for that purpose from the ground up. The ground support equipment set for a Gripen fighter wing such as F 21 is supplied in 20-ft shipping containers that can be attached to a hangar to form part of a home base maintenance facility, but can also be loaded onto medium-sized trucks in minutes and dispersed at short notice along with the aircraft themselves. The Gripen itself sits relatively low to the ground and has access panels that can be opened with push toggle locks with winter gloves on, greatly facilitating maintenance by ground crews without ladders or specialist tools in dispersed locations. The auxiliary power unit on the aircraft allows it to be started up from cold without ground power if required, and most major operations, including loading weapons and engine changes, can be conducted outdoors with universal winch tools known as ‘fishing rods’. Fuel and ammunition dumps and hides are required at the forward and reserve bases, and must be transported to and loaded on highway strips as needed. To ensure that these sorts of armed flight operations all over the country can be certified and assured from an explosive and flight safety point of view, this must be practised with reasonable regularity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/o6Y1MMZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most NATO air forces, however, that fly fighter aircraft not designed specifically with sustained operations from dispersed locations in mind, the Swedish model is difficult to copy. The European air force with the most advanced dispersed basing model that flies non-Swedish fighters is the Finnish Air Force, which has many similarities to its Swedish counterpart and notably makes even more regular use of highway strips for flight operations, with 19 highway strips and the ability to use a range of other civilian airfields and airports for military operations. Due to the higher frequency of drills, the Finnish Air Force has even more recent experience and currency than the Swedish Air Force in flying from dispersed locations. However, Finland’s maintenance and logistics support equipment is more concentrated than Sweden’s, and its 55 F-18C/D Hornet fighters are based in two main operating bases (Rovaniemi and Kuopio) in peacetime. The F-18 Hornet has landing gear designed to cope with hard, short landings on less than ideal surfaces, can take arrestor cables to further reduce landing runs, and is designed to be forgiving to land at high angles of attack and relatively slow speeds due to being designed for operations on US Navy aircraft carriers. Likewise, compared to land-based aircraft, the ground support equipment for the Hornet and other navalised fighters must be relatively compact and transportable to maximise the space available in the cramped hangars onboard aircraft carriers. Therefore, it is logical to expect that Finland can disperse its logistics and maintenance chain relatively easily compared to most Western air forces, even though the F-18 was not designed from the outset for such operations on land like the Gripen was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most NATO air forces, however, which fly aircraft such as the F-16, F-15, F-35, Typhoon and Rafale, dispersing maintenance and conducting sustained operations away from main operating bases is more challenging. The ground support equipment, spares packs and tool sets required to diagnose and fix faults, conduct engine changes, load weapons and process mission data from the aircraft for each sortie are generally bespoke and extensive. This is because, with the partial exception of the F-35B, these aircraft were designed around the assumption that they would operate from large, well-equipped bases. Perhaps more significantly, many NATO air forces have contracted a significant part of their line maintenance and fleet support arrangements to civilian industry. This has allowed fighter fleets to be maintained with a lower uniformed personnel headcount by using civilian engineers rather than military ones, and enabled lower operating costs. However, it has also driven further centralisation of maintenance and logistics, often in commercial-standard buildings. Civilian maintainers working for industry also generally have more restrictive hours in their working day and are more expensive to deploy away from home than military personnel. Availability-based maintenance contracts that undertake to simply provide an air force with a given number of airframes and flying hours at main operating bases also tend to lack the flexibility to rapidly generate dispersed operations at short notice or for sustained periods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/cvtpOvI.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, there is a practical limit to the length of time air forces equipped with such aircraft can operate sustainably away from established bases, even when supported by teams and equipment carried by large transport aircraft like the C-17 or the A400M. To ameliorate its air base vulnerabilities, the USAF has developed its Agile Combat Employment (ACE) strategy, initially for the Indo-Pacific and subsequently with an increased focus on ACE exercises in Europe since the invasion of Ukraine began. The doctrinal definition of ACE is ‘a proactive and reactive operational scheme of manoeuvre executed within threat timelines to increase resiliency and survivability while generating combat power’. In other words, it is not about power projection or deployment over distance per se, but rather about being able to move fast jets between bases faster than a peer opponent’s targeting cycle can follow in order to improve the survivability of a force while still flying combat sorties. While tied to large facilities for deep and regular line maintenance, US Air Forces Europe (USAFE) trains its fighter wings to conduct multi-day deployments to operate from dispersed forward-operating locations at 24 hours’ notice. When this occurs, large numbers of fighters disperse to Allied air bases throughout Europe that have been designated as forward-operating locations or additional landing sites, and then draw on a combination of pre-positioned supplies, host nation support and deployable air base systems moved by C-17. The US currently has an unmatched global logistics system including heavy lift and pre-positioned stocks, and can also afford to spend far more money than other individual nations in NATO on conducting ACE at scale and on a regular basis. Even so, US fighter wings remain tied to their main operating bases for maintenance purposes, and C2 functions – especially targeting cells – are still largely centralised in Air Operations centres. Therefore, despite the impressive ability to rapidly disperse fighter aircraft, crews and maintainers to forward-operating locations around Europe, large-scale Russian strikes on USAFE bases and command centres still pose a serious threat to each fighter wing’s ability to conduct warfighting at scale on a sustained basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When considering how to reduce the vulnerability of European air forces on their air bases, it is important to prevent the lack of a perfect solution being seen as a reason not to make improvements to the situation as it currently exists. While no affordable hardening or dispersal measures can completely remove the vulnerability of any one air force or location to a concentrated long-range precision strike campaign by Russia, it is still possible to greatly increase the number of weapons required to have a decisive effect. For Russia to undertake a major strike campaign against NATO airpower on its home bases, its military commanders would have to have a reasonable degree of confidence that it would destroy enough combat airpower to justify the resulting political escalation and military retaliation. A combination of active and passive hardening and dispersal/ACE exercises could with reasonable efficiency make NATO’s main operating bases much less attractive targets than they currently are, thus reducing both the temptation to conduct a strike campaign and the credibility of threats to do so. The Russian military has shown the capability to fire large numbers of standoff missiles with acceptable accuracy against Ukraine. However, it only has a limited number of long-range launch platforms, and most would have to expose themselves to at least some risk to reach many key targets in Western Europe. Therefore, presenting Russia with targeting dilemmas and reducing the efficiency of any given successful strike would significantly increase the deterrence value and warfighting credibility of NATO airpower. For most NATO air forces, the practical solution is likely to be a combination of limited investment in hardening main operating bases, investing in more deployable spares kits and forward-operating location exercises, and purchasing small numbers of GBAD assets such as NASAMS or Sky Sabre to provide cruise missile defence at each main operating base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, any increased spending to increase the survivability of air forces on the ground will come at an opportunity cost, both in terms of money and the capacity of the force to conduct other activities. HAS construction, maintenance and support, and C2 arrangements and exercises to enable ACE-type dispersal, particularly GBAD, are expensive. However, the primary reason why combat air is an extremely expensive business remains the complex sensors, weaponry, defensive systems and high performance required to ensure the aircraft themselves can survive against enemy threats while remaining effective and lethal in the air. Given that most NATO air forces (rightly) judge it essential to pay these costs to be able to contest control of the air, it would seem prudent to also spend the significantly lower sums required to credibly give the aircraft and the maintenance and logistics systems that support them a degree of survivability on the ground. After all, they are much easier for Russia to target on the ground than in the air, and the ground is where they unavoidably spend most of their time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;aircrew-training-and-exercises&quot;&gt;Aircrew Training and Exercises&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast jet aircrew, or ‘fighter pilots’ in layman’s terms, remain the most vital human component of any modern air force. However, the skills that combat-ready fast jet crews require to be combat-effective are poorly understood by the majority of non-specialists in the wider military and policy community. The costs and timescales involved in generating the tactical leadership skills essential for fast jet combat operations are widely underestimated, as are the minimum fleet size and flying activity thresholds required to do so on a sustainable basis. Part of this is because producing a cost estimate that can be relied on for use as a rule of thumb is a complex undertaking due to the number of variable factors involved, and because precise figures are seldom deemed suitable for public release due to political and commercial sensitivities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the outset, it is important to understand that being good at physically flying the aircraft is one of the least important factors distinguishing a capable modern fast jet pilot. Basic airmanship skills are an important prerequisite, not least from a flight safety perspective, but these are supposed to be largely ingrained in newly trained pilots by the time they graduate from basic fast jet flying training and move on to advanced fast jet flying training. The modern fly-by-wire flight control systems make most advanced fourth- and fifth-generation fast jets comparatively easy to fly from a traditional ‘stick skills’ perspective. An ability to recognise and/or diagnose and then safely cope with a wide range of potential mechanical and software failures in flight remains essential, and requires a mix of synthetic and live flying experience to develop. However, the main focus during advanced fast jet flying training, and subsequently on an operational conversion unit (OCU), is not physical flying skills or airmanship, but rather learning how to tactically operate the many sensors, weapons systems and avionics that will be used on the front line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most critical task for the modern fighter pilot is to harness the different sensor and communications systems on their aircraft to generate an accurate and detailed understanding of the battlespace around them in real time. They must then continuously interpret this situational awareness picture and react so as to optimally position their aircraft to survive against known and potential threats, and employ their weapons and sensor capabilities against aerial and ground-based targets. This task is made hugely more challenging by the fact that it must be done while moving at high speeds in three dimensions, often under significant g-forces, dealing with transiting complex airspace boundaries, international borders and weather conditions, and potentially managing a wider formation or even a complex strike package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These challenges become far greater for missions against a peer adversary like Russia, which can disrupt communications and threaten bases, enablers and fighter aircraft themselves from long range using ground-based and airborne assets. Against a state threat such as that posed by Russia, missions must be planned to include complex, mutually supporting elements working in tandem to detect, suppress and destroy threats. As such, one of the core qualities of a successful fighter pilot is an ability to multi-task and make rapid life-and-death decisions based on information that is often simultaneously overwhelming in volume and incomplete. This is a skill set that is partly affected by innate ability, but is primarily a function of proficiency in the core tasks of flying and navigating the aircraft. As a pilot gains proficiency and currency, the tasks of flying the aircraft, navigating and employing weapons require less mental capacity to perform. This leaves more capacity for communication, tactical awareness building, decision-making and, eventually, formation leadership functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, it is important to understand that a fast jet pilot is of limited value in most combat scenarios at the point when they first finish training and join a front line unit, due to lack of experience and qualifications. They will start out flying as wingmen in a pair or four-ship formation, providing support to and learning from a formation leader. In most Western air forces, pilots will progress through initial combat readiness in their primary role and later multirole mission sets, night operations and formation leader qualifications during their first tour. Nevertheless, one of the key fighter pilot mantras is that one never stops learning; it takes multiple tours, specialist training courses, a wide range of operational experiences and the right mindset and aptitude to become an effective combat leader in the fast jet world. As such, it is difficult to define exactly what the true cost is to generate multirole-capable front line fast jet pilots, but what is certain is that it costs many millions of pounds, takes the better part of a decade and requires a significant amount of input from existing qualified instructor pilots. Moreover, the skill sets and competencies that make a truly effective multirole fighter pilot also fade rapidly without regular practice, since so many things must become all but second nature for a person to have sufficient mental capacity to be tactically effective as a formation leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The poor performance of the VKS fighter fleet during the invasion of Ukraine in 2022 underscores how vital fast jet pilot competency and currency are to effectiveness. In the years leading up to the invasion, VKS (and Russian Naval Aviation) fighter crews were typically flying around 80 hours per year, and had limited access to high-fidelity simulators for synthetic training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, a significant proportion of the flying hours being flown by Russian fast jet crews were relatively simple sorties involving navigation, unguided weapon deliveries on ranges, and target simulation for GBAD operators. Consequently, many Russian aircrew had limited skills across the primary mission set assigned to their aircraft type (fighter, frontal-bomber, ground attack), let alone all the weapons, tactics and procedures involved in potential secondary mission sets. As a result of this, the core VKS inventory of around 350 modern, multirole fast jet aircraft has been shown in practical terms to be fairly inflexible in terms of mission sets, with very limited tactical interoperability between fleets. Though the inability of the VKS to conduct a successful air campaign against Ukraine so far is a positive from a NATO point of view, the difference between the capabilities of the Russian fighter force on paper and its capabilities in practice should be a wake-up call for aircrew training and readiness standards for most European air forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, annual flying hours accrued by Western fast jet aircrew fell dramatically, with most getting somewhere between 80 and 120 hours per year, as air forces attempted to maintain fleet sizes as far as possible in the face of continued budget cuts. As a result, most Western air forces today have modern, multirole fast jet fleets but risk falling into the same trap as the Russian VKS; failing to invest in sufficient flying hours and the infrastructure required to conduct realistic, complex training sorties. Pilots interviewed for this paper from multiple NATO air forces consistently emphasised that they were permanently ‘behind the drag curve’, with too few flying hours available for both instructor and student pilots, and that this was causing an overall degradation of skills currency and multirole capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spreading out smaller aircraft fleets to maintain the appearance of a larger number of front line units has exacerbated the issue, since with fewer aircraft per squadron it is often difficult to reliably generate enough available jets to fly the four-ship formations required to practise the complex tactics required by most warfighting mission sets. The smaller unit complements of aircraft are, the more vulnerable regular realistic training flying is to disruption due to inevitable maintenance issues, depot cycles and operational deployment requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another commonly expressed theme from pilots across European NATO air forces is that quality and realism in live flying training have been systemically sacrificed on the altar of flight safety, largely due to a refusal at the duty-holder and senior leadership levels to sign off on and hold risk. This was expressed succinctly by one German Eurofighter weapons instructor who stated that: ‘the German approach to training and flight operations is geared towards fulfilling NATO flying hour targets as safely as possible, but with no real concern for how to make us lethal [as fighter pilots].’ The lack of any serious peer threat since the end of the Cold War has permitted air forces throughout NATO to focus on maximising flight safety at the expense of pushing aircrew, aircraft and weapons systems to their limits during realistic training sorties and major exercises. The cost of the latter approach during the Cold War was a steady drumbeat of fatal crashes, especially during low-level training sorties in bad weather or at night. However, against the Soviet Union such tactics were seen as the only viable option for penetrating Warsaw Pact air defences, and so to ensure the operational credibility that was seen as essential to conventional and nuclear deterrence, the risks inherent in realistic regular training at low level in low-visibility conditions were seen as necessary. The dissolution of the Soviet Union and the breakup of the Warsaw Pact removed the threat that justified regular aircrew deaths and losses of airframes, so it was not only inevitable but also morally right that a greater emphasis be placed on flight safety during training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the intervention and counterinsurgency campaigns of the 2000s and 2010s saw almost all combat operations conducted from 12,000 ft or above to remain clear of the anti-aircraft fire and man-portable air defence systems (MANPADS) that formed the only realistic threat. They also generally involved close air support against enemies who were often fighting in civilian areas and/or very close to friendly forces. Consequently, training for these medium-level operations generally focused on performing the difficult task of conducting close air support as safely and accurately as possible to minimise collateral damage and friendly fire risks. As a result, aircrew training for combat operations has been focused on flight safety and operations in permissive or semi-permissive airspace for more than a decade. Even among air forces like the RAF and the French Air and Space Force (L’Armée de l’air et de l’espace, or AAE), where a significant proportion of pilots have live combat experience, that combat took place under permissive conditions very different from those they would face against Russia or another serious state adversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To return non-US NATO air forces to a state where they are ready and capable of performing realistic combat missions against Russia will require significant changes to the focus of training and exercises and to the policies around how risk is managed, and above all a reduction in operational tempo compared to the current situation. Retraining aircrew for warfighting tasks requires those aircrew to have time, capacity and flying hours to dedicate to developing proficiency in both core and advanced skills that they either have not practised in a long time or in some cases may have never been qualified in before. Furthermore, the tactics employed in most high-intensity mission sets generally require larger numbers of aircraft, supporting enablers and planning to accomplish. To generate competence in them, aircrew must have their capacity and flying hours synchronised to fly exercises together at the same time. Unfortunately, in several NATO air forces (including the RAF), pilots are currently completely overstretched by the concurrent requirements for multiple ongoing operational deployments in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, major exercises and basic currency flying. The same goes for maintenance crews, who are struggling to generate jets reliably to meet the operational and training tempo demanded. This means that there simply is not currently enough capacity, either in terms of aircrew or aircraft availability/maintenance personnel, to conduct large-scale complex warfighting training sorties on a regular basis for most non-US NATO air forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The underlying problem is that while most NATO nations have accepted the political need to pivot defence planning towards Russia and a return to state-on-state deterrence as a core planning assumption, few pre-existing deployments or operational commitments have been stopped to generate the capacity for fast jet crews and the maintenance personnel who keep them flying. Instead, the demand signal has been to keep doing everything, while flying additional deterrence and reassurance operations and deploying for new exercise activities. Overstretching fast jet fleets leads inexorably to poor morale across the force, increasingly poor aircraft availability for regular training, and the atrophying of aircrew skill competencies. It also leads to an increase in aircrew and engineers leaving the military, which in the case of experienced personnel creates shortfalls that take many years to rectify. In addition to the expense and time it takes to replace aircrew and experienced engineers who leave air forces due to an unsustainable operational tempo, their loss increases the burden felt by those who remain, since the same workload must be tackled by a smaller cadre of experienced personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-critical-role-of-weapons-instructors-and-balancing-live-versus-synthetic-training&quot;&gt;The Critical Role of Weapons Instructors and Balancing Live Versus Synthetic Training&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arguably the most critical personnel cadre for any combat-focused air forces are weapons instructors (or their equivalents, for the few air forces who do not use that specific role title). Weapons instructor pilots are generally responsible for leading formations in combat and coordinating complex missions in the air. Within each squadron they are also responsible for leading the tactical mission planning, briefing and debriefing stages of any mission. Essentially, while standard instructor pilots are responsible for training and certifying pilots to fly their aircraft in a variety of conditions safely, weapons instructors are responsible for the tactical training and combat effectiveness of a squadron and its pilots. The process to train such instructors is complex and varies somewhat between air forces, but it remains essential for credible combat capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the RAF, pilot conversion to front line fighters such as the Eurofighter Typhoon and F-35 Lightning II takes place at the OCU, alongside basic combat readiness qualifications prior to assignment to a front line squadron. 29 Squadron is the OCU for the Typhoon force, and it is also the unit that conducts qualified flying instructor (QFI) and qualified weapons instructor (QWI) training courses. The process of training new QFIs and QWIs requires a significant pool of pre-existing and experienced QFIs and QWIs; consequently, 29 Squadron has the largest number of instructor pilots of any RAF squadron. Dependence on experienced instructors is one of the hidden fragilities within any air force. If the number of instructors drops below that required to both serve the requirements of front line squadrons and simultaneously train a steady supply of sufficiently qualified new QFIs and QWIs, one process must be truncated at the expense of the other, and the overall pilot training ecosystem will break. If this happens, it is generally extremely difficult and time consuming, or even impossible, to fix without resorting to a dependence on partner-nation training pipelines to shore up numbers. As air forces have become smaller, it has become progressively harder for them to balance recruitment, training, career management and retention to ensure that enough suitably qualified and experienced personnel are retained where needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To provide adequate live flying hours for the OCU, QFI and QWI courses, 29 Squadron has by far the largest number of aircraft and maintenance and support personnel of any RAF squadron, with approximately 24 airframes and 300 people, respectively. Nevertheless, the training requirements for both new junior pilots and the instructor cadre, coupled with supply chain disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and Britain’s exit from the EU, have created considerable problems with spares and airframe availability. To try to compensate for the expense and scarcity of live flying hours at all levels of the training pipeline and on the front line, RAF senior leadership has pushed reliance on synthetic training in simulators further than have other NATO air forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present the RAF Typhoon force average sits somewhere between 50% and 70% synthetic flying hours compared to live flying (with significant variation depending on squadron, location and operational deployments). The RAF’s long-term strategy plans to increase that to around 80/20% synthetic/live. There are significant benefits to relying heavily on the synthetic environment for some aspects of training fast jet pilots. Simulators that are linked together to allow at least four aircrew (and ideally more, from multiple bases) to train together simultaneously are an excellent way to efficiently practise complex high-end tactics and mission sets. In the case of certain threat systems, advanced tactics and electronic warfare (EW) techniques, there are aspects of training for high-end warfighting that can only be practised regularly in the simulator due to airspace, security and financial constraints. However, every fighter pilot interviewed for this study thought that 80% was too high as a proportion of synthetic to live flying, and that the simulator should be used to enhance rather than replace the value of live flying training. Despite the benefits of conducting many complex training tasks primarily in the simulator, from an operational effectiveness point of view, the universal view was that if the planning priority were warfighting readiness, then the synthetic/live flying balance across European air forces would be different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effects of bad weather, visibility while night flying, the effect of sustained high g-forces when manoeuvring to defeat incoming missiles and the dangers of low flying were all regularly cited by interviewees for this paper as vital elements of flying training for state-on-state mission sets that cannot be replicated accurately in a synthetic environment. Perhaps even more significantly, the psychological and physiological effects of adrenaline and fear caused by sudden spatial disorientation, and the risk of accidents during tactical flying or from enemy action, are almost impossible to accurately train for in the simulator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps even more crucially, when missions are not exercised regularly in real life but instead are only practised in simulators, only the aircrew are getting any training value. The maintenance crews are not getting practice generating large numbers of jets for complex sorties or loading live air-to-air and standoff air-to-ground weapons, the logistics chain is not being realistically tested, and none of the practical clearance and authorisation steps are being carried out. In other words, synthetic training does not allow end-to-end testing of the air force as a whole. This also applies for multi-domain or joint warfighting effects. If new doctrinal and tactical assumptions rely on synchronising capabilities from multiple services in real time to solve operational challenges, then to be credible, all the required joint force elements and support structures must be regularly exercised together in real life, from the planning stages through to execution, debriefing and lessons learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picture is different for USAFE, where the practical training and planning focuses more heavily on traditional high-intensity warfighting readiness and credibility than in most European NATO air forces. A key advantage that the USAF has over European air forces is the scale at which it routinely operates in a training and exercise context. Most bases host a fighter wing composed of between three or four squadrons of fast jets, each with between 20 and 24 aircraft. On some bases a typical day will see each squadron launch two or even three waves of eight–12 aircraft in rapid succession. As such, the training airspace used by some USAF fighter wings will regularly be in use by 30 or more fighters simultaneously, usually supported by tankers and sometimes big-wing ISR enablers such as the E-3G AWACS. This in turn means that in locations where they are well resourced, such as RAF Lakenheath, US fast jet aircrew train daily as part of large formations in complex air environments – conditions which most other Allies can only generate for periodic large-scale exercises. Maintenance crews, logistics chains, planners and air traffic and airfield traffic management personnel are also constantly trained to handle operations at a realistic scale for most warfighting scenarios. The resultant complexity of day-to-day training means that USAFE fighter aircrew tend to develop tactical expertise faster than other Western air forces, but as a result may not spend as much time concentrating on technical flying finesse per se.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The philosophy within the F-15E community at RAF Lakenheath on live/synthetic training for new pilots is that skills can be introduced, familiarised and practised through cheap, safe repetition in the simulator, but they must be validated by instructors and then regularly practised during live sorties. The USAFE fighter community in general tends not only to fly more than the RAF or the AAE but also to be significantly less comfortable with the prospect of very heavy synthetic training over live training ratios. Senior instructor pilots noted that newer pilots joining the squadrons with significantly lower live flying hours in basic and advanced flying training had good tactical skills and system knowledge but also generally displayed a poor standard of basic airmanship. This meant that they had to be given significant live flying training time before their airmanship skills were judged to be of an acceptable standard. From a budgetary perspective, this implies the need to compensate for live flying hours in relatively cheap trainer aircraft sacrificed for cost saving during basic training by flying an increased number of live hours in expensive front line jets once at squadron level. It also meant that a lower proportion of live flying hours could be devoted to combat-relevant training tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the USAF, with the luxury of significantly greater resources than most other NATO air forces, fighter pilots are expected to progress to being qualified to fly as the leader of a two-ship formation around the end of their first year on a front line squadron. For an F-15E Strike Eagle squadron this typically equates to around 250 flying hours, with the higher-than-usual average being accounted for by deployments on combat operations in the Middle East. The general intent is to bring almost all pilots to a stage where they are qualified as four-ship leaders during their first three-year front line tour. There is no hard and fast rule on when this happens, with individual aptitude and temperament, as well as individual squadron situations, influencing how fast each pilot is able to progress. The most promising may begin the process of upgrading almost as soon as they are qualified as a two-ship lead, but for most this typically happens around the one-and-a-half- to two-year mark, with around 500 hours flown. However, these rosy flying hour totals are not representative of the current USAF as a whole. According to General Mark Kelly, speaking at the International Fighter Conference, the average US fighter pilot flew only 81.5 hours in 2021, although other sources suggest that for active-duty fighter pilots, the figure was marginally over 120 hours. It is also vital to note that not all flying hours are created equal, especially in relation to readiness for peer warfighting. For example, a sortie to provide a combat air patrol on NATO’s eastern border with Russia might involve long transits and several hours maintaining a combat air patrol, giving the pilots involved four to six hours in the air, but with little to no tactical training value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During their second front line tour, many USAF pilots will be expected to train as instructor pilots – able to teach those fresh from the operational training units how to fly the type in question, and conduct basic check flights to assess competency. However, those who are perceived as having a sufficiently advanced grasp of tactical issues and sufficient technical airmanship and operating acumen will be selected for training as weapons officers – the USAF equivalent of RAF QWIs. The selection process is sufficiently robust that by the time aircrew reach ‘weapons school’, the pass rate is very high, despite the complexity and demanding pace of the training. The course involves intense academic study over four to five months, especially on the subject of the aircraft, avionics, weapons and tactics used by both Allied and potential adversary air forces. Actual flying time at weapons school can be as low as 30 hours, with many of the higher-level tactical training and learning exercises necessarily being carried out in the synthetic environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as in the RAF, when USAF weapons officers, known as ‘patch wearers’, return to the front line they are expected to act as the primary source of tactical and operational knowledge in their squadron, and to lead on planning and operational activities. At first, a weapons officer will act as a Tier 1 patch wearer, and will focus on leadership at the tactical level in the air and often fly as the lead and command ship during complex exercises or combat operations. They are also expected to lead debriefings after each complex sortie to ensure that all mistakes or areas for improvement are identified, dissected and drilled into all pilots. Between a year and 18 months after rejoining the squadron as a Tier 1 weapons officer, a pilot may be upgraded to Tier 2 and be given the primary planning responsibility for complex operations at the squadron or wing level. A Tier 2 weapons officer is expected not only to be an expert on almost all aspects of the aircraft and weapons systems that his or her squadron operates, but also to act as the bridge between the tactical and operational levels of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This relationship between experienced fast jet pilots and operational planning and leadership places weapons officers at the core of the USAF’s ability to provide credible warfighting capability. It is a deeply ingrained concept that operational expertise at the planning and policy advice level is based on and relies on extensive tactical understanding. As such, the live flying training and combat flying experiences of aircrew are seen as essential for developing leaders of sufficient calibre to ensure that the USAF can plan and execute complex joint operations, especially in a contested environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;French fast jet pilots also take around a year from the end of their flight training to achieve basic combat readiness for single-role duties. However, the AAE takes longer than the USAF to qualify front line pilots as combat leaders. There is some variation according to individual aptitude, but around three years is the average to become certified as a two-ship flight lead, and another year after that to become a four-ship leader. AAE fast jet crews typically fly around 150–180 hours per year. The amount of simulator training compared to live flying varies by type, with Rafale crews taking advantage of more modern synthetic training aids to conduct around a 50/50 synthetic/live mix, while the Mirage 2000 crews with more limited simulators fly more at approximately 20/80 synthetic/live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AAE is somewhat unusual among NATO air forces in that it has not traditionally had weapons instructors per se. Instead, four-ship leaders have tactical leadership responsibilities when on operations and in training. As part of the four-ship qualification process, pilots must take a course at centres of excellence for their aircraft type and write a paper on a tactical subject that will be analysed and critiqued by senior pilots and brigade-level staff members. In addition, the most experienced four-ship lead pilot in any given squadron will be the appointed expert in air-to-air or air-to-ground tactics and will oversee tactical training in each squadron. With a smaller aircrew pool than the USAF, the AAE has traditionally sought to bring as many four-ship lead pilots to a required tactical proficiency standard as possible, and to create a written tactical debate and database of analytical writing on which all squadrons can draw, rather than concentrating on creating an elite cadre of weapons instructors. In any case, France’s more strategically independent foreign and defence policy stance compared with other NATO countries explicitly prioritises the ability to act independently against near-peer threats, and the AAE also retains a regularly exercised and modernised airborne nuclear deterrent role. Therefore, it has retained a greater focus on hardening, electronic attack and self-protection suites, GBAD and live training for high-intensity missions than many other air forces since the end of the Cold War. The AAE has also recently started to consider moving to a more formalised weapons instructor course and role for aircrew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to sustain truly dispersed operations places specific demands on aircrew training and tactics. Consequently, Swedish fighter pilots train to be capable of operating in a very independent way compared to most NATO air forces. For any air force to continue to be operationally effective when operating from a widely dispersed posture, even two-ship formation leaders must be highly capable. To meet these requirements, Swedish fighter pilots take around three years to become two-ship leads. This is because they are expected to be capable of conducting mission planning at remote locations with heavily disrupted communications; executing high-intensity mission sets; diverting at short notice into reserve bases, civilian airports or highway strips; conducting rapid turnarounds; and still coming together with other force elements in the air with precise timing to concentrate force in larger formations such as four-ships as required. All Swedish fighter pilots train to be air-to-air mission-capable first and foremost, and then train for additional tasks with priorities set according to the secondary mission specialisation of their particular fighter wing, which might be EW, anti-ship strikes or interdiction. It takes around six years on a front line squadron before Swedish pilots generally qualify as four-ship leads, and at least 10 years before they may be selected to train as either weapons instructors or mission planners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This much slower progression rate compared with other Western air forces is mostly due to the much greater complexity of mission planning and execution required to be combat-effective against Russian forces from a truly dispersed footprint on a sustained basis. It is also due to the harsh weather requirements of operations in Northern Europe and the Arctic, such as the need to be qualified and current to lead four-ship formations in beyond-visual range and close-in air-to-air combat in full instrument-flying conditions, including launch from and recovery to dispersed highway strips. To allow the development and maintenance of such specialised dispersed warfighting aircrew skills, Swedish (and Finnish) pilots are not rotated every three years between units and other non-flying posts like pilots in most NATO air forces, but instead are expected to stay for 15–25 years with the first squadron, or at least wing, that they join. This gives them reduced career variation and exposure to other parts of their services compared to other Western aircrew. However, this approach also improves pilot retention by allowing more family stability and facilitates a depth of learning and specialist skills development that is hard to match. The latter is further improved by the lack of an expeditionary posture for either the Swedish or Finnish Air Force, which has reduced the operational burden and mission breadth that pilots and ground crews have to meet, allowing a much greater focus on fielding credible deterrence capabilities against Russian aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the way in which aircrew, maintenance crews and the other ground trades are managed in terms of training and career management, there are clear trends that are key for regenerating warfighting credibility among the European NATO air forces where it has been allowed to decay. First and foremost, the development, incentivisation and retention of weapons instructors or equivalent tactical experts in every squadron is vital. If more of these individuals can be trained and retained in flying posts, the workload on each individual will be lower and the air force’s tactical expertise, internal training, planning and operational warfighting leadership capacity will be more resilient. Second, if personnel are not regularly trained in representative live missions, the capacity across the force to credibly generate and execute a given capability will rapidly degrade. As noted above, when practice for complex warfighting mission sets is relegated to the simulator, only the aircrew get the training value; the vital maintenance crew, logistical tail, other joint force elements, ground and airspace traffic management and regulatory/permissions aspects are not practised and so will atrophy. Third, no serious increase in aircrew training quality, exercise frequency and thus warfighting readiness and skill sets will be possible without reducing current operational tasking levels. Some fighter forces have already been pushed well beyond a sustainable operational tempo, leading to degrading aircraft availability, worsening retention of key aircrew and maintenance personnel, and fragile morale. Training for warfighting requires capacity, especially when the additional complications of dispersal or ACE-type activities are factored in. It is not a task that can just be added on to existing commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-need-for-seaddead-and-munitions-stocks&quot;&gt;The Need for SEAD/DEAD and Munitions Stocks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of the medium-term threat to Western deterrence and warfighting credibility, it is worth noting that the two components of Russian military power that have performed consistently well during the invasion of Ukraine are its GBAD systems, and its long-range precision strike capabilities. Both are significant for the operational credibility of Western air forces, and they collectively mean that comparative performance between Western fighters and their VKS equivalents is not the key criterion that will determine the potential combat effectiveness of airpower against Russia (or any other peer opponent). Hardening against long-range precision strike capabilities is discussed in Chapter I. However, the need for SEAD/DEAD capabilities is another critical point, and one that has been underlined not only by the highly lethal capabilities of Russian surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems in Ukraine, but also by the striking effectiveness of Ukraine’s much less sophisticated and numerous GBAD capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the defining features of the Russian invasion of Ukraine has been the inability of either side to reliably locate, identify, track and destroy the other’s SAM systems. This has resulted in a mutual denial of the ability to effectively use airpower to shape the war on the ground. Even when not acting as part of a well-coordinated IADS, Ukrainian mobile SA-11 (Russian designation 9М38M1) ‘Buk’ and SA-8 (Russian designation 9K33) ‘Osa’ SAMs have proven sufficiently lethal to deny the much larger and technologically superior VKS the ability to operate above very low altitude inside Ukrainian-controlled airspace. This is despite the fact that the VKS began operations against Ukraine with well over 350 genuinely modern fast jets, a wide range of standoff precision-guided munitions, and potent and widely deployed ground-based and aerial EW capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inability to use airpower effectively on the battlefield has significantly limited Russia’s tactical and operational options, and greatly facilitated Ukrainian challenges. However, the Russian and Ukrainian armies are both designed to rely on massed artillery and tanks for the vast majority of their firepower. The Russian army invaded Ukraine with 2,433 tube artillery systems and 3,547 multiple-launch rocket systems, while the Ukrainian army fielded 1,176 and 1,680, respectively. Both the number of artillery pieces and the ammunition quantities involved dwarf NATO stocks, largely because NATO forces (with the partial exception of the US military) are designed around assumed air superiority and the delivery of aerial precision fires at scale over any contested battlefield. However, at present this assumption is deeply flawed against Russia (and China) due to an inability to credibly deal with their IADS in most likely future flashpoint scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western planners have been aware of the serious challenge to airpower posed by the IADS deployed by Russia and China for years, especially in terms of very long-range SAM systems such as the SA-21 (Russian designation S-400) and the HQ-9B, linked to advanced radar systems such as the RLM-ME Nebo-M and the 59N6 Protivnik-GE. However, the lesson from Ukraine’s air defence performance against Russia in the air domain is that even successfully degrading an enemy IADS to the point that it stops performing as a unified system is insufficient to allow control of the air over contested areas. The threat posed by mobile medium- and short-range SAM systems such as the SA-17 (Russian designation 9M317) and SA-15 (Russian designation 9K330) ‘Tor’ would still render medium- and high-altitude penetrations unacceptably dangerous for the non-stealth platforms that will continue to make up the vast bulk of NATO’s combat aircraft inventory for the foreseeable future. To be able to establish air superiority, therefore, NATO air forces must be able to not only conduct SEAD but also hunt down and conduct DEAD at scale against mobile and aware medium- and short-range SAMs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SEAD/DEAD task requires specialist aircrew training, weapons and sensors that no European air force currently fields at anything like the scale required. Even during the supposedly European-led Libya intervention in 2011 against a largely static and completely outdated air defence system, other NATO partners were dependent on the US to conduct SEAD/DEAD before they could operate effectively. The challenge that would be faced from a near-peer such as Iran, let alone against Russian forces in Eastern and Northern Europe, is almost incomparably more serious, with layered long-, medium- and short-range SAM coverage provided by highly mobile systems linked to a range of multi-static and multi-frequency radar systems by modern C2 vehicles and communications architectures. To give an idea of the threat, Ukrainian fighter pilots have been shot down while flying at altitudes as low as 15 ft by SA-21 SAMs fired from over 150 km away, enabled by active-seeker terminal guidance on the missile itself coupled with launch-cueing and mid-course guidance from a 48Ya6-K1 ‘Podlet’ all-altitude radar relayed through the standard SA-21 battalion 55K6 command vehicle. Russian SA-15 and SA-22 (Russian designation Pantsir-S1) short-range systems also regularly shot down incoming precision munitions, including the AGM-88 HARM and sometimes even the Tochka-U short-range ballistic missile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the individual aircraft level, European NATO capabilities are more impressive than in 2011, especially since many European nations have purchased the F-35 to replace previous F-16 and Tornado fleets. The F-35 was designed specifically to be able to operate against modern SAM systems in both the penetrating strike and SEAD/DEAD roles. Its stealth and EW capabilities allow it to operate much closer to hostile SAM systems than non-stealth aircraft for a given level of risk. Just as importantly, the F-35’s superlative active and passive sensor suite can rapidly and precisely geolocate SAM systems when they illuminate their radars, especially when the aircraft is being operated in a four-ship formation. However, despite these very impressive capabilities, simply fielding the F-35 is not sufficient as an answer to European NATO’s SEAD/DEAD problem in itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the key limitations for some F-35 operators, like the RAF, in the SEAD and more specifically the DEAD role, is a lack of suitable munitions. The radar performance of Russian systems and the overlapping coverage when deployed as intended means that even with its stealth features, the F-35 is likely to be at significant risk if it has to get close enough to drop free-fall bombs. The ability of the SA-15 and SA-22 to intercept incoming munitions also means that free-fall and even glide weapons are likely to have limited survivability when attacking the medium- and long-range SAM units that these short-range systems are designed to protect. Furthermore, anti-radiation seekers such as those found on traditional SEAD weapons such as the AGM-88 HARM will lose the SAM once it stops emitting radar energy, and even if they can store a fairly accurate position fix and hit that, accuracy is usually insufficient to reliably destroy armoured SAMs, and they cannot be tracked if they are moving. Anti-radiation munitions can modify SAM operators’ behaviour and engagement periods to avoid being hit, but they have a very poor track record of achieving hard kills. They are, for the most part, SEAD rather than DEAD weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EW effects are also a vital component of both the threat (since Russia deploys advanced electronic attack assets at scale) and any NATO SEAD/DEAD strategy. Due to the sensitivity of detailed information on EW capabilities, a detailed discussion of their effects and potential is difficult within the bounds of this paper. However, in general terms they can be tailored to offer responsive and much more cost-effective suppressive effects than kinetic munitions against the radars that provide situational awareness and guidance for hostile SAM systems. Doing so requires advanced electronic intelligence collection capabilities to stay up to date on the latest enemy system frequencies and operating patterns, and a responsive mission data-programming capability. It also requires assets capable of delivering the electronic attack (or jamming) effects, such as the US Navy’s standoff EA-18G Growler aircraft, the stand-in F-35, the MALD-X air-launched decoy/jammer, or the proposed MBDA SPEAR-EW missile. However, EW effects are generally temporary, even if certain enemy systems must be reset or components replaced to restore functionality. Therefore, while EW is a vital component of SEAD efforts, it cannot create the conditions for lasting air access in airspace contested by modern air defence systems alone. Instead, it must form part of the mix of SEAD capabilities that can open temporary access opportunities for key strike operations. Only the destruction of a significant portion of the ground-based SAM threat will provide Western airpower with the sustained access it needs with the majority of its conventional aircraft to attain control of the air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the DEAD mission, Western air forces need weapons that can first be launched from standoff and can navigate to a SAM’s approximate location using either positional data provided by an advanced sensor suite such as the F-35s, or by homing in on emitted radar energy using an anti-radiation seeker. Then to reliably hit and destroy the SAM during the terminal phase, the weapon must incorporate millimetric radar homing or possibly infra-red imaging-seeker capabilities to find and accurately hit that SAM even after it has stopped emitting radar energy and is on the move to reposition. They also need to be available in sufficient numbers to seriously attrite the multi-layered Russian IADS quickly, both in terms of overall stockpile, and carriage capacity per aircraft. This is an expensive combination of traits and requires specialised designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three clear options for NATO air forces at present. The first is the Raytheon GBU-53/B StormBreaker glide bomb, which includes a millimetric seeker for terminal target acquisition and precision guidance, and if launched from high altitudes and speeds can strike moving targets over 70 km away. This offers much greater lethality and survivability for launch aircraft than free-fall bombs, but is likely to require multiple weapons per target to saturate SA-15 and SA-22 defences. Another option is MBDA’s similarly sized SPEAR 3 miniature cruise missile, which also offers a millimetric radar seeker capability but with a jet engine that allows a much greater standoff range (especially when fired from lower altitudes and speeds), faster flight time to target and a higher likelihood of each weapon getting past terminal defences. The cost is a significantly higher price per weapon and, therefore, a correspondingly lower number that any air force can purchase. The third SEAD/DEAD weapon option is the Northrop Grumman AGM-88G Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile Extended Range (AARGM-ER). The AARGM-ER is a significantly larger, rocket-powered missile with an anti-radiation seeker and millimetric radar terminal homing capabilities that can be fired from even further away than the SPEAR 3 and travels much faster. Its high peak speed of around Mach 4 results in less time for SAMs to reposition once fired upon at any given standoff launch range, and should also make it more difficult for point defences to intercept the AARGM-ER than other SEAD/DEAD weapons. The downside is a much higher per-weapon cost and, if carried internally on an F-35, being restricted to only two weapons per aircraft per sortie, as opposed to up to eight GBU-53/Bs or SPEAR 3s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important alternative option would be to build in a much greater doctrinal reliance on long-range ground-based firepower for DEAD effects, with location and targeting supplied by air assets like the F-35. Long-range rocket artillery systems such as the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) and High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) systems have been used to impressive effect in Ukraine against Russian logistics and vehicle targets in the deep battle area and could potentially offer significant lethality against SAM batteries many tens of kilometres behind the hostile front line. However, there are various requirements to be satisfied before this represents a viable core of a SEAD/DEAD strategy. First, GMLRS/HIMARS systems would require ammunition with appropriate warheads for reliably destroying or disabling mobile, combat-spaced and armoured SAM systems, such as the M30E1 GLMRS – Alternate Warhead (GMLRS-AW). These are not currently fielded by European operators of GMLRS or HIMARS, so would need to be procured. More to the point, these systems would need to be present in theatre with the ammunition available and political permissions to fire into hostile territory as part of the early stages of any clash when the SEAD/DEAD mission would be most critical. They would also need a secure, common and interoperable communications and data exchange architecture to allow real-time targeting information to be passed from assets such as national and Allied F-35s to GMLRS/HIMARS batteries. This multi-domain approach does offer a route towards greater DEAD lethality, but it also imposes additional training, exercising and resource allocation challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, in the UK the British Army is currently attempting to reconstitute its warfighting capacity, and long-range precision fires renewal is a key component within the operational testing and resource allocation planning process. The RAF might decide to doctrinally rely on Army GMLRS systems forming a key component of DEAD lethality in future joint operations. However, for that to work, detailed discussions on ammunition stockpiles and warhead/guidance requirements, assumed fire mission capacity allocations, airspace deconfliction, wartime and deterrence deployment sequencing and logistic support assumptions must happen urgently before key Army procurements are fixed. Furthermore, just as with other aspects of air operations, if multi-domain SEAD/DEAD approaches are not properly resourced, regularly exercised in realistic scenarios and trained for as a primary task by all the joint elements involved, they will not work in practice when needed. In terms of weapon cost, the notion of relying on ground-based long-range fires simply transfers cost liability to another service in balance sheet terms (assuming they agree) but does not avoid the overall requirement to spend more on munitions to regenerate a SEAD/DEAD capability at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whichever weapons are chosen, the cost per weapon is likely to mean that, with the possible exception of the GBU-53/B, stockpiles will need to be purchased and held specifically against the SEAD/DEAD mission. The capabilities that these weapons require mean that they are unlikely to be economical as multipurpose utility weapons for lower-threat target sets and missions. However, the quantities required to give a credible DEAD capability will mean that air forces which buy into this mission set will have to accept a high opportunity cost in terms of other potential purchases forgone. Furthermore, even with such weapons, the SEAD/DEAD mission set in a high-intensity Russia scenario is an extremely complex task that will require joint force planning, enablement and deconfliction, as well as specialist aircrew skills and competencies. In other words, European air forces will have to specialise in order to be good at SEAD/DEAD. For small F-35 operators, with fleets sized only to be able to generate perhaps two four-ship waves per day on a sustained basis, this would likely have to be the primary mission focus for training, exercises and operational deployments. Not every air force in NATO needs to specialise in SEAD/DEAD to unlock the problem set of how to regenerate a viable and credible airpower posture to deter Russian military aggression in the medium term. However, with the US ever more overstretched trying to deter burgeoning Chinese capabilities in the Indo-Pacific, it is not a discretionary requirement for at least some of Europe’s air forces to step up to the task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a viable European SEAD/DEAD capability is not regenerated at scale, European NATO states will be unable to establish control of the air in any scenario where the US is either unable or unwilling to commit major resources to doing so itself. This is not simply an issue for deterring Russian forces, but also for maintaining military options against near-peer states such as Iran, or even a state such as Algeria, which fields modern air defence systems at scale. The alternative to regenerating SEAD/DEAD capacity is a requirement to regenerate massed infantry, artillery and armoured forces to beat the Russians at their own game. This would also mandate procuring massed ammunition stocks and recruiting sufficient personnel to run all the enablers needed to deploy and sustain large land forces where needed. Massed land armies such as those fielded by Russia and Ukraine also imply the acceptance of far greater casualties in any war than the current airpower-heavy Western model. Therefore, while regenerating viable SEAD/DEAD capacity at scale is an expensive task, the alternative is far more expensive and more politically problematic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the early years of the Second World War, the Western way of warfare has relied heavily on the precision, reach and sheer lethality of airpower for its warfighting and deterrence credibility. This has brought a wide range of advantages, not least the ability to retain military overmatch sufficient to deter or defeat most potential and actual adversaries without having to field massed land armies optimised for high-casualty, massed firepower battles of attrition as seen in Ukraine since February 2022. In short, the ability to rapidly establish and exploit air superiority has allowed NATO to be the pre-eminent military alliance in the world since at least the 1980s with comparatively efficient and small standing military forces. However, lacking any serious challenge to its air superiority in discretionary conflicts since 1991, most NATO air forces have allowed their warfighting credibility against peer threats such as Russia and China to atrophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The platforms remain, for the most part, highly capable individually. However, the number of bases has been dramatically reduced and, in many cases, the hardening measures at the remaining main operating bases are either inadequate to house the squadrons now stationed there or have been demolished to make way for non-hardened buildings and open hardstands and sun shelters. GBAD capabilities have been retired and/or only replaced in small numbers in many countries. Meanwhile, expensive but resilient networks of dispersal bases, and regular exercises and the maintenance arrangements and equipment required to credibly use them, have been dropped in the name of efficiency savings. It is worth noting that war is an inherently highly inefficient business, and an area where layers of redundancy are essential for credible capability, especially in a peer conflict. These factors mean that the threat posed by Russian long-range missile capabilities is serious, and the survivability of NATO combat air platforms in the air is not matched by their survivability on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the air, flying hours are lower than ever in most NATO nations. While modern simulators can compensate for or even improve on live flying training for some advanced threats and tactics, synthetic training does not exercise or test the whole air force and cannot realistically account for real world risks and weather conditions. Furthermore, the capacity is simply not there in most NATO air forces to ‘add’ serious training at scale for warfighting mission sets to existing deployments, operational commitments and exercise schedules. Training and maintaining the aircrew skills, especially tactical leadership skills, as embodied by weapons instructors, is just as vital for credible warfighting capabilities as having the right aircraft and weapons. However, generating and sustaining such talent requires not burning people out so that they leave after one or two front line tours, and giving them sufficient high-quality live and synthetic training hours to develop and maintain the required skills and deep tactical knowledge. Flying enough of the right sort of training hours requires additional operational funding for engineering capacity and spare parts availability for jets. However, in many heavily tasked NATO air forces it also requires both senior air force commanders and political leaders to significantly reduce ongoing discretionary taskings, such as legacy counterterrorism, or diplomatic and industrial influence deployments, to free up force capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another key issue that needs urgent attention if European NATO air forces are to regenerate warfighting credibility is munitions stocks. It is not simply that the invasion of Ukraine has served as a stark reminder of the scale of munitions expenditure required to stop a determined Russian (or Chinese) military force; it has also shown that many of the existing weapon types developed and purchased for operations in permissive air environments are not relevant in contested airspace. The SEAD/DEAD mission is non-discretionary for achieving air superiority over not only Russian or Chinese forces in a contested area, but also against near-peer or sub-peer states with moderately advanced GBAD capabilities. The dedicated munitions required to allow even advanced aircraft like the F-35 to engage modern mobile SAM systems sustainably, with a high probability of kill, are expensive. To enable non-stealth platforms to either provide supporting fires for F-35 and other penetrating assets from a safer distance or engage themselves, these weapons must have not only the terminal seeker performance to find and strike the target without direct designation, but also significantly greater standoff range. All these requirements can be met, but cost per munition is correspondingly high, and tactics and therefore training to use them effectively must also be developed and regularly practised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that the way that Western military forces have been sized, equipped and organised to fight as a joint force requires air superiority to be achieved relatively quickly to defeat peer or near-peer opponents. Russia will remain an adversary of the West for the foreseeable future and is likely to continue to rearm and rebuild large-scale conventional forces once the fighting in Ukraine ceases. China has a great deal to gain from helping Russia rearm, in terms of splitting US and European resources and attention to prevent full concentration on the Indo-Pacific, and so is likely to do so once there is some form of ceasefire in Ukraine. The same Chinese threat means that the US will be able to spare fewer and fewer military assets to reinforce Europe in a crisis, especially if such a crisis is timed to coincide with a conflict in the Indo-Pacific. Therefore, European NATO air forces must take steps to urgently regenerate the credible capability to achieve air superiority over an area contested by Russian forces; medium-term deterrence requires it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing this will require reducing the vulnerability of air forces on the ground to long-range precision fires, refocusing aircrew and whole force training on warfighting mission readiness, and acquiring the specialised weapon stocks and skills sets to prosecute a SEAD/DEAD campaign at scale. The cost, and opportunity costs in terms of discretionary capability sets and commitments, will be considerable. But if NATO’s European air forces cannot credibly gain and exploit control of the air in the event of a conflict with their most likely non-discretionary threat actor, then they are not fit for purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August 2021, several Ukrainian officers relayed concerns about ‘corruption, incompetence, alcoholism, and idiocy’ in their military. However, when we followed up with these same officers this past month, they made clear that these ‘Soviet problems’ are mostly gone because ‘we’re now in a very serious business, a major war. This environment means responsibility and welcomes initiative’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The approaching anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine means observers are taking stock of the first 12 months of fighting. While battlefield actions certainly warrant in-depth analysis, it is developments away from the front lines – especially regarding Western military assistance – that might eventually tip the balance in the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kyiv is acknowledging the harsh reality of its dependence on Western governments for next-generation weapon systems as it exhausts Soviet-era stocks. One top Ukrainian presidential advisor recently commented that ‘indecision’ over sending extra weapons is ‘killing more of our people’. Similarly, though, concerns about the West not doing enough before the Russian invasion were also expressed by retired British Lieutenant Colonel Glen Grant, who complained about Canadian military assistance only consisting of medical training and ‘defensive stuff’ as ‘Canada didn’t want to be seen to be helping anybody to kill anybody’. In fact, one Canadian officer interviewed in Kyiv in August 2021 by our team was frustrated by Ottawa imposing restrictive rules of engagement when it came to advising Ukrainian personnel on cyber and information operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprise visits to London, Paris and Brussels on 8–10 February 2023 by President Volodymyr Zelensky rallied European countries to maintain support and aid for Ukraine. In Paris, he said weapons from ‘France and Germany have the potential to be game changers … The sooner we get heavy long-range weapons and our pilots get modern planes … the quicker this Russian aggression will end’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How has the Western effort to train and equip the Armed Forces of Ukraine fared in year one? What were the main roadblocks to getting advanced equipment into the hands of Ukrainian soldiers? What have been the major successes, and what might we expect from additional military assistance in the future?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After dozens of interviews with Western military advisors and Ukrainian personnel over the last two years, we contend that Ukraine is reaching a critical point as Soviet weapons, ammo, armour, vehicles and aircraft are exhausted. Western capitals will need to deftly manage the provision of Western armaments and improve unity of effort in advising and training the Ukrainian Armed Forces in an effective and sustainable way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-good&quot;&gt;The Good&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Success in repelling Russia’s invasion reflects years of preparation and assistance, political and military leadership, and the skill and bravery of the Ukrainian people. Without the willpower of Ukrainians resisting Vladimir Putin’s invasion and defending their country, Western capitals would likely be deploying even more forces to the eastern flank of NATO than they are already. Fortunately, Western efforts to build Ukrainian citizen resilience and resistance prior to Russia’s invasion ensured that many Ukrainians found innovative ways of opposing Russian troops, while enabling partisan and Ukrainian special operations units to ambush Russian forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supporters of Ukraine’s war effort have much to be proud of over the past year. Despite dire predictions, Ukraine’s military has fought admirably against the Kremlin’s renewed and expanded invasion. Moreover, informal security assistance to Ukrainian troops through NGOs, civil society, and backchannel communications via Western military personnel has ensured that frontline forces have received proper equipment, intelligence and tactical advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;manoeuvre-firepower-protection&quot;&gt;Manoeuvre, Firepower, Protection&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Russia’s 2022 invasion, the West has collectively provided over $48.5 billion in security aid to Ukraine, per the Kiel Institute. According to the Russian news agency TASS, this ‘nearly equals Russia’s 2022 defense budget’. The US has led the bulk of the effort to arm and equip the Ukrainians with advanced weapons, technology and intelligence. The US has provided over $27.1 billion in military aid to Ukraine and trained over 3,100 Ukrainian military personnel in 2022. With the approval of collective combined arms training for Ukrainian battalions in December, that number is sure to grow quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Success in repelling Russia’s invasion reflects years of preparation and assistance, political and military leadership, and the skill and bravery of the Ukrainian people&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other Western countries have made important contributions too. For instance, the UK was the first country to pledge Challenger main battle tanks (MBTs), giving many Western capitals political cover to pledge their own MBTs. Even Berlin and Washington agreed to send their top tracks, but only after Germany made the transfer contingent on the US sending Abrams. Additionally, the UK leads Operation Interflex (composed of trainers and advisors from Western militaries), and trained approximately 10,000 Ukrainians in 2022. Between 2015 and early 2022, the precursor Operation Orbital trained over 22,000 Ukrainian personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While France only coached 40 Ukrainian troops on its soil in 2022, French leaders have pivoted towards training 2,000 Ukrainians and have proposed teaching Ukrainian fighter pilots as well. This decision came after an announcement from the Netherlands on 20 January 2023 offering about 60 F-16s to Ukraine. On 10 February 2023, Ukrainian officials formally requested the transfer of Dutch F-16s to their military, but the success of this transfer and its impact on the Ukrainian Air Force hinges on two aspects. First, the US would have to approve the export and transfer of F-16s to Ukraine. Second, the necessary pilot and ground personnel to fly and maintain F-16s would require training in the US. The logic and pattern of Western security assistance over the last year suggests that President Joe Biden’s ‘No’ to Ukraine receiving F-16s will likely become a ‘Yes’ as the rest of NATO pledges and commits to the next level of escalation by providing Western aircraft and training Ukrainian fighter pilots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding even more international weight to the training effort, the EU recently announced an expanded military assistance programme for Ukraine. With operational headquarters in Germany and Poland, the new organisation – the EU Military Assistance Mission in Support of Ukraine (EUMAM Ukraine) – is slated to train up to 30,000 troops, including crews for the pledged European tanks. All told, 26 member states have offered to either help staff the mission or provide training modules to the Ukrainians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;leadership&quot;&gt;Leadership&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it isn’t just weapons and training that have made the difference. Structural reforms in the Ukrainian military have also borne fruit. Following Russia’s 2014 invasion, then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko directed sweeping changes to the military, requesting Western advisers to help implement the reforms and reach NATO standards by 2020. The resulting effort led to a fledgling Ukrainian NCO corps and, relatedly, increased emphasis on junior leader initiative. The post-2014 reforms also drove the creation of the Ukrainian Special Operations Forces (SOF) and the establishment of a mechanism to rapidly enlist civilians into territorial defence forces. In the early weeks and months of Russia’s expanded invasion last year, both the SOF and the territorial defence forces played vital roles in Kyiv’s resistance. The value of Ukrainian territorial defence forces cannot be underestimated, as our interviews indicate these personnel are highly motivated to defend their country and spend their own money to procure weapons and gear to be on par with the Ukrainian SOF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;targeting&quot;&gt;Targeting&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although not widely acknowledged by US policymakers, growing evidence suggests that the US and European countries have provided targeting assistance to the Ukrainian military, contributing to the spectacular campaign against senior Russian commanders earlier in the war. Reports from this month go so far as to say that the US either provides or confirms the coordinates ‘on the majority of strikes’ launched by Ukrainian HIMARS units against Russian forces. Ostensibly, this is to ensure that limited ammunition stockpiles are used to maximum effect. More importantly, though, the process created between Ukrainian frontline units and US intelligence targeting centres creates trust between the two countries that may lay the groundwork for the approval of longer-range weapons in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-bad&quot;&gt;The Bad&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite impressive achievements, Western military assistance is still often ad-hoc and disorganised. Western trainers quickly stood up new organisations, such as Security Assistance Group-Ukraine (SAG-U) and EUMAM, solely focused on military assistance. Another organisation, Joint Multinational Training Group – Ukraine, was hastily relocated from Ukraine to Germany in the days prior to Russia’s full-scale invasion, forcing trainers to restart instruction all over again in a new country. One US planner likened the effort to ‘building the plane while in flight’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western planners seem to recognise the need for standardisation, with one staff officer telling us that many of the states involved in Ukrainian training have agreed to standardise their programmes of instruction (POI). Instead of each country training Ukrainian units in its own style, standardised POIs will help create uniform capabilities across Kyiv’s security forces. Thus, if a Ukrainian completes basic training (or any other type of training) in the UK, Germany or Poland, the result would be the same. Even more encouraging is the fact that Western planners have made strides toward aligning the training of entire Ukrainian Armed Forces (UAF) brigades, meaning individual companies can be trained throughout Europe, but then come together as brigade tactical groups and UAF brigades ready to fight after undergoing collective training. The push towards standardisation and unity of effort is designed to eliminate ‘assistance fratricide’ and to get all partners on the same path toward the same goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early in the war, Western planners were caught in the tyranny of now, unable to address Ukraine’s long-term security needs due to the acute threat posed by Russia’s expanded invasion. That too seems to be changing. In January, Western planners held their first planning conference to prioritise training based on the advice and requests of the Ukrainians themselves. Staffers tell us these meetings are now expected every six weeks or so, with the next one taking place in March. Each meeting will enable greater unity of effort and more efficient use of resources to maximise the training of the UAF against Russian forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-ugly&quot;&gt;The Ugly&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;public-infighting&quot;&gt;Public Infighting&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to military assistance, few things are more painful to watch than allies arguing over the details in public. Yet that is what has repeatedly happened over the past 12 months. Recently, the point of friction between allies has centred on the pace of aid and overall strategy. Visiting Washington in January, UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly argued that it would be possible for Ukraine to score a victory this year if the allies move fast to exploit Russia’s vulnerability. US policymakers, however, pushed back, arguing that it is critical to pace the aid and not overwhelm Kyiv with resources that it cannot put to full use. One of the more egregious splits occurred last month after German Chancellor Olaf Scholz initially refused to send Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine. After deliberations with the US, Germany eventually agreed to send the tanks, but only after the US committed to sending its own Abrams MBT to the front lines. It remains to be seen when Ukraine will receive Abrams because the Biden administration is using the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) fund. USAI money will have to be spent on buying Abrams directly from factories, meaning that it will take months to produce export Abrams for Ukraine; alternatively, the US might have used this as a stalling action, as Taiwan and Poland are also expecting deliveries of Abrams over the next three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;western-companies-witting-and-unwitting-accomplices&quot;&gt;Western Companies Witting and Unwitting Accomplices&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps some of the more disquieting developments in Western military aid to Ukraine relate to the role played by major corporations. Research from Switzerland’s University of St Gallen recently found that 1,404 EU and G7 companies operated a total of 2,405 subsidiaries in Russia at the time of the expanded invasion. By November 2022, only 9% of these subsidiaries have divested from Russia, calling into question Western willingness to decouple from the Kremlin’s war-making economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;When it comes to military assistance, few things are more painful to watch than allies arguing over the details in public&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few companies have caused more of a stir in the Russo-Ukrainian war than SpaceX. Elon Musk’s aerospace manufacturer earned praise early in the war for speeding Starlink internet terminals into the war-ravaged country. However, just this month, SpaceX announced restrictions for Starlink that would prohibit Ukrainian forces from using the connections in offensive targeting systems like drones. Our interviews with NGOs, such as Blue/Yellow Ukraine, indicate that such blocking of Starlink internet access actually became a problem much earlier, in the summer of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-future&quot;&gt;The Future&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does the future of Western military assistance mean for Ukraine? As an old US saying goes, ‘You cannot push a river’. Everything has its own timing, and security assistance cannot be rushed or delayed because there is a pragmatic need to assist Ukraine without provoking a nuclear response from Russia. Instead of predictions, we offer four questions to guide Western thinking over future military assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;will-putin-escalate&quot;&gt;Will Putin Escalate?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Western capitals deliberate over providing fourth-generation combat aircraft (such as F-16s, Gripens, Typhoons and Rafales) to Ukraine, the US and other leading powers must be ever-cognisant of the impact such assistance will have on Russia. Already, the US is considering the option of re-inserting commandos back into Ukraine to revive ‘control teams’, helping Ukrainian forces and partisans to more effectively fight Russian troops. If the effort to arm the Ukrainians can continue to thread the needle between provoking Putin and improving Ukrainian lethality, Kyiv has a real chance of success in the long term. If, however, continued Western support to Ukraine proves too much for Putin to tolerate and the Kremlin dramatically escalates the invasion, perhaps with tactical nuclear weapons, it is hard to see how there will be any real winners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-are-china-iran-and-north-korea-doing&quot;&gt;What are China, Iran and North Korea Doing?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as the West has buttressed Ukraine against Russia’s onslaught, so too might China, Iran and North Korea – some of the few state actors willing to openly support the Kremlin’s invasion – reinforce Russia’s war effort. Iran and North Korea are providing substantial material assistance to Russian forces, mainly in the form of drones and artillery shells. Although there does not yet appear to be direct Chinese involvement in the war, the Biden administration has identified some Chinese companies as providing non-lethal aid (such as body armour and helmets) to Russia. Xi Jinping’s refusal to condemn Putin’s invasion early in the war does not augur well. Even more troublingly, a recent report from a US think tank found that state-owned Chinese businesses are trading in sensitive technologies with Russia’s defence establishment, including businesses involved in the ongoing invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-do-we-expect-this-to-accomplish&quot;&gt;What Do We Expect This to Accomplish?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Iraq and Afghanistan (and Vietnam a generation before) make clear, training and equipping foreign armies is a fraught endeavour. With Soviet stocks of war matériel becoming more difficult to source for the Ukrainian military, the West will need to shoulder a greater burden of defence production, education and training for the Ukrainian military. Instead of providing aging stocks of Western weapon systems and ammo, at some point, Ukraine will have to receive systems and ammo directly from factories. The inherent tension in this will be its impact on Western military readiness and force postures for potential conflicts and crises elsewhere. This will strain many Western militaries because they will increasingly have to focus on equipping, training and educating Ukrainian military personnel instead of their own. The goal, of course, for Western military advisors will be to achieve sustainability within the Ukrainian military through a ‘train-the-trainers’ approach, where Ukrainian personnel can become proficient enough in certain weapons systems and tactics that they can shoulder the programme of instruction at the institutional level and provide courses to their own forces inside Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;can-transatlantic-unity-and-engagement-be-sustained&quot;&gt;Can Transatlantic Unity and Engagement be Sustained?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With an infrastructure deputy arrested for stealing $400,000 and the discovery of over $1,000,000 in the sofa of a former deputy defence minister, the perception of Ukrainian corruption in Western countries will threaten the future provision of aid. Russian talking points and sociopolitical-information warfare against Western societies focus on undermining domestic support for Ukraine. Hence, Ukrainian leaders should continue political reforms and the outing of corrupt officials, as this liability can be weaponised by Russian propagandists and also by opposition parties in Western countries – leveraging Ukrainian corruption as a talking point to reduce spending and support for Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Moscow and Kyiv appearing on the verge of launching opposing spring offensives, there are no signs of either side letting up any time soon. But as Russia struggles to replenish its losses, Ukraine may have an opportunity to make significant advances, as long as Western partners can send the right assistance at the right time. The question then becomes, have the US and others learned from the past year of military assistance to Ukraine? Only time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，16人否認「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，今（21日）踏入審訊第12天。控方續傳召區諾軒作供，並播放2020年3月戴耀廷與區諾軒就初選召開的首個記者會片段。戴形容立會過半是「大殺傷力憲制武器」，可運用否決權爭取特赦抗爭者及重啟政改等；區諾軒則自稱是「踢唔到波嘅球員」，指勝出功能組別對35+不可或缺，籲業界登記做選民。會上多名時任議員均表示過半失敗將迎來更大打壓，張超雄指若立會過半，共產黨就要學習「尊重返香港人」，否則「相信打壓係以數以倍計嘅力量加諸係香港人身上」；戴耀廷亦形容機會「千載難逢」亦「稍瞬即逝」：「如果我哋今屆唔能夠爭奪到呢個機會，相信中共專制政權一定會做好多功夫，去封殺晒未來嘅可能性。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，列席認罪被告自區諾軒作供起獲安排於兩個延伸庭就坐，但上周五及昨天均因輪候公眾不足而庭內不設記者席，其中一個被告身處的延伸庭沒有任何公眾獲准入內。法庭今更改做法，安排所有列席被告於設有記者席的2號延伸庭就坐，包括馮達浚、朱凱廸、梁晃維、譚凱邦、岑敖暉、黃之鋒、袁嘉蔚及吳敏兒。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴耀廷會上表示，雖然他們來自民主派光譜不同部分，但「我諗大家都有一個幾強烈嘅共同理念，就係希望能夠立會過半」。戴形容，立會過半是「大殺傷力嘅憲制武器」，可與抗爭運動連結、推動香港改變，包括運用否決財政預算案的權力，爭取特赦抗爭者、向警暴問責、重啟政改爭取雙普選。但戴亦強調如何運用否決權，仍需進一步討論，需時凝聚共識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴表示，望在5個地方直選選區分別爭取「6 6 4 4 3」議席，共23席，並指與區諾軒「做緊好多協調工作……希望能夠將光譜咁闊嘅陣營嘅各方，都能夠大家拉埋一齊」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴又表示，是次機會「千載難逢」但亦「稍瞬即逝（編按：應為「稍縱即逝」或「轉瞬即逝」）」，「如果我哋今屆唔能夠爭奪到呢個機會，相信中共專制政權一定會做好多功夫，去封殺晒未來嘅可能性」，「我哋都要共同揹起唔能夠過半帶嚟嘅後果」。他又指，立會過半「唔會改變到宜家制度嘅本質，但會加大反制專制政權嘅力量，從而有打破而家困局嘅契機」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒在會上形容，自己是「踢唔到波嘅球員」，庭上面朝被告席上方大屏幕的區諾軒微微笑了一下。區強調，「喺立法會35+過半嘅戰役上面，功能組別嘅勝出係必要條件，係不可或缺」，籲所有公司都必須登記做選民，「唔理你係白公司定黑公司，總之登記到選民就係好公司。」他又指，《基本法》23條將至，政府亦以「殖民惡法」拘捕時任中西區區議會主席鄭麗琼，指立會過半「正正就係要話畀無論係中共定香港政府聽，我哋係唔要一個咁差嘅香港」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;時任工黨立法會議員張超雄則表示，若立會過半，便可由民主派出任主席，掌握「直接左右政府運作」的權力，又指《基本法》列明兩次否決財政預算案可令特首解散立法會及下台，故立法會並非無權，「只要攞到立法會過半，共產黨就需要學習點樣同香港人相處，點樣尊重返香港人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張又指，只望維持香港核心價值，「要中央要政府兌現返佢哋喺《基本法》對香港人嘅承諾」，而這場立會之戰「只許勝，不許敗」，因眼見政府對區議會、整個反送中運動、及對年輕一輩的打壓，如民主派在立會選舉失敗，「我相信呢個打壓係以數以倍計嘅力量加諸係香港人身上。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;會上亦提到各區區議會主席協助協調，沙田區議會主席程張迎指民主派未能過半或面對更嚴厲打壓，故「義不容辭」接受戴耀廷邀請協助新界東協調工作，籲各派開心見誠和開誠布公討論協調機制。公民黨東區區議會主席黎志強亦指民主派無分裂的本錢，今次「唔成功真係成仁，佢哋嘅打壓會越嚟越犀利」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;片段播畢後，區確認該記者會於日間舉行，而港島區協調會議在同日晚上舉行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李予信稱香港無法治可言-但不放棄對法治追求&quot;&gt;李予信稱香港無法治可言 但不放棄對法治追求&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今早亦播放餘下的超級區議會初選論壇片段，王百羽問李予信「《國安法》下法治係咪死咗？」，李指「我必須好鄭重咁講，喺《國安法》底下，香港已經冇法治可言」，但指問題是「我哋係咪要放棄對法治嘅追求，我會即刻話，一定唔係，我哋香港係需要法治」，最後表示「香港人頂住，我哋一定要一齊贏，五大訴求，缺一不可」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;岑敖暉則強調，在DQ和《國安法》下，即使達到35+，也不認為否決財政預算案會發生，亦不認為政府會因此回應五大訴求，重申35+是要為港人創造破局機會；王百羽亦表示35+甚至40+是「海市蜃樓」，認為要為最壞情況打算，要有全力抗爭的候選人入議會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;有被告需醫療診治-11天審訊改半日聆訊&quot;&gt;有被告需醫療診治 11天審訊改半日聆訊&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，早前辯方為受傷的吳政亨申請缺席聆訊進行物理治療，法官陳慶偉今表示因被告需醫療診治，審訊期間有11天將改為半日聆訊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大律師石書銘今早亦提出，望控方說明串謀於何時開始，及各被告於何時加入串謀，指相關議題並未在開案陳詞提及，法官陳慶偉着他與控方商量。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/23ro3BA.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，16人否認「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，今（21日）踏入審訊第12天。控方續傳召區諾軒作供，並播放2020年3月公民黨記者會片段，時任黨魁楊岳橋承諾若政府不回應五大訴求，將否決政府每個法案、撥款和財政預算案，令行政長官解散立法會及辭職。今早已播放首次初選記招片段的控方，其後欲再播放另一條初選記招片段，惟遭法官多番追問播放目的。法官陳慶偉不耐煩指，若控方在播放片段後只是問3、4條問題，播片根本沒有意義，「我們不是來浪費時間看不相關的片段」；法官李運騰亦質疑，若片段「對法庭沒有幫助，亦無助控方案情，我們為什麼需要看？」；法官陳仲衡則打比喻，指他們就像餐廳內飢餓的客人，但控方現時只是將所有原材料放在桌上，而不是呈上煮好的菜餚。控方終沒有播放該片段。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指清楚控方引共謀者原則範圍之前-拒承認影片&quot;&gt;辯方指清楚控方引「共謀者原則」範圍之前 拒承認影片&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方自上周四下午開始完整播放5條選舉論壇片段，並於今早播放2020年3月、長52分鐘的首次初選記者會片段，播畢後要求區確認他是否其中一名參加者，以及片段內容是否與他印象中一致，區確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後指出，公民黨曾於該記招前一日，於3月25日舉行記者會，區記得，並指據他所知，沒有公民黨成員曾在記招前與他或其他初選組織者提及相關事宜。控方其後欲播放該片段，指由於林卓廷和黃碧雲兩名被告未能承認片段，故要求區諾軒認出參加者，但在法官詢問下確認區沒有出席該記者會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表二人的大律師沈士文回應，該段影片嚴格上與他的當事人無關，但當不清楚控方引用「共謀者原則」的範圍和程度時，他們未能承認一些他們不清楚的東西。沈又指，不反對影片以臨時證物形式播放，若得悉控方不會以此片段指證其當事人時，便不會爭議影片真實性，並強調控方一日不澄清對共謀者原則的立場，同樣問題會一直出現。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;公民黨承諾將否決所有議案及預算案-直至政府回應五大訴求&quot;&gt;公民黨承諾將否決所有議案及預算案 直至政府回應五大訴求&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後播放長36分鐘的公民黨記者會片段，區諾軒確認出席者包括被告鄭達鴻、李予信、楊岳橋、郭家麒、譚文豪，以及林瑞華、郭榮鏗和梁家傑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;時任公民黨黨魁楊岳橋於會上表示，公民黨響應民主派爭取35+的大目標，亦有責任促成該目標。他承諾，若政府不回應五大訴求，公民黨將否決政府「每一個法案，每一個財政撥款」，亦會「義無反顧」否決預算案，令行政長官解散立法會重選及辭職，形容是「莊嚴嘅承諾」。他又指這不是「攬炒」，一切視乎林鄭月娥如何回應港人訴求，若林鄭不聽民意，「攬炒嗰個係林鄭月娥。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到中聯辦主任駱惠寧曾批評爭取立會過半是「奪權」，楊不認同，指中共若切實執行《基本法》高度自治、港人治港，「權喺香港人嘅手裏面，奪咩權呀？」、「呢個永遠都係建制派嘅咩？」，強調《基本法》賦予立法會制衡及監督的權力，他們只是將憲制責任發揮出來。法律界郭榮鏗亦批評，駱惠寧「完全冇民主社會嗰種胸襟，只有極權社會嗰種鬥爭思維」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭家麒也表示政府要回應五大訴求的民意；譚文豪亦強調政府若沒有落實五大訴求，將「否決晒所有法案，否決晒所有撥款直至回應」：「你問我下一步會繼續點，就係繼續否決。佢搵邊一個特首上嚟，佢一日唔落實五大訴求，我哋一日反對落去。」公民黨主席梁家傑則表示，知道戴耀廷和區諾軒牽頭進行民間討論，公民黨會義無反顧支持民間協調，一定會服膺機制，絕不會「輸打贏要」。李予信在會上則沒有發言。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方欲播初選介紹記者會-官質疑浪費時間&quot;&gt;控方欲播初選介紹記者會 官質疑浪費時間&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方播放公民黨記者會片段後，沒有作任何追問，便提及戴耀廷於兩次記者會前的2020年3月21日，曾於《蘋果日報》刊登〈立會過半是大殺傷力憲制武器〉一文，區確認，並確認於2020年6月9日，與戴耀廷、趙家賢、鍾錦麟及數名區議會主席舉行記者會，介紹35+初選計劃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後欲播放該記招片段，惟法官陳慶偉即問及播放目的。周天行在法官多次追問下，指證人觀看片段後，控方會就記招的安排發問及就錄音謄本的內容作出澄清，亦會要求他確認影片的真實性。惟陳慶偉指似乎沒有人挑戰影片真實性，並多次問：「讓我們看這些片段有什麼目的？」、「你想證明什麼？」，又不耐煩指：「我不想浪費時間看一些不知道有多長的片段，如最終你只是要問3、4條問題，看這些片段根本毫無意義，我們不是來浪費時間看不相關的片段。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡着周天行直接問問題，如證人有需要才播放相關部分。法官李運騰亦要求控方善用法庭時間，提醒控方呈上的證據不一定有助確立其指控，而若控方呈上的片段對法庭沒有幫助，亦無助控方案情，「我們為什麼需要看？」，着控方要謹記這點。陳仲衡亦補充，他們就像餐廳上飢餓的客人，但控方現時只是將所有原材料放在桌上，而不是為他們呈上煮好的菜餚（“Me and my brother judges are like hungry customers in a restaurant, but instead of presenting us the dishes, you put all the raw materials on the table for us.”）。控方回應，因林卓廷和黃碧雲爭議影片真實性，亦望證人能依據脈絡觀看片段，但法官指大律師沈士文已表明其立場。控方終沒有播放片段，轉為就區諾軒的文件發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/RXOeO7T.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，16人否認「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，今（21日）踏入審訊第12天。控方續傳召區諾軒作供，提及戴耀廷曾向初選組織者發出各地方選區的協調機制文件，內容包括「積極運用《基本法》權力否決財政預算案」，惟戴在其後的記者會上指參與初選者毋須簽署協議，引來不少批評，鄒家成等人亦發起「墨落無悔」聲明書，質疑拒簽聲明者可無視共識。區諾軒其後發文澄清，指「就算沒有一份文件出台，但協調的協議實然存在」，又形容戴「出於善心，不想徒添暴政羅織罪名」。他今解釋，當時憂慮發布文件會令候選人被取消資格或觸犯《選舉條例》，「因為我哋就算搞初選都好，基本嘅倫理係唔應該讓到參加者犯法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷記者會稱毋須簽協議-翌日鄒家成等發起墨落無悔&quot;&gt;戴耀廷記者會稱毋須簽協議 翌日鄒家成等發起「墨落無悔」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今早完整播放長52分鐘的首次初選記者會片段，及長36分鐘的公民黨記者會片段，惟下午欲再播放另一條初選記者會片段時遭官質疑浪費時間，遂改就區諾軒的文件發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示所有從區諾軒電腦及 Facebook 擷取的文件，區確認當中包括在各區協調會議傳閱、早前供稱由戴耀廷準備的「35+計劃」文件，指「第一次（協調）會議我有份睇到呢個內容」。文件列表亦包括由戴耀廷發送的香港島及九龍西的協調機制初稿文件、區諾軒製作並發給初選參加者的「35+民主派協調機制時間表」，及區製作的初選論壇文件等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後展示區諾軒的 Facebook 帖文，包括2020年6月19日發布的〈以正視聽——假如我有資格回應抗爭派立場聲明書發起人〉一文，內文提及三位抗爭派立場聲明書發起人公開表示：「是否代表部分拒絕簽署聲明書的參選人可以無視我們早前的共識，甚至無視初選的結果？」區在文中表示作為參與過協調的個人，有幾點作澄清。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒解釋，在2020年6月9日的初選記者會上，戴耀廷曾提及協調會議上有一個協議，但沒有要求參與者簽署，其後於記者會翌日，鄒家成、張可森和梁晃維便於網上發起一份「墨落無悔 堅定抗爭 抗爭派立場聲明書」，他撰文是嘗試說服幾名發起聲明書的人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區戴曾發各選區協調機制文件-參與者毋須簽署&quot;&gt;區：戴曾發各選區協調機制文件 參與者毋須簽署&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續引區諾軒文中頭兩點澄清：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;由始至終，就算沒有一份文件出台，但協調的協議實然存在，只是當日記者會沒有公開。沒有公開，不等於參與過的人沒有承諾遵守。諸如五大訴求、怎樣停止選舉工程、否決財政預算案，如果協議沒有約束力，那多次會議得來的共識，便毫無意義。&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;或許我可以承認，當初記者會戴耀廷教授出於善心，不想徒添暴政羅織罪名，不但無法如願，而且受到很多批評。事後他逐個致歉，懇求所有人諒解，強調聯合確立承諾是大家自行決定，無論如何都尊重，就此，請把所有責任怪到主辦單位，作為民主派，最不希望參與者將責任歸咎其他參與者，產生不信任。&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區在主問下表示，文中「多次會議」是指各區的協調會議，而「協議」是指各區協調會議後所擬定的地方選區協調機制文件，當中提及「五大訴求、怎樣停止選舉工程、否決財政預算案」等內容，並有「積極運用《基本法》權力否決財政預算案」的字眼，區形容文件是「嘗試總結各區傾出嚟嘅共識」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區指，該文件是戴耀廷於6月9日記者會前「忽然」發送予各組織者，但不肯定是否有全部發送予其他參與者，該文件亦沒有公開。區又確認，當時除了超級區議會界別外，每個地方選區均有一份協調機制文件，換言之有5份協議；而據6月9日的記者會，參加者毋須簽署任何文件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒憂發布文件致取消資格或犯法&quot;&gt;區諾軒：憂發布文件致取消資格或犯法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指，戴耀廷在記者會表示毋需簽署文件後，受到一定程度批評，並「不斷地搵唔同嘅人致歉」。被問到指戴「出於善心」、不欲「羅織罪名」的意思，他指當時憂慮若發布一份文件，或會導致候選人被取消資格，因當時有輿論指「任何人如果就住否決預算案表達睇法，會有機會被指唔尊重《基本法》」，增加無法參選的風險；他們亦擔心若每區候選人表明因某些決定而不參選，或會被視為阻止人參選，而觸犯《選舉(舞弊及非法行為)條例》。區強調：「因為我哋就算搞初選都好，基本嘅倫理係唔應該讓到參加者犯法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;長毛要求如廁-官指不能在被告缺席下審訊-提早休庭&quot;&gt;長毛要求如廁 官指不能在被告缺席下審訊 提早休庭&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡續問，區諾軒指有5份協議，是否每區文件均有「積極運用《基本法》權力否決財政預算案」的字眼，區指「我嘅表述會有啲複雜，請耐心聽一聽我講」。惟此時梁國雄舉手表示欲去洗手間，法官遂下令散庭。梁國雄一度以英文表示，自己的律師在庭內，「你不需要休庭」，惟法官陳慶偉指：「我們不能在你缺席的情況下繼續審訊，即使你想，我也不可以。」案件遂提早於下午約4時15分休庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，連日來吳政亨均在審訊途中表示要求小休讓被告如廁，其代表大律師石書銘今午休後表示，那是被告之間的安排，如有人想如廁會透過吳來傳達。法官陳慶偉笑指知道並非吳個人要求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;由於有被告明早有醫療預約，案件明午續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件編號：HCCC69/2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;列席認罪被告全於延伸庭被告欄就坐&quot;&gt;列席認罪被告全於延伸庭被告欄就坐&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表包括資深大律師潘熙、大律師沈士文、張耀良、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等，本身是大律師的劉偉聰則自辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪被告包括獲准保釋的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信10人，及還柙的何桂藍、吳政亨、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及余慧明6人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;列席認罪被告包括馮達浚、朱凱廸、梁晃維、譚凱邦、岑敖暉、黃之鋒、袁嘉蔚及吳敏兒。列席被告自區諾軒作供起，獲安排於兩個延伸庭就坐，但上周五及昨天均因輪候公眾不足而庭內不設記者席，其中一個被告身處的延伸庭沒有任何公眾獲准入內。法庭今更改做法，安排所有列席被告於設有記者席的2號延伸庭就坐。&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>獨媒報導</name></author><summary type="html">庭上播立會過半記者會 張超雄：如成功中共將學習尊重港人 如失敗打壓將以倍計 控方欲再播片官阻止：如將未烹煮的原材料呈予飢餓食客 區諾軒稱憂簽協議致違法或DQ：搞初選唔應該讓參加者犯法</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">【初選47人案・審訊第十一日】</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-02-20-trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-11.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="【初選47人案・審訊第十一日】" /><published>2023-02-20T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2023-02-20T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-11</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-02-20-trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-11.html">&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，16人否認「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，今（20日）踏入審訊第11天。控方上周確認，於初選論壇片段會引用「共謀者原則」舉證，即依賴其他被告言論指證被告。控方今續播放新界東選舉論壇片段，何桂藍的代表大狀要求控方說明依賴其他被告的哪些言論舉證。控方一度指所有被告的言論都是證據，又望於陳詞階段才回應，惟法官李運騰反問「如果他們只說『Hello』，不能成為證據吧？」，又指以為控方開審前應有明確立場。何桂藍大狀亦指現時已是審訊第11天，被告已還柙兩年，「控方真的是說他們並不清楚他們的案情是什麼嗎？」控方終確認會在辯方盤問前交代。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;庭上播放新界東論壇片段，何桂藍表明入立會要奪主導權「破局」，鄒家成亦指要有具「攬炒意志」者入議會。梁國雄提及「《國安法》嚟咗之後，可能我都被控呢個煽動顛覆國家政權罪」，多名被告隨即起哄，梁亦發笑。區諾軒並確認，論壇上「所有環節，包括得罪人嘅環節，都係我設計，我安排」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何桂藍大狀要求控方指出針對被告的證據-控方指不應此階段處理&quot;&gt;何桂藍大狀要求控方指出針對被告的證據 控方指不應此階段處理&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方上周開始播放九龍西、九龍東和香港島的初選論壇片段，並確認會援引「共謀者原則」舉證，即除被告自身的言論外，亦會依賴其他被告的言論指證被告，但未有指出針對各被告的證據，指會在完成控方案情前交代。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 今表示，望控方在播放新界東初選論壇片段前，交代除了何桂藍本人的言論外，還會依賴其他出席者的哪些言論指證她。主控周天行回應，已表明會依賴其他被告的言行（acts and declarations）證明串謀存在。法官李運騰指，法庭並未就此作出裁決，而控方只確認了會引用「共謀者原則」，卻未有說明會依賴其他被告的什麼言論作為指控何桂藍的證據。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行續指，現時只是播片，問是否需於現在處理。李運騰指控方一直都必須說明針對各被告的證據，問題只是現時能否做到，又指以為控方在開審前，應該頗清楚會依賴其他被告的什麼言論作為證據。周天行續指就被告言行，控方有3個進路（routes），惟李運騰打斷指並非要知道控方的進路，而是要說明針對各被告的證據。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方稱所有言論均成證據-官只說hello不能成為證據吧&quot;&gt;控方稱所有言論均成證據 官：只說「Hello」不能成為證據吧？&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行答，基本上所有其他被告的言論都會成為證據。但李運騰指，一定要是促進串謀的言行（acts and declarations in furtherance of a conspiracy）才相關，「如果他們只說『Hello』，這不能成為證據吧？（“If they only say hello, it cannot be evidence against others, isn’t it?”）」有被告和旁聽人士發笑。周天行重申，現時只是舉證階段，認為在陳詞階段指出相關證據會較為合適。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 即指，「現時已是審訊第11天，我的當事人已經還柙兩年，控方真的是說他們不清楚他們的案情是什麼嗎？（“Is the prosecution seriously saying they don’t know what their cases are?”）」周天行反問，是否即在控方證人作供時，控方亦須說明會依賴哪部分證供指證被告，重申應是陳詞階段才提出。但李官不同意，指被告需要知道控方案情，才能決定是否出庭作供或傳召辯方證人。周天行則指已在開案陳詞說明。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方稱盤問前會交代-官指需處理串謀何時開始和被告何時加入&quot;&gt;控方稱盤問前會交代 官指需處理串謀何時開始和被告何時加入&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大律師馬維騉亦有相關關注，堅持控方需在他開始盤問區諾軒前，說明會如何依賴其他被告的言行。周天行終同意會在辯方盤問區前，表明對於「共謀者原則」的立場，即會以論壇上其他被告的什麼言論指證被告。法官陳仲衡一度表示，論壇中每人的發言均需以其他人的言論作為脈絡理解；控方同意，並指在論壇上如果一名被告說話時有其他人在場，他的言論當然可用以指證其他被告。此外，法官陳慶偉和李運騰亦表示，串謀最早於何時開始，及每名被告於何時加入該串謀，是控方將須處理的議題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後播放2020年6月28日新界東初選論壇片段，區諾軒確認參加者包括不認罪的梁國雄、林卓廷、陳志全、鄒家成、何桂藍、柯耀林；認罪的楊岳橋、林景楠、范國威、劉頴匡、呂智恆；被捕但沒被控的李芝融；及沒被控的黎銘澤和李志宏。論壇主持為黃潔慧，嘉賓為李慧玲和桑普。播放片段時，區諾軒不時回頭望旁聽席，又轉身望向被告上方的大屏幕，一時托腮，一時撓手，不時會隨發言內容微微發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何桂藍立法會不再是議事殿堂-除下記者證望破局&quot;&gt;何桂藍：立法會不再是議事殿堂 除下記者證望「破局」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就不認罪被告，前《立場》記者何桂藍表示，「立法會要過半，我哋唔係講緊再投議員入去議事咁簡單，而係要奪取主導權，將立法會變成人民嘅武器，要突破中共 set 畀香港嘅死局，需要最多嘅抗爭派進入議會」，指要「同全香港人一齊抗擊中共極權」，「一息尚存，力戰不降。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到為何要從政而不繼續做記者，何表示在運動中，「相信好多嘅香港人同我有同一樣嘅經歷，就係我哋望住咁多嘅朋友，咁多嘅手足，佢哋付出咗前程人生為代價，去犧牲，咁我都會問番自己，我究竟可以做啲乜嘢？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何認為，「立法會唔再係一個議事嘅殿堂，亦唔只係一個抗爭嘅陣地」，而在極權和政治打壓下，記者未必能完全履行社會責任，「政治制度一日唔變呢，我哋嘅新聞自由係無辨法爭取番嚟，所以我哋必須有人去改變個制度」。她續指，望推動「破局」的議程，「我必須要放低持平嘅身分」，「我必須親身落水嚟說服大家去參與」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒家成批中共為殖民者-稱要具攬炒意志抗爭者&quot;&gt;鄒家成批中共為殖民者 稱要具「攬炒意志」抗爭者&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本土派鄒家成則表示，「我今日參選係因為我要代表香港民族嘅意志，對抗中國殖民。法治已死，制度沉淪，呢一刻，香港需要嘅，唔再係西裝骨骨嘅政客為大家議政，而係需要具備攬炒意志嘅抗爭者為大家衝擊體制，撕下香港政治上最後一塊畫皮」。提到「西裝骨骨嘅政客」時，坐在鄒家成旁的林卓廷向鄒指了指自己，鄒家成點頭回應。鄒又表示他參選目的「非常之旗幟鮮明」，「就係要宣揚香港民族主義，因為要建立一個民族出嚟，我哋先能夠對抗到中華民族嘅入侵」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成論壇上屢批評中共為殖民者：「香港就係面對緊中共殖民者全方位嘅入侵……一國兩制、《基本法》、立法會通通都係精心設計嘅殖民工具，所謂一國兩制就係一個殖民嘅代名詞，所謂五十年不變就係用緊五十年嘅時間將香港殖民到變成一個香港市，呢一本《基本法》已經係一本中共嘅喉舌文件。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒又認為，35+的機會「非常之低」，但重申參選就是要把握該焦點平台，宣揚其理念。但他重申，初選落敗後不會參選立會：「因為呢個墨落無悔係我鄒家成發起嘅，我發得起，我就會兌現呢個承諾」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉頴匡問臭水配方惹笑聲-慢必稱議會抗爭要升級&quot;&gt;劉頴匡問「臭水」配方惹笑聲 慢必稱議會抗爭要升級&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於人民力量主席慢必陳志全則表示，8年前參選立會，源於對傳統民主黨派的不滿，「個個都話議會抗議，唔通個個都有議會抗議咩？」指初選是要獲取最多議席，「亦都係畀大家有機會挑選真正抗爭派嘅議員代表我哋，人民力量過去係走在抗爭最前線，最早，最可靠嘅抗爭力量」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;慢必曾在立法會潑「遺臭萬年水」，認罪的劉頴匡提及自己2018年被DQ後亦試過「開臭魚」作抗爭，問「究竟你有冇得分享下你用嗰個配方係點樣，或者有冇啲特別嘅經驗可以分享下，等我哋第時入到議會都可以學習到呢？」 ，引來哄堂大笑。慢必指「太過 deatil 呢，就真係唔方便講」，但指「議會嘅抗爭真係要升級……你話我去掟呢個遺臭萬年水究竟係成功定係失敗呢，議會抗爭就係要令政府要通過啲惡法或者係撥款嘅時候，難度愈嚟愈高同埋要愈嚟愈樣衰」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;長毛稱國安法後或被控煽動顛覆國家政權-被告起鬨&quot;&gt;長毛稱《國安法》後或被控煽動顛覆國家政權 被告起鬨&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於前立法會議員長毛梁國雄，表示自己過去「推動議會抗爭，發動五區公投，拉布抗惡法、苛政」，亦因公民抗命發起遊行被拘控，指「35+需要堅定嘅抗爭力量」，「要攞一個全面嘅否決權，操諸我手」。有網民問簽署「墨落無悔」的參選人是否會有Plan B，長毛搶答成功，但指「我就冇簽到嗰份抗爭宣言」，旁聽席發笑。梁續解釋不簽是因該聲明「係重複番35+嗰個初衷」，沒有需要簽，又指自己多年任議員，「年年都」否決財政預算案，「咁我覺得即係呢個問題對我嚟講已經唔係問題。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;梁國雄又被李慧玲多番質疑為何仍繼續參選，不予機會年輕人，梁反問：「我畀到㗎咩？係選民決定㗎嘛。我畀咁呀，兄終弟及呀？」，又說「你問嗰啲投票畀我嘅人吖嘛，你問我有乜用啫？」，多名被告和區諾軒亦發笑。李又質疑梁「戀棧權位」，梁回應：「我又覺得你好怪喎，你正話話立場姐姐（何桂藍）嗰陣時就話人哋資歷淺走咗去喎，你真係你啲邏輯喺邊度呢？」，林卓廷笑着向梁豎起拇指，何桂藍亦發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;梁國雄又表示：「其實老實講，《國安法》嚟咗之後，可能我都被控呢個煽動顛覆國家政權罪」，林卓廷、鄒家成等多名被告隨即起哄，梁國雄亦發笑，梁並強調「抗命就無分先後嘅，同心就不分長幼嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;林卓廷批警隊非常不堪指政府派三萬要投贊成票&quot;&gt;林卓廷批警隊非常不堪、指政府派三萬要投贊成票&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於時任民主黨副主席林卓廷，表示「中共粗暴制訂《國安法》，全方面鎮壓香港人。我哋香港人唯有用勇敢、智慧，同埋我哋嘅堅毅，去對抗呢個極權」，又指過去一年，「香港嘅警隊呢真係非常之不堪，無論係6.12、7.21、8.31，我哋都見到警隊呢，係打市民啦、打記者啦、打議員啦、貪贓枉法啦、畀假口供啦、去屈好多我哋嘅年輕人啦。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被質疑在委任張舉能任終審法院首席法官的議案投棄權票，是否並非「全面抗爭」，林稱要視乎「具體嘅議案，具體嘅政策」，又指「如果政府話『每個香港人派三萬蚊』，我覺得一定要投贊成票喎，冇理由留返啲錢畀政府去做大白象工程㗎嘛」，強調不能以一個議案，「就講晒我哋過去咁多年喺議會上面監察個政府，抗衡個政權嘅立場。」林卓廷亦提及，他兩度被控違《權力及特權條例》，批當局限制議會抗爭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;柯耀林議會行動戰線結合-稱要投選有抗爭意志參選人&quot;&gt;柯耀林：議會行動戰線結合 稱要投選有抗爭意志參選人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於時任區政聯盟召集人柯耀林表示，「我哋好希望行動同埋議會係雙結合」，又指會在衝突現場和前線看到其團隊做支持，「我哋好希望係同大家香港人齊上齊落。五大訴求，缺一不可」，並指望初選「大家支持係有抗爭意志嘅參選人 」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;早前庭上曾播放論壇片段，柯耀林被問2018年民主黨新東補選出現紛爭，曾形容林卓廷「人格卑劣」，是否堅持看法，柯答「係」，但若林勝出而他落敗，「我哋會服膺我哋初選簽嗰個協議書，我哋係會支持所有出選初選嘅候選人」，引來被告大笑，林和柯互表歉意。庭上今播放該片段，林卓廷和鄒家成等亦再發笑。片中主持形容是次答問較長，但「可能大家對個題目都有啲興趣，嘉賓亦都好想問」，再引來林卓廷、柯耀林和鄒家成等多名被告大笑，區諾軒亦展露笑意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉頴匡稱完全信任德高望重戴耀廷區諾軒稱35不切實但望本土成主流&quot;&gt;劉頴匡稱完全信任德高望重戴耀廷區諾軒、稱35+不切實但望本土成主流&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於認罪被告，時任民間集會召集人劉頴匡，指過去一直「身體力行」推動遊行、集會、各種街頭抗爭，「喺街頭監察警暴，支援被捕手足」；並強調自己身負暴動罪，「我真係同所有嘅手足係同呼吸，共命運，我希望大家可以投票去支持呢一個政府口中嘅暴徒，讓國際社會知道我哋所有香港人係同呢一班嘅前線手足係從來冇割席」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉又被質疑，2017年新東補選曾指會跟隨民主動力初選，但後來「自己跳出嚟選」。劉指他當年不參加初選因對民動不信任，「但係今次呢一個民主派嘅抗爭，成個初選，我哋係願意完全係信任戴耀廷教授，以及係區諾軒前議員，呢兩位德高望重嘅人物」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉頴匡又坦言，「完全唔覺得35+係一個切實嘅目標嚟」，形容是「天空樓閣」，但認為初選更重要是在「冇篩選，冇DQ」的情況下，「大家去揀一個你哋覺得最值得去畀票佢嘅候選人」，「所以你話35+又好，35-又好，我好希望有堅定投爭意志嘅本土派可以成為主流，帶領香港」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊岳橋稱司法絕對有險可守承諾如有35會運用否決權&quot;&gt;楊岳橋稱司法絕對有險可守、承諾如有35+會運用否決權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於時任公民黨黨魁楊岳橋，屢被重提「dead body」、「案底令人生更精彩」等言論，及質疑他對法治的立場。被問「Dead body 出現先定陳同佳飛台灣自首先」，楊答「Dead body 呢樣嘢跟咗我四年，我亦都明白四年前可能講大咗」，但指作為律師，「過去幾年見證住法治嘅崩塌，係咪就咁一句 dead body，法治無險可守，跟住我哋就行開呢？」。有旁聽人士和何桂藍等發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊又被問及「被DQ是否使人生更精彩」，他回應「DQ只係令DQ你嗰個變得無恥，下流，賤格」，強調「人生是否精彩當然自己各自嘅判斷」，有被告發笑。楊又強調「司法絕對有險可守」，並指「攬炒」是由當權者造成，「無論嗰個係林鄭定係北京嘅當權者，真正做到攬炒嘅只有佢哋」。被問到《國安法》將落實，「你會唔會又 over your dead body 呢？」，楊答：「我會同香港人一齊，係咪 dead body，到時大家先算。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊又表明，公民黨承諾「如果我哋入到去（議會），有35+，我哋就可以運用《基本法》畀我哋嘅否決權」，又指如成功35+，「我哋就能夠有最大嘅力量去畀政府最大嘅壓力，去將一啲佢以前走數唔做嘅嘢呢，可以希望有機會變成事實」。但何桂藍質疑，公民黨「有35+就承諾乜嘢都會做，冇35+就乜都唔承諾」予人「投機」之感。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;呂智恆稱攬炒議會癱瘓暴政范國威表明行使否決權迫政府回應五大訴求&quot;&gt;呂智恆稱攬炒議會癱瘓暴政、范國威表明行使否決權迫政府回應五大訴求&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於社工呂智恆則提及，「會傾其所有去攬炒議會，癱瘓呢個暴政。」被問當選後會否簽署擁護政府和《基本法》的確認書，他表示：「今日割一城，明日割十城。你今次妥協得一次，佢下一次就要你再妥協多另外一次。佢叫你食屎，咁 你係咪去食屎呀？咁我唔會囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;時任新同盟召集人范國威則指，初選是讓選民「為民主派、本土派、素人揀選最強嘅隊伍⋯⋯奪取立法會過半議席，行使憲制否決權，迫使政府回應五大訴求」，又提及今時今日，「入去立法會要有充分嘅心理準備，唔單止係要有足夠嘅抗爭意志，要有經驗，仲要有被控、被捕、坐監、滅黨、被逮捕，呢啲咁嘅心理準備。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;林景楠稱抗爭到最尾-林卓廷等發笑&quot;&gt;林景楠稱抗爭到最尾 林卓廷等發笑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於由不認罪改為認罪、並任控方證人的林景楠，表示原任海關關員的自己，於2015年因參加光復沙田而被政治打壓，後來成為阿布泰創辦人，「點解我依然尚存到而家呢，係因為我會同大家一齊抗爭到最尾」，林卓廷與鄒家成均發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至論壇尾聲，梁國雄表示「唔好食花生，7月1號上街。7月11號、12號投票，收咗一萬蚊，撐手足、撐手足」，林景楠即謂「撐手足嘅話呢，就可以捐6.12或者支持黃色經濟圈，我覺得係好需要嘅」，林卓廷和吳政亨等發笑，在延伸庭的岑敖暉、袁嘉蔚、吳敏兒及譚凱邦亦不禁大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指所有環節包括得罪人環節均由他設計&quot;&gt;區指所有環節包括「得罪人」環節均由他設計&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;播放新界東片段後，周天行問區諾軒，論壇流程是否與他所安排一樣，區邊點頭邊回應：「所有環節，包括得罪人嘅環節，都係我設計，我安排，都係吻合嘅。」至於去過哪次論壇，他則表示：「我唔記得邊次有去，但我有出席大部分嘅論壇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/QGbj2Wo.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，16人否認「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，今（20日）踏入審訊第11天。控方今續播放初選論壇片段，其中法官李運騰留意到新界西所有被告均認罪，問「播放片段有什麼意義？」，控方指因其他被告都是共同串謀者，其言論可證串謀存在，惟在辯方無反對下，終停止播放。庭上其後播放超級區議會片段，其中不認罪的李予信指會在議會和街頭「同大家並肩作戰」；認罪的王百羽則自稱「超區坦克車」，會將「阻住我哋議事嘅垃圾，立法會親中保皇議員，一個一個車出去議事堂」，正庭和延伸庭多名被告大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;新西被告全認罪-官質疑播放片段有什麼意義&quot;&gt;新西被告全認罪 官質疑「播放片段有什麼意義？」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方下午播放2020年7月3日舉行的新界西論壇片段，區諾軒確認出席者為：伍健偉、林進、潘朗聰、朱凱廸、吳敏兒、黃子悅、張可森、郭家麒、吳敏兒，主持為梁家權。其中除林進和潘朗聰沒被控，其餘均是認罪被告，另缺席論壇的尹兆堅亦是認罪被告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;庭上播放各候選人的自我介紹片段後，法官李運騰表示，似乎所有新界西參選人均認罪，周天行確認。李官略顯驚訝，續問：「那播放片段有什麼意義？（“So what’s the point of playing this video?”）」周指因其他被告都是共同串謀者（co-conspirator）。法官陳慶偉問：「So?」周重申該些被告言論可顯示串謀的存在及其程度，惟李運騰指，除非有辯方律師堅持播放，否則不認為應浪費庭上時間觀看。最終在沒有辯方反對下，控方停止播放新界西片段。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李予信指極權滲透要全方位應對議會街頭並肩作戰&quot;&gt;李予信指極權滲透要全方位應對、議會街頭並肩作戰&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後播放2020年7月4日的超級區議會論壇片段，區諾軒確認出席者包括不認罪的李予信、認罪的岑敖暉和王百羽，以及沒有被控的涂謹申和鄺俊宇，主持人為區家麟。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就不認罪的被告，時任公民黨東區區議員李予信表示，作為社工和區議員的他，於6.12一周年時進行人道支援「都要畀黑警濫暴」，又指7月1日見證《國安法》下「警察成為特權階級，繼續去肆意去欺壓我哋嘅自由」，表明「無論喺議會定還是喺街頭，我都會同大家並肩作戰」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李又指，「其實當極權要全方位滲透呢個社會嘅時候，我哋嘅戰場就係要全方位地去應對，無論街頭或者議會」，強調議員要用公共身分指證「黑警」濫捕和不跟法規。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;王百羽自稱超區坦克車-庭上多人大笑&quot;&gt;王百羽自稱「超區坦克車」 庭上多人大笑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於認罪的兩人，時任元朗區議員王百羽，被問到如何懲罰立法會「瞓覺、亂噏同打人」的「保皇黨」時表示：「我可以好大聲咁同大家講，如果當呢啲垃圾嘅議員阻住我喺議會入面議事，甚至乎係做抗爭，我會用我自己嘅身位，超區坦克車，將呢啲咁樣阻住我哋議事嘅垃圾，立法會親中保皇議員，一個一個車出去議事堂，呢個係我對大家嘅承諾。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;王提及「超區坦克車」和「一個一個車出去」時，林卓廷、鄒家成等多名被告發笑，鄭達鴻笑得身體前傾；在延伸庭的岑敖暉、袁嘉蔚、吳敏兒和譚凱邦4人同樣發笑，袁嘉蔚也笑得身體前傾。王其後又指在議會內，「唔會淨係得一架坦克車，我哋會見到好多架坦克車」，嘉賓問他是否「建議大家都一齊增磅」，王表示會建議「健康地增磅，唔好令到自己高血壓、高膽固醇、高脂肪咁樣」，余慧明等多名被告再發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;王百羽又表示，「35+或者35-，我哋都要有相應嘅應對，如果係35-嘅話……我哋要做嘅就係要全面抗爭，响個議會入面，用我哋嘅肢體衝突去阻止惡法通過。」被問《國安法》後如何「反守為攻」，他則指現時「光復香港，時代革命」口號已不准講，可能以後「五大訴求，缺一不可」也不能講，「但係我都想話畀大家聽，呢啲恐懼係唔需要自己一個人去孭嘅，呢啲恐懼係我哋香港人一齊去面對。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;岑敖暉不信35能落實五大訴求-稱極權下議會戰線可爭取破局&quot;&gt;岑敖暉不信35+能落實五大訴求 稱極權下議會戰線可爭取破局&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;時任荃灣區議員岑敖暉則表示，「喺極權底下，議會戰線最大嘅目的就係爭取一個破局嘅機會」，又指「中共用《國安法》去對付香港人，香港人就要喺一切嘅戰線，令到對方都要付出最大嘅政治代價，呢一個係今時今日香港人面對極權，各個戰線嘅意義」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;岑敖暉認為制度內不可能存有任何改變制度的空間：「35+之後會唔會落實五大訴求，我覺得呢一個係冇可能」，亦不認為可改變《警察通例》和查「黑警濫權」，「但係點解我哋仍然要喺議會戰線奮鬥，就係香港人仍然要把握呢個機會」，推動運動延續，「創造一個北京冇可能會接受嘅局面。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;片段播放岑敖暉回答主持問及如何避免犯下學聯的錯誤時，在庭上的岑專注地觀看片段，期間又雙手摸臉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;涂謹申稱有坐監準備-指達到35大把嘢可以玩&quot;&gt;涂謹申稱有坐監準備 指達到35+「大把嘢可以玩」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就沒有被控的民主黨涂謹申和鄺俊宇，涂認為：「如果我哋有35+，大把嘢可以玩！我哋全部主席做晒！除非政府唔夠膽上嚟，我哋好多嘢可以質詢佢！好多嘢令到佢好尷尬！好多嘢令到佢喺全世界面前出醜！……甚至可以通過一啲議案譴責佢（高官）！傳召佢出嚟！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;涂又指在《國安法》下，「去美國訪問都可以坐監，同埋而家嘅起跳係三年、五年同十年」，但「我要發表嘅意見，我就照講，唔可以退縮，唔可以畏懼」。涂又提及要與世界結合，對中共產生最大的國際壓力，並指論壇上回答該問題，「我已經係冒五年、十年嘅監禁，呢個係我預算付出嘅」，「我有坐監嘅準備。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄺俊宇稱惠及基層要投贊成&quot;&gt;鄺俊宇稱惠及基層要投贊成&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄺俊宇則表示，若民主派議席過半，「我哋可以堵截大白象工程，我哋可以幫助窮人基層，我哋可以否決財政預算案」，又指若議案能惠及基層和窮人，「好抱歉，我一定要去幫咗先……呢啲票係要投贊成嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明早續審，將繼續播放超級區議會初選論壇片段。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表包括資深大律師潘熙、大律師沈士文、張耀良、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等，本身是大律師的劉偉聰則自辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪被告包括獲准保釋的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信10人，及還柙的何桂藍、吳政亨、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及余慧明6人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，16人否認「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，今（17日）踏入審訊第10天。控方繼續播放各區初選論壇片段，其中在九龍東選區，6名參加者只有施德來一人不認罪，法官李運騰問及控方播片目的，是僅依賴被告言論作為指控他本人的證據，抑或會使用「共謀者原則」，即同時依賴其他被告的言論作檢控。主控周天行表示會引用「共謀者原則」，但未有指出針對各被告的證據，並指會在完成控方案情前交代。庭上片段中，不認罪施德來表明要入議會「攬炒政府」，認罪的快必譚得志、譚文豪等亦表明要否決財政預算案爭取五大訴求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，列席的認罪被告今續被帶到兩個延伸庭觀看直播，其中岑敖暉、袁嘉蔚、吳敏兒和譚凱邦4人在2號延伸庭，另有被告在1號延伸庭，惟因該庭不設記者席，現場輪候的公眾人數亦不足，最終沒有公眾獲准入內旁聽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒昨就籌辦初選論壇的過程作供，提及戴耀廷提議找《蘋果日報》等媒體合資格作，最終6場論壇均在《蘋果日報》大樓舉辦。控方昨播放九龍西初選論壇片段，區諾軒確認流程與其安排吻合。控方問他會否記起曾否出席該論壇，區說「唔確切，但我有肯定我有出席大部分嘅論壇」，有被告發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今續播放2020年6月26日九龍東初選論壇片段，播片前要求區諾軒認出所有參加者，包括李嘉達、胡志偉、譚文豪、黃之鋒、譚得志和施德來，其中僅施德來為不認罪被告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰在播片前指，留意到九龍東論壇只有施德來是不認罪，並指昨日播放九龍西片段時忘記問控方，播放論壇片段時是否僅依賴被告言論作為指控他本人的證據，抑或會使用「共謀者原則」，即同時依賴其他被告的言論。主控周天行回應，會依賴被告言論指控他本人，至於「共謀者原則」的問題，他一度停下與身旁的主控萬德豪商量，稱稍後回覆。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，控方應在完成控方案情前，對在「共謀者原則」下依賴什麼證據表達清晰的立場，辯方才能作出及時的反對，重申辯方有權知道控方到底會依賴其他被告的什麼言行作檢控，法庭或需就此作裁決。周天行回應會引用「共謀者原則」，並將在案情完結前識別出針對每名被告的證據，讓法庭清楚控方的檢控基礎。代表施德來的大律師表示，當提及該議題時，辯方會及時回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施德來稱要有全面攬炒決心承諾兩次否決預算案&quot;&gt;施德來稱要有「全面攬炒決心」、承諾兩次否決預算案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後播放長74分鐘的九龍東論壇片段，其中施德來指，《國安法》是中共要打壓港人爭取民主自由的決心，直言「共產黨係信唔過嘅」、「今日嘅中共，我哋冇討論嘅空間，冇談判嘅餘地」，「入到議會裏面，我哋大家都要否決財政預算案，大家都要否決政府所有議案，同呢個政府抗爭到底，攬炒呢個政府，因為真正攬炒香港嘅就係林鄭，就係呢一個中共，所以我哋香港人一定要抗爭到底。」施德來邊看片段邊點頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;嘉賓曾志豪問施德來，如前民協主席馮檢基想參選，會向他說什麼，施表示「馮檢基，如果你要選呢，就要參加初選，唔參加初選嘅馮檢基，我會叫佢唔好選」，又指「唔參加初選你肯定唔係35+嘅一員，肯定唔係同路人」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問民協如何擺脫「又傾又砌」的脫節形象，施則重申「今日嘅民協入到議會裏面，我哋一定會兩次否決《財政預算案》，入到議會裏面，今日係要抗爭，唔抗爭嘅就行開」，又表明「35+要一個全面攬炒嘅決心」，最後稱「今日嘅民協同香港人同行，我唔怕DQ，唔怕攬炒，請你重新認識民協，相信民協」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;快必稱入議會衝撞抗爭否決財案癱瘓政府&quot;&gt;快必稱入議會衝撞抗爭、否決財案癱瘓政府&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其餘5名出席者均是認罪被告。其中快必譚得志表示議會需要「更加辣，更加衝撞，更加抗爭」的人，「邊個好打、邊個夠辣嘅就入立法會」，「絕地還拖」；又表明會「兩次否決財政預算案、癱瘓個政府、林鄭柒婆落台，嚟到做 bargaining power，爭取五大訴求，缺一不可」，即使全民派樓、派十萬也反對，有被告發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;快必亦屢提及不認罪被告慢必陳志全，指陳因「遺臭萬年水」而被罰十多萬；又指進入議會不止「打交」，亦要發言、開會要勤力，「陳志全做乜，我就做乜，議會應該要有兩個陳志全，三個甚至乎」，陳志全、鄒家成等聞言發笑，彭卓棋亦望向陳志全。快必又表示議會抗爭暴力與否視乎定義，「最暴力係邊個呀，沒有暴徒只有暴政，共產黨最暴力」，「打倒共產黨，反對《國安法》。」多次搶答成功的快必，亦引來施德來、彭卓棋等發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;胡志偉譚文豪重申否決預算案迫政府落實五大訴求&quot;&gt;胡志偉、譚文豪重申否決預算案迫政府落實五大訴求&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;民主黨主席胡志偉則表示，否決預算案是「最大武器」，有35+政府就必須回應五大訴求。他解釋民主黨不簽署「墨落無悔」聲明，是因參與協調時已經同意「要運用憲制上面賦予立法會嘅否決權，否決《財政預算案》」，並指「所有政府嘅法案，佢剝奪市民嘅人身自由、個人利益、個人意志自由，我哋都一定係會反對」，不過也反問：「起醫院、起學校我哋都要反對咩？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;譚文豪重申公民黨立場，指只要有「35+」，為令五大訴求落實，他們承諾會行使《基本法》權力，「任何嘅政府法案，任何嘅撥款，同埋呢個最緊要嘅財政預算，我哋都會投反對票」，即使解散立法會後亦會再反對，令特首下台。被質疑公民黨在委任終審法院常任法官張舉能議案投下棄權票，他則解釋立法和司法機關一向「河水不犯井水」，法官任命一般不會投反對，又指若投反對票，他日有較開明法官委任，或會打開缺口令「保皇黨」作反對。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黃之鋒稱推動國際線反擊北京-李嘉達指將抗爭帶入立會&quot;&gt;黃之鋒稱推動國際線「反擊北京」 李嘉達指將抗爭帶入立會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃之鋒則表示，明白他會有被DQ的可能，但政府明顯並非只想DQ他，而是想「DQ晒所有反對《國安法》嘅人，甚至DQ晒成個選舉」，並指「面對住被消失、被送中，消滅人身自由嘅狀況，我好希望大家初選一定要出嚟投票，呢一個先係關鍵所在」。他又指除了議會戰線，他一直游說推動《香港人權民主法案》，會守住國際線，「連結世界、反擊北京」。被問其席位應在國際社會，他則指以往到外國游說，會被質疑欠民意授權，故認為初選的民意授權很重要。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李嘉達則表示，進入全民抗爭時代，要「壯大黃色經濟圈，爭取更加多嘅資源投入抗爭」，並「將抗爭帶入立法會」，又指議會抗爭只是其中一條戰線，「攬炒唔係一個手段，唔係一個目標，係一個態度。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，16人否認「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，今（17日）踏入審訊第10天。控方今播放港島區初選論壇片段，其中不認罪的公民黨鄭達鴻屢被質疑對法治的立場，但堅稱「我哋唔會放棄法治」，並指《國安法》由特首「完全委任法官」是「絕對唔可取」，三名指定法官聞言沒有特別反應。發起「墨落無悔」的梁晃維則稱難保證所有人不背叛承諾：「既然大家都認同呢啲概念，咁點解唔能夠係真係做一個公開承諾呢？」至於認罪的時任東區區議員徐子見，形容自己是「好老嘅素人」，被問「點解我唔揀個後生嘅呢，而家抗爭係年輕人嘅事喎？」，徐答「有少少年齡歧視喎」，多名被告大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方稱引用共謀者原則舉證&quot;&gt;控方稱引用「共謀者原則」舉證&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今早表示，就初選論壇片段會引用「共謀者原則」，即依賴其他被告言行指證被告，但未有指出針對各人的證據，會在完成控方案情前交代。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今續播放2020年6月27日的港島初選論壇片段，要求區諾軒認出參加者包括梁晃維、楊雪盈、徐子見、羅冠聰、鄭達鴻、張嘉莉、彭卓棋、許智峯和袁嘉蔚。其中楊雪盈、鄭達鴻和彭卓棋為不認罪被告，許智峯和羅冠聰則已離港，沒有被起訴。論壇主持為區家麟，林彥邦和袁彌明為嘉賓。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄭達鴻稱不會放棄法治批國安法委任法官絕不可取&quot;&gt;鄭達鴻稱不會放棄法治、批《國安法》委任法官絕不可取&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就不認罪的3人，公民黨時任東區區議員鄭達鴻曾表示，「真正去到『35+』，我哋達成議會過半呢……民主派先可以用個選票去迫使行政長官要落實五大訴求」，又指會否決財政預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/LBwLbd6.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
▲ 鄭達鴻&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄭達鴻對法治的立場屢遭質疑，有網民問「法治爛成咁，憑佢點樣光復法治呢？」，又問他是否不敢說「光復香港」。鄭稱他「絕對夠膽講光復香港」，而「光復法治」是每個法律從業員畢生責任，「攞到35+，我哋就可以由制度根本改革，呢個先係光復法治嘅最好方法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭卓棋問鄭達鴻是否認為法治未崩壞，要在制度繼續糾纏，鄭答「我哋唔會放棄法治」，重申一個法律從業員，「佢去到警署見到一個遍體鱗傷嘅手足，佢一定要盡快咁救佢返嚟，呢個先係捍衛法治嘅最好原則。」該環節播放後，彭卓棋傾身向隔一個位的鄭達鴻交談。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;梁晃維亦質疑，「成個法律制度入面，充滿一啲所謂嘅紅官、藍官，藍絲斬人就畀人讚情操高尚，我哋嘅手足、社工，佢哋只不過喺防線面前舉高社工證，叫警察放慢腳步，已經要面臨一年監禁，點解公民黨同埋鄭達鴻你，仲未敢講『法治已死』呢？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;會上亦多次有人質疑，公民黨在委任終審法院常任法官張舉能議案中，有人投下支持和棄權，而非反對票。鄭達鴻表示，負責任命法官的司法人員推薦委員會亦曾委任開明法官來港，要尊重該制度，否則未來可能只是「藍絲嘅法官」獲委任；又指制度本身無問題，有問題是「我哋冇民主去 backup 呢個法治嘅制度」。鄭又指，《國安法》下將由特首「完全委任法官」，「呢個絕對唔可取嘅」，三名指定法官聞言繼續觀看電腦螢幕，沒有特別反應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;彭卓棋稱不惜肢體抗爭-共產黨要我跪我哋係唔會跪&quot;&gt;彭卓棋稱不惜肢體抗爭 「共產黨要我跪，我哋係唔會跪！」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;南區區議員彭卓棋則表示：「我哋面臨國安法壓境，我哋抗拒默沉，面對極權嘅奴隸，我哋吶喊高呼，聲討賣港派、港共派、中間派，仲有袁彌昌。我哋嘅敵人就係共產黨，我哋入到議會不惜以肢體抗爭、癱瘓政府、否決財政預算案，亦會用議員身位支援街頭抗爭」，又指他擁護本土尊嚴價值和反對23條。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭又在最後高呼：「捍自由來齊集這裏，全力抗對，共產黨要我跪，我哋係唔會跪，我哋會全力抗爭，對抗共產黨！」林卓廷聞言發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊雪盈稱連結港人能發光&quot;&gt;楊雪盈稱連結港人能「發光」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;時任灣仔區議會主席楊雪盈被問到「區議會主席都未做好，點解要參選立法會？」，指在其任期已反對《國安法》，而在許多政治事件中，「我哋唔怕民政處嘅打壓」，相信無論在哪個崗位，最緊要是幫到香港人和這場運動，「我相信我哋只要將我哋唔同嘅力量，就住唔同嘅人嘅崗位連結埋一齊，我哋一定可以發光，一定可以照亮更加多嘅地方。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;嘉賓林彥邦其後問「發光」一說「即係咩意思？完全聽唔明」，坐在楊雪盈後方的林卓廷發笑。楊解釋在運動中每人有自己角色和能量，「咁每個人就好似發住光咁樣，就算喺我哋而家政治咁崩壞嘅環境之中，我哋都見到彼此，我哋都可以同大家一齊上」，林彥邦最後再說「其實唔係好明」，庭上的林卓廷和楊雪盈亦再次發笑。惟被問當選會否辭任區議會主席，楊則沒有正面回答。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊雪盈和彭卓棋論壇上亦就區議會事務爭拗，彭卓棋指灣仔區議會防疫包因寫有「武漢肺炎」而無法報銷，批身為主席的楊雪盈沒有諮詢其他議員。楊雪盈回應時二人多次疊聲，彭卓棋批楊「真獨裁就假民主」，又認為楊無正面回答其問題，一度問「補唔補返時畀我呀？」，主持區家麟說「冇㗎」，彭卓棋自己，及林卓廷、柯耀林、陳志全等多人發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊雪盈其後邀請候選人選擇4個名單出選，彭卓棋說「anyone but you」，被告欄多人大笑，片中彭解釋楊在文化界最有機會勝出。而許智峯回應「手足A，手足B，手足C，手足D，所有真香港人都值得入議會」，旁聽席亦傳來笑聲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;梁晃維稱用盡手段抵抗惡法-發起墨落無悔為向選民清晰交代&quot;&gt;梁晃維稱用盡手段抵抗惡法 發起墨落無悔為向選民清晰交代&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於另外認罪的3人，被問到在「35+」議會的抗爭，時任中西區區議員梁晃維表示政權一定會用盡手段DQ參選人，甚至拘捕立法會議員，故會用盡一切可行手段，包括肢體抗爭，令街頭、國際戰線引起更大迴響，「抵抗一切惡法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;梁晃維承認主張香港民族和本土理念，又指「我哋視中國為我哋嘅敵人」，知道中國「一定會用盡佢所有方法繼續壓迫我哋香港人」，「而我哋面對咁嘅壓迫，我哋係一定唔會退讓，我哋一定會再次挺身而出。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問發起「墨落無悔」是否「夾緊其他人」，梁否認，指初選協調會議內容只有戴耀廷和出席者知道，無法保證所有人不會背叛承諾，「如果大家都係承諾咗，或者係都認同呢啲理念嘅話，其實點解唔能夠向住全香港市民做一個公開嘅承諾呢？」。他形容簽聲明是「基本責任」，「向選民交代到底我哋會唔會繼續堅定抗爭」，而若有人有「被夾」的「hard feeling」，可能本身就不同意協議內容。在搶答環節，梁晃維4次搶答成功，主持問「梁晃維撳掣咁快嘅你」，被告欄傳出笑聲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;袁嘉蔚稱要光復議會被問是否羅冠聰plan-b&quot;&gt;袁嘉蔚稱要光復議會、被問是否羅冠聰「Plan B」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;時任南區區議員袁嘉蔚則表示，「議會抗爭唔係單單靠投反對票，係需要一班用盡所有方法抗爭嘅民主派」，而初選是「要為民主派協調最堅實嘅陣容，九月光復議會」，又指要「向極權抗爭」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到是否羅冠聰的「Plan B」，在延伸庭觀看直播的袁嘉蔚即埋頭靠近螢幕，並專注觀看。當袁在片中回應自己是獨立出選時，庭上的她低頭並托眼鏡。其後林彥邦問到每一個民主派是否可完全補上任何位置，袁回答屆時再磋商，又指「要接前人意志」。庭上的袁看到片段後，隨即雙手遮臉，又不斷搖頭及撥頭髮，最後將頭傾側向一邊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被問為何不選年輕人-徐子見指有少少年齡歧視-多人大笑&quot;&gt;被問為何不選年輕人 徐子見指「有少少年齡歧視」 多人大笑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於時任東區區議員徐子見，嘉賓袁彌明指他經常提自己是「素人」，徐指相信素人定義是沒有加入任何政黨，而自己應是「好老嘅素人」，有被告發笑。徐稱素人有堅定意志投贊成或反對，袁彌明遂問徐認為候選人中誰是素人，徐稱楊雪盈是素人，而梁晃維和彭卓棋則「一半一半」，因「好早接觸政治嘅嘢」，鄒家成、彭卓棋、林卓廷等多人發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;林彥邦多次問徐子見與其他年輕素人分別，又問「點解我唔揀個後生嘅呢，而家抗爭係年輕人嘅事喎？」，徐答「有少少年齡歧視喎」，彭卓棋、柯耀林、楊雪盈等多名被告再次大笑，黃碧雲邊笑邊拍大腿。徐指相信抗爭並非一個年齡層的事，「可以係一啲比較中年人嘅事，甚至乎係老年人嘅事」，認為以他年紀也可有智慧幫助「抗衡呢個不義嘅政權」。徐也提及有簽署「墨落無悔」，但認為「寫得比較怪」，此時發起該聲明的鄒家成亦輕輕發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;許智峯稱議會內外寸土必爭-羅冠聰認預咗畀人dq&quot;&gt;許智峯稱「議會內外，寸土必爭」 羅冠聰認「預咗畀人DQ」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就沒被控的兩人，許智峯表示「議會內外，寸土必爭」，「無論喺議會抗爭，喺街頭我必出席，同埋喺所有嘅法律訴訟、法律程序，我都做到盡」，指要透過司法制度給予政權最大的壓力，「迫佢哋承認錯誤。」被問到35+後可否有一致投票意向，許指民主黨光譜較闊，有「衝衝子」和「和理非」，要包容不同看法，又指民主黨過去四年施政報告和財政預算案均投反對票。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;羅冠聰承認自己「預咗畀人DQ」，望突顯政權打壓的暴虐和不合理，籲選民投票支持他的信念，又指「街頭、議會、國際，缺一不可」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件編號：HCCC69/2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;列席認罪被告全於延伸庭被告欄就坐&quot;&gt;列席認罪被告全於延伸庭被告欄就坐&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表包括資深大律師潘熙、大律師沈士文、張耀良、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等，本身是大律師的劉偉聰則自辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OXnzVZZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，16人否認「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，今（15日）踏入審訊第9天。認罪被告區諾軒今續作供，重申戴耀廷在新界東協調會議提及「積極」運用《基本法》權力否決財政預算案，是試圖迎合不同意見，又指會上有人批評泛民過往「行禮如儀」。區又供稱，超級區議會界別曾於2020年5月8日後舉行協調會議，但很快結束，因當時「大局已定」，其他區均已大致就舉行初選、目標議席和替補機制等達成共識，戴亦沒有提及否決財政預算案的主張。區又指，被捕前已刪除手機所有 WhatsApp 紀錄，並在2021年9月獲展示趙家賢手機紀錄才能重溫當時對話，確認那時他已協助警方調查。翻查資料，區諾軒於同月23日的第二次提訊日，首次表明擬認罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區重申戴望說服與會者-故提積極運用權力否決財案&quot;&gt;區重申戴望說服與會者 故提「積極」運用權力否決財案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒昨供稱，戴耀廷在不同地區的協調會議，不斷建議加入「積極運用《基本法》權力否決財政預算案」的條款，其中港島區司馬文表示反對，社民連指會支持涉全民退保等民生項目的預算案，新界東鄒家成則質問戴耀廷為何用「積極」，而非較確定的「會」字。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主控周天行今續就新界東協調會議情況發問，問戴耀廷在新東第二次會議上，何時提及「積極運用《基本法》權力否決財政預算案」字眼。區指據其憶述，戴是在會上看到相關討論後，在回應時才講述他對積極運用否決權的看法，「試圖迎合唔同嘅意見」，至於與會者在開會前有否討論該字眼，區則稱「我冇再之前嘅印象」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行續問，為何說戴耀廷「不斷加入」該條款，區再解釋，當時會上有人質疑條款字眼，故戴嘗試說服會眾就算只用「積極」，「都比起唔用行前一步」。他指戴沒再闡述何為「再行前一步」，但認為戴「應該係為咗說服鄒家成」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱會上有人批泛民行禮如儀-就條款字眼沒有達成共識&quot;&gt;區稱會上有人批泛民「行禮如儀」 就條款字眼沒有達成共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區昨又提及，鄒家成的質問引發「激烈辯論」，期間民主黨被批評，林卓廷助理莊榮輝指民主黨中委會無授權他處理有關問題。周天行問「民主黨被批評」是什麼意思，區指會上「有人拎返以前民主黨好多事情出嚟批評」，批評對象亦包括街工，「都係講緊泛民主派過往行禮如儀」，旁聽人士聞言發笑。傳譯主任一度未能翻譯，大律師沈士文提議「just go through motions and rituals」，法官陳慶偉則提議「go through the formalities」。區並補充，莊榮輝的回應是在鄒家成提議即場投票處理條款字眼時發生。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行一度續問，相關議題是否指「否決財政預算案」，惟大律師沈士文提出反對，指是引導性問題，「運用《基本法》權力」與「否決財政預算案」是兩個不同字眼。法官李運騰同意，區並補充鄒當時是就「運用《基本法》權力」應用「會」或「積極」作投票。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指，相關爭辯花了相當時間，最終沒有共識，其後並轉為討論該區初選應派出6或7張名單，因7張名單是「較為樂觀」的勝選目標。他並指，有與會者認為第7張名單若被界定為初選勝出者，可於正式立法會選舉報名，但不應展開選舉工程。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱whatsapp紀錄於被捕前已刪除-僅靠趙家賢紀錄重溫對話&quot;&gt;區稱WhatsApp紀錄於被捕前已刪除 僅靠趙家賢紀錄重溫對話&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒續指，他只出席過新界東頭兩次會議，不清楚有否第三次會議。法官陳仲衡問新界東是否有 WhatsApp 群組，區指有，但對有否收過第三次會議的通知則「冇印象」，「特別係我只能夠覆睇趙家賢嗰部手機有關新界東嗰個群組嘅內容」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰再問他是否身在該群組，及有否被通知有第三次會議，區確認他是群組成員，「但我沒有被知會有任何會議」。李續問，既然他在群組內，為何要看趙家賢的手機？區諾軒解釋：「因為喺我2021年9月收到本案關於趙家賢手機嘅 WhatsApp 紀錄，我先能夠重溫返當時候嘅對話」，李問即是他被捕後，曾被展示趙的手機紀錄？區同意。李問那時他是否已在「協助警方調查」，區亦同意。李再問他自己的手機紀錄在哪？區答：「關於我嘅任何紀錄，關於 WhatsApp 都已經剷走晒，喺我被捕之前。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;翻查資料，本案2021年3月1日首提堂後，區諾軒於2021年9月23日的第二次提訊日，與趙家賢和鍾錦麟首次表示擬認罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;新東群組於報名期後由戴耀廷創立-發布初選訊息&quot;&gt;新東群組於報名期後由戴耀廷創立 發布初選訊息&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指，該群組約於2020年5、6月建立，但對有否收過會議摘要則沒有印象。周天行問及群組成員名單，區指「如果向我展示嗰個 WhatsApp group 嘅名單，我能夠睇得返，知道有咩成員參與」，吳政亨、梁國雄等發笑。法官李運騰續指，理解現時在談論多年前的事，亦非測試記憶，但區是否不記得任何成員。區指只能確定包括初選參與者及其代表，要一一數出「恐怕有錯漏」，重申「比較好」的做法是如早前作供時控方展示九龍東的群組紀錄，「我覺得用嗰個方式，會比較恰當回應嗰個問題。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後展示從趙家賢手機擷取「35+計劃新東訊息發布區」的 WhatsApp 群組紀錄，顯示於2020年6月24日創立。區解釋該群組是「訊息發布的地方」，法官李運騰一度問是否呈上錯誤的群組，惟區諾軒核實是指此群組。控方問新界東是否有另一群組，區更正指應另有一個發送訊息的名單，但「趙家賢先至有」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據群組紀錄，區諾軒是群組管理員，他起初稱是由他創立群組，再加入其他與會者，但不肯定是否所有成員都由他加入。惟其後顯示戴耀廷亦是管理員，區則改稱群組應由戴創立，「但我唔敢肯定點解我做咗 admin」，有旁聽人士發笑。區同意，群組是在新界東兩次協調會議及6月19日的初選報名期後創立，「我推斷係因為完成咗報名，先創立呢個群組，發布訊息予參加者。」大律師馬維騉一度指其回應為意見，質疑呈堂性。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱協調及訊息發布兩群組不會同時進行-相信九東群組完成協調後關閉&quot;&gt;區稱協調及訊息發布兩群組不會同時進行 相信九東群組完成協調後關閉&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行問其他區是否都有類似群組，區確認，並在法官李運騰詢問下確認，有部分選區會於協調會議時創立群組，「但過咗報名期後，無論之前有冇開過 WhatsApp 群組，我哋都會確保每一區開設訊息發布嘅群組」，又指據其印象「冇一個選區嘅群組係有兩個同時間進行」。傳譯主任一度猶豫：「冇一個選區嘅群組係有兩個同時間進行……」，區再主動翻譯：「There is no WhatsApp group running concurrently.」被告欄和旁聽席傳出笑聲。區其後再確認，初選報名日期完結後，參與者便不會再使用協調會議群組，而改用發布訊息的群組。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後重新展示早前呈堂、處理協調會議的九龍東 WhatsApp 群組，於2020年2月創立，5月20日後便沒有任何訊息。區指他沒有去九龍東第四次和第五次會議，不清楚他們進度，「但係我有理由相信，呢個群組處理完協調會議嘅事務之後，佢哋已經完成咗任務，所以就閂咗個群組。」紀錄亦顯示，時任觀塘區議會主席蔡澤鴻最後移除群組成員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區形容超區協調會議舉行時大局已定-各區已大致定替補機制等&quot;&gt;區形容超區協調會議舉行時「大局已定」 各區已大致定替補機制等&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後就超級區議會協調會議發問。區供稱，超級區議會曾舉行一次會議，他不記得日期，但肯定是在2020年5月8日新界西第二次協調會議之後，出席者包括他、戴耀廷、涂謹申、鄺俊宇、王百羽、李予信和岑敖暉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區指，當時由戴耀廷主持討論，而會議「好快就結束」，「因為喺成個協調會議，咁多區嚟講，我會形容為大局已定。」他又指，與會者亦是有政治聯繫人士，故會上只是集中介紹超級區議會目標是「5席贏3席」，及簡介選舉論壇和投票日內容，席間戴耀廷並無提及關於否決預算案的主張。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問及何謂「大局已定」，區解釋其他選區的協調會議已完成舉行，並指基本方向是各區都會舉行初選，亦訂下目標勝算議席，但有個別選區則保留彈性，決定初選投票日後才決定確切出選名單數目。法官問還有什麼其他共識，區指除香港島外，其餘選區當時均已決定以「靈童制」作為替補被「DQ」者的機制；當時亦就舉辦選舉論壇達成共識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於新界西，區昨天指「新界西我冇參與過，所以我唔能夠評論新界西嘅事」，今重申他並沒有出席過任何新界西協調會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下午續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區戴耀廷提議找蘋果合辦初選-獲回覆可提供場地&quot;&gt;區：戴耀廷提議找《蘋果》合辦初選 獲回覆可提供場地&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒今就初選論壇作供。他確認負責籌備初選論壇，於6月25日至7月4日舉辦6個論壇，包括5個地方選區和超級區議會。區表示，2020年3月與戴耀廷傾談初選早期，已預期要舉辦選舉論壇。當時戴耀廷曾指可嘗試找《蘋果日報》及其他媒體一起合作，因此他聯絡一位《蘋果日報》記者，表達想搞初選論壇的意見，《蘋果》並回覆可以提供場地。區亦聯絡網台《城寨》、《D100》 和《立場新聞》問有否興趣合辦論壇。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區表示，與4個媒體各派出的一名代表，舉行兩至三次會議準備論壇的工作，會上討論播放模式，決定由《蘋果日報》錄制影像，再分發予上述媒體在同一時間播放；並思考邀請什麼人做嘉賓及主持，「經過幾間媒體物色人選下」訂下名單；並指他們最初憂慮論壇所牽涉的選舉開支，及是否需要作選舉申報。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;以35名義辦論壇-民主動力安排申報選舉開支&quot;&gt;以「35+」名義辦論壇 民主動力安排申報選舉開支&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區提及，就選舉申報曾徵詢《蘋果日報》一方的法律意見，惟法官李運騰即打斷：「我不認為我們需要知道所有細節。」區續指他只是想解釋在6月9日記者會，他曾表示不以「35+」的名義舉辦論壇，但與媒體開會後認為應作選舉申報，故最後還是以「35+」名義舉辦論壇，並由民主動力安排候選人申報選舉開支的資料。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區製作35論壇須知文件-擬定論壇流程&quot;&gt;區製作〈35+論壇須知〉文件 擬定論壇流程&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區表示，曾準備〈35+論壇須知〉和〈Candidates’ memo（候選人備忘）〉兩份文件，發給每位初選參加者，分別列明6個論壇的錄製和播放日期、發言時間；及論壇流程、嘉賓和主持等資料，並指論壇環節是參考一般媒體的立法會選舉論壇。他並曾將文件發給戴耀廷和趙家賢，指他們知悉該兩份文件，「但都係由我製作。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區又透露，與戴耀廷、趙家賢、鍾錦麟和民主動力職員黎敬輝有一個名為「PfD 35＋計劃」的 WhatsApp 群組，群組於2020年6月創立，創立者「唔係趙家賢，就係戴耀廷」，群組最後訊息於7月23日發出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區稱曾去大部分選舉論壇趙家賢沒去過戴耀廷只去一次&quot;&gt;區稱曾去大部分選舉論壇、趙家賢沒去過、戴耀廷只去一次&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區確認，論壇於《蘋果日報》大樓舉行，指「當中大部分我都有去，但我唔記得冇去邊一兩個」，形容自己「只係去做觀察」，而戴耀廷只去過一次，趙家賢應沒有去過。法官多次問及區有否參與，他再指大部分都有去，「即使冇去都好，我都有睇晒所有論壇」，但就九龍西論壇「我冇100%確保我有去」，但確定所有選舉論壇流程都由他處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方原不打算播放所有論壇片段，但大律師馬維騉表示，於盤問會播放新界東論壇片段，望庭上能播放所有論壇片段。法庭押後讓雙方商討，控方於午休後指會播放完整片段。資深大律師潘熙一度指大部分辯方律師對論壇沒有爭議，不要求在區諾軒作供時播放所有片段，法官陳仲衡提議先由新界東片段播放，惟馬維騉指他希望順時序播放。法官陳慶偉指交由控方決定，「你們之間永遠不會達成共識。（“There will be no consensus among you all.”）」有被告大笑，林卓廷笑着重複：「There will be no consensus.」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方播片前，指有部分被告不承認片段，要求區諾軒認出參加者，自辯的劉偉聰表示沒有爭議身份，區並認出黃碧雲、劉澤鋒、何啟明、毛孟靜、馮達浚、岑子杰、張崑陽、安德里和李軒朗，其中劉偉聰、黃碧雲、何啟明為不認罪被告。開始播片時，區諾軒一度回頭望向旁聽席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後播放長1小時20分鐘的九龍西初選論壇片段，先是每人30秒的「開場介紹」，劉偉聰提及要將最多同路人送入議會，「裏應外合」；黃碧雲提及「今日上嚟論壇，小心我可能畀人重點招呼」，但重申35+要團結合作抗暴政，有被告發笑；何啟明則提及自2019年8月起，「我同一班70+手足，喺深水埗警署門口，一齊嚟到反暴政，一齊嚟到食TG」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黃碧雲論壇被多人質問-惹被告及旁聽席大笑&quot;&gt;黃碧雲論壇被多人質問 惹被告及旁聽席大笑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後進入每人3分鐘的「自由搏擊」環節，多名候選人均質疑黃碧雲立場，其中張崑陽問黃「過去一年，喺抗爭上做過啲咩嘢？」、「七一嘅時候，點解要同勇武手足割蓆？」，又指在「中大保衛戰」時有人曾聽到她說「嘩，咁多人嘅，係咪 open day 呀？」，黃回應時二人疊聲，張說「宜家係我嘅主場，唔好惱羞成怒」，多名被告發笑，林卓廷笑着搖頭。岑子杰問黃如何說服港人她進入議會後會「積極抗爭」，黃指民主黨「一定會抵抗惡法」，指面對《逃犯條例》，「我哋係全部一條心，民主派嘅議員係一齊共進退」，而隨《國安法》來臨，「已經冇得分咩叫和理非，咩叫勇武。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同案認罪被告馮達浚則指，現時共產黨政權為「共同敵人」，「議事堂內已經係冇任何議事嘅空間」，問黃碧雲：「我見到你用咗8年時間，係學識點樣去捐山窿，但係我想問嚟緊4年，你願唔願意同我一齊，如果一齊當選嘅話，你願唔願意同我一齊衝？」黃碧雲拍枱高聲答： 「一齊衝，希望一齊贏！」引來旁聽席大笑，彭卓棋、柯耀林、鄭達鴻等前俯後仰，黃碧雲亦笑着搖頭。安德里其後問到少數族裔議題，黃碧雲指「過去兩屆，我同 Ms Mo 都喺立法會度有啲關注少數族裔嘅工作做嘅」，惟毛孟靜說「我冇同你一齊做呀」，再惹被告大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一認罪被告劉澤鋒，則指黃碧雲曾在戴耀廷舉辦的佔中訓練營訓練擋水砲，多次質問：「點解你唔去擋水砲？」，又說「既然你係抗爭者，你識唔識得唱《願榮光歸香港》呀？你唱嚟聽吓」，黃碧雲答「我哋一齊唱」，再引來林卓廷等被告和旁聽人士大笑。其後劉轉為問張崑陽問題，黃碧雲續說「我見到你嗰種憤怒係好明白，不過希望我哋嘅憤怒，係對住呢個政權」，劉即說「我宜家問緊張崑陽呀，你收聲吓」，林卓廷等再大笑，黃碧雲再苦笑搖頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黃碧雲稱會用盡憲制權力爭五大訴求何啟明指不簽墨落無悔要foul走&quot;&gt;黃碧雲稱會用盡憲制權力爭五大訴求、何啟明指不簽墨落無悔要「foul走」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉澤鋒又質疑，黃碧雲拒簽墨落無悔，問黃民主黨「係咪應承一定攬炒」，黃指如戴耀廷認為九龍西要再簽協議，「我哋好樂意」，又稱會用盡憲制內的權力和手段爭取五大訴求，「如果否決財政預算案能夠促成呢一樣嘢，我哋一定會做。」何啟明則稱，35+是要團結入議會，若有人不簽「墨落無悔」，市民「就用佢雪亮嘅眼睛，就用佢手上一票，咪 foul 走佢囉」，又指35+是要「令到立法會成為呢個政府同埋保皇黨嘅地獄」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何啟明亦提到，過去一年「見證住無數警暴」，指「呢個極權政府，淨係針對年輕人，好多濫捕、濫告，甚至有好多死得不明不白嘅死者」，又指周梓樂是他的中學師弟，該案必須徹查。其後劉偉聰稱，議會是一條戰線，指「首先我哋就炒晒班（立法會）保安，跟住請番晒自己嘅手足」，黃碧雲發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張崑陽則問劉偉聰是否知道議會內「做唔到法治重光」，劉指法治是「制約當權者的權力」，又說「如果大家覺得我哋仲需要制約當權者嘅話，有你，有我哋，大家一齊嘅話，法治係唔會死」。他又指「有35+，我相信好多嘢都可以做，包括修改呢啲惡法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於岑子杰被問為何不簽墨落無悔，他形容「覺得嗰種夾泛民嘅意味太重，佢好似會創造一種撕裂，我唔鍾意」，又指：「社民連有邊一次嘅財政預算案係投過贊成票嘅啫？係咪先？未有你哋，社民連係第一個講議會抗爭嘅！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後為嘉賓提問環節，嘉賓為資深傳媒人湛國揚及阮穎嫻。問黃碧雲時，阮穎嫻形容「其實我覺得大會，喺現場呢個節數其實都係為咗呢一刻㗎，可能係咁」。湛國揚後提及當時81歲李柱銘和「擺咗喺床下底嗰個楊森」都被捕，問民主黨「大中華」概念是否太天真。黃指回歸前寄望有高度自治，但回歸廿多年，中央插手香港事務，甚至有《國安法》，「的確令我哋對於中共呢個政權，同埋佢過去做出嘅承諾，係幻想破滅」，籲港人團結向專制政權說不、抵抗所有惡法，包括《國安法》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉偉聰後被問到法治「死咗未？死定係未死？」，答「梗係未」，又說：「我死唔死唔緊要，我 dead body 係唔重要嘅⋯⋯你哋未死嘅話，法治就未死。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就何啟明，嘉賓指「攬炒受傷最大嘅就係基層」，但何啟明已簽署「墨落無悔」，「你會選擇背棄堅定抗爭聲明定係背棄深水埗嘅支持者？」何回應基層市民眼睛雪亮，明白「攬炒係中共吖嘛」，又指「真正令到基層市民生活苦，嗰個係共產黨，係呢個極權社會，係呢個極權政府」，他們知道「共產黨係一個殺人政權」，故他要出來「反暴政」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何啟明倡打倒共產黨岑子杰指想長毛再參選&quot;&gt;何啟明倡打倒共產黨、岑子杰指想長毛再參選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;最後是各人10秒的總結環節，劉偉聰說「最重要係支持最大多數同路人進入議會，到時 they would fear you，建制會驚你」，黃碧雲指「贏唔到」會全力支持勝出隊伍，何啟明則說元朗 YOHO 商場有8男4女被捕，「不如宜家我哋就一齊去元朗，一齊守護手足，一齊守護下一代，好唔好呀？」&lt;/p&gt;

Historians will likely see 2022 as a pivotal year akin to 1989 and 2001 — years that marked the end of an era and the beginning of a new historical phase. Europe’s response to the war has changed the continent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The changes in the past year have truly been dramatic. Countries with a long history of neutrality suddenly sought to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) military alliance. Almost overnight, the United Kingdom, seemingly irreparably entangled with Russian investment and influence, evicted Russian oligarchs and their wealth. Germany announced a new era, invested massively in defense, sent weapons to Ukraine, and ended its deep dependence on Russian natural gas. The European Union showed itself to be a geopolitical actor, implementing massive economic sanctions and, for the first time, providing billions of euros in lethal security assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, the unity forged in Europe in response to the war held. The prevailing assumption that Europe was weak led to constant predictions that this unity would crack. There were concerns that the millions of Ukrainian migrants could trigger a populist backlash and that rising energy prices and a cost-of-living crisis would prompt Europe to push for an end to the conflict, breaking with Ukraine and the United States. Furthermore, there were concerns that Europe would not get through the winter without Russian gas and that its economy might collapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But again and again, Europe has held firm and adapted. Its response has often been messy and cacophonous, but this is to be expected in European democracies, where foreign policy debates and divisions play out in public. In the end, Europe’s response has demonstrated both its resolve and the strength and resilience of democracy. European democracies have demonstrated their competence and determination — from rapidly getting weapons to Ukraine to rapidly building liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals. The war has thus strengthened Europe, the European Union, and the NATO alliance. Economically, Europe has performed better than expected and avoided falling into recession in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, despite the strong response to the war, comprehensive structural changes to Europe’s economy and security architecture have yet to materialize. Although it is now spending more on defense, the war has revealed that the state of European forces is even worse than realized. Off-the-shelf procurement of military equipment, mostly from the United States, has taken priority over ambitious coordination efforts and investment in common European defense initiatives. Despite the war, none of the three primary Western stakeholders — NATO, the United States, and the European Union — have proposed any transformational initiatives to improve defense cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;But again and again, Europe has held firm and adapted. Its response has often been messy and cacophonous, but this is to be expected in European democracies, where foreign policy debates and divisions play out in public. In the end, Europe’s response has demonstrated both its resolve and the strength and resilience of democracy.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Momentum toward greater fiscal integration has also stalled. There are growing demands on Europe to invest resources to address common problems. But the European Union lacks the fiscal capacity to address major issues — from defense procurement to providing weapons to Ukraine and from building new energy infrastructure and accelerating the green transition to securing supply chains. Additionally, once the war ends, rebuilding Ukraine will cost hundreds of billions of euros over at least a decade. The European Commission has already stated that the current EU budget, known as the “multiannual financial framework,” does not cover these needs and that new financing sources will have to be identified. Yet, despite the precedent created by the EU Recovery and Resilience Facility — toward which the European Union borrowed about 800 billion euros to help member states recover from the Covid-19 pandemic — European leaders have thus far refused to issue more common debt. It is therefore unclear how Europe will finance addressing its collective challenges, as well as Ukraine’s reconstruction. The year 2023 will no doubt pose significant economic challenges, as Europe’s economy is expected to slow, and the continent will continue to have to cope without Russian gas supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper examines the present state of Europe one year since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine. It gauges the continent’s political response to the war, the sanctions regime, the economy, the energy crisis, Ukrainian migration, and the enlargement and reconstruction of a wider Europe. It then evaluates defense and EU-NATO cooperation before looking ahead to the future of transatlantic relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Russia launched its brutal invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the high degree of political unity demonstrated by the European Union’s response has surprised many observers, who expected Vladimir Putin to use Russian influence, particularly Europe’s long-recognized dependence on Russian hydrocarbons, to effectively divide and incapacitate the bloc. But Putin’s bet that Europe would not put its economic well-being at risk for Ukraine has proved wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A year after the war began, European unity continues to endure. In mid-December 2022, the European Union passed its ninth sanctions package against Russia, just a few weeks after collaborating with the United States and other members of the Group of Seven (G7) to launch an international price cap on the purchase of Russian oil, in addition to an EU embargo on the maritime shipment of Russian oil. At the start of 2023, France, Germany, and the United States each announced that it would ship armored fighting vehicles to Ukraine — the first time a Western-designed light tank will be sent to the Ukrainian military. The United Kingdom also committed to sending 14 of its Challenger 2 main battle tanks to Kyiv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europeans have so far maintained solidarity and enacted robust sanctions to punish Russia. There have no doubt been sharp disagreements within both the European Union and NATO about how to respond, for instance, regarding the proper level of sanctions, the correct way to wean Europe off its reliance on Russian oil and gas, and the appropriate amount and kind of defense support the transatlantic alliance should be providing to its Ukrainian partners. But these are normal foreign policy debates, many of which are also occurring in Washington. The difference is that in Washington, these debates are between government agencies behind closed doors, while in Europe foreign policy decisions and processes play out publicly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some prominent European politicians, such as Marine Le Pen and Matteo Salvini, have expressed skepticism of the Western approach toward the war, and some pro-Russian protests have emerged, overall the continent’s political class and public remain supportive of the European response to the crisis. The latest Eurobarometer polls have shown that 74 percent of EU citizens approve of the European Union’s support for Ukraine following the invasion. The value that citizens place on participation in the organization has concurrently increased as well, with 72 percent of EU citizens saying their country has benefited from EU membership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been concern about a new revival of populism and far-right parties in Europe, but such a sweeping narrative proved largely unfounded. European elections throughout 2022 saw far-right parties attempt to moderate their extremist tendencies and normalize themselves in the eyes of voters. In France, Le Pen moved to the center and ran as the change candidate against the establishment, embodied by President Emmanuel Macron. While Le Pen performed better than she did in 2017, she still lost by 17 percentage points to a fairly unpopular incumbent. In Italy, Giorgia Meloni of the Brothers of Italy party, which has its roots in fascism, won the election and became prime minister. However, Meloni also sought to strike a more moderate tone, took a strong Atlanticist stance in supporting Ukraine, and toned down past anti-EU rhetoric. In Sweden, the Sweden Democrats, which has neo-Nazi roots, emerged as the second-largest party, which helped the center-right Moderate Party secure the prime minister position. While the success of the Sweden Democrats is concerning, the party was not formally included in the new government, and the issues that dominated the election were crime and immigration, the very topics that helped bring it to prominence. These elections present no discernable sign of a rise in anti-EU sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine also spurred the European Union to get serious about democratic backsliding in Hungary and Poland. In December 2022, Brussels withheld all 22 billion euros of earmarked cohesion funds from the European Union’s 2021–2027 long-term budget for Budapest until the Viktor Orbán government agreed to conditions on judiciary independence, academic freedoms, LGBTQ+ rights, and the asylum system. This was in addition to the 5.8 billion euros in grants already withheld from the pandemic recovery fund until the Hungarian government addresses ongoing concerns about its court system. In the end, a deal was struck, with Budapest largely backing down. The European Union would hold back only 6.3 billion euros from Hungary, which would complete 27 reforms aimed toward addressing corruption and improving judicial independence. Hungary also dropped its vetoes of the 18-billion-euro EU aid package for Ukraine and the global minimum corporate tax of 15 percent. While this has nowhere close to resolved Hungary’s rule-of-law or corruption issues, it does demonstrate that the European Union is increasingly willing to use its considerable leverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Commission has also not released 35 billion euros in loans and grants from its pandemic recovery fund to Poland and will continue to withhold funds until changes to the judicial system are made. In addition, Warsaw owes 436 million euros as part of a fine of one million euros per day imposed last year by the EU Court of Justice for failing to comply with an EU court order to suspend its controversial disciplinary mechanism for judges. Warsaw needs to pass legislation to unlock the funds — which it desperately requires, as inflation sat at 17.5 percent year-on-year in November, one of the highest levels in the European Union. But a rift exists within the ruling coalition, where the Law and Justice Party holds the majority but needs the support of the smaller, far-right United Poland Party to form a government. Legislation recently passed in the lower house of parliament aims to address the European Commission’s concerns by removing controversial powers of the supreme court, which is one of the objectives stipulated by Brussels to unfreeze the pandemic recovery funds. However, the new bill still requires approval from President Andrzej Duda and it remains unclear whether the European Union will find the changes sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sanctions&quot;&gt;Sanctions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the European Union’s limited response to Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea, the bloc brought its full economic weight to bear on the Kremlin in 2022. The EU economic response has far exceeded Washington’s expectations. While the Biden administration assumed it would have to push the European Union to adopt more robust sanctions, it has often found itself reacting to surprisingly strong European proposals. For instance, it was the European Union that proposed sanctions against Russia’s Central Bank. EU sanctions against the Russian oil and gas sector prompted concerns in Washington that they would send a shock to global energy markets, leading to compromise proposals such as the oil-price cap that was implemented in December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In contrast to the European Union’s limited response to Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea, the bloc brought its full economic weight to bear on the Kremlin in 2022. The EU economic response has far exceeded Washington’s expectations.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union has also been constantly updating and strengthening its sanctions regime. Nine sanctions packages imposed by Brussels have targeted a broad swath of the Russian economy, military, and industrial base. These measures aim to punish Russia for its extraterritorial aggression and effectively diminish its ability to continue occupying Ukraine. The initial sanctions targeted individuals with ties to the Kremlin and restricted Russia’s access to European financial markets, while more recent measures have included a price cap on Russian oil and a ban on exports of dual-use goods and technology. Furthermore, several European countries have made a concerted effort to rid their societies of Russian kleptocrats. The United Kingdom alone has frozen over 18 billion pounds of Russian-linked assets, which is almost 6 billion pounds more than the total assets held under all other British sanctions regimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union’s nine sanctions packages complement unprecedented sanctions imposed on Russia by a multilateral coalition including the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and Japan. Since February 2022, Moscow has become a target of more than 10,000 new sanctions, bringing a total number to around 13,000 and making Russia the most sanctioned country in the world. While these have indeed created challenges for the Kremlin, they have not yet contributed to the full collapse of the Russian economy. However, experts believe it will take at least a decade for Russia to return to its pre-war levels of economic activity and quality of life. Limited access to Western technology will also diminish the Kremlin’s ability to manufacture and sustain high-quality defense and military equipment in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU market is roughly equivalent in size to the United States and China. Thus, when the European Union and United States work together on sanctions, whether related to Russia or Iran, they are immensely impactful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economy&quot;&gt;Economy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe, like most of the world, is experiencing an economic slowdown. However, defying all doomsayers, the EU economy is performing much better than expected and is projected to continue doing so throughout 2023. In mid-2022, many analysts were forecasting a European economic collapse due to energy shortages, price hikes, and increased uncertainty. However, according to the European Commission’s estimates, economic growth in 2022 has exceeded 3 percent. Unemployment is at a historical low of 6.6 percent, an industrial production has fallen much less than expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, Europe faces a challenging 2023. Essentially unplugged from Russian energy, some European countries may fall into a technical recession, and inflation will most likely continue to rise. Unlike previous crises (the Covid-19–induced economic catastrophe in 2020 and the 2007–2012 global financial crisis), this economic contraction, if it takes place, will likely be mild and short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EU member states have made varying economic policy choices and faced some unexpected tailwinds that are likely to continue in 2023. (The situation is different in the United Kingdom, where the effects of Brexit and poor macroeconomic management led to a political crisis and will generate a deep recession in the coming year.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, EU countries have implemented targeted expansionary fiscal policies.&lt;/strong&gt; On top of the Next Generation EU program of public investments, all member governments have taken measures to shield citizens and companies from the increase in electricity and gasoline prices. This has ensured that domestic demand (investment and consumption) has not drastically declined. These policies will continue in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second, monetary policy, while more restrictive than in the past, has still been expansionary.&lt;/strong&gt; With the U.S. Federal Reserve being much more aggressive in terms of restricting liquidity, the euro has depreciated against the dollar, favoring eurozone exports. Moreover, the limited increase in interest rates has generated neither substantial reductions in credit nor a real estate market crash. The downside has been persistent inflation, which probably has already peaked in the United States but not in the eurozone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third, energy prices have fallen.&lt;/strong&gt; Energy and commodity prices, especially natural gas prices, which skyrocketed following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, have almost returned to pre-war levels, alleviating European economies. Policies to substitute Russian gas with other forms of energy, alternative suppliers, and — above all — savings have worked remarkably well. As a result, European economies will probably ride out the remainder of the 2023 winter with sufficient reserves to avoid energy cuts, especially if temperatures are mild. (Problems might arise in the winter of 2024, but that is still far away.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, there are no signs of a financial crisis.&lt;/strong&gt; Despite slower growth, higher interest rates, and a euro-critical, extreme-right government in Italy, there are no signs of financial fragmentation or complications in the financial sector that could trigger sovereign-debt problems. In fact, the mechanisms put in place over the past decade to avoid financial crises in the eurozone, coupled with the new role that the European Central Bank (ECB) has been playing as a lender of last resort, seem to have convinced investors that the single currency is here to stay.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the baseline scenario, the International Monetary Fund projects economic growth to be close to 1 percent in both the European Union and the eurozone in 2023, meaning a recession would be avoided. However, there are substantial risks that could undermine economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, there remains uncertainty about how Europe will meet its energy needs throughout 2023.&lt;/strong&gt; While Russian gas flows have been substantially reduced and almost eliminated, Europe still received sizeable quantities of Russian natural gas throughout much of 2022. How it refills its reserves and prepares itself for next winter is a major economic question. Without adequate energy supply, Europe will have to reduce or ration demand, which could negatively impact major industries and economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second, there is significant uncertainty around the economic performance of China.&lt;/strong&gt; On the one hand, the end of the zero-Covid policy — potentially leading to the virus’s unchecked spread in China — could generate new disruptions to global supply chains in the first part of the year. On the other hand, if the Chinese economy rebounds in the second part of the year, energy demand will soar, making it more difficult for European economies to continue substituting Russian gas at reasonable prices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third, inflation could remain high.&lt;/strong&gt; Because of expansionary fiscal policy and higher energy prices, inflation will likely remain elevated, forcing the ECB to increase interest rates more aggressively. This could trigger a more pronounced economic slowdown and a stronger euro, with negative consequences for growth. In fact, a prolonged period of higher-than-expected interest rates would increase financing costs for southern European countries and could lead to financial instability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, an acceleration of deglobalization&lt;/strong&gt; generated by political tensions, protectionism, or the collapse of economic-governance institutions, especially the World Trade Organization (WTO), would seriously damage growth prospects for European countries, which are more export-oriented and more dependent on the rules-based multilateral system than other parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unexpected events can substantially modify economic outcomes. As Covid-19, the war in Ukraine, and U.S.-China tensions have shown, economic performance is increasingly determined by noneconomic events — especially geopolitics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;energy&quot;&gt;Energy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, Europe experienced a dramatic energy crisis due to Russia’s weaponization of natural gas. The European Union has had to do whatever it takes to get through the winter and keep the lights on, including expanding its use of coal-fired power plants, increasing its use of LNG, and extending nuclear plants. But despite this, it has strengthened its commitment to combating climate change and accelerated the deployment of renewable energy technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europeans have felt the impact of rising energy prices. Gas prices exceeded 300 euros per megawatt hour (MWh) in August on the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) spot market, compared to around 20 euros per MWh in 2020. Due to the difficulties French nuclear power plants faced in 2022 and climate change-related limitations on hydroelectric production, there emerged a severe crisis on the EU electricity market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union responded by launching the REPowerEU plan, a framework that enabled countries to take short-term measures to alleviate the difficulties of households and businesses. It also agreed to an embargo on Russian coal and oil, a price cap on Russian oil exports, and — after intense negotiations — to buy 15 percent of its gas jointly and with an applied price cap. European countries were also able to substantially diversify away from Russian energy. This policy goal receives broad support from EU citizens, with 82 percent in favor of the European Union continuing to take actions to reduce its dependency on Russian fossil fuels and 83 percent agreeing that Russia’s war against Ukraine makes it more urgent to invest in renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union has also greatly accelerated the deployment of renewable energy production. For instance, new solar power installations grew by 47 percent in 2022, equivalent to the power needs of 12.4 million European homes. Although volatile costs generated strong headwinds for wind-turbine suppliers, new wind capacity also expanded moderately in 2022, with onshore wind accounting for about 90 percent of this growth. To further increase the bloc’s domestic production capacity, the European Union recently adopted a reform that will rapidly accelerate the permitting process for new renewable energy power plants. It is estimated that growth in wind and solar capacity may have saved it $11 billion in gas imports since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, in December 2022, the European Union reformed its Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) to deepen its commitment to mitigating climate change. Per the new EU law, the number of emissions in the sectors covered by the EU ETS will be reduced by 62 percent by 2030 compared to 2005 levels, instead of 43 percent under current legislation. Between 2026 and 2034, the European Union will gradually phase out free emission allowances given to EU companies. This much more ambitious target under the EU ETS is one of the key tools that allowed the European Union to raise its greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets to 57 percent by 2030 compared to 1990 levels during the 2022 UN Climate Change Conference (COP27) in Sharm el-Sheikh. This commitment is part of the “Fit for 55” and “Green Deal” initiatives, which will be upscaled in 2023 with substantial investments to accelerate the energy transition. In sum, the European Union seems determined to accelerate its energy independence and its focus on renewables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a crucial tool of EU climate policy has been the carbon border adjustment mechanism, (CBAM) which aims to ensure a level playing field between European-based companies and their foreign competitors regarding GHG emissions requirements. The CBAM, which is essentially a “green tariff,” will apply to imports of goods produced outside the European Union in countries with lower environmental standards. It will affect sectors most at risk of “carbon leakage,” such as production of cement, iron and steel, aluminum, fertilizers, electricity, and hydrogen. It will not be fully operational until 2026, but its approval has sent a powerful political message to other countries about the European Union’s commitment to fighting climate change. Even though the European Commission claims that the CBAM is WTO-compatible, it may well be perceived by other countries as a protectionist instrument. This could create problems for the European Union, which has itself been complaining about the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), a $369 billion package of subsidies passed in August 2022 to accelerate the energy transition in the United States. In the European Union, there is a growing fear that U.S. subsidies, combined with high energy costs triggered by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, might lead to the deindustrialization of Europe. Although it is unlikely that the trade frictions introduced by the IRA and the CBAM will cause a transatlantic trade war, further diplomatic work will have to happen throughout 2023 to avoid a conflict that could seriously undermine Western unity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;migration&quot;&gt;Migration&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe has felt the secondary impacts of the war in ways the rest of the world has not. For one, its geographical proximity to the frontlines means it is facing the worst humanitarian displacement the continent has seen since World War II, with millions of Ukrainians fleeing the conflict. On top of that, worries that the war could spill further into Europe continue to loom. The European Union has responded to the crisis with various instruments, including humanitarian aid, emergency civil protection, and granting immediate protection in its territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time in its history, the European Union has activated the Temporary Protection Directive for Ukrainians fleeing war. An estimated 5.3 million Ukrainians have entered the European Union since the beginning of the invasion, and the total number of arrivals (including non-Ukrainians) is estimated at 7 million individuals. Under the Temporary Protection Directive, Ukrainian refugees have the right to residence, healthcare, education, and work in any EU member state until March 2024, per the latest prolongation of the directive. For now, public support for taking in a large number of Ukrainian refugees remains robust across a large swath of EU member states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;enlargement-and-reconstruction-of-wider-europe&quot;&gt;Enlargement and Reconstruction of Wider Europe&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has revived the European Union’s pursuit of enlargement. Ukraine’s application to join the bloc was embraced by European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, who helped convince EU leaders to grant Ukraine and Moldova EU candidacy status in June. Furthermore, after years of waiting, the European Union finally opened accession negotiations with North Macedonia and Albania in July and granted candidate status to Bosnia-Herzegovina in December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While EU enlargement is gaining momentum, the prospects of full membership for any of these countries are in doubt. Most of all, before the European Union considers another round of enlargement, it will almost certainly need to adopt a new treaty to reform how it functions. This sentiment was echoed in August by German chancellor Olaf Scholz, who suggested the bloc could expand to include as many as 36 member states but not before revisiting, for example, the unanimity requirement that has kept Brussels from acting swiftly on foreign policy, taxes, and holding Hungary and Poland accountable for democratic backsliding. These reforms currently require unanimous support among EU members. However, while countries like Poland and the Baltic states are fully supportive of enlargement, they also oppose efforts by countries like France to reform the European Union. This political deadlock will stand in the way of future enlargement, no matter how much progress countries make in meeting the requirements for joining the bloc. Thus, granting candidate status does not necessarily mean what it has meant before: becoming a member in a fairly short time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the hope for these countries is that a virtuous cycle is formed, wherein the renewed EU interest in enlargement (however distant), leads to momentum for internal reforms within EU aspirant countries, thereby prompting the European Union to grant them greater market access and increase its investment in them. This, in turn, will prompt greater integration of the electricity, telecommunications, and transportation sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;nato-and-defense&quot;&gt;NATO and Defense&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nato&quot;&gt;NATO&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine is one of the most significant tests NATO has faced since the alliance formed in 1949. The challenge is twofold: defending allies and supporting Ukraine. So far, NATO’s response to both has been robust. But the alliance will come under intense pressure in 2023 ahead of the Vilnius summit in July, and with a historic, 75th anniversary Washington summit on the horizon in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO’s foremost commitment is to defend its own members. More U.S. and Western European forces have been deployed to NATO’s eastern flank during the war, significantly strengthening its combat capacity in eastern Europe. There has also been a significant increase in NATO spending commitments, with most allies now either reaching the 2 percent defense spending goal or having a clear path to hit it. As a result, defense investment by EU member states has risen by a third, from 163 billion euros in 2014 to 214 billion euros in 2021 (according to the latest EU figures). The war has also triggered a return to Cold War–style forward defense, which has involved bolstering NATO’s “enhanced forward presence” missions in the east and establishing a new rapid reaction force. After the 2022 invasion, the alliance’s new approach was crystallized in its Strategic Concept, which describes Russia as “the most significant and direct threat to Allies’ security.” This concept was agreed at a historic summit in Madrid alongside the approval of more forward-deployed and high-readiness forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this period has seen plenty of challenges to NATO’s integrity, including rising energy prices, an anonymous attack on the Nord Stream gas pipeline, a stray missile that killed two Polish farmers, and the failure of Hungary and Turkey to ratify Finland’s and Sweden’s membership bids. These challenges are likely to intensify in the coming months as Russia doubles down in Ukraine and beyond. Despite these obstacles, support for NATO in European countries has grown dramatically in the past year and remains particularly strong in countries located near Russia or Ukraine. This trend is most evident in Poland, where the share of the public who consider NATO very important has grown from 43 percent to 66 percent since 2021, according to the German Marshall Fund. Even countries that have historically been more skeptical of NATO have embraced the alliance as central to their security; in the same survey, 72 percent of French and 77 percent of Spanish respondents considered NATO somewhat or very important, an increase from 52 percent and 65 percent, respectively, in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Ukraine is not a NATO member, allies have made supporting Ukraine a matter of alliance credibility — providing billions in financial and military assistance, updated equipment, training, intelligence sharing, and a long-term commitment to reconstruction and reform. However, differences have emerged among allies over their political willingness and ability to provide military assistance, and there have also been industrial-capacity challenges (e.g., for manufacturing ammunition). In addition, assistance to Ukraine is further depleting the readiness of European militaries. As stocks of ammunition, artillery, vehicles, and tanks flow to Ukraine, Europe will need to find funding to replace the equipment outflows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine also prompted a Scandinavian NATO enlargement that had previously been considered unlikely. On May 18, 2022, Finland and Sweden jointly applied for membership after months of domestic debates, reversing long-standing policies of maintaining military neutrality. The inclusion of the two Nordic countries as NATO members constitutes a major shift in European security and a historic strengthening of the alliance, both politically and militarily, given their geostrategic location and military capabilities. On the one hand, Finnish and Swedish NATO membership will contribute to the collective defense of the Baltic Sea region and help counter Russia’s expansion of Arctic bases in the Kola Peninsula. Furthermore, Finland has valuable experience as Russia’s neighbor, sharing a 1,340-kilometer (832-mile) land border with it, and both Finland and Sweden have valuable practical insights into operating in sub-Arctic climates. On the other hand, the enlargement will bring NATO to Russia’s doorstep and more than double the border between them, locking the alliance into a more strangled relationship with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To grant membership, the governments of all 30 NATO members must sign and ratify the accession protocols. Following a September 27, 2022, vote in Slovakia, legislatures in 28 NATO countries have ratified the accession, with the exception of Turkey and Hungary. To mitigate risks during the accession period, Finland and Sweden have received security guarantees from France, Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom. They are expected to join NATO as full members prior to the alliance’s Vilnius summit in June 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;european-defense-and-foreign-policy&quot;&gt;European Defense and Foreign Policy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has prompted European countries to get serious about defense and increase the role of the European Union in defense and foreign policy. The organization has released a raft of initiatives to address some of the issues at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2022, the European Union adopted its first-ever equivalent of a national security strategy, the Strategic Compass. Negotiated and drafted mostly before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, it was hastily revised to take this major shift into account but could not capture the full scale of the war’s impact and consequences. It still puts forth an ambitious yet realistic roadmap for the European Union to become a more responsible and credible security provider. The document lays out a joint threat assessment that presents Russia as severely and directly threatening the European security order and China as a partner for cooperation, an economic competitor, and a systemic rival. It also highlights the need for Europe to develop military capabilities, such as the ability to rapidly deploy up to 5,000 troops in all types of contexts. This goal was a direct response to the difficulties of the withdrawal from Afghanistan, where the European Union was dependent on the U.S. military to get EU citizens out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time in its history, the European Union has provided lethal security assistance to a foreign partner, providing more than 3.1 billion euros to Ukraine through the European Peace Facility (EPF). The EPF, used to reimburse EU members sending military equipment to Ukraine, was originally intended for use in countries outside Europe. The union has also created the EU Military Assistance Mission in support of Ukraine (EUMAM Ukraine), which provides combat training for the Ukrainian armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European nations have also provided direct military assistance to Kyiv, sometimes on a strictly national basis and sometimes within a multilateral framework. According to the most recent data collected by the Kiel Institute, as of November 2022, EU members had allocated 8.61 billion euros toward military commitments to Ukraine; this number is a combination of both specific weapons and equipment purchases, as well as financial commitments related to a military purpose. EU institutions have added 3.1 billion euros to that tally via the EPF, and the United Kingdom has committed an additional 4.13 billion euros, bringing total European military commitments to Ukraine to 15.84 billion euros as of November. This is less than the U.S. contribution of 22.86 billion euros ($24.44 billion) but is nonetheless significant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Europe’s generosity and the resulting need to restock armaments has exposed the hollowness of Europe’s defense industrial base. This vulnerability began to develop after the end of the Cold War, primarily as a result of low defense spending: European governments reduced their military expenditure from roughly 2 percent of GDP annually to 1.3 percent between 1993 and 2014. Other causes include a focus on low-intensity military missions such as counterterrorism operations and the potentially stifling effect of U.S. arms sales that, often for good reason, lure public money away from homegrown European defense companies. Furthermore, while it is widely recognized that more joint procurement would be beneficial, member states regularly fall short of the EU benchmark that 35 percent of total defense equipment procurement expenditure should be spent collaboratively; in 2021, cooperative spending comprised only 18 percent of military expenditure. This leads to redundancies in the defense industrial base, with many individual European states maintaining their own protected industries. Europe now has the will to rearm but perhaps not the capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, European countries were already lacking in military capabilities, particularly those needed for high-intensity conflict, even before they began sending equipment to Ukraine. This is a liability for NATO, not least because the rate of attrition characterizing the Russia-Ukraine war has underscored the need to rapidly produce basic supplies like munitions and ammunition at scale. Now, Europe likely could not engage in a conventional conflict for more than a handful of days before running short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe’s ability to resolve these problems in a timely manner is in doubt amid reports that its defense industry is already failing to keep up with the demand that Russia’s war has stoked. Fortunately, European countries have pledged to increase defense spending, and the European Union has developed or is developing a raft of initiatives to either reimburse EU countries sending military equipment to Ukraine (such as through the EPF) or to incentivize cooperation (e.g., the European Defense Fund, the European Defence Industry Reinforcement through Common Procurement Act, and the forthcoming European Defence Investment Program). So far, however, three things are not yet clear: the degree to which national defense-spending pledges will turn into actual procurements; whether member states will allocate sufficient funding to the EU initiatives; and whether the funds that do materialize will be spent efficiently, collaboratively, and in such a way that the European defense industry is revitalized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most consequential national development in the defense realm was Germany’s decision to shed its pacifist tendencies and embrace a more active role in Europe’s security order. Chancellor Scholz heralded a Zeitenwende (“change of era”) in his speech to the Bundestag during an extraordinary session only three days after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. He called for a major overhaul of German defense planning, promising to spend 2 percent of the country’s GDP on defense, with the support of an exceptional emergency fund of 100 billion euros to reform the German armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, critics have claimed the German chancellor and government are not up to the task of following through on their historic commitments. First, they argue that Berlin has insufficiently altered the course of its foreign policy, shied away from taking the lead in supporting Ukraine’s efforts to defend its sovereignty, and conceded to supplying Kyiv with critical military supplies only after facing untenable political pressure. Second, they claim that Germany is repeating the mistakes of its past policy of engagement with Russia in its current diplomatic approach to China, epitomized by Scholz being the first Western leader to visit Beijing after the reelection of Xi Jinping as leader of the Chinese Communist Party in October 2022. Lastly, critics blame Berlin for thus far not taking significant concrete steps to differentiate its current defense overhaul from past failed efforts at reform. It has mostly used the emergency fund to buy off-the-shelf U.S. equipment and folded it into the annual defense budget instead of dedicating this money to ambitious national or European defense projects. As it stands, Germany may only reach the 2 percent spending benchmark it has set for itself by 2025 at the earliest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is clear is that 100 billion euros will not solve all the problems plaguing the German armed forces after decades of neglect. Nevertheless, the additional investment will significantly boost the German military and make the country a much stronger defense actor — though how much so remains an open question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;transatlantic-relations-stronger-than-ever&quot;&gt;Transatlantic Relations: Stronger Than Ever?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has significantly strengthened transatlantic relations. In its first year, the Biden administration emphasized the importance of transatlantic ties and struck a significantly more cooperative tone than the Trump administration. Yet it was also clear to Europe that its focus was on China and the Indo-Pacific. Europeans received no warning from the United States regarding the Afghanistan withdrawal; Franco-American relations nearly collapsed over the Australia–United Kingdom–United States (AUKUS) submarine deal in September 2021; and U.S.-German relations were dominated by opposition to the Nord Stream II pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine paused this pivot to Asia, and senior U.S. officials descended on Europe. The war also scuttled the Nord Stream II project and prompted Europeans to dramatically increase defense spending. Furthermore, the incredibly robust U.S. response to the war in Ukraine has demonstrated Washington’s indispensable role in European security. The United States has shown its military and intelligence capabilities through massive security assistance to Ukraine. In a September 2022 survey conducted by the German Marshall Fund, a majority of European respondents believe that EU-U.S. relations will remain stable over the coming five years, while more than a quarter expect ties to become closer. Among the same respondents, support for President Biden’s handling of international affairs is robust in European countries, with particularly strong support in Eastern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is also a danger that 2022 will be a high-water mark for transatlantic relations. The U.S. pivot to Asia is no longer paused, as made clear with the release of the National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy this past September. It is unlikely the United States will be able to maintain the tempo of senior-level visits to Europe or the force posture it inserted into Europe when it looked like Russia might take Ukraine. Given Europe’s dependence, it may react with increasing concern if it feels Washington is not adequately focused on the threats to the continent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-future&quot;&gt;The Future&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Europe’s response to the war has been laudable, several questions remain unanswered. Russia’s invasion has accelerated European countries’ plans to distance themselves from authoritarian regimes and decrease dependencies in critical sectors such as semiconductors and renewable energy. Increased defense commitments are also straining national budgets, as EU member states are forgoing the interoperability benefits and lower costs of joint procurement, opting instead for more expensive off-the-shelf solutions (mostly imported from the United States). This has revived both long-standing debates over greater fiscal and defense integration, as well as regional fissures over EU spending. With ambitious new proposals on the docket in both realms, funding challenges will persist in the new year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will also be a big year for European countries facing presidential and parliamentary elections. Elections are due in Estonia, Montenegro, Bulgaria, Finland, Greece, and Turkey in the first half of 2023 and in Slovakia, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Poland, and Spain in the second half. The elections in Turkey and Poland are by far the most geopolitically significant since their future governments will set the tone of their relations with the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in Hungary last year, the Turkish elections are unlikely to be fair. The six major opposition parties will probably unite behind a consensus candidate to run against President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Public polling suggests that the the country’s severe economic crisis is the most important election issue, reflecting the impact of Erdoğan’s unorthodox and bizarre economic policies — such as cutting (rather than raising) interest rates in the face of growing inflation, which is unofficially estimated to be as high as 170.7 percent. Furthermore, some of his efforts to gain political support, such as by increasing the minimum wage and pensions, have also fueled inflation. In addition, there is a concern that he may escalate tensions with Greece (which is having its own elections the same month) over a disputed island or provoke a fight with NATO over Sweden and Finland. But while it is clear the election will not be fair, the question is how far Erdoğan can go to manipulate it. There is a general expectation among the opposition that the actual vote will be legitimate. Should Erdoğan attempt to steal the election outright, Turkey may erupt in significant civil unrest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poland also goes to the polls in 2023 (likely in October). The populist, right-wing Law and Justice Party is seeking a third term, something no incumbent party has ever done before. According to polling, it is on course to lose its parliamentary majority. Although the Polish government had been on a collision course with the European Union and United States over its efforts to subvert the independence of the judiciary, Polish support for Ukraine, its clairvoyant stance on Russia, its acceptance of millions of Ukrainian refugees, its dramatic increases in defense spending, and its distancing from Viktor Orbán in Hungary have granted the country a temporary reprieve. However, the Polish government has recently turned up the nationalist dial, ferociously attacking Germany, including demanding additional reparations for World War II. The rhetoric will likely stay heated until after the country’s parliamentary elections later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major question for the European Union is whether it will expand its financial capacity and move toward a “fiscal union.” Although it has already created a monetary union with the establishment of the ECB and the euro, it has so far hesitated to move toward closer, permanent fiscal integration. However, pressure for more EU investment or spending to address common European issues will only grow. Washington has increasingly become supportive of the European Union becoming a fiscal actor, with John Kerry, special envoy for climate change, and U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai both encouraging Brussels to emulate the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and invest in fostering clean-technology sectors. The United States also wants the European Union to play a leading role in reconstructing Ukraine. This will require additional resources, in turn prompting important institutional debates that will play out throughout 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the future of European defense is uncertain. The war has revealed huge weaknesses among the continent’s militaries — and although European countries are spending more on defense, this spending is largely uncoordinated. Instead of working together to address common challenges, European defense cooperation has gotten worse over the past decade. Despite the shock caused by the war in Ukraine, there are no major Europe-wide initiatives to significantly improve coordination. Furthermore, the acute threat Russia poses to NATO has dissipated due to the performance of the Ukrainians and the depletion of the Russian military. There is a risk that this will sap Europe’s political momentum to maintain elevated investments in defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In addition, the future of European defense is uncertain. The war has revealed huge weaknesses among the continent’s militaries — and although European countries are spending more on defense, this spending is largely uncoordinated.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coming year — the last before EU parliamentary elections — will be critical to Europe’s future direction. While the outcome of the war remains uncertain, there are many economic and political challenges that will require significant political leadership, vision, and capital. Transatlantic allies should continue strengthening their relationship, using institutional platforms such as the Trade and Technology Council to its fullest while easing trade tensions created by the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act. The following year, 2024, will be tumultuous, with important elections on both sides of the Atlantic and the war in Ukraine likely entering a critical phase. In this context, the political momentum created by the war should be used wisely to resolve existing issues and prepare a united Europe for the challenges that lie ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/QgnVZuL.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，16人否認「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，今（15日）踏入審訊第8天。認罪被告區諾軒今續就九龍東協調會議作供，指有與會者曾製作會議摘要並發送到 WhatsApp 群組，但由於他幾乎每個月有「刪機」習慣，故控方並沒有該檔案作為呈堂證物。區又指無法記得所有文件內容，但指戴提倡「積極運用《基本法》權力，否決財政預算案」一句「應該有喺當時加喺文件裡面」，有被告起哄。此外，辯方屢批評主控周天行以「引導性問題」發問，法官李運騰指他有同樣關注，只是一直等待辯方提出反對，驚訝此前無人提出，惟相信此後控方會更小心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指積極運用基本法權力否決財政預算案一句應該存在&quot;&gt;區指「積極運用《基本法》權力否決財政預算案」一句「應該存在」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續就九龍東協調會議提問，區諾軒昨稱第二次會議曾決定不舉行「初選」，轉為舉行「棄選」，但有地區人士反對。控方今展示 WhatsApp 訊息，顯示當時譚文豪、胡志偉和施德來均認同再考慮舉辦初選，黃之鋒亦曾稱「我都支持初選，希望可以促成初選機制順利進行，唔好五區獨欠九東」。而戴耀廷亦於4月中指九西、港島和新東都同意有投票程序，新界西和超級區議會將在月底前開會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問及第三次會議內容，區供稱當時決定「重新搞返公民投票」，目標在5席贏取3席，亦有初步討論宣傳策略，他亦有報告選舉論壇進度。周天行問會上曾否提及初選目標，惟大律師沈士文即打斷，指上述內容昨天已問過，法官陳慶偉問：「周先生，你是否在重複自己？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周遂改為問會議後有否任何文件紀錄。區諾軒確認，會議翌日時任觀塘區議會主席蔡澤鴻曾在「35+九東立選座談會」的 WhatsApp 群組，傳出名為「35+九東final.docx」的會議摘要，指「昨晚戴教授召開九東立選協調會，會上大家同意進行初選，以上是初步協調結果，我會抽時間做份更詳細的給大家」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指無第三次會議摘要-區解釋有刪機習慣&quot;&gt;控方指無第三次會議摘要 區解釋有「刪機」習慣&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行問區是否能確定有人傳送該文件給他，惟李運騰即指，看不到任何文件，只有一連串數字和符號。周說區確認文件有發出，李運騰反問「但我們有那份文件嗎？」，周確認沒有，何啟明、余慧明等發笑。周天行改為問「初步協調結果」為何，區稱無法記得所有文件內容，但至少可以確認，「積極運用《基本法》權力，否決財政預算案」該句「應該有喺當時加喺文件裡面」，話畢被告欄起哄，柯耀林等人發笑，有被告說：「哇，應該有。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區形容，該摘要是「九龍東咁多次會議黎累積底下嘅一啲討論結果」，而蔡澤鴻兩日後再補發最終版本，並附上戴耀廷就協調會議的補充。李運騰問及，在 WhatsApp 收到文件後，若仍保留手機及該訊息，該文件是否「理應仍然存在」。區解釋，因他「幾乎每個月都有刪機嘅習慣」，「所以起碼我被捕之後嗰個檔案就冇咗。」控方再問他能否確認「積極運用《基本法》權力，否決財政預算案」一句有加入文件，區答：「應該存在。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方關注控方提引導性問題問傳聞證供&quot;&gt;辯方關注控方提「引導性問題」、問傳聞證供&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 其後表示，關注控方以「引導性」的方式提問，即要求證人確認某些事情曾發生，而非問他記得發生過什麼。法官李運騰指他有同樣關注，只是一直等待辯方提出反對，在場人士發笑。Beel 說如果有引導性問題應立即停止，李再指他其實挺驚訝沒有人反對，以為代表辯方沒有爭議，惟現時辯方提出，相信控方會更小心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後展示 WhatsApp 訊息提及，戴耀廷於《明報》發布的一篇文章，問區當時有否看過。區指因「隔得太久遠，我都唔實際記得寫嘅內容，我只能夠推斷佢寫呢篇文嘅動機」，陳志全聞言哈哈大笑。控方再問區有否看過文章，惟大律師石書銘質疑，區並不是戴耀廷，他的回答只會屬傳聞證供（heresay）或猜測（speculation），李運騰指要待區諾軒回答才可判斷。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後引 WhatsApp 紀錄，顯示蔡澤鴻曾提及九東35+初選籌備工作小組經3輪協調會議，「各派成員初步達成共識」。周天行要求區確認曾收到該訊息，大律師 Trevor Beel 再次質疑是引導性提問，法官李運騰再囑控方避免問引導性問題。周改問他曾否收過，區確認於5月收到，而蔡當時引述的「共識」便是「35+九東final」文件內的共識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒稱無出席九東定下初選制度後的兩次會議&quot;&gt;區諾軒稱無出席九東定下初選制度後的兩次會議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指，第三次會議後，九龍東於2020年5月18日及6月中，分別舉行第四次及第五次協調會議，但他沒有出席。他解釋，因當時九東初選制度「已經上咗軌道」，即已決定勝選目標為3席，並會採用公民投票進行初選，「個制度已經喺度啦，咁所以我應該專心做其他事情」，並表示九龍東直至初選投票日前應沒有其他會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;稱無證據何桂藍出席記招-區諾軒即錄第11份口供-辯方批控方重塑證據&quot;&gt;稱無證據何桂藍出席記招 區諾軒即錄第11份口供 辯方批控方重塑證據&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，今甫開庭，代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 即提出，這是他首次參與沒有陪審團、由3名法官審理的高等法院審訊，而法庭任何決定均不應由單一法官作出，惟昨天他反對控方提問時，法官陳慶偉沒有與其餘兩名法官商討便立即拒絕。法官陳仲衡指，若他們有不同立場便會提出；陳慶偉亦指商討並非必須，一般而言會由主審法官決定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 又提及，上周曾指出控方開案陳詞中，沒有證據顯示何桂藍曾於2020年7月的抗爭派記者會出現，惟控方於上周五（10日）即為區諾軒錄取第11份證人供詞，要求他認出記者會上出現的人。Beel 批評控方似乎是在「重塑（remake）」證據，做法不恰當。李運騰指，他同樣關注控方延遲提交證據，「因控方似乎有數以月計、甚至年計的時間準備這案」，並指會考慮該些證據的比重。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，16人否認「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，今（15日）踏入審訊第8天。認罪被告區諾軒今繼續作供，指戴耀廷於首次港島區協調會議上，曾倡積極運用權力否決財政預算案，遭與會的南區區議員司馬文反對，戴嘗試「迎合」他並解釋該權力「可以用，可以唔用」。區又指，即使有分歧，戴仍「好堅持」其想法，並將「會積極運用立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案」一句加入協調機制文件。不過區形容，當時與會者似乎沒有對該想法有積極討論，形容他們對此「漠不關心」。此外，區諾軒稱對與會者取態「冇印象」後，控方一度再追問，惟被法官厲聲打斷：「我知道你不喜歡這個答案，但這就是答案。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2020年3月港島首次會議-司馬文反對戴耀廷倡積極否決財政預算案&quot;&gt;2020年3月港島首次會議 司馬文反對戴耀廷倡積極否決財政預算案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒續就香港島選區的協調會議作供。他供稱，首次會議於2020年3月26日灣仔富德樓香港獨立媒體進行，當時他、戴耀廷、趙家賢、許智峯、羅冠聰、司馬文、羅健熙、人民力量成員，以及同案被告鄭達鴻、徐子見、梁晃維和彭卓棋團隊均有出席，楊雪盈則派了代表出席，眾人並以「35+港島」的 WhatsApp 群組溝通。他重申絕大部分參與初選者都有出席協調會議，又補充「新界西我冇參與過，所以我唔能夠評論新界西嘅事」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區表示，會上先由戴耀廷介紹35+計劃，並與九龍東協調會議一樣，傳閱由戴耀廷準備、名為「35+ 計劃」的文件。他指「特別注意到香港島嘅選票係比較緊張」，民主派派出4人參選，「已經好掹掹緊」，會上決定港島要爭取4席後，司馬文曾建議該區以「投4票」的機制進行初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區又指，當時戴耀廷已開始建議「積極運用《基本法》權力否決財政預算案」，但遭南區區議員司馬文反對。他指戴當時嘗試解釋「積極」一字，意思是「你可以用，你可以唔用，但如果政府唔聽民意，我就使用呢個憲制權力」，以「嘗試迎合司馬文嘅睇法」。在法官詢問下，他指沒有印象戴如何進一步闡述何為「唔聽民意」，但強調戴每次引述都是他上述所記憶的定義。周天行問及會上有否其他反對聲音，區指「相關嘅討論我再冇其他印象」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官要求區諾軒講述事實-而非相信什麼&quot;&gt;官要求區諾軒講述事實 而非「相信」什麼&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後展示「35+ 計劃 Project 35+」的文件，問與會者有否就該文件討論。區表示「我相信重點集中喺第5點」，因該點提及港島區議席數目。惟陳仲衡指，法庭並不關注他「相信什麼」，而是「當時發生什麼事」。李運騰亦問區說「我相信」是代表他不肯定，抑或只是一種說話方式（manner of speech），有被告發笑。陳慶偉補充：「假如我是你的話，我會說『對，重點在第5點』。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續回應：「我認為當日係有討論第5點」，惹來眾人大笑和起哄，有被告說「哇」，身處第一庭觀看直播的黃之鋒亦不斷搖頭。法官李運騰再提醒：「我們懂得怎麼說廣東話，也懂得外行人如何說話（how laymen speak），但我們現時在專業的法庭，如果你肯定便說肯定，不肯定便說不肯定，不記得便說不記得」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒遂改稱「我肯定當日有討論」，並指戴耀廷或許有介紹文件內容，「我相信有部分內容我都有介紹嘅」，解釋會議上凡有關選舉論壇事宜，皆由他介紹，而「有時若果戴耀廷講嘅論點唔足夠，我會作出補充」，但因「時間太久遠」，故沒有印象特別介紹哪一點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區首次會議後戴傳港島協調機制初稿-加積極運用權力否決財政預算案&quot;&gt;區：首次會議後戴傳港島協調機制初稿 加「積極運用權力否決財政預算案」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒提及，首次港島區會議後，戴耀廷曾草擬一份名為「35+立會過半計劃 民主派港島協調機制（初稿）」的文件，個別地傳予每個與會者。控方展示該文件，問戴為何準備。區指他理解文件的存在，是戴耀廷為總結首次會議上的想法而設，他不記得文件上是否每點都曾在會議討論，但戴目的是希望所有人知悉文件內容。李運騰問文件有沒有修改、或有人指出有不正確的地方，區指此乃初稿，「喺往後嘅會議，的確有一啲內容係有另一啲變化嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒指港島區與會者對積極否決財政預算案漠不關心&quot;&gt;區諾軒指港島區與會者對「積極否決財政預算案」漠不關心&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後將「35+ 計劃」及「35+立會過半計劃 民主派港島協調機制（初稿）」兩份文件並置，顯示後者提及「會積極運用立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案」，區重申是司馬文在首次會議反對的想法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續問，若當時有不同意見，為何新一份文件有該說法。區解釋，因戴耀廷在每個會議「都好堅持講佢嘅諗法，然後將佢對35+嘅諗法，加入去協調機制嘅內容裡面」，但區指，當時與會人士並未對該想法有很積極的討論，「我相信係因為大家未意識到⋯⋯」陳仲衡此時再打斷，提醒不是在問他「相信」什麼，區即指：「我只能話喺當時嘅會議，與會人士漠不關心」，又指「如果真係有人關心，我會有好深印象」，他在往後的會議亦會引述有關情況。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，是否代表第一次會議的出席者對「會積極運用立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案」這一點沒有共識？區回答：「與會人士諗法存在分歧。」李再指：「那即是沒有共識？」區諾軒確認，但同意該句還是由戴耀廷加入文件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方大律師馬維騉一度指出，傳譯主任將「漠不關心」翻譯為「totally ignored」，希望更正為「indifferent」，惟法官李運騰提議改做「they did not care」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;港島共辦5次會議-羅冠聰料無法入閘提議靈童制作替補制&quot;&gt;港島共辦5次會議 羅冠聰料無法入閘提議「靈童制」作替補制&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方後再問及，除司馬文外，港島區會上是否沒有其他人對否決財政預算案提出異議，區同意。法官陳慶偉再問，那有沒有人表明不關心否決財政預算案，區則表示「冇印象」。周天行再追問他沒有印象是什麼意思，惟法官陳慶偉即厲聲打斷：「沒有印象，多謝，我知道你不喜歡這個答案，但這就是答案。（“No recollection, thank you. I know you don’t like the answer, but this is the answer.”）」被告欄傳出笑聲。法官李運騰亦指，「如果證人說沒有印象，我不認為還可以繼續問下去」，周說因不肯定區指「冇印象」是指有否發生，李運騰再反問：「如果已經說了沒有印象，他還怎樣告訴你其他人說過什麼？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指，港島區共有4次協調會議，他有份主持所有會議。第二次和第三次會議分別於2020年4月17日及5月19日舉行，出席人數與首次大致相同，袁嘉蔚於第三次會議才出現，徐子見缺席其中一次，至於戴耀廷則不肯定有否出席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方要求他由第二次會議內容說起，惟區指他「真係分唔到邊次係第二次講、邊次係第三次講」，問：「請問我可唔可以兩次一齊講？」他其後指，第二或第三次會議上，關於替補機制有較大爭議，其中楊雪盈和徐子見傾向以「排名制」作為替補機制；羅冠聰則預算自己很大機會無法「入閘」，故傾向採用「靈童制」，在他無法參選時指定袁嘉蔚出選。會議最後協調以「靈童制」作港島替補機制。當區提及羅冠聰指定袁嘉蔚參選，在延伸庭的袁將頭仰後，並摸了一下額頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區表示第四次會議於2020年6月舉行，時間很短，基本上有份參加初選的人士都有出席。他指，當時一直有找香港民意研究所合作設計初選投票程式的戴耀廷，與程式公司溝通後，發現無法處理投4票的選項，故望港島有份參與人士「考慮由4票轉返1票」，區形容「與會者無奈接受」。區續指，初選舉行後，於2020年7月有第5次會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，16人否認「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，今（15日）踏入審訊第8天。認罪被告區諾軒續就九龍西的初選協調會議作供，他憶述其中一名與會者張崑陽提及戴耀廷的文章〈真攬炒十步 這是香港宿命〉，戴重申「參選立法會要有心理準備做唔到4年」。張崑陽又表示支持否決財政預算案，惟岑子杰提出質疑，指「講抗爭，邊有人及得上社民連」，但他仍要支持民生議案包括全民退休保障。區諾軒又表示：「當我睇到呢篇文章，曾經同佢（戴耀廷）講，我話佢嘅想法太瘋狂。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;政治聯繫尷尬者能否參選-戴只要認同五大訴求便可&quot;&gt;政治聯繫「尷尬」者能否參選？ 戴：只要認同「五大訴求」便可&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒下午就九龍西協調會議作供。他指首兩次會議分別於2020年3月24日及4月26日舉行，首次會議出席者除了他之外，還有戴耀廷、何啟明、劉偉聰、馮達浚、岑子杰、黃碧雲助理、毛孟靜助理、油尖旺區議會主席林健文及前立法會議員劉小麗。社區前進的代表有出席第一次會議，至於趙家賢則不肯定有否出席。區交代上述各人的政治聯繫後，再表示：「依家補充返，有個人都有出席兩次會議：張崑陽。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒憶述，會議曾討論的議題包括政治聯繫較「尷尬」的人，例如新思維的狄志遠，是否可以參與初選。傳譯主任一度翻譯「尷尬」為「embarrassed」，惟區諾軒隨即指正應譯為「ambiguous」。區續指，戴耀廷當時回答是，「只要認同『五大訴求』就可以參選。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區指戴耀廷九西會議提否決財政預算-未得到太大關注&quot;&gt;區指戴耀廷九西會議提否決財政預算 「未得到太大關注」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒指，會上亦曾討論九龍西選區的目標，戴耀廷認為6席裡民主派最多可以贏得4席，而與會者認為九西做法可以較寬鬆，可容許初選推薦4至6張名單參選正式的立法會選舉，直至選舉後期才棄選。會上另有討論初選論壇。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區指，戴耀廷亦在會議提及「積極運用《基本法》權力，否決財政預算案」，做法與早前提及其他區的會議差不多，即會上先傳閱「35+計劃」的文件，會後再傳閱另一份九龍西協調機制的文件，並指「就我記憶，當時有關字眼並未得到太大關注」。控方再問戴耀廷是否曾就此「討論」，區更正說法，指準確而言應是戴「介紹」該權力「可以用，可以唔用」，若政府不聽民意就可動用，但他沒有印象其他人參與討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區憶述岑子杰質疑否決財案-因需支持民生議案&quot;&gt;區憶述岑子杰質疑否決財案 因需支持民生議案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於第二次協調會議，區諾軒指出席人士與首次會議相若，其中劉小麗沒有出席。會上曾討論邀請區議員辦事處和「黃店」作為票站，又集中討論應派多少張名單參選立法會，與會者認為應先投票，再於初選後討論推薦出選名單數目，並以5席為目標。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區又指，張崑陽曾提及有留意戴耀廷的文章〈真攬炒十步 這是香港宿命〉，引發戴在該會議重申文章理念，認為「參選立法會要有心理準備做唔到4年」。張崑陽回應他支持否決財政預算案，惟社民連岑子杰即提出質疑，稱：「講抗爭，邊有人及得上社民連」，但他亦要支持某些民生議案，例如全民退休保障，在延伸庭的黃之鋒聞言一度發笑。惟區對其他人有否表達意見沒有印象。傳譯主任打算翻譯「全民退休保障」一字時遲疑數秒，法官見狀即指出「universal retirement scheme」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒攬炒十步想法太瘋狂&quot;&gt;區諾軒：「攬炒十步」想法「太瘋狂」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區指就着會議不同看法，戴耀廷再重申他使用「積極運用」字眼的用意，「由此可見，佢用呢個字眼處理會議上面唔同觀點。」控方其後問及，區有否看過〈真攬炒十步〉一文，區指在文章刊出不久後讀過，戴亦曾向他講過一次，並補充「喺度我想加個註腳」：「當我睇到呢篇文章，曾經同佢（戴耀廷）講，我話佢嘅想法太瘋狂。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/8zjxbq3.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，16人否認「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，今（15日）踏入審訊第8天。認罪被告區諾軒今繼續作供，他提及在新界東第二次協調會議上，鄒家成曾質問戴耀廷，為何初選文件的條款，要稱「積極」運用基本法權力否決財政預算案，而非「會」否決預算案，並引起激烈辯論；而社民連曾稱若有全民退保等民生項目，亦會支持預算案。區又指，鄒家成希望即場投票用「積極」還是「會」字眼，但最後不成事，戴解釋用「積極」一字「比乜都唔用行前一步」，「希望寫得彈性少少。」法官陳慶偉問到，鄒是否想有一個「較確定」運用否決權的說法，區同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷新東會上提五大訴求為目標無印象有否傳閱35計劃文件&quot;&gt;戴耀廷新東會上提「五大訴求」為目標、無印象有否傳閱35+計劃文件&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒下午就新界東協調會議作供，他指曾出席兩次新界東協調會議，分別於2020年4月14日及5月5日，每次各約20人出席。有參加初選的出席者包括：鄒家成、何桂藍、柯耀林、李芝融、呂智恆及劉頴匡，部分人派助理或代表出席，包括民主黨林卓廷派莊榮輝、社民連梁國雄派陳寶瑩、新民主同盟范國威派關永業、人民力量陳志全派助理、公民黨楊岳橋派助理。而沒有參加初選的與會者，包括：區諾軒、戴耀廷、趙家賢、鍾錦麟、時任沙田區議會主席程張迎、羅庭德、羅庭輝、街工代表盧藝賢。至於參加初選的林景楠兩次均沒有出席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區表示，第一次會議中，戴耀廷介紹新東當選目標，希望在9席之中贏到6席，亦表示預設公民投票及棄選機制，並討論舉辦選舉論壇，但區沒有印象有否傳閱九龍東和港島會議均有傳閱的「35+計劃」文件。區亦指，「相信」戴曾提及「五大訴求」，指五大訴求是35+初選爭取的其中一個目標，法官陳仲衡提他勿用「我相信」，他遂改稱「佢係有講過」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黃浩銘曾致電區稱不要答應否決預算案&quot;&gt;黃浩銘曾致電區稱不要答應否決預算案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區供稱，5月5日的第二次會議前，社民連副主席黃浩銘曾致電他，說「陣間開會，唔好應承人哋會否決財政預算案嘅講法」。陳慶偉問黃為何如此說，區解釋其實他當時不太知道會議將發生什麼事，但黃的說話令他思考待會是否有人會討論該問題，他並回應他「知悉（acknowledge）」其意見，但對其餘對話沒有印象。黃最後沒有出席會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒家成質問戴耀廷為何用積極而非會字&quot;&gt;鄒家成質問戴耀廷為何用「積極」而非「會」字&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指，第二次會議開始後不久，鄒家成就質問戴耀廷，為何在35+計劃中，要稱「積極」運用基本法權力否決財政預算案，而非直接表示「會」否決財政預算案。法官李運騰問及他如何理解鄒的話，區指鄒當時應是察悉在協調機制內有「積極運用權力」的條文，並指當時戴耀廷在不同地區的協調會議，「不斷地建議加入『積極運用《基本法》權力否決財政預算案』嘅條款」，他不知道有多少人知悉該句子及當中的爭議，但當時若有人知道並作討論，「喺當時嘅狀況可以理解」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;與會者開始激烈辯論並批評傳統泛民&quot;&gt;與會者開始激烈辯論並批評傳統泛民&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;傳譯主任一度將「質問」翻譯為「query」和「question」，法官李運騰遂問，鄒家成當時的語氣是敵對（hostile）還是普通疑問。區表示「我理解當時候最初都未係好緊張」，只是鄒與戴進行對話，但後來卻引伸到與會人士開始有「激烈辯論」。他指，會上許多其他地區人士亦有參與討論，並對傳統泛民政黨作出批評，包括民主黨、街工以及公民黨。鄒家成邊聽邊點頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴稱用積極是望彈性少少-區同意鄒家成想更明確運用否決權&quot;&gt;戴稱用「積極」是望「彈性少少」 區同意鄒家成想更明確運用否決權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指，當民主黨被批評時，林卓廷助理莊榮輝表示，民主黨中委會無授權他處理有關問題；而社民連代表陳寶瑩亦質疑，若有民生項目例如全民退保，社民連亦會支持。街工盧藝賢則有回應不同意，但區不記得他實際所說的話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區指，鄒家成其後希望即場投票，決定文件用「積極」還是「會」的字眼，但最後「唔成事」。而戴耀廷的回應是「不如用『積極』，『積極』都比乜都唔用行前一步，希望可以寫得彈性少少」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ChhJ0NV.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;
▲ 鄒家成&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡續問，「『會積極』運用權力於4時半休庭」，和「『會』運用權力於4時半休庭」 ，哪個意思較為「肯定（certain）」？區指「『會』係較為確定」和直接（straightforward）。法官陳慶偉最後問到，以區理解，鄒是否想更明確運用否決權力（“… he wants a more definitive use of vetoing power?”），區說「係有呢個含意」。陳慶偉續說區可以離席，「我們絕對會休庭。（“We will definitely adjourn.”）」被告欄和旁聽席傳來笑聲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明早續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表包括資深大律師潘熙、大律師沈士文、張耀良、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等，本身是大律師的劉偉聰則自辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪被告包括獲准保釋的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信10人，及還柙的何桂藍、吳政亨、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及余慧明6人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/eTZ8cP2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（14日）於西九龍裁判法院（暫代高院）續審。首名控方證人、同案認罪被告區諾軒今繼續作供，供稱戴耀廷2020年1月飯局曾明確提及取得立會過半後要「兩次否決財政預算案，解散立法會，令行政長官下台」，惟因當時不清楚其他團體是否願意參與初選，故與戴耀廷於2月至3月期間，分別或一起與政黨及有意參選者會面，包括公民黨、梁晃維、黃之鋒、朱凱廸、彭卓棋和劉頴匡等。其中公民黨有人曾對電子投票有保留，因認為可能有利較激進的候選人當選；黃之鋒則認為區將要離港留學，認為他「冇必要搞初選」，區解釋黃意見與初選無關，「佢只係以朋友嘅身分去忠告我啫。」在延伸庭的黃之鋒聞言後搖頭苦笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區又提及，與梁晃維見面時從無提及戴耀廷否決財政預算案的想法，因「我唔認為初選要係一個綑綁議員當選後工作嘅計劃」，又指當時環境當選人會否用《基本法》權力否決預算案並非值得關心的議題，因該否決權在《基本法》訂明，過往許多民主派議員反對財政預算案亦「一路相安無事」。法官李運騰要求區停止發表演說，以善用法庭時間。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區戴指大殺傷力憲制武器為兩次否決財政預算解散立會令特首下台&quot;&gt;區：戴指「大殺傷力憲制武器」為兩次否決財政預算、解散立會令特首下台&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;架黑色粗框眼鏡、穿灰色毛衣的區諾軒，今在3名懲教陪同下，經特別通道出庭作供，全程被懲教人員看守。區昨日供稱，於2020年1月尾與戴耀廷、李永達、李卓人和黃浩銘的飯局內，首次談及初選，戴並指若立會過半，將是「大殺傷力憲制武器」，可利用《基本法》賦予的權力行使否決權，包括否決財政預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒今指，關於「大殺傷力憲制武器」的說法，可參考戴耀廷3月尾在《蘋果日報》發布的文章。惟法官陳仲衡提醒，現時證供仍圍繞1月飯局，尚未到3月的文章，法官李運騰亦要求他直接引述與會者說法，並問戴耀廷在飯局上有否提及「大殺傷力憲制武器」，區確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區其後欲再引3月的文章以助闡析戴的論述，惟法官陳仲衡再次打斷，指現時有如問及肥皂劇情節，正在說第一集時，區不應以第20集的內容解釋第一集內容，「我們仍然在第一集。」區遂說，「咁我不如直接講」，指戴耀廷當時闡述「大殺傷力憲制武器」，是指「兩次否決財政預算案，解散立法會，令行政長官下台」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區會上討論民主動力負責初選行政工作&quot;&gt;區：會上討論民主動力負責初選行政工作&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒續指，當時曾討論如何安排初選行政工作，而李永達認為「民主動力」過往曾進行初選和泛民主派協調工作，他們討論民主動力可負責收集報名表及作出宣傳，他遂在會面後聯絡民主動力召集人趙家賢，指「搵佢係順理成章嘅事」。區並指，因當時他完成立法會議員公職，有一段長時間在香港，李永達建議他任初選協調人與戴耀廷合作推動初選，他表明同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;對初選構想有分歧-遂接觸其他有意參選者及政治團體&quot;&gt;對初選構想有分歧 遂接觸其他有意參選者及政治團體&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主控周天行問，飯局後區諾軒與戴耀廷有否就推行初選計劃作商討。區指當時面對的問題，是不清楚應用「民調」抑或「公民投票」的機制，並提及飯局有一個「重點分歧」，就是不知道其他政治團體是否願意參與初選，特別是李永達與李卓人都不同意舉行公民投票，「因為當你連其他團體肯唔肯參加都傾唔成嘅時候，公民投票所用嘅資源，一定比淨係做一個民調貴同代價高，選舉申報都會多。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;他續指，當時討論認為需進一步接觸有意參選立法會的民主派人士，而由於對初選構想有分歧，故透過李永達與李卓人聯絡梁家傑，望由他介紹與公民黨會面。最終於2020年2月，他、戴耀廷、李永達和李卓人一起與梁家傑會面，會上戴耀廷重複其立會過半的願景，但不確定有否詳細提及否決預算案令行政長官下台的步驟。區續引述梁家傑稱，由於他已退下前線政治工作，故轉介他們去公民黨執委會會面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區戴赴公民黨執委會-公民黨對電子票有保留因或有利激進者當選&quot;&gt;區戴赴公民黨執委會 公民黨對電子票有保留因或有利激進者當選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒續指，於2020年2月與戴耀廷兩人，往公民黨炮台山總部的執委會介紹初選工作，當時有約10名執委在場，他記得的公民黨成員包括梁家傑、賴仁彪、譚文豪、陳淑莊和余若薇。區指，當時將1月飯局提出的想法諮詢公民黨意見，包括應做民調還是公民投票、公民投票要投電子票還是實體票、他們是否同意協調各區出選等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區憶述，戴在會上再次提及對立會過半的願景，並提及運用《基本法》權力，兩次否決財政預算案並解散立法會，「最壞嘅後果」是行政長官下台。惟他形容，陳淑莊對戴耀廷說法「有保留」，因公民黨當時望推林瑞華參選功能組別飲食界，而功能組別會因界別利益，在處理財政預案的議題與地區直選有「唔同嘅諗法」，故考慮是否否決財政預算案時「會有較大嘅困難」。他又指，公民黨有人對只用電子票進行公民投票有保留，因若只是網上投票，其政治後果「可能係有利較激進嘅候選人當選」。他表示，對於初選計劃，公民黨「並冇話支持，只係話會後考慮」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區與梁晃維黃子悅會面介紹初選-無提及否決財政預算案&quot;&gt;區與梁晃維、黃子悅會面介紹初選 無提及否決財政預算案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指，與公民黨執委會面後，在2020年2月至3月期間，他與戴耀廷各自與「有機會參與立法會選舉的民主派人士」會面，他本人曾與梁晃維、黃子悅、黃之鋒、朱凱廸4人會面。此時坐在延伸庭觀看直播的梁晃維、黃之鋒、朱凱迪3人聞言後竊笑，梁晃維轉身望向黃之鋒，再與朱凱廸交談。區指，他分開會見梁晃維及黃子悅，而黃之鋒及朱凱廸則是一同會面。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 朱凱廸（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區憶述，他於2020年2月在梁晃維的議員辦事處與他會面，當時可能有梁的議員助理在場，但只有他與梁對話。他當時問及梁有否興趣參與初選，並只是解釋初選是揀選民主派代表的制度，但因為「我唔認為初選要係一個綑綁議員當選後工作嘅計劃」，故從無提及戴耀廷提出否決財政預算案等想法。區指，梁當時並無回應是否參與初選，只是稱如有進一步資訊，區可再與他聯絡。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指，他於2020年2月至3月左右於黃子悅會面，向她介紹一樣的內容，並簡單介紹民主派如要在立法會「再下一城」可如何實現。黃向他提及「想知道初選係乜嘢嚟」，他認為據其印象，黃當時「只係想了解初選究竟係乜嘢嚟」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區與黃之鋒朱凱迪會面-黃作為朋友認為無必要舉辦初選&quot;&gt;區與黃之鋒、朱凱迪會面 黃作為朋友認為無必要舉辦初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續憶述，他於2020年2月至3月左右，在朱凱廸於立法會的議員辦事處內，與黃之鋒及朱凱廸會面。區形容會面「好唔正式」，因朱當時正參與立法會會議。區續指，他向二人提及他與戴耀廷將會舉辦初選，並指初選是為民主派於立法會爭取最大勝算的計劃。區指，當時朱凱廸「因為掛住開立法會，所以佢唔係好關心（初選）」，而黃之鋒則「直情覺得我冇必要去搞初選𠻹」，因當時區「就嚟去讀書」，「佢直情唔贊成我搞初選𠻹。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰一度問，區只是任初選籌劃者，而非參加者，將要離港讀書與不搞初選有何關係，區遂說：「其實黃之鋒嘅意見係同初選無關，佢只係以朋友嘅身分去忠告我啫。」黃之鋒聞言後搖頭苦笑，梁晃維則望向身旁的譚凱邦，坐在延伸庭的公眾人士則望向被告發笑。區續指，他不記得他當時有何回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區戴稱與張可森鄒家成等見面-辯方反對傳聞證供無效&quot;&gt;區：戴稱與張可森、鄒家成等見面 辯方反對「傳聞證供」無效&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主控周天行再問及區諾軒，戴耀廷與何人會面。區表示他不肯定戴與誰會面，但指戴提及曾與張可森、呂智恆、鄒家成、天水連線成員、區政聯盟成員、民主黨成員會面。惟他不清楚戴分開或一同與上述人士會面，亦不記得上述政黨有什麼成員參與會面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行續問，戴耀廷有否告訴他會面內容，此時何桂藍的代表大律師 Trevor Beel 起身反對，指屬傳聞證供（heresay），惟法官陳慶偉僅說：「No. Allow.」周天行遂繼續發問，區回應戴沒向他提及討論內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區彭卓棋關心勝算多於否決預算案-稱基本法訂明否決權故當時不關心&quot;&gt;區：彭卓棋關心勝算多於否決預算案 稱《基本法》訂明否決權故當時不關心&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒續指，2月至3月期間與戴耀廷會見彭卓棋和劉頴匡團隊，其中彭卓棋團隊包括維多利亞社區協會的李永財，會面在天后的李永財議員辦事處進行。會上他與戴介紹初選計劃並徵詢使用電子票抑或實體票等，戴有提及立會過半願景，即民主派可掌握否決權，但至於有否詳細闡述整個流程，即否決財政預算案及特首下台，則沒有清晰印象。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主控周天行一度要求區諾軒闡述戴有關初選目的之說法。區回應「我相信大家都好關心戴耀廷究竟嗰時具體嘅論述講咗啲乜」，並指2021年8月落口供時憶述戴耀廷對立會過半的表述，初選目的具體而言就是爭取立會過半以爭取否決權，再爭取五大訴求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行遂問，戴初選的目標為何，惟陳慶偉打斷指區已回答是取得立會過半、否決財政預算案及爭取五大訴求；周天行再問有否提及否決財政預算案，官再打斷指區已表示沒有印象。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒續形容，彭當時「唔關心立會過半點運用權力嘅問題」，但關心使用電子票或實體票，「因為用乜嘢制度對佢嘅勝算係有影響嘅。」被問到為何不關心如何運用立會過半的權力，他指因當時參選立法會的環境，大家並不認為當選人會否用《基本法》權力否決預算案是「好值得關心的議題」，並提出「兩個觀察」，即《基本法》第49條和第52條有提及運用該否決權，「大家就覺得好理所當然」；而且以往許多民主派政黨或議員，「一路都係每一次財政預算案都係投反對票，一路都係相安無事。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官着區諾軒停止發表演說善用時間&quot;&gt;官着區諾軒停止發表演說、善用時間&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區在法官陳仲衡詢問下同意，上述均是他的「整體觀察」，並非會面上確實提及。法官李運騰遂指，「區先生，你要了解你作為證人的身份，若你停止發表演說並集中回答問題，可以節省我們許多時間（“It would save us a lot of time if you stop making speeches and concentrate on the question.”）」，又說「我們每天只有4小時審訊時間，所以請協助我們善用時間，否則我們會審到明年（“We only have 4 hours of sitting time every day, so please help us to use the time economically, otherwise we will be here until next year.”）」，有被告發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續在法官詢問下，指彭卓棋在會上曾表示實體投票會對他「不利」，因他是「政治素人」，相較傳統政黨會較少地區動員能力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Z9wIMCx.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
▲ 彭卓棋（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於與劉頴匡的會面，是2020年3月在大圍一間餐廳，區憶述戴耀廷當時介紹初選制度、如何爭取立會過半，亦提及立會過半可以爭取否決權，以爭取五大訴求，但記不清楚他有否談及所撰文章及闡述其他內容。他亦不記得會上說過什麼或劉頴匡會上回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下午續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/roKI78N.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，16人否認「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，今（14日）踏入審訊第7天。認罪被告區諾軒今繼續作供，提及因有意參選者就投票方式、替補被「DQ」者機制等有分歧，遂與戴耀廷為5個地方選區及超級區議會選區舉辦協調會議。就九龍東選區，區供稱曾舉行3場會議，會上黃之鋒與譚得志曾就替補機制爭拗，又一度決定搞「棄選」但被推翻。區又指，戴耀廷曾準備名為「35+計劃」的文件於會上傳閱，提及「五大訴求，缺一不可」及初選機制等，戴並曾倡加入「積極運用《基本法》權力否決財政預算案」一句，意指「你可以用，你可以唔用，但若果政府唔聽民意，就要拎呢個憲制權力出嚟」，惟其後被另一份文件取代。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，被問及會議出席者，區諾軒一度稱「我驚我背漏」，有被告面露驚訝和發笑，法官李運騰即提醒區：「你不是來背誦任何事情，你是來告訴我們你記得什麼。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區戴組織6區協調會議-商討辦選舉論壇替補機制等分歧&quot;&gt;區戴組織6區協調會議 商討辦選舉論壇、替補機制等分歧&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒上午供稱，2020年2月至3月期間，與戴耀廷分別或一同與民主派政黨及有意參選立法會人士會面，解說初選及徵詢意見。他續指，二人在2至3月，於教協商討如何進一步整理有意參選者意見，當中就投票方式，傳統政黨較堅持用實體票，素人或新晉團體則擔心初選只是對泛民有利，較喜歡電子票；而二人當時亦未正式決定舉辦公民投票，因素人特別擔心會「招致好大額嘅選舉開支」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區又指，有團體質疑是否值得舉辦初選、開支是否合理，而當時多區有多名潛在參選人，「佢哋都未有機會一齊傾。」有見及此，他遂與戴耀廷在香港島、九龍東、九龍西、新界東、新界西及超級區議會6個選區，組織協調會議以商討相關分歧，並指會議目的是「焦聚」各區有意參選民主派人士，「一齊傾一個制度去推行初選」，包括應否舉辦選舉論壇、勝選人被取消資格有何替補機制，及每區當選目標。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行向區澄清，該些事項是否均於協調會議討論，區答「的確有」，並問：「因為啱啱咁問，係咪我有任何遺漏內容……？」周天行否認，指僅望了解區的證供，鄒家成低頭搖頭苦笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區邀有意參選者入whatsapp群-黃之鋒譚得志等出席九東會議&quot;&gt;區：邀有意參選者入WhatsApp群 黃之鋒、譚得志等出席九東會議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒確認，當時與戴耀廷合辦6區的協調會議，並以九龍東為第一個試點。就九龍東協調會議，區供稱，首次會議於2020年3月2日順安邨安逸樓地下會議室進行。控方要求他說出有誰出席，區諾軒說「我驚我背漏，但我先講原則上先……」。被告欄傳出起哄聲音，多名被告探頭望向區，面露驚訝的林卓廷與身旁的鄒家成對視，鄒難以置信地俯身大笑，陳志全等也發笑，區定睛望向被告欄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰即提醒區：「你不是來背誦任何事情，你是來告訴我們你記得什麼。（“You are not here to recite anything, you are here to tell us what you can remember.”）」坐在延伸庭的馮達浚聞言後發笑。區續指，基本上所有最後參選人或其代表都有出席協調會議，另各區的泛民主派區議會主席亦有出席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指，當時他或戴耀廷會透過 WhatsApp 或電話、或委託相熟的區議會主席，逐個詢問有意參選者有否興趣出席協調會議，並在各區設立 WhatsApp 群組商討地區協調事宜。他並主動提及，九龍東的邀請過程「可以參照民主動力被繳獲嗰個 WhatsApp 紀錄」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後展示從趙家賢手機檢取的 WhatsApp 紀錄，顯示九龍東協調群組名為「35+九東立選座談會」，群組管理員為蔡澤鴻，成員包括區諾軒、趙家賢、施德來、註明來自香港公開大學的黃之鋒、譚文豪、胡志偉、譚得志、民主動力職員黎敬輝。區確認除上述人士外，時任黃大仙區議會副主席黃逸旭、觀塘願景召集人梁凱晴亦有出席首次會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區首次九東會議-戴耀廷未提初選目標-黃之鋒與譚得志就替補機制爭拗&quot;&gt;區：首次九東會議 戴耀廷未提初選目標 黃之鋒與譚得志就替補機制爭拗&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主控周天行問及會議內容，區諾軒指舉行首次會議的意義，在於「如果喺九龍東都冇辦法傾得成一個機制呢，其他區都只會更難」，因九龍東選區只有5席，民主派的目標為3席，可浪費的票數少。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大律師沈士文一度指出，傳譯主任遺漏了「九龍東選區有5席」的部分，法官李運騰遂向區表示，「傳譯主任的工作非常艱難，因為你的句子傾向冗長（wordy），並牽涉不少難以翻譯的人名及政黨名稱」，並着區「逐句逐句回答，這會令傳譯主任的工作更容易，正如我現在一樣」，有被告發笑，區諾軒亦表示「抱歉」，「我會努力。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指，首次會議上商討「3席係民主派喺九龍東勝算嘅目標」，亦討論是否舉辦初選論壇，他表示他將籌備。他並提及，替補機制為初選制度內很重要的元素，而當時會上主要矛盾是黃之鋒與譚得志就替補機制的爭拗，黃認為應採用「靈童制」，譚則認為應採用「排名制」。提及「靈童」時陳志全、鄒家成等多名被告發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區解釋，「靈童制」是指勝出候選人若被取消資格，將有權利指定一位替補者獲35+機制承認繼續參選，而其他不獲該候選人支持的參選人則不會獲承認。惟譚得志團隊不同意，認為應按初選投票結果排名，若勝出者被取消資格，便由次選者，即排後一位的候選人，替補參選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區戴準備35計劃文件-寫有五大訴求缺一不可及初選機制&quot;&gt;區：戴準備「35+計劃」文件 寫有「五大訴求，缺一不可」及初選機制&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒並指，雖戴耀廷有出席首次會議，但他只處理是否舉辦選舉論壇、有何替補機制、九龍東勝選目標等事宜，當時未有透露「他相信的」初選目的。而會議上傳閱一份由戴耀廷準備、名為「35+ 計劃／Project 35+」的文件，為35+計劃的「最原初版本」，目的為介紹初選機制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;庭上展示相關文件，控方指文件第一段提及「五大訴求，缺一不可」，而戴耀廷於第二及三段訂下時序，分別說明有意參選者須於2020年5月中公開表明意向，及2020年7月初會舉行公投。戴在文件亦列明，民主派於各地方選區目標議席為「6 6 4 4 3」、替補機制為「排名制」，且若候選人支持度不足，須即時停止選舉工程，並支持其他勝選者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區指出，除黃之鋒反對「排名制」的替補機制，無印象其他人就文件作任何回應。他並指，蔡澤鴻曾為該會議製作摘要，並傳送到 WhatsApp 群組。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區第二次會議決議靈童制作替補機制不搞初選搞棄選&quot;&gt;區：第二次會議決議「靈童制」作替補機制、不搞初選搞「棄選」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒供稱，第二次九龍東協調會議於2020年3月16日晚上7時半舉行，出席人士與上次相若，惟原由譚得志代表的人民力量，改由劉家鴻代表。區提及，蔡澤鴻會前希望邀請地區組織「凝聚觀塘」列席，遭黃之鋒反對。坐在延伸庭的黃之鋒聞言後發笑，並與前一排的譚凱邦交談。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指，眾人於該會議達成共識，以「靈童制」取代「排名制」作為替補機制；並決定不舉行初選，轉為舉行「棄選」（即參選人在立法會競選後期透過民調形式決定是否繼續選舉工程）。他不確定會上曾否談及初選目的，但相信不遲於第三次會議前，有更進一步關於35+初選目的之討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區第三次九東會議議決辦初選-惟傳whatsapp群表決內容搵唔到&quot;&gt;區：第三次九東會議議決辦初選 惟傳WhatsApp群表決內容「搵唔到」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒續表示，第二次會議決定不搞初選後，有九龍東的地區人士包括區議員或義工，望能舉辦公民投票，故於4月推動重開會議商討九龍東舉辦初選的可能，第三次會議遂於2020年5月4日舉行，出席人士大致相同，但加入觀塘區議會副主席莫建成及李梓成。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區指，會議議決九龍東可有5名候選人於初選出選，最後有3名爭取當選。李運騰問及是否與「6 6 4 4 3」的計劃相違，區否認，指3席仍是九龍東目標，但容許更多名單參選，是因經會上的人商議，「認為可以浪費嘅選票嘅額度都頗多。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區確定會上曾討論重辦初選及如何宣傳初選，李運騰問有否任何書面決議，區答「理論上係有」，在 WhatsApp 群組「有個 file 傳到出嚟，但係最後喺呢單案度搵唔到 」，有被告發笑。至於有否討論初選目的，區指「唔排除有，但我唔敢100%確定」，但肯定在其中一次會議一定有討論初選目的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區戴耀廷倡文件加積極運用基本法權力否決財政預算案&quot;&gt;區：戴耀廷倡文件加「積極運用《基本法》權力否決財政預算案」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒續提出，在不遲於第三次會議，戴耀廷曾倡議在地區文件加入一句句子，即「積極運用《基本法》權力否決財政預算案」：「佢嘅解釋係：『你可以用，你可以唔用；但若果政府唔聽民意，就要拎呢個憲制權力出嚟。』」陳慶偉問與會者對此句有否任何回應，區指「冇印象邊個有特別回應」，又指該句原於第三次會議前加入九東文件，但到了2020年6月又被一份新文件取代，他亦不肯定在第三次會議上曾否討論該句內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，是否即會上沒有人對該句表示同意或反對，區表示「我認為呢句係一個公道嘅說話」。他續指，認為該句話與戴耀廷的立會過半願景有關，但要理解則要結合第三次九東會議前其他區的會議情況。法官問及，戴在會上如何解釋該句句子，區稱：「九龍東佢具體點樣推銷呢一句句子，我冇好鮮明嘅印象。但就我記得，佢喺各區都有推動呢句句子成為會議文件嘅一部分。」法官指，明天將會處理該議題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下午4時半散庭，有被告喊「情人節快樂！」，吳政亨亦做出心形手勢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;傳譯主任屢被糾正-辯方批譯漏重要字眼&quot;&gt;傳譯主任屢被糾正 辯方批譯漏重要字眼&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，以中文作供的區諾軒，今再次與法官、主控周天行及辯方大律師等不時糾正法庭傳譯主任的翻譯。其中區供稱戴耀廷於首次九東會議「尚未透露他相信的初選目的」，傳譯主任僅譯出「初選目的」，而未有提「他相信的」，遭代表吳政亨和余慧明的大律師石書銘指出，指該部分「非常重要」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而區諾軒提及 WhatsApp 群組包含「35+九東」字眼時，傳譯主任直譯「Kow Tung」，周天行指出應是「Kowloon East」，被告欄再傳出笑聲。至區提及「排名制」時，傳譯主任一度猶豫：「排名制即係……」，區提議「ranking」，獲傳譯主任接納。傳譯主任將「就要拎呢個憲制權力出嚟」一句翻譯為「this constitutional power should be “taken out”」，周天行糾正應為「exercised」，陳慶偉則提議「used」，獲眾人接納。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明早續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件編號：HCCC69/2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;列席認罪被告全於延伸庭被告欄就坐&quot;&gt;列席認罪被告全於延伸庭被告欄就坐&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表包括資深大律師潘熙、大律師沈士文、張耀良、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等，本身是大律師的劉偉聰則自辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪被告包括獲准保釋的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信10人，及還柙的何桂藍、吳政亨、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及余慧明6人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;列席的認罪被告今續被分別帶到沒有記者、只有公眾席的1號及2號延伸法庭被告欄觀看直播，包括黃之鋒、朱凱廸、譚凱邦、馮達浚及梁晃維5人；及岑敖暉、袁嘉蔚、吳敏兒和尹兆堅4人，意味他們無法親睹證人作供及與不認罪被告見面。認罪被告自開審起原與不認罪被告同坐，惟上周四開始已被懲教與其他不認罪被告分開坐，昨更被安排到不同法庭就坐。&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>獨媒報導</name></author><summary type="html">區諾軒稱黃之鋒「以朋友身分忠告」不必辦初選 黃聞言搖頭苦笑 被問誰出席九東協調會 區諾軒稱「我驚我背漏」 官提醒作供非背誦</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Atoms For Sale</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-02-14-atoms-for-sale.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Atoms For Sale" /><published>2023-02-14T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2023-02-14T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/atoms-for-sale</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-02-14-atoms-for-sale.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Western sanctions on the Russian economy have been expanding. Nonetheless, Russia’s nuclear energy exports have not come under economic restrictions.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Rosatom State Nuclear Energy Corporation (Rosatom), which has a monopoly over the Russian nuclear industry, has continued exports of nuclear fuel and other goods relevant to the nuclear energy sector. According to Russian customs data, sourced through a third-party commercial trade data provider, Russia has exported just over $1 billion-worth of nuclear energy-related goods and materials since the start of the war in Ukraine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some customers that have historically relied on Russian nuclear energy exports – like Ukraine, Czechia and Bulgaria – have sought to diversify away from Russian supplies. However, contractual obligations and technical challenges make diversification slow and complicated – although not impossible. Additionally, generous Russian financing arrangements make Russia an attractive supplier among its other competitors in the nuclear energy sector.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The trade data reviewed by the author shows a drop-off in Russian nuclear exports to some countries in Eastern and Western Europe since the invasion of Ukraine, but also a significant rise in the overall value of Russian nuclear energy exports in 2022. Significant increases in value can be observed in Russian nuclear energy-related exports to China, which appear to be the result of Russian exports of fuel for the Chinese CFR-600 reactor at the Xiapu nuclear power plant (NPP). In a year-on-year comparison between 2021–22, the dataset also shows increases in overall Russian nuclear exports to Hungary, Turkey and India. And while the dataset studied by the author does not span a long enough time frame to draw definitive conclusions on longterm trends in Russian nuclear energy exports, or how Russia’s invasion of Ukraine might impact these trends, it does point to the importance for the Russian nuclear energy sector of markets outside North America and traditional European customers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The primacy among Russian nuclear energy customers of countries that have proven reluctant to support Western sanctions on Russia so far suggests that any EU and US sanctions on Rosatom and Russian nuclear trade need to be coupled with broader diplomatic efforts if they are to be effective in significantly curtailing Russian economic gains from its nuclear energy exports. Focusing efforts on bringing countries like Turkey and Hungary on board with increasing the political and economic pressure on Moscow – including through the provision of viable and sustainable alternatives to Russian nuclear energy-related supplies – will be key. Securing China’s cooperation will undoubtedly prove more difficult. As it has in other contexts, Russia will find ways to take advantage of these divisions to its own benefit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pass-go-and-collect-1-billion&quot;&gt;Pass Go and Collect $1 Billion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Russia’s February 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the UK, the US, the EU and others have introduced several rounds of Russia-focused sanctions packages. These measures have targeted both Russian individuals and certain economic sectors in an effort to curb the flow of funds that are enabling Moscow’s war effort and enriching those in Russia perpetrating and supporting it. Western sanctions have targeted Russian energy exports as a major contributor to the Russian economy. However, one component of the Russian energy market – the nuclear energy sector – has been left unsanctioned. This omission of Russian nuclear exports from Western sanctions appears to be – at least in part – the result of persistent dependencies in some countries on Russian nuclear energy fuel and reactor technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian customs data, sourced though a third-party commercial trade data provider and reviewed by the author in collaboration with Bloomberg shows that, between March and December 2022, Russia exported just over $1 billion-worth of materials and technology of relevance to the nuclear energy sector. This trade included exports to members of NATO and the EU. In fact, not only has the value of Russian nuclear-related exports not shrunk since February 2022, the data reviewed by the author suggests that it may be expanding, with a handful of loyal customers still eager to do business with Russia’s nuclear sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/v60SLfQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Monthly Transaction Values of Russian Nuclear Energy Exports Over Time.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Russian customs data obtained through a third-party commercial provider, RUSI.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian nuclear energy sector is monopolised by Rosatom State Nuclear Energy Corporation (better known as Rosatom) and its many subsidiaries. The company also appears to have been directly involved in supporting Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Rosatom staff are present at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya NPP, on the front line of Russia’s invasion. According to Ukrainian reports, Rosatom has taken over the management of the plant and have been pressuring the NPP’s Ukrainian staff to sign employment contracts with the Russian company. A recent report by the Washington Post also detailed apparent offers by Rosatom to provide components, technology and raw materials to the Russian military and Russian weapons manufacturers. However, Rosatom has not come under Western sanctions, despite calls from Ukrainian officials as well as Members of the European Parliament to impose restrictions on Russian nuclear exports. Hungary – which has insisted on maintaining its nuclear cooperation with Russia – has stated that it would veto any such attempt from the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report presents data and analysis on continued Russian nuclear energy exports since the invasion of Ukraine and highlights some of the difficulties countries may face in diversifying away from Russian supplies. At the same time, it points to the importance of customers outside of Europe and North America for the Russian nuclear energy sector and concludes that Western sanctions on Russian nuclear exports must be coupled with broader diplomatic efforts to curtail dependencies on Russian nuclear energy technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;notes-on-methodology-and-data&quot;&gt;Notes on Methodology and Data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data presented and analysed in this report was sourced from a third-party commercial trade data provider and captures Russian exports between January 2019 and December 2022. The data includes goods that fall under five nuclear-relevant HS codes – numeric identifiers used to internationally standardise the classifications of traded goods. The HS codes, their associated goods and notes on their relevance to the civilian nuclear fuel cycle are included in Table 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with all customs information datasets, the dataset reviewed by the author in this report is incomplete and may include some inaccuracies – including missing transactions or duplicates of transactions. The dataset also clearly excludes certain export destinations – likely because they do not make their customs data publicly available. For instance, Russian nuclear exports to Iran were not captured in the dataset. The author tried her best to validate the available data by comparing it against another commercial trade dataset from a different third-party provider. Some discrepancies are inevitable when comparing any large datasets and were indeed identified when comparing this dataset against a second one. Furthermore, the availability of data over time was inconsistent across the datasets; data was not available in the second dataset past June 2022, meaning the original dataset could not be validated past that date. However, despite these discrepancies, the alternative dataset does not contradict the analysis presented in this report and, within the timeframe of the data available in the second dataset (January 2019–June 2022), confirms the general trends outlined in this piece. Nevertheless, the author has kept her analysis within the bounds of the available data in the original dataset. The reader should also engage with the data and associated analysis presented with an understanding of these limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that lack of data at certain points in the dataset may indicate either a lack of transactions in that instance or missing transaction data in this particular dataset. As detailed above, the author validated – to the best of her abilities – the overall reliability of the data available but is not in a position to make a final judgement on the origin of gaps in the dataset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data for Russian nuclear exports to individual countries tends to be characterised by large peaks and troughs. This is unsurprising, as trade in the nuclear sector is often made up of periodic high-value transactions – such as the delivery of nuclear fuel batches or materials for the construction of nuclear plants – instead of a consistent flow of goods. Furthermore, timelines for nuclear energy projects are significantly longer than those in other energy sectors. Well-planned NPP construction projects take about 11 to 12 years to construct and commission. For instance, the agreement between Russia and Turkey for the construction of the Akkuyu NPP was signed in 2010; construction of the first of the four planned reactors did not begin until 2018. Negotiations in advance of the start of an NPP project can also take considerable time. Commissioned reactors will then operate for decades, requiring fuel, maintenance and servicing – all of which is often bespoke to the reactor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, it is difficult to draw any definitive conclusions from a nuclear trade dataset that only spans four years – as is the case in this instance, or to assess the long-term implication of changes observed in the data from the 10 months since the invasion of Ukraine (March-December 2022). The spikes and drops in trade value captured by the data may not necessarily point to persistent trends. Some of the transactions captured in the dataset for the post-invasion period may also represent an acceleration in the delivery of contracts for goods and materials – such as nuclear fuel – in advance of countries’ diversification from Russian supplies. As such, additional data over the coming months and years will be necessary to confirm whether the trade activity seen in the dataset represents persistent trends or one-off occurrences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier, the Russian nuclear sector is monopolised by Russian state corporation Rosatom. Due to the volume of transactions, the author could not definitively confirm that all instances of nuclear-related exports from Russia were on behalf of Rosatom and its group of companies. However, nearly all of the transactions reviewed by the author within the database appear to have been conducted either by a subsidiary of Rosatom or on behalf of one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;global-dependencies&quot;&gt;Global Dependencies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As others have detailed elsewhere, Russia occupies a major share of the global nuclear energy market, with dependencies on Russian nuclear fuel supplies particularly high in Central and Eastern Europe, but also apparent in the US and Western Europe. In 2021, there were 44 Russian or Soviet-built VVERs (water-water energetic reactors – a type of pressurised water reactor) operating outside Russia. Seventeen of them were in Ukraine, with the rest spread across 10 other countries. Many of these were built decades ago. However, Russia is continuing to construct nuclear reactors abroad. According to Rosatom’s webpage as of January 2023, the company had 34 active NPP construction projects ‘at various implementation stages’ (although the accuracy of Rosatom’s reporting on its construction portfolio has been questioned in the past and others have counted 13 reactors actively under construction at the end of 2021).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s role in the global nuclear market includes not only the construction of nuclear reactors, but also the mining of raw uranium, conversion of uranium ore into fuel-useable compounds, the fabrication of nuclear fuel assemblies, and the provision of other services across the nuclear fuel cycle – ‘from assessing and developing key nuclear infrastructure components in customer countries to NPP decommissioning’, as the company notes in its 2021 annual report. According to the 2021 report – the latest available – Russia occupied the greatest share of the global uranium enrichment market (38%) (other sources show that it had 46% of the world’s total operational and planned uranium enrichment capacity), was second in the world in terms of uranium production (15% of the market) and third in its share of the global nuclear fuel market (17%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, many countries with civilian nuclear energy sectors face significant dependencies on Russian provision of technology, services and fuel for their operation. A May 2022 report by Matt Bowen and Paul Dabbar for Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy assessed the degree of dependency of Western markets on Russian nuclear energy supplies. Bowen and Dabbar highlight in particular the key role Russia plays in uranium conversion and enrichment for global markets, including for American and Western European nuclear energy production. In 2021, subsidiaries of Rosatom provided 31% of enrichment services to EU nuclear utilities and 28% to US ones. They point out that replacing Russian uranium enrichment and conversion capacity possible, but that additional alternative capacity will need to be brought online, likely resulting in higher nuclear fuel prices. Alternative nuclear suppliers will also need to be convinced that the resources they invest in expanding their operations will not be in vain should any restrictions on Russian nuclear supplies be rescinded in a few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternative suppliers would also have to be found for the fabrication of nuclear fuel. A consortium of Western companies has been conducting work on the diversification of VVER fuel supply for years, focusing mainly on the production and licensing of VVER-440 fuel supplies. According to recent industry media reporting, supplies of VVER-440 fuel produced by a collaboration between US energy company Westinghouse Electric Company LLC (Westinghouse) and Spanish company Enusa should be ready for deliveries in 2024. French company Framatome also produces fuel under licence from a Rosatom subsidiary, which is reportedly identical to Russian-produced VVER fuel. Diversification away from Russian nuclear fuel supplies is time consuming, costly and presents technical challenges. Western nuclear fuel production lines need to be adapted, expanded and licensed for the production of VVER fuel, while customer countries need to license new suppliers which – according to one former senior Westinghouse engineer – can take at least five years. However, despite all this – and as has been demonstrated – diversification is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Bowen and Dabbar note that reactors often rely on unique components produced by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), which results in significant dependence on the OEM for replacement parts and servicing. The Russian customs data reviewed by the author shows Russian nuclear energy-related exports going to 21 different countries between January 2019 and December 2022. New reactors being constructed by Rosatom will also need servicing and spare parts over their lifetimes, which is likely to perpetuate future dependencies on imports from Russia. The Rosatom project for the construction of the El Dabaa NPP in Egypt, for instance, explicitly includes provisions for personnel training and reactor maintenance for the first 10 years of the plant’s operations, as well as fuel supply over the plant’s lifetime. Even more extensive long-term maintenance and operation provisions could be built into future NPP construction projects – for instance, the ‘build-own-operate’ model, which is being used for the first time in the construction of the Akkuyu NPP in Turkey and is discussed in more detail later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fuelling-up&quot;&gt;Fuelling Up&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the importance of Russia as a supplier of nuclear technology has been well-established, the dataset reviewed by the author points to an increase in the dollar value of Russian nuclear energy-related exports in the last few months, driven by a handful of countries outside of North America, Western Europe and traditional Eastern European customers. According to the dataset, the value of Russian nuclear energy exports increased considerably in the second half of 2022. In a month-on-month comparison, the dataset examined by the author shows values of 2022 nuclear energy exports exceeding 2021 exports in five out of 10 months captured by the data since the invasion (March – December 2022).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ldEHTGA.png&quot; alt=&quot;image3&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: Month-on-Month Value of Russian Nuclear Energy Exports.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Russian customs data obtained through a third-party commercial provider, RUSI.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both prior to the invasion and since March 2022, Russia’s primary nuclear-related exports – by a significant margin – came under HS code 840130 – ‘fuel elements, unirradiated’; in other words, fresh fuel for nuclear reactors. According to the trade data reviewed by the author, nuclear fuel exports accounted for about 77% of Russian nuclear exports prior to the invasion, rising to 86% between March and December 2022. Prior to March 2022, the top five destination countries for Russian nuclear fuel in the dataset – by dollar value – were Ukraine, Czechia, China, Bulgaria and Hungary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, some of these customers have sought to diversify away from Russian nuclear fuel. Czechia and Bulgaria have reached agreements with French and US suppliers for the supply of nuclear fuel for some of their reactors. However, the deliveries of this fuel are not expected until 2024 in Czechia and 2025 in Bulgaria. The trade data reviewed by the author shows that Russia has continued exporting nuclear fuel into both countries after the invasion, although the value of those imports dropped from 2021 to 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine is of course the most obvious case of diversification away from Russian nuclear fuel supplies. Hosting 17 VVER reactors, Ukraine has relied heavily on Russian imports of nuclear fuel to keep the units powered. In the last year – and even before then – it became clear that this dependency was no longer feasible. After Moscow’s initial incursion into Ukraine in 2014, Westinghouse was granted contracts to supply nuclear fuel to a number of Ukraine’s VVER reactors. The company – which has the capability to produce fuel for VVER-1000 reactors – was reportedly supplying fuel for six of the country’s reactors as of April 2022. Ukraine went from being the top export destination for Russian nuclear reactor fuel prior to the invasion to not importing any at all after the end of February 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/TsGbbP5.png&quot; alt=&quot;image4&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the cases of China and Hungary, the dataset reviewed by the author shows the two countries assuming a larger proportion of Russian nuclear fuel exports since March 2022. In fact, the value of Russian nuclear fuel exports to Hungary in the 10 months between March and December 2022 far exceeds that of any of the previous three years. According to the transaction details captured in the data, the deliveries were for Hungary’s Paks NPP. In August 2022, Hungary controversially decided to go ahead with issuing permits for Rosatom construction of two new nuclear reactors at the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data also shows a clear spike in Russian exports of nuclear fuel to China in the second half of 2022, which appears to be primarily driven by the export – for the first time – of Russian fuel for the CFR-600 fast neutron reactor currently under construction at China’s Xiapu NPP in Fujian Province. The supply of fuel for the CFR-600 reactor is part of a set of 2018 Russo-Chinese agreements on nuclear energy cooperation, which includes Russian commitments for the delivery of fuel, equipment and services for the Chinese-built CFR-600. The trade data shows three separate batches of nuclear fuel assemblies being exported to China in September, November and December 2022. This data corroborates public reporting of the fuel deliveries. Data for December 2022 also shows the export to China of control and protection system assemblies for the CFR-600 reactor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CFR-600 is a sodium-cooled fast neutron reactor. According to assessments by the US Department of Defense, the reactor could be used as a breeder reactor; this means that the reactor may be capable of producing more fissile material than it consumes. This has raised concerns that the reactor could be used for the production of plutonium, which could in turn be used for fuel in nuclear weapons, among unconfirmed suspicions that China may be expanding its nuclear weapons arsenal. Nevertheless, there is no evidence that China is diverting – or planning to divert – plutonium from the CFR-600 to nuclear weapons production and some experts have suggested that there are more efficient ways for Beijing to increase its weapons-usable plutonium stockpiles than relying on a breeder reactor designed for civilian energy production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All other Russian nuclear fuel shipments to China recorded in the dataset appear to be for the Russian-built Tainwan-3 VVER reactor. Rosatom is also due to construct four new reactor units at the Tainwan and Xudabao NPPs. One of these began construction on 25 February 2022 – the day after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – and the other in May 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-nuclear-family&quot;&gt;The Nuclear Family&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An analysis of trends in overall Russian nuclear energy-related exports, across all HS categories, also point to the emergence of several loyal customers for the Russian nuclear energy market. As many countries look to diversify their sourcing of nuclear energy supplies, a handful of others appear to be increasing Russian imports of nuclear goods and technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/BX2fFAJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image5&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4: Changes in the Value of Russia’s Nuclear Exports Between 2021 and 2022 by Destination Country.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Russian customs data obtained through a third-party commercial provider, RUSI.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before March 2022, the dataset shows that the top five destination countries for Russian nuclear exports were Ukraine, China, Czechia, Bulgaria and Hungary, with India not far behind. Since March, exports to Ukraine have stopped entirely according to the data. Other destinations for Russian nuclear exports also disappear from the dataset from March 2022 onwards, including the US, Switzerland, Sweden, Canada and the Netherlands. However, even in the three years prior to March 2022, Russian nuclear energy exports to these countries made up a very small proportion of the entire dataset. As mentioned earlier, it is possible that more significant exports took place before 2019 and materials were stockpiled. However, the relatively small proportion of Russian nuclear energy exports to these countries suggests that Western customers – and retaining access to those export markets – will be relatively less important to Russia than customers in other parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s priority is likely to be focused on retaining and growing business in a handful of apparently loyal customers that remain less enthusiastic about imposing sanctions on the Russian economy. The data shows that both the relative share and net value of overall nuclear exports to China has skyrocketed, driven almost exclusively by the spike in the value of Russian nuclear fuel exports to China in the second half of 2022, which were discussed earlier. The relative and absolute value of Russian exports to Hungary has also grown, consisting – as before the invasion – almost entirely of nuclear fuel exports. The data also shows a significant amount of Russian nuclear exports going to India in the first half of 2022 – consisting of deliveries of nuclear fuel (HS 840130) and nuclear reactor components (HS 840140) – but dropping off after June of that year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another country which – according to the data – continues to import a significant amount of Russian nuclear-related goods and materials, and whose importance in Russia’s nuclear export market has grown since March 2022, is Turkey. The data shows that Russian nuclear exports to Turkey took a dip in the first few months of the invasion but have since rallied in both relative and absolute terms. While future trade data will help to determine whether the importance of Turkey as a market for Russian nuclear exports will continue to grow, such a trend would not be surprising. Rosatom is in the process of constructing Turkey’s first nuclear power plant – the Akkuyu NPP, on the country’s Mediterranean coast. The project is the result of a 2010 agreement signed between the Russian and Turkish governments and – according to Rosatom – is the ‘largest project in the history of Russian-Turkish cooperation’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project is the first application of the ‘build-own-operate’ model for nuclear reactor construction; under this arrangement, Rosatom will maintain ownership of the NPP after its construction, selling the generated electricity to a Turkish utility company – thus expecting to make a guaranteed profit off the project. According to the project’s webpage, Rosatom companies own nearly 100% of the project. When completed, the Akkuyu NPP will host four VVER-1200 reactors and is expected to generate 35 billion kWh per year – an estimated 10% of Turkey’s electricity. Construction of the first reactor began in April 2018 and of the fourth in July 2022. Descriptions of Russian exports to Turkey within the dataset reviewed by the author clearly identify shipments of nuclear reactor parts and other technology for the construction of the Akkuyu NPP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the methodology section of this report, it is difficult to draw any definitive conclusions on long-term trends in Russian nuclear exports just from looking at four years of trade data and especially from any movement in the 10 months following the invasion of Ukraine. The trends observed in the post-invasion trade data align with expectations on shifts in Russian nuclear energy customers, as a result of efforts in some countries – and publicly reported resistance in others – to diversify away from Russian nuclear energy supplies. However, additional data over the coming months and years will help confirm – or disprove – these apparent trends. For now, the observed increases in Russian nuclear energy exports to certain destinations in the reviewed dataset are best viewed as general confirmation of these countries’ commitments to nuclear cooperation with Russia, rather than a rapid expansion of these relationships since the start of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;in-for-a-penny&quot;&gt;In For a Penny&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the aforementioned dependencies and difficulties in diversifying suppliers, several factors continue to make Russia an attractive supplier for existing and new customers. One key consideration is Moscow’s willingness to extend attractive financing schemes for its NPP construction projects abroad. As Matthew Bowen and Alec Apostoaei highlight in a recent report on government financing of nuclear reactor exports, the debt and equity arrangements that Rosatom is able to provide are government-backed and their conditions are not limited by restrictions placed on US, French and South Korean competitors by the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD). As such, the authors note, Russian financing arrangements are consistently more generous and attractive than other suppliers are able to provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such financing arrangements likely serve as an important motivator for countries that may not be able to front the costs of an NPP construction project themselves. Equally, they create commitments that are financially difficult to disentangle from down the road. For instance, Rosatom’s construction of two new units at Hungary’s Paks NPP is expected to cost €12.4 billion, with Russia providing €10 billion as a loan under a repayment period of 16 years. Russia is also providing Egypt with a $25 billion loan for the construction by Rosatom of the El Dabaa NPP, out of a total estimated cost of $60 billion. The repayment term for that arrangement is reportedly 22 years. In Bangladesh, Russia extended a loan for $11.4 billion, with a repayment term of 20 years for the construction of the Rooppur NPP. The loan represents 90% of the total original cost of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Differences in the regulatory requirements for the export of US nuclear technology versus nuclear exports from Russia as well as other major suppliers may also allow Rosatom to be a more nimble and attractive supplier, at least in relation to US competitors. In instances where the US wishes to make significant transfers of nuclear material or technology, US law generally requires the conclusion of a peaceful nuclear cooperation agreement under Section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act (commonly known as a ‘123 Agreement’). These agreements outline requirements around specific non-proliferation criteria that recipient countries must meet in order to receive US technology; 123 Agreements are reviewed – and may therefore be rejected or delayed – by the US Congress. Furthermore, these agreements require periodic renewal. The expiry of the US’ 123 Agreement with South Africa in December 2022 has meant that Westinghouse lost its US Nuclear Regulatory Commission licence to export nuclear fuel components to the country’s Koeberg NPP. As others have outlined elsewhere, while Russia also includes non-proliferation and export-control measures in its nuclear cooperation agreements, they are less extensive than those applied by the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the trade data reviewed by the author demonstrates, Russia’s nuclear export sector has continued to thrive since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. This trade in nuclear technology will directly benefit state corporation Rosatom, which appears to be actively supporting Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Some have called for the Russian nuclear industry to be sanctioned. Others have taken it into their own hands to find alternative suppliers for their nuclear energy sectors. On 5 February, Kyiv took the step of sanctioning 200 entities connected to the Russian nuclear sector. A few days earlier, the European Parliament passed a resolution calling for sanctions on Rosatom and an embargo on imports of Russian uranium. Such actions are helpful and should be actively pursued as part of broader national and multilateral efforts to place economic pressure on Moscow and Russian entities supporting Russia’s invasion and atrocities in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By sanctioning Rosatom and its subsidiaries, the US and EU can make it more difficult for the corporation to operate within the international financial system and to access certain services – like insurance – that it would need to move its wares to customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, as demonstrated by the trade data reviewed by the author, Russia’s most important customers for nuclear energy exports are located outside Western Europe and North America, and Russia appears to be increasingly reliant on business from countries that have shown less enthusiasm for sanctioning its economy. As such, for any US and EU sanctions on Rosatom and the Russian nuclear energy industry to be effective in significantly curtailing Russian economic gains from its nuclear energy exports, they will need to be coupled with broader diplomatic efforts to encourage and support diversification away from Russian supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focusing efforts on bringing countries like Turkey and Hungary on side to increase the political and economic pressure on Moscow will be key. It remains unclear to what extent these countries will maintain – or expand – their nuclear cooperation with Russia moving forward although incentives and restrictions to diversification clearly exist, as detailed in this report. Finding ways to support a sustainable shift away from dependence on Russian nuclear fuel and technology and towards alternative suppliers will be key to ensuring that emerging trends suggested by the data assessed for this report do not become permanent ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, securing the cooperation of China – Russia’s most important customer in nuclear energy exports – when it comes to curtailing Russian access to its nuclear energy market is an undoubtedly tall order. As it has already demonstrated, Beijing is likely to remain the persistently weak link in Western efforts to effectively apply sanctions against the Russian economy. As long as international consensus on condemning and sanctioning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine remains divided, Russia will find ways to benefit from these divisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（13日）於西九龍裁判法院（暫代高院）續審。法官上周提及，相信控方於本案依賴「共謀者原則（co-conspirator’s rule）」，以其他被告的言行推論被告參與串謀。有辯方律師今表示控方開案陳詞從沒有提及相關原則，遭法官質疑控方依賴該原則是顯而易見。此外，有辯方律師表示本案控罪始於2020年7月1日，被告此前言行不屬串謀一部分。惟法官李運騰指他完全錯誤，指所有人都知道《國安法》於7月1日才生效，原本合法的行為也可變成非法，而控罪屬「持續罪行」，《國安法》前的言行可為本案「謀劃」提供一個背景，證明被告的思想狀態。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;列席認罪被告全於延伸庭被告欄就坐&quot;&gt;列席認罪被告全於延伸庭被告欄就坐&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表包括資深大律師潘熙、大律師沈士文、張耀良、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等，本身是大律師的劉偉聰則自辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪被告包括獲准保釋的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信10人，及還柙的何桂藍、吳政亨、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及余慧明6人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於上周列席的認罪被告全部不在正庭，據記者觀察，他們被帶到沒有記者、只有公眾席的1號延伸法庭被告欄就坐，包括黃之鋒、朱凱廸、譚凱邦、馮達浚及梁晃維5人。認罪被告自開審起原與不認罪被告同坐，惟上周四開始已被懲教與其他不認罪被告分開坐。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方控罪詳情為公開作為串謀指控被告贊成無差別否決財政預算&quot;&gt;控方：控罪詳情為「公開作為」、串謀指控被告贊成無差別否決財政預算&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方上周要求控方澄清，控罪所列的4項協議內容，是各被告的「公開作為」（overt act，即法庭可用以推論被告作串謀的間接證據），抑或視為控罪必要元素的「非法手段（unlawful means）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主控萬德豪今重申，本案「謀劃」內容是被告贊成無差別地否決政府提出的任何財政預算或公共開支，以迫使特首解散立法會及辭職，而本案控罪詳情均是該「謀劃」的「公開作為（overt act）」，即法庭可用以推論被告作串謀的間接證據。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方質疑須證戴耀廷文章為他所寫-否則僅屬傳聞證供&quot;&gt;辯方質疑須證戴耀廷文章為他所寫 否則僅屬傳聞證供&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官上周批准控方傳召兩名警長就 Facebook 和 YouTube 的運作作供，代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 今指，他不爭議該些內容的真確性（authenticity），但認為控方在依賴「共謀者原則（co-conspirator’s rule）」前，須先舉證本案串謀協議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就控方依賴其他被告如戴耀廷撰寫的文章，他認為戴不會出庭作供，無證據文章由他所寫，僅屬「傳聞證供」，控方須證明涉案文章由戴所寫。法官李運騰同意若控方證人並不知悉文章由誰所寫，控方或須就此提出證據；又指其他被告的文章在「共謀者原則」下可以呈堂，辯方屆時可再提出反對。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方質疑控方開案沒提共謀者原則&quot;&gt;辯方質疑控方開案沒提「共謀者原則」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表黃碧雲和林卓廷的大律師沈士文其後表示，控方並沒有在開案陳詞提及意圖依賴「共謀者原則」。法官李運騰指，開案陳詞大量引用戴耀廷文章，已清楚顯示控方會依賴該原則；法官陳慶偉亦質疑，辯方如有疑問為何不在案件管理聆訊提出。沈士文指是控方責任，沒預期控方會依賴該原則，遭法官陳慶偉批評他完全錯誤（totally misconceived），並反問：「難道控方每次開案陳詞都要列明依賴的每項原則？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文重申，根據案例，若控方依賴「共謀者原則」，辯方需知道控方依賴此原則下，針對每名被告的證據。法官李運騰指，本案所有促進串謀的言行（acts and declarations in furtherance of a conspiracy）均是針對所有共謀者的證據，不論他們於言行作出前或後才加入串謀。沈士文同意，但指控方未必依賴所有證據，不同證據亦可能達致不同結論。Trevor Beel 遂補充，本案或涉多於一個串謀，法官指將會稍後處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控罪始於2020七一-官指國安法前言行可證被告思想狀態&quot;&gt;控罪始於2020七一 官指國安法前言行可證被告思想狀態&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大律師馬維騉續指，本案控罪日期為2020年7月1日至2021年1月7日，控方似乎沒有指控被告於2020年7月1日前串謀，故被告此前言行不屬串謀一部分。法官李運騰指他完全錯誤（totally misconceived），指所有人都知道《國安法》於7月1日才生效，在此之前被告不可能干犯任何本案的「非法手段」，而本控罪屬橫跨一段時間的「持續罪行（continuous offence）」，《國安法》後原本合法的行為也可變成非法，故控方才以2020年7月1日為控罪開始日期。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟馬維騉指，《國安法》生效前並不存在本案的非法串謀，故被告此前的言行最多只是推動一個「協議（agreement）」，而非非法的「串謀」。李運騰回應，被告於6月30日或以前的言行，可為本案「謀劃」提供一個背景（setting），及證明被告的思想狀態（state of mind）。馬維騉同意7月1日前的言行可為本案提供背景，但重申不認為能證被告推動串謀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪補充，除了共謀者規則外，控方亦可能依賴「巧合（coincidence）」的規則，指涉案行為於相近時間發生，會邀法庭考慮被告犯案不是「純粹巧合」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;需時處理同意事實-押下午開庭&quot;&gt;需時處理同意事實 押下午開庭&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控辯雙方早前未能同意承認事實，萬德豪指今早4時15分收到辯方要求修改承認事實，需時1小時再商討。Trevor Beel 指，由於需時與還柙被告會面，望能下午再繼續。法官終批准休庭至12時。直至近12時，法庭書記指押後至下午2時半。審訊下午續。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（13日）於西九龍裁判法院（暫代高院）續審。首名控方證人、被指為初選組織者的區諾軒下午作供，他供稱初選的計劃由2020年1月與戴耀廷、李永達、李卓人和黃浩銘的一個飯局開始，當時戴耀廷提及立會過半願景，及如何在區選大勝後「再下一城」，在立法會為民主派贏取更多議席並爭取「五大訴求」。區指，當時戴耀廷較堅持以公民投票形式舉辦初選作協調，並推想每區可獲的議席數目；又指立會過半是「大殺傷力憲制武器」，可利用《基本法》賦予的權力否決財政預算案和政府議案，並成立獨立調查委員會向警暴問責等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區又指，飯局上他同意民主派過半及建立協調機制「會係一個好大嘅進步」，並答應以籌劃者身份與戴耀廷合作舉辦初選。他解釋，當時他剛完成立法會公職，打算赴日留學，2020年有約大半年時間在香港，「我認為我當時有時間，能夠貢獻我視之為民主運動嘅工作。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;下午傳首名控方證人區諾軒-官着稍後再處理承認事實&quot;&gt;下午傳首名控方證人區諾軒 官着稍後再處理承認事實&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控辯雙方早上就承認事實商討，主控萬德豪下午開庭後，原欲讀出修訂的承認事實，指屬法庭一貫做法，惟法官陳慶偉及陳仲衡均指應立即聽取本案證供，稍後才處理承認事實。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法庭其後於下午約2時45分，傳召首名控方證人、被指為初選組織者的區諾軒作供。他架黑色粗框眼鏡、身穿灰色毛衣，在3名懲教人員押送下手持一疊文件步入法庭，先向旁聽席和被告欄方向微微躹躬，再坐下。法官指他不能攜有文件，區一度問：「我嘅證供係咪可以留低，定係都唔得？」法官指他作供期間不能以書面供詞協助記憶，區其後將文件放在桌上，除下口罩以基督教誓章宣誓。區諾軒宣誓時，被安排在另一法庭觀看直播、已認罪的被告之一馮達浚搖頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方稱控罪日期為202071至202117-區係咪再早啲啊應該&quot;&gt;控方稱控罪日期為2020.7.1至2021.1.7 區：係咪再早啲啊應該？&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒作供時確認，他由2009年12月至2017年9月為民主黨黨員，2012年至2019年任南區區議員，並於2018年3月至2019年12月經補選當選香港島立法會議員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;除串謀顛覆國家政權罪外，他亦於2020年4月涉大聲公襲警被定罪、2021年4月涉組織參與非法集結被定罪，另2021年8月涉選舉舞弊和違反《立法會（權力及特權）條例》獲准守行為。控方指串謀顛覆國家政權罪控罪日期為2020年7月1日至2021年1月7日時，區諾軒一度面露疑惑：「係咪再早啲啊應該？」惟他迅即改口稱「正確」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2020年1月首度與戴耀廷李永達李卓人黃浩銘飯局商討&quot;&gt;2020年1月首度與戴耀廷、李永達、李卓人、黃浩銘飯局商討&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主控周天行負責主問環節，要求區諾軒順時序講述本案串謀計劃的發生。區諾軒供稱，2019年12月，戴耀廷於《蘋果日報》發表〈立會奪半 走向真普選重要一步〉一文，他起初有留意但沒有聯絡戴，直至2020年1月，泛民主派亦開始留意到該文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指，「一切係由一個飯局開始」，指於2020年1月尾，與戴耀廷、民主黨李永達、工黨李卓人和社民連黃浩銘進行飯局作首次見面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區表示，當時他剛完成立法會公職，打算赴日留學，而該飯局的重要性，在於是他首次與戴耀廷商討有關初選的問題。他形容，李永達和李卓人當時亦很關心在將要來臨的立法會選舉，「民主派可以點樣達到最大勝算。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;飯局目標包括助民主派於立法會爭取更多議席&quot;&gt;飯局目標包括助民主派於立法會爭取更多議席&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒指，戴耀廷在飯局提出有關立會過半的願景及覆述文章看法，並提出三點值得留意，包括：當時民主派於2019年區議會選舉大勝，他們要思考如何「再下一城」，在立法會為民主派贏取更多議席；當時「五大訴求」是反修例運動主要內容，他們要思考如何爭取「五大訴求」；區議會選舉大勝後，要思考如何設立公民參與機制，包括活用民主派贏得的議席，並結合「黃營媒體」及公民社會團體的參與，建立一個平台。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就第一點，區解釋泛民主派要在立法會贏取更多議席，需要一個「協調機制」。他指，立法會地方選區奉行比例代表制，而過往選舉常有一種規律，就是泛民主派獲得比建制派更多選票，但在部分選區無法獲得相應比例議席，因泛民主派有太多名單參選，以致部分選票被浪費。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區續指，建制派自2008年起已建立一套成熟的協調機制，但泛民直至2020年仍未成功建立，故與戴耀廷等人討論如何建立一套協調機制，讓不同黨派，無論是傳統泛民主派、激進泛民主派和本土派，總之任何「黃色陣營」內的政治勢力，參選立法會時均可互相協調，善用選票、按比例當選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區戴耀廷堅持公民投票形式舉辦初選&quot;&gt;區：戴耀廷堅持公民投票形式舉辦初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行問及，戴耀廷目標是增加民主派於立法會選舉的勝算，那他有否提出任何方案以取得立法會多數議席。區諾軒指戴耀廷當時較堅持用公民投票形式舉辦初選，惟當時其他與會者認為較消耗人力物力，可用其他方法，如以選前民調調查候選人支持度，再讓大家參考。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就戴耀廷當時的提議，區指雖然未有如2020年7月的初選般具體，但也有基本框架，即在不同地方直選選區、及功能組別的區議會第二界別（超級區議會），以公民投票選出泛民主派代表，決定他們出選的優先次序。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;他續指，若能建立協調機制，在各選區便理應可獲多數議席，包括在港島區6席贏取4席、九龍西6席贏取4席、九龍東5席贏取3席、新界西9席贏取6席、新界東9席贏取6席、及超級區議會5席贏取3席，再將上述選區議席相加，便可得出還需爭取多少席以達35席。他並指就新界兩區，「如果諗得積極啲，可能（在一個選區內）會攞到7席嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區指，當時飯局未訂下確實數目，直至與不同團體諮詢後，戴耀廷才在之後的文章及3月底的記者會提出「6 6 4 4 3」的說法。但在法官詢問下，他同意在飯局上戴耀廷已曾作相關推想和推算，「佢有同我講呢一啲數字」，並指對與會者來說，「如果民主派能夠贏，當然係好」，但要推展整個民主派實現就需更多工作，如向不同團體諮詢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒承認飯局上答應合作籌劃初選-貢獻民主運動&quot;&gt;區諾軒承認飯局上答應合作籌劃初選 「貢獻民主運動」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3名指定法官不時加入發問，法官李運騰要求控方順時序發問，並要求區諾軒確實說出飯局當日「誰說過什麼」，又問他有沒有參與討論。區指他無法憶述具體的說話內容，但當時亦同意若民主派能過半，且能建立一個協調機制，「會係一個好大嘅進步」，「而且正正係當時，我答應同戴耀廷合作舉辦初選。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區解釋，他答應以籌劃者身份參與，因他即將要留學，2020年有約大半年時間在香港，「我認為我當時有時間，能夠貢獻我視之為民主運動嘅工作。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區戴耀廷稱立會過半是大殺傷力憲制武器-可否決財政預算案&quot;&gt;區：戴耀廷稱立會過半是「大殺傷力憲制武器」 可否決財政預算案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於區諾軒提及會上第二點，即思考如何爭取「五大訴求」。區諾軒指，當時原意回應反修例運動，戴耀廷提及若立會過半，將是「大殺傷力憲制武器」，因民主派對政府會有更多議價能力，亦可以利用《基本法》賦予的權力行使否決權。他指，當時沒有特別指定否決對象，但有包括財政預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡指不明白，如何沒有特定否決對象但又包括否決財政預算案。區諾軒解釋，「五大訴求」包括要求為警暴問責的條款，「若果我哋能夠運用立會過半所得到嘅地位，係可以有好多空間可以做嘅」，如設立獨立調查委員會或否決政府議案，戴耀廷當時正是指出立會過半後「可以做到嘅一啲可能」。他又指，由於當時飯局上的人，「一係就資深議員或前議員，一係就資深嘅政治工作者」，故對他們來說，該些概念都是耳熟能詳，無特別為意戴的含意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官提醒應就實際所說作供-不應提個人猜想&quot;&gt;官提醒應就實際所說作供 不應提個人猜想&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此時法官李運騰提醒，指「我們正在處理非常嚴重的罪行」，區諾軒應盡量貼近飯局上人們實際的說話，而非對與會者想法作出猜想，又指相信區能分得出兩者分別，區點頭。李續問飯局上有否提及財政預算案，區指戴耀廷有提及過，並談及〈立會奪半〉文章內容，但他們沒有特別回應其說法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒最後重申，戴耀廷當時提及立會過半是「大殺傷力嘅憲制武器」，可以運用許多權力爭取五大訴求，包括否決財政預算案、設立獨立調查委員會，以及否決政府議案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒糾正法庭傳譯-旁聽席發笑&quot;&gt;區諾軒糾正法庭傳譯 旁聽席發笑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;下午近5時散庭，臨散庭前，法官李運騰重申區諾軒作供時不應保存任何文件，控方着懲教署保管，區諾軒在3名懲教押送下離開，臨走前向旁聽席及律師席注目及點頭。散庭時，林卓廷向母親說「情人節快樂」，吳政亨舉起拇指，旁聽席有女童喊「加油（長）毛伯伯！」，長毛妻子陳寶塋亦高喊：「各位加油！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，以中文作供的區諾軒，今不時糾正法庭傳譯主任的翻譯。其中區提及「公布」，法官李運騰指出翻譯錯誤，應為「make it public」，區說「I suggest to use “announce”」，法官採納，陳志全等被告及旁聽的民主黨劉慧卿發笑。至區提及戴耀廷作出就初選的「推想」，傳譯主任一度猶豫「推想啊……」，區提議「imagination?」，傳譯主任採納，旁聽席再發笑；區亦試過忘記等待傳譯主任翻譯便直接回答控方英文問題。另外，被問及飯局與會者的黨派，區諾軒稱「無黨派」，傳譯主任譯作「individual」，劉慧卿等再發笑，傳譯主任其後更正為「I did not belong in any party.」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;區諾軒作供時，正庭內的被告沒有太大反應，大多低頭以紙筆或電腦抄筆記，林卓廷一度閉目養神。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明早續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件編號：HCCC69/2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;列席認罪被告分坐兩延伸庭看直播&quot;&gt;列席認罪被告分坐兩延伸庭看直播&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表包括資深大律師潘熙、大律師沈士文、張耀良、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等，本身是大律師的劉偉聰則自辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪被告包括獲准保釋的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信10人，及還柙的何桂藍、吳政亨、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及余慧明6人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於上周列席的認罪被告，今全部不獲安排在正庭就坐，需於延伸庭觀看直播，意味無法親睹證人作供及與不認罪被告見面。據記者觀察，他們分別被帶到沒有記者席、只有公眾席的1號延伸法庭，及有記者席和公眾席的2號延伸法庭被告欄就坐，包括黃之鋒、朱凱廸、譚凱邦、馮達浚及梁晃維5人；及岑敖暉、袁嘉蔚、吳敏兒和尹兆堅4人。其中1號庭內設有3個直播熒幕，均面向旁聽席，坐在被告欄的被告均需傾前身體及仰頭望向右，才能觀看直播。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;認罪被告自開審起原與不認罪被告於正庭同坐，惟上周四開始已被懲教與其他不認罪被告分開坐，今更被安排到不同法庭就坐。&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>獨媒報導</name></author><summary type="html">官指串謀屬持續罪行 《國安法》前言行可證被告思想狀態 區諾軒開始作供 指2020年1月首與戴耀廷飯局商討 答應合作籌劃</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Russo-Ukrainian War In 2023</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-02-13-russo-ukrainian-war-in-2023.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Russo-Ukrainian War In 2023" /><published>2023-02-13T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2023-02-13T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/russo-ukrainian-war-in-2023</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-02-13-russo-ukrainian-war-in-2023.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As Russia and Ukraine head into year two of a war that has defied expectations, a collection of CSIS experts examined driving factors for the future of the conflict. They borrow the approach from intelligence analysts, who seek to evaluate the possible trajectories of a conflict rather than make straight-line predictions, bounding reality for policymakers.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;Emily Harding discusses the life-or-death question of continued outside aid for Ukraine and the resilience of the Ukrainian people. Ben Jensen discusses cohesion in the Russian military and the potential for catastrophic collapse. Heather Williams evaluates the looming nuclear question. Finally, Eliot Cohen examines how a conflict might end.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;single-point-of-failure-will-outside-support-for-ukraine-endure&quot;&gt;Single Point of Failure: Will Outside Support for Ukraine Endure?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Emily Harding&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The success or failure of Kyiv’s war effort hinges on one unfortunate fact: Ukraine does not have the indigenous capacity to arm itself for this fight. Ukrainian president Zelensky knows it and has devoted considerable time and energy to shoring up relationships and corresponding supply lines — for example, leaving Ukraine to visit Washington and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The West has responded: despite a slow, hesitant start, marked by hand-wringing over escalation, NATO members have stepped up to provide increasingly effective and potent weapons systems. HIMARS — the light, mobile, precision artillery platforms — are already a hero of the war, and Abrams and Leopard tanks are inbound. Debates over fourth-generation fighter jets and long-range fires are surely right around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Zelensky’s work is never done. Russia is working hard to widen any crack in support for Ukraine. Recent Quran-burning protests in Sweden seem to have been bought and paid for by Russian assets, designed to make it impossible for Turkey to support Sweden’s bid for NATO membership. A recent poll by the European Hybrid CoE suggests that segments of the public in key European nations are questioning why Europe is sending so much aid to Ukraine. Those segments are still minorities, but Ukraine is only a year into what most likely will be a very long fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO allies also have a structural concern beyond the whims of opinion polls. As CSIS’s Seth Jones argued in his recent report, Empty Bins in a Wartime Environment, support to Ukraine has drawn down U.S. stocks of critical weapons systems faster than they can be replenished, in our current peacetime production tempo. The report says “DoD has only placed on contract a fraction of the weapons it has sent to Ukraine. Many U.S. allies and partners in Europe also have defense industrial bases that are unprepared for major war, heavily reliant on the United States, and chronically underfunded.” At some point, U.S. and European military planners will begin to feel the pinch and question what should go to Ukraine and what should be held in reserve for a potential future fight, should this conflict dramatically escalate or China see an opportunity to move in the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this conflict more than most, Ukraine’s chances at victory will be decided by both the weapons themselves and the symbolic value of the commitment to send them. Moscow is betting that time is on its side and it can grind Ukraine into dust. The key assumption in that bet is that Russia can outlast NATO commitment. Instead, Russia needs to fear that, just as it underestimated NATO’s willingness to help Ukraine and Ukraine’s ability to fight, it has miscalculated the West’s resolve to stay with Ukraine all the way to Crimea. The Biden administration has signaled medium-term U.S. commitment with its military aid package and training programs, and in one of his few lines on foreign policy in the State of the Union, Biden pledged that the United States “will stand with you as long as it takes.” On the heels of Zelensky’s trip, European allies need to find ways to signal the same commitment to their people and to Kyiv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;can-ukrainian-resilience-hold&quot;&gt;Can Ukrainian Resilience Hold?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On February 24, millions of us made a choice. Not a white flag, but a blue and yellow flag. Not escaping, but meeting. Meeting the enemy. Resisting and fighting. –Zelensky’s New Year address to the nation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Zelensky has been a symbol of his nation’s resolve and defiance in the face of a brutal enemy. He has been steadfast, but how long can Ukrainian resilience hold? As of January 15, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees recorded 18,358 civilian casualties in the country: 7,031 killed and 11,327 injured. More than eight million Ukrainians have become refugees, at least six million more are internally displaced, and nearly half the population needs humanitarian assistance. Russia has engaged in a ruthless campaign to knock out critical infrastructure, including power and water, in the middle of winter. Ukrainians have suffered greatly and will continue to suffer as a result of Moscow’s blatant disregard for human life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, reliable numbers of Ukrainian military casualties are difficult to calculate; the Ukrainian government has labeled them classified. In early December, Ukrainian government officials publicly estimated up to 13,000 killed and stridently denied a European estimate of 100,000 dead. Ukrainian soldiers have shown ingenuity and grit and have made clear they will fight to free their country for as long as is necessary with whatever is available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO and other friends of Ukraine should plan for a multiyear conflict and develop sustainable plans for keeping Ukraine’s forces and population resilient. For refugees, those plans look like work programs — in particular support for Ukraine’s women to work remotely in their Ukrainian jobs whenever possible — education for children, and mental health support. A soldier unburdened with worries about their spouse and kids is a soldier better able to focus on the fight. For those fighting, efforts to create sustainable rotations on and off the battlefield for training and rest are a basic start. Fostering the belief that the fight is winnable with public symbols of support — from flags waving over Washington, to the United Kingdom hosting Eurovision on behalf of Ukraine, to NAFO Fellas, to, yes, tanks and HIMARS — will keep determination high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-there-cohesion-in-the-russian-military&quot;&gt;Is There Cohesion in the Russian Military?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Benjamin Jensen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In stark contrast to Ukrainian forces, Russian efforts in Ukraine have been plagued by faulty equipment, lack of winter gear, and reported fights and drunkenness in the trenches. What if the mutinies endemic in the Russian revolutions in 1905 and 1917 are a harbinger for the course of 2023? Military power requires cohesive fighting organizations as much as it does tanks and planes. Soldiers tend to reflect cleavages and power struggles in their societies. The combined stress of battlefield losses and growing crises on the home front can undermine military power through eroding cohesion. Look no further than the Kiel Mutiny in the German navy in 1918 and the cascading protests across that accelerated the end of World War I. Along similar lines, a recent study by Jason Lyall, director of the Political Violence Field Lab, found that military performance is linked to economic and social inequality in a society. The more unequal and stratified a society, the more likely the military is to underperform and even collapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applied to Russia, which has seen a dramatic rise in income inequality over the last generation, alongside a rise in nationalistic xenophobic attitudes and racism against non-ethnic Russians, this finding suggests the winter could be longer for Moscow than it is for Kyiv. The signs are already present given changing sentiments in minority regions like Buryatia and mass emigration by military age males. Sanctions combined with the Kremlin’s rhetoric about historic Russia may bolster the elite that didn’t jump from windows, but it only acerbates the tensions tearing the nation apart and undermining its military performance. Russia has more forced conscripts and prison units than it does volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conditions are already present for a large-scale Russian military mutiny. Low morale, cold weather, and high attrition rates alongside nationalist rhetoric and economic decline will continue over the course of the next three months. In this environment, a spark can start a wildfire. Riots, rampant refusal of orders, and even defections and surrenders could spread like a disease through the burnt-out cities and trenches along the battlefield in Ukraine. Though impossible to predict, the most likely catalyst on the horizon is the first offensive of the spring in which mobilized conscripts currently training in Russia and Belarus discover the hell of modern trench warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;will-putin-continue-to-make-nuclear-threats&quot;&gt;Will Putin Continue to Make Nuclear Threats?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Heather Williams&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether the war in Ukraine lasts months or years, nuclear weapons will continue to lurk in the background. Russian president Vladimir Putin has come to rely on nuclear weapons for coercion and bullying and will continue to make nuclear threats. Since the start of the invasion, Putin has made explicit and implicit reference to Russia’s nuclear arsenal. On December 21, he stated, “We will continue maintaining and improving the combat readiness of the nuclear triad” and listed Russia’s numerous nuclear delivery vehicles, including the Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin is relying on nuclear threats for two primary reasons. First, he wants to deter NATO from directly intervening in Ukraine. While the West has gradually increased its military support for Ukraine, Putin’s efforts have arguably had some success preventing direct Western military intervention for fear of escalation. Keeping NATO out of Ukraine will remain a top priority for Putin. But the second reason for Putin’s nuclear threats is even more dangerous and risky. By suggesting a willingness to use nuclear weapons, Putin is also signaling his commitment to winning the war in Ukraine at ever-increasing costs. In the event Russia is facing defeat on the battlefield, Putin may resort to tactical nuclear weapons use in a key strategic region, such as Kherson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deterring Putin from using nuclear weapons will require concerted international efforts. The international community should make it clear that any nuclear use in Ukraine would turn Russia into an international pariah and while nuclear weapons might win a battle, they will lose Putin the war. This message would be particularly meaningful coming from Russia’s key strategic partners in Beijing and New Delhi. But U.S. and NATO leaders should also continue to rely on risk reduction measures and crisis communication channels, such as the October call between Secretary of Defense Austin and his Russian counterpart, Sergei Shoigu. The West may not be able to stop Putin from threatening to use nuclear weapons, but countries can work to prevent him from following through on those threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-might-this-end&quot;&gt;How Might This End?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eliot Cohen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conventional wisdom says “negotiations,” of course. That is the point that the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, and numerous civilian officials in the U.S. government have often made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some sense this is true: a bunch of tired men sitting around a table conclude most wars — but that can be a surrender negotiation (which is not much of a negotiation), or a ceasefire arrangement (which merely creates an interlude until the next round of fighting) or a grand peace-fest like Vienna 1815. “Negotiation,” in other words, covers a multitude of events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, it is most likely that what will not happen is the kind of negotiation Milley and others have in mind — a genuine compromise that brings about peace. What is more likely is that one side or the other collapses in exhaustion, and that the result is a ceasefire for now, which is the predicate for another conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conceivably, if the West continues to be dilatory in arming Ukraine, it could be Kyiv that crawls wearily to the table. But it is rather more likely the Russians will be the ones to do so, if (as laid out above) outside support is robust, the Ukrainians maintain their immense capacity to adapt and continue the fight, Russia sees collapses in its fighting force, and the West maintains a united front rejecting nuclear threats. After suffering another hundred thousand or more casualties and feeling the internal strains of an unjust and ill-conceived war, Russia could be driven by Ukrainian grit and Western firepower and battlefield intelligence to slump its way to a table at which it agrees to leave the lands it has pillaged, and the populations it has occupied, violated, and slaughtered. But it depends on us.&lt;/p&gt;

IPEF holds the rare distinction of being a multilateral approach to regional economic integration that includes both the United States and India — two nations often at odds during multilateral trade talks.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;Divided into four pillars — Connected Economy, Resilient Economy, Clean Economy, and Fair Economy — IPEF is aimed at structural economic transformation. The 14-member country arrangement is driven by the political urgency of countering Chinese economic influence in the region. With the special negotiation meetings for IPEF in New Delhi held between February 8–11, CSIS experts provide their analyses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;managing-indias-supply-chain-disruptions&quot;&gt;Managing India’s Supply Chain Disruptions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jayant Krishna&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IPEF aspires to rewrite the rules of engagement for the twenty-first century economies and enable them to grow faster and fairer. It is surely bigger than Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) in size as well as clout and continues to expand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like other nations with a significant industrial footprint, India also experienced serious supply chains disruptions in supply of electronic components, semiconductor devices, minerals, and other raw materials due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The worsening of trade relations among Asian countries, a logistics slowdown, and China’s economic coercion only added to its economic woes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supply chain resilience is one of IPEF’s four key themes. Beyond the traditional risk management frameworks deployed by the industry, India could leverage IPEF to develop an adaptive capability of its supply chain to prepare for unprecedented events, become responsive to disruptions, and maintain business continuity at an optimum level of connectivity, coordination, and command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IPEF already accounts for 40 percent of global GDP and is likely to cross 50 percent soon. With pragmatic supply chain framework understanding expected to be operative among IPEF signatory nations, India would be far better positioned to safeguard its supply chains against the associated vulnerabilities. This would ensure that India’s industrial output does not remain compromised and the GDP continues to grow uninhibited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mukesh Butani&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IPEF meeting presents a significant opportunity for India to push its key reform agenda on multilateral tax policy and trade, keeping in mind investment and inclusive economic growth. Specifically, it presents an opportunity to move forward with member states for comprehensive free trade agreements and reduction of trade barriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The forum will play a critical role in building global consensus on contentious cross-border tax issues, such as taxation of digital services, virtual digital assets, and indirect transfer of capital assets. Most of these are being debated at wider multilateral institutions such as Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), International Monetary Fund, and World Bank — however, there is inertia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The member states should reaffirm their commitment to transparency by adopting global best practices on a common framework for the exchange of information for tax purposes and crypto trades. The forum is expected to supplement efforts to improve tax administration and mutual cooperation by supporting the ongoing work on the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project’s Two-Pillar Solution and tax inspectors without borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strengthening-leadership-in-clean-energy-and-improving-domestic-programs&quot;&gt;Strengthening Leadership in Clean Energy and Improving Domestic Programs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kartikeya Singh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the upcoming ministerial meeting of the IPEF, leaders will gather to deliberate the next steps on the guiding pillars. India is a participant to pillar three: Clean Economy. To activate meaningful cooperation between India and the other members of this pillar, India can contribute in the following ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;structuring reverse auctions for utility-scale clean energy projects to ensure lowest tariffs;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;designing bulk procurement programs to reduce cost of energy efficiency, and e-mobility ventures;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;promoting joint financial and technical partnerships for business transition toward clean energy verticals between state-owned enterprises, including National Thermal Power Corporation, Coal India, and Indian Oil with peer institutions in partner countries (i.e., to foster the growth of offshore wind industry); and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;consolidating the One Sun, One World, One Grid by designing effective electricity transmission, which would dovetail with the efforts to create an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) super-grid or the proposed undersea interconnection between Australia and Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In exchange, given the recent line items in India’s 2023 budget where clean energy featured heavily, India should work with IPEF partner countries to add value to these efforts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;work with partner countries to develop a green hydrogen ecosystem, including crowding demand for products like green steel to develop an edge in low carbon production;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;jointly create the supply chains for critical materials that are required for powering the clean energy economy, given countries like Australia, Indonesia, and others with large reserves of these materials are in the coalition, is beneficial;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;jointly develop and improve the technologies that can dovetail with India’s biogas (GOBARdhan Scheme) to ensure its success; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;negotiate how countries in IPEF might create their own versions of the United States’ Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) to ensure healthy competition and joint benefit-sharing of localized job creation from enacting such incentive schemes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;improving-governance-efficacy-and-attracting-foreign-direct-investment&quot;&gt;Improving Governance Efficacy and Attracting Foreign Direct Investment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alok Gupta&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IPEF is aimed at incentivizing partner countries to contribute to stability, prosperity, development, and peace in the Indo-Pacific region. Inducing cooperation between the countries requires effective governance at the back end. This is to ensure that the commitments made by partner countries are timely and effectively implemented. Several countries in the region suffer from endemic institutional problems such as ineffective bureaucracies and corruption. Addressing these challenges will be crucial for ensuring that development efforts in the region are not in vain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To contextualize, the United States should look at where India stands in terms of governance. Per the Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) 2021, published by the World Bank, India occupies 11th position out of the 14 IPEF countries on two measured metrics — government effectiveness and control of corruption. Out of a maximum score of 100, India received 62.5 on government effectiveness, as opposed to index leader Singapore, which has 100, and Philippines, which is at the bottom of the chart with 57.69. Similarly, on control of corruption, India scored 46.63. New Zealand leads the chart with a score of 99.04, and Philippines is at the bottom with 34.13. While India has improved since the previous rankings in 2016, there is a long road ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Better governance and less corruption can enable a more conducive environment for commercial cooperation and technical exchanges which can increase the FDI in the country and growth in economy, thus driving to prosperity and peace. India needs to accelerate its efforts of improving governance and employ technological advances to work towards creating an efficacious environment for collaboration and cooperation. Specifically, India needs to proactively engage the United States on technological exchanges and commercial engagements to enhance trade and mutually benefit both countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The geostrategic stakes of Ukraine’s reconstruction are such that failure could have disastrous consequences not just for Ukraine but also for the broader region and the world order.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/xAlHCTY.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But successful reconstruction for Ukraine must begin before the war is won. This will require effort from a multitude of donor countries, multilateral institutions, and actors in the private sector. The international donor community will play a critical role in enabling this private sector investment that will fund Ukraine’s reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5O8cSTJ.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To secure a truly durable peace, Ukraine must transform itself economically. Corruption must be tamed, governance and the rule of law improved, and the power of oligarchs and vested interests broken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/pF7kERr.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Central to this economic transformation will be the political process of Ukraine’s accession to the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU accession experience of other Central and Eastern European countries has shown that most of the benefits of EU membership actually come from the reforms undertaken to enter the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These reforms will enable transformation of Ukraine’s economy from the old model toward one that incubates innovation, supports entrepreneurs, interconnects with the rest of Europe and the world, and delivers inclusive prosperity for citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Ri5Q9kO.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June 2022, the European Union took the step of formally recognizing Ukraine as a candidate for membership; fulfilling this process after the war, on a clearly defined timeline, is essential to secure Ukraine’s economic and political future firmly imbedded in the Euro-Atlantic community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve these goals, however, will require a significant commitment by Ukraine and its partners to winning the peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-wartime-economy-in-ukraine&quot;&gt;The Wartime Economy in Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/vHpjALX.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the initial devastation, in October 2022, Russia began a series of sustained air and missile attacks that have inflicted extensive damage on Ukraine’s electrical grid, water supply, and heating sources. The investment firm Dragon Capital estimated that due to these strikes against Ukraine’s infrastructure, Ukraine’s GDP would decline by 32 percent in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/AyKH3tJ.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
▲ Firefighters put out a fire on the ruins of an electrical products plant following missile strikes in Kharkiv in October 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite cutting its budget back to the bare minimum, Ukraine expects a monthly budget deficit of $3 billion in 2023, or $36 billion for the year. In August 2022 the nation reached an agreement with its creditors to suspend interest payments for 24 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This included a limited restructuring of its sovereign debt, but until Ukraine resumes payments, it is effectively blocked from accessing international capital markets. On the local capital markets, interest rates have risen to such a level that Ukraine cannot issue additional debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/qqoadBE.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To cover the fiscal gaps, Ukraine has relied on a large amount of direct budget support supplied by the United States, the European Union, and international financial institutions (IFIs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This money has enabled Ukraine to continue to meet its government obligations. However, some have disbursed the money more slowly than others, forcing the government of Ukraine to resort to inflationary financing by issuing additional currency when civil servant salaries must be paid and foreign funding is delayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The scale of destruction and the government’s deteriorating fiscal position suggest that without sufficient outside assistance, Ukraine could win the war militarily but lose economically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;winning-the-economic-war&quot;&gt;Winning the Economic War&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6fT9MVp.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign assistance will not be enough to rebuild Ukraine and ensure an economic victory for Ukraine and the surrounding region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The G7 and its European partners must therefore strategically use the money available to strengthen Ukraine’s enabling environment for private sector investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/qcANNG5.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States, the European Union, other G7 countries, and the IFIs must find ways to use official finance to mitigate risks and incentivize investment in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, much of the hard work of governance, rule of law, and other regulatory reforms will need to be paid for with foreign assistance and there are still many variables to take into account when planning reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine and the international community held a series of conferences in 2022 — Lugano (July), Prague (August), and Berlin (October) — to undertake important initial planning for this process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rTQ5qbL.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;
▲ Ukraine’s prime minister Denys Shmyhal delivers a speech at the Lugano conference in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine also released a National Recovery Plan (NRP) in July 2022 that lays out the country’s preliminary effort at not only rebuilding but also transforming itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NRP is a bold, expansive plan that covers nearly every aspect of Ukraine’s economy and infrastructure, and it should be at the center of future reconstruction efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NRPs objectives are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Economic, social, and environmental resilience&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Quick solutions for recovery of the economic, social, and environmental sectors&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A modernization and growth plan that will “ensure expedited sustainable economic growth and [the] wellbeing of the people”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian government estimates the plan would cost between $750 billion and $1 trillion and ideally would be financed through a mix of grants, soft loans, and private sector investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NRP is divided into three phases:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Immediate needs through 2022&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Medium-term needs (2023–25)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Long-term needs for a modernization phase (2026–32)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/k9EreJB.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To meet Ukraine’s immediate, medium-term, and long-term needs, the United States should announce a multiyear, multibillion-dollar commitment to fund the economic reconstruction of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This announcement would be most effective in early 2023 and if given in tandem with similar commitments by the European Union and other G7 partners like Canada, the United Kingdom, and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of its commitment, the European Union should offer a specific timeline and set of conditions for Ukraine’s accession as a full EU member.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/mfgphrq.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image12&quot; /&gt;
▲ Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky and European Council president Charles Michel give a press conference following talks in Kyiv in January 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This offer needs to be genuine on the part of the European Union, and the timeline for accession should be no more than 10–15 years. Anything longer is not serious and could weaken Ukrainian resolve to pursue the needed reforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside pledged financial assistance, this offer will ensure Ukraine has a clear, time-defined road map outlining what is required to join the European Union. This in turn will give businesses the confidence to invest for the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-clear-path-forward&quot;&gt;A Clear Path Forward&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/8ld0HSA.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image13&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s NRP should be at the center of reconstruction efforts, and Ukraine must lead in prioritizing reconstruction projects under a joint plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two cornerstones of this joint plan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A genuine partnership between Ukraine, the United States, other G7 countries, and the European Union&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clear planning with assigned roles on a long-term timeline&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scale of reconstruction requires a clear commitment from Ukraine’s partners for at least a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also requires IFIs, the World Bank, G7 development agencies, and relevant development finance institutions (DFIs) to work closely to reduce overlap and inefficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jSnJQ0K.png&quot; alt=&quot;image15&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defining roles and responsibilities for these groups will avoid onerous conditions on aid or duplication of effort. All conditionality requirements should be aligned with the reforms the Ukrainian government must undertake to court the private sector and win the peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reforms-critical-for-success&quot;&gt;Reforms Critical for Success&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/WboTF7O.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image16&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The private sector needs to engage sooner rather than later for reconstruction to be successful. However, there are four significant barriers to investment and private sector engagement in reconstruction:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Governance, corruption, and accountability&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inefficient economic sectors&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Outdated infrastructure and limited trade linkages&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Access to finance&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Prioritizing reforms that will strengthen governance and accountability and create the enabling conditions for greater private investment in Ukraine will be an essential first step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These reforms can coincide with the requirements of Ukraine’s candidacy as an EU and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) member. The chief priorities of these reforms include&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;strengthening rule of law&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;increasing transparency, and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;implementing accountability mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One critical piece of implementing these reforms is strengthening Ukraine’s judicial system to ensure it is free from corruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the economic front, this will include breaking the power of oligarchs and vested interests. Creating a level playing field for Ukrainian businesses of all sizes free of the undue influence of corrupt actors will also be essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another key step is developing a well-functioning, independent court system that draws upon the dispute resolution and bankruptcy laws of Ukraine’s Western allies. Prewar efforts to decentralize the government should continue, and the international community should work with municipal governments on reconstruction efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/oUrnPsQ.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image18&quot; /&gt;
▲ The Office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine. Andriy Kostin, who was appointed as prosecutor in summer 2022, is committed to rooting out government corruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The international community can also provide accountability and transparency to support local civil society contractor procurement and investor screening, prevent malign influence, and vet and prequalify companies and contractors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working closely with the Ukrainian government, the United States, the European Union, and other international partners can establish an independent monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;amp;E) system so that funds are tracked properly and it is possible to judge the success or failure of projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting these reforms right will enable Ukraine to modernize and transform its economy in a way that will help guarantee its security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ukraines-future-economy&quot;&gt;Ukraine’s Future Economy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/gVFvJMP.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image19&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lenna Koszarny, founding partner and chief executive officer of Horizon Capital, described Ukraine’s future economy as “brains, hands and grains.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This vision for Ukraine’s economy is structured around its digital and information, communications, and technology (ICT); existing advanced manufacturing; and agriculture sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/wCO2z3c.png&quot; alt=&quot;image20&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine is already a leading player in the technology and digital sector and should be seen as a source of innovation. Western-based technology and digital service companies — several of which already had a prewar presence in Ukraine — should double down on Ukraine’s well-educated workforce and create additional outposts in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If properly supported, all of these well-established and in-demand sectors could build on Ukraine’s impressive economic foundation and unlock significant equitable economic growth for Ukraine for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emphasizing these three economic areas also offer clear opportunities to economically integrate Ukraine with the European Union and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, foreign direct investment by Germany, France, the Netherlands, and other Western European countries into productive sectors of other former Warsaw Pact countries has been critical to their economic success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given its geographic location and well-trained workforce, Ukraine is well positioned to serve as an off-shoring destination for manufacturing in a postwar environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;winning-the-peace&quot;&gt;Winning the Peace&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/NLUHgWF.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image22&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the February 2022 invasion, Ukrainians have increasingly looked to a future in the European Union and the broader Euro-Atlantic community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no reason Ukraine cannot join the ranks of other Central and Eastern European countries that cast off their Russian-dominated pasts and transformed themselves into modern, vibrant democratic economies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/pbGWalC.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image23&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Ukraine is well placed to be a leader in the region and in Europe more broadly, stabilizing not only the region but also the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States, European Union, and G7 should do everything in their power to realize this vision after Ukraine wins the war with Russia. With strong partnership, clear planning, and necessary reforms, Ukraine will have the support it needs to win the peace.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;官批准傳召兩警長就FB及YouTube作供 料4名同案被告作供需時6周&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/wH5ye3c.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（10日）於西九龍裁判法院（暫代高院）續審。控方昨已讀出整份開案陳詞，何桂藍的代表大律師今反對控方傳召兩名警長以「專家證人」身份就 Facebook 和 YouTube 作供，指控方太遲提供證人口供紀錄予被告，導致她難以尋找辯方專家，對她造成不公。控方代表、副刑事檢控專員萬德豪則強調已在切實可行的情況下盡早把證人口供交予被告，況且4名認罪被告出庭作供需時6星期，被告依然有時間尋找辯方專家證人。法官最終批准控方傳召兩名警長作供，但二人的專家資格尚未確立，日後將會處理。案件下周一續審，預料控方開始傳召4名認罪被告區諾軒、趙家賢、鍾錦麟及林景楠。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表包括大律師沈士文、張耀良、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等，本身是大律師的劉偉聰則會自辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方稱已在切實可行下盡早提供文件-未對被告不公&quot;&gt;控方稱已在切實可行下盡早提供文件 未對被告不公&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、副刑事檢控專員萬德豪指，控方於2022年6月已把交付至高院文件夾給予被告，但當時仍未提供控方證人書面證供。至2023年1月，控方把審前覆核文件夾提供予被告，當中顯示控方有意傳召專家證人，而警長6533分別於1月6日及1月9日錄取口供，分別就 Facebook 和 YouTube 的運作提供證據。然而代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 卻於1月10日表達反對立場，但其時證人已完成錄取口供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方承認未有按《實務指示》在交付程序之前，將專家報告送達辯方，但強調只用了一星期時間把警長證人口供交給被告，乃在切實可行的情況下盡早（as soon as practicable）提交文件，沒有對被告構成不公。至1月16日，被告已收到相關文件。控方強調，由1月16日至今天，被告總共有26日研究及決定是否傳召辯方證人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提及其中一名專家證人為警長6533，但他錄取口供時職級仍是警員（police constable），之後才晉升至警長（sergeant）。法官李運騰指文件顯示他以警長身份簽署，要求澄清他身份是警員還是警長，「他預料到自己會升職嗎？」惹來被告發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方料4名同案被告作供需時6星期-並會傳召與協調會議有關的證人&quot;&gt;控方料4名同案被告作供需時6星期 並會傳召「與協調會議有關的證人」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又表示，下周一起將傳召4名同案被告出庭作供，若計算辯方盤問的時間在內，預料合共需時4星期。法官李運騰一度反問控方是否有點樂觀，因合共有16名被告的辯方律師需要盤問。控方其後更正所需時間為6星期。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，然後會傳召一名與協調會議有關的證人，以及政府官員，包括選舉事務處，因此預料在4月中之前，控方仍未會傳召兩名警長，何桂藍仍有時間準備或尋找辯方專家，若果有任何對她不公的情況，也有時間作出補救。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方強調，兩名專家證人僅就十分常用的社交媒體的一般運作提供證據，而該些社交媒體可以發布文章、照片和影片等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何桂藍控方遲交證供-致遭受不公&quot;&gt;何桂藍：控方遲交證供 致遭受不公&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 則投訴，控方太遲提供證人口供，以致辯方沒有足夠時間尋找辯方專家，因為他們不像律政司般有自己的專家，而是需要在外尋找學者擔任辯方專家。Trevor Beel 指，被告於1月31日才收到警長6533首兩份口供的英文譯本，至2月6日即開審當日，才收妥所有口供，包括另一警長3137的口供及英文譯本。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trevor Beel 強調是次並非一般的審訊，可能對辯方構成困難。法官陳慶偉認為此說法只是猜測，但 Trevor Beel 則指此乃合理期望。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trevor Beel 又表示，若果控方安排兩名警察以專家證人身份作供，便會爭議兩名證人的專家身份；若果二人僅以事實證人身份作供，那便不會提出相關爭議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;他總結指，其當事人因為控方遲來的專家證供，而遭受無法彌補的不公（unredeemable prejudice），要求法庭拒絕控方傳召兩名警長。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法官提醒控方只可就法律陳詞&quot;&gt;法官提醒控方只可就法律陳詞&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表萬德豪回應時批評，辯方一直未開始尋找辯方專家，打算等待今日法庭決定是否批准傳召兩名警長作供後，才決定是否尋找。他又指何桂藍的律師團隊懂閱讀中文，能從中文本得知證人身份是警長而不是警員，而毋須等待英文譯本。法官李運騰打斷，此僅為翻譯問題，提醒萬德豪的陳詞應圍繞法律議題。萬德豪其後表示沒有進一步陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法官批准傳召2名警長就-facebook-和-youtube-作供&quot;&gt;法官批准傳召2名警長就 Facebook 和 YouTube 作供&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;休庭45分鐘後，法官陳慶偉宣布批准控方傳召兩名警長出庭作供，但不代表法庭接納二人的報告內容，而二人的專家資格是否確立則有待日後處理。稍後會頒布書面理由。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳官並指，從庭上雙方的陳詞可見，Facebook 和 YouTube 影片的真確性（authenticity）和可呈堂性（admissibility）是一項尚未處理的問題，可是沒有任何人在案件管理階段提出過相關議題，若果有任何人挑戰控方呈交的 Facebook 和 YouTube 影片，便會對審訊有重大影響。陳官表示，若辯方有意提出爭議，法庭期望他們在下周一續審時提出，屆時需研究有什麼選項，包括分拆案件審訊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另提及控方開案陳詞指稱被告串謀計劃的協議內容涉及4項「非法手段」，然而早於案件進行交付程序時，控方卻指稱協議內容涉及公開行為（Overt acts)，要求控方釐清指控基礎。 法官則指稍後處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，代表黃碧雲的大律師沈士文申請撤銷宵禁令，其他辯方律師紛紛提出相同申請，皆獲陳官批准，所有早前須遵守宵禁的保釋被告可獲撤銷宵禁令。陳官亦批准保釋的被告在審訊期間不需到警署報到。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（9日）於西九龍裁判法院（暫代高院）續審。控方繼續讀出開案陳詞中，針對5名新界東候選人何桂藍、陳志全、鄒家成、林卓廷和梁國雄的涉案言行。其中何桂藍被指提倡奪取立法會主導權以「破局」，及宣揚攬炒和籲外國更強硬對待中共；鄒家成被指有份草擬「墨落無悔」聲明及宣揚香港民族主義，又稱要進入議會「打交」及「做任何手段癱瘓每一個議會進行」；林卓廷被搜出的初選論壇筆記，寫有「完全同意光復香港，時代革命呢個理念」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，控方指何桂藍出席抗爭派記者會，是重申無差別否決財政預算案，惟其代表律師稱她沒有發言，指控只是鬆散地（loosely）基於其他被告發言。法官李運騰表示開案陳詞中許多事實及宣言都是出自其他認罪被告，特別是戴耀廷、區諾軒及趙家賢，相信控方是依賴「共謀者原則」，至於是否適用會由法庭判斷。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪的被告包括獲准保釋的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信10人，及還柙的何桂藍、吳政亨、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及余慧明6人。認罪的袁嘉蔚、吳敏兒、朱凱廸、岑敖暉、黃之鋒和馮達浚亦有列席，開庭前被懲教帶往被告欄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指何桂藍倡奪立會主導權爭破局&quot;&gt;控方指何桂藍倡奪立會主導權爭「破局」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就前《立場新聞》記者何桂藍，控方指她簽署「墨落無悔」聲明，並在參選宣言〈一息尚存，力戰不降〉表示面對《國安法》的逼害及打壓仍不會放棄抵抗，「識時務者，會笑我哋螳臂擋車，作無謂嘅抵抗同犧牲。但佢哋永遠都唔會明白，我哋前仆後繼，係因為我哋知道，反抗，先可以改變到香港嘅宿命」。何又指：「面對極權，我哋的確一無所有，只能夠以我哋嘅人生、前程、甚至肉身同生命作為代價去抗衡國家機器⋯⋯喺今時今日嘅香港，議會要去助燃場運動，而唔係再拖抗爭嘅後腿⋯⋯我哋只可以用盡一切方法同中共周旋到底。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何其後發布宣傳影片，提及「攞到立法會過半嘅主導權，我哋就可以逼出一個北京冇可能接受到嘅局面，從而令到佢用更加瘋狂嘅方式去應對，要付出更加高昂嘅政治代價」，又在初選論壇奪取立會過半「唔係講緊再投議員入去議事咁簡單」，而是「將立法會變成人民嘅武器」，指「要突破中共set畀香港嘅死局，需要最多嘅抗爭派進入議會」。播放片段時，何桂藍露出笑眼，又一度以雙手掩眼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何在新界東初選民間論壇，亦重申35+並非最終目的，不應幻想取得35+後可逼使政府實現承諾，並指當選者應「用盡一切嘅方式去繼續個議會抗爭，去繼續施壓」。何其後亦表明不害怕被DQ，並承諾與抗爭派議員站在同一陣線，於議會內進行肢體抗爭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指何桂藍宣揚攬炒籲外國更強硬對待中共&quot;&gt;控方指何桂藍宣揚攬炒、籲外國更強硬對待中共&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指，何宣揚及堅定支持「攬炒」，指《國安法》落實和外國介入是香港抗爭者觸發的連鎖效應，透過港人「犧牲」達致「攬炒」。她提倡以「街頭戰線」和「國際戰線」反抗，7月8日為袁嘉蔚助選時向被通緝的羅冠聰的海外游說工作致敬，並發文要求外國以更強硬態度對待中共的威脅。控方讀出何桂藍發言指「所以今日 Tiffany 再次喺《國安法》已經實施咗嘅宜家，國安公署就喺嗰邊，但係佢仍然好勇敢咁樣走出嚟」時，何轉頭望向袁嘉蔚微笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何曾表示，為有效達到35+，民主派應團結利用初選配票，又在初選首日籲公眾投票，指在白色恐怖年代，初選投票率可向國際社會展示港人具頑強的反抗意志、無懼《國安法》，亦讓更多抗爭派議員進入議會帶來真正改變。何其後勝出初選並報名立法會選舉，但被DQ，她發文指DQ是要抹殺35+的可能性，呼籲繼續反對中共及中央政府，並要求外國介入，又在《洛杉磯時報》撰文重申在立會獲得多數反對的重要性。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，警方搜得她與岑敖暉的競選單張，其中控方指以〈中共推『國安立法』 香港變『一國一制』〉為題的單張推動抵抗中共；〈國安法打到嚟監控有冇得避？〉則指控《國安法》落實後會加強對港人監控，威脅港人安全和私隱。控方又指，何桂藍競選宣言透過指控「香港制度崩壞、法治無存」，鼓吹對政權的不滿。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何桂藍大狀稱何無於抗爭派記者會發言-僅依賴其他被告說法&quot;&gt;何桂藍大狀稱何無於抗爭派記者會發言 僅依賴其他被告說法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指，何桂藍勝出初選後，與另外14名被告出席抗爭派記者會，重申會維持對政府堅定抗爭，即無差別否決財政預算以迫使特首回應五大訴求。惟其代表大律師 Trevor Beel 指，何並沒有在記者會發言，控方如有任何指控，亦只是鬆散地（loosely）基於其他被告的發言。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰表示明白，指開案陳詞中，許多事實及宣言都是出自其他認罪被告，特別是戴耀廷、區諾軒及趙家賢。他指，相信控方是依賴「共謀者原則（co-conspirator rule）」，至於該原則是否適用則交由法庭判斷。周天行一度欲回應，但法官指現時為控方提出指控的階段，控方不用回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指慢必籲議會抗爭升級筆記稱簽墨落無悔是要有攬炒決心&quot;&gt;控方指慢必籲議會抗爭升級、筆記稱簽墨落無悔是要有攬炒決心&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於時任人民力量主席、立法會議員陳志全，控方指人民力量曾於2020年3月發聲明，表示全力投入「謀劃」，他於同月與人民力量副主席、譚得志主持的電台節目《人民主場》中，亦承諾人民力量會全力支持「謀劃」並盡力實現，強調參與者應遵守共同綱領，又批評《蘋果日報》錯誤指人民力量反對初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，陳志全曾在6月的街站，呼籲在街頭、議會、國際、網上及黃色經濟圈戰線持續抗爭，「每一條戰線如果大家幫到手嘅，都應該盡力而為，係不容有失」，又指「同港共政權，同中共抗爭到底」，並重申不惜否決財政預算案，是要迫使政府重啟政改、回應五大訴求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳其後在初選論壇表明，「人民力量過去係走在抗爭最前線，最早，最可靠嘅抗爭力量」，並強調議會抗爭要升級，「令政府要通過啲惡法或者係撥款嘅時候，難度越嚟越高同埋要越嚟越樣衰」，並指自己曾到「前線」及承諾協助流亡者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，陳志全曾發起眾籌，以支持他在議會戰線繼續抗爭，並與譚得志受訪，稱35+重要性在反對預算案，「乜嘢惡法都可以反對反對反對，大白象工程又反對反對反對，跟住反對埋財政預算案，解散立法會，特首都要下台」。陳被捕後，警方搜得他準備初選的筆記簿，提及「點解要簽“自殺聯署聲明” 攬炒面對強權 要有『置諸死地而後生』決心」，又提及他對議會和街頭戰線互動的理解，籲在所有戰線抗爭。陳最終勝出及報名參選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指鄒家成草擬墨落無悔聲明稱參選目的宣揚香港民族主義&quot;&gt;控方指鄒家成草擬「墨落無悔」聲明、稱參選目的宣揚香港民族主義&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就本土派鄒家成，控方指他與梁晃維及張可森，於2020年6月草擬「墨落無悔」聲明，顯示他們堅定承諾否決財政預算案，迫使特首回應五大訴求，亦協助其他參與者作出相同承諾。庭上播放3人受訪片段，解釋發起聲明原因，鄒家成指得悉不需簽署共同綱領後，「我哋第一個感覺就話我哋要簽返啲嘢喎，唔可以畀泛民主派單方面去撕毀約章」，梁晃維則指初選協議鬆散，需有確切文件證明。在張可森指簽署後「絕對唔可以反悔」時，鄒家成邊聽邊點頭，至張稱若其他參選人回應到時代要前進的方向，「其實你唔會覺得我哋係夾你嘅」，有被告發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，鄒家成同月於 Facebook 發文，表示「重光未至，我哋絕無放棄時代革命嘅本錢」，又指「我決定除低面罩投身政治，就係為咗將香港民族嘅理念散播到每一個角落，同殖民者設計嘅議會制度攬炒到底」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，鄒在論壇宣揚「攬炒」及分離主義思想，並詆毀「一國兩制」，指議會不需「西裝骨骨的政客」議政，而是要選出「具備攬炒意思嘅抗爭者為大家衝擊體制，撕下香港政治上最後一塊畫皮」，籲投選有抗爭意志的代議士進入立會刺穿假象。他又指自己參選目的「非常之旗幟鮮明」，就是宣揚香港民族主義，指「建立一個民族出嚟，我哋先能夠對抗到中華民族嘅入侵」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，鄒在《國安法》生效後，指控《國安法》將香港變成極權社會，承諾面對打壓仍會繼續抗爭，並指所有參選代議士都應進入議會「打交」，及「做任何手段癱瘓每一個議會進行」。鄒家成其後勝出初選，並出席抗爭派記者會及聯署抗爭派聲明，承諾否決財政預算迫使政府回應五大訴求，鄒家成會上表明許多本土派勝出，要「讓本土成為主流」。他其後報名參選立法會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指林卓廷筆記稱完全同意光時選舉延後仍稱要堅守議會戰線&quot;&gt;控方指林卓廷筆記稱完全同意「光時」、選舉延後仍稱要堅守議會戰線&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於時任民主黨副主席，身兼立法會議員及北區區議員的林卓廷，控方指其競選單張將中共和政府標籤為對人權自由帶來前所未有威脅的「極權」，呼籲團結抗爭及對抗警暴。林並在6月的初選論壇，表示「中共粗暴制訂國安法，全方面鎮壓香港人。我哋香港人惟有用勇敢、智慧，同埋我哋嘅堅毅，去對抗呢個極權」。控方又指他散播對警察沒有根據的指控，承諾當選後會向警察報復。涉擾亂議會秩序案的他亦承諾會繼續在立會抗爭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;警方在林卓廷家中搜得其「初選 Debate Notes」，寫有「完全同意光復香港，時代革命呢個理念」。就會否反對財政預算案，筆記指「（民主黨主席）胡志偉一再公開回應話會『積極運用』（《基本法》權力反對）。況且，其實我立法會四年沒有贊成過財政預算案。」至於為何不簽「墨落無悔」，筆記寫上「因為尊重戴教授，他的決定有他的理據」，並指「如果戴教授真係有份嘢，我哋承諾咗會簽」。筆記最後提及籲港人投票、珍惜每個表態機會，控方後播放初選論壇片段，顯示林最後同樣稱「香港人唔知道幾時我哋嘅投票權會最終被剝奪。我希望各位珍惜手上嘅一票」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指，林在另一份筆記表明他在議會、街頭及國際戰線抗爭的決心，及解釋三線結合能加強對抗政權的「非法目的」。林最終勝出初選並報名立法會選舉，而在選舉延後之後，控方指林持續詆毀並要求繼續堅定對抗政府， 包括2020年9月與梁晃維出席港大學生會舉辦的「立會委任惹爭議 議員去留利與弊」公開辯論，表明要堅守議會戰線，以配合街頭抗爭及國際聯繫，「延續三線相輔相成的抗爭策略」，又指「棄守議會戰線呢，係會令到我哋嚟緊大開中門，令到啲保皇黨同埋政府不斷打壓我哋香港人」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方播放林卓廷初選論壇片段時，亦顯示其他候選人的發言，梁國雄稱「撐手足」後，任控方證人的林景楠說「撐手足，可以捐612或者支持黃色經濟圈」，有被告發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指梁國雄稱奪全面否決權社民連欲組織罷工引國際支援&quot;&gt;控方指梁國雄稱奪全面否決權、社民連欲組織罷工引國際支援&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就時任社民連主席、前立法會議員梁國雄，其競選單張題為「五大訴求 缺一不可 抵抗惡法 您我同行」，並指他「貫徹社民連主張議會、街頭和法庭三面抗爭的策略」，決心落實「五大訴求」。梁又在6月24日的社民連街頭集會表示：「功成不必在我，但係一路我都係喺抗爭路上未缺席過嘅，冇理由而家缺席，亦都冇理由唔係同香港人一齊抵抗，抵抗，抵抗。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，梁國雄同日轉發社民連聲明〈【爭奪全面否決權 持續不斷抗暴政】一 社會民主連線回應當前香港政治形勢變化的決議文〉，表明要在議會奪「全面否決權」，否決惡法和不義撥款，制衡中共「全面管治權」及迫使政府實現「五大訴求」；又指爭取立會過半與尋求外國制裁同樣重要，社民連亦會嘗試組織更大規模的公民抗爭或總罷工，以引起國際社會支援。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;梁國雄沒有簽署「墨落無悔」聲明，在初選論壇被問到為何不簽，他解釋認為只是重複35+初衷，如「一定要否決財政預算案」，但他指自己過往任議員多年，每年均會否決財政預算，「呢個問題對我嚟講已經唔係問題」，故沒有需要簽署。他又在論壇上說：「我哋要攞個全面嘅否決權，操諸我手。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，梁國雄在初選前呼籲公眾投票，指他們不應懼怕《國安法》，要繼續堅持抗爭。他最終落選，並以社民連副主席身份發聲明，指社民連會遵守初選協議，又形容宣稱初選違法的說法是沒有根據及「有趣（amusing）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主控周天行主動提出，開案陳詞有兩處指梁國雄「無差別（indiscriminately）」否決財政預算案，惟原文無提及，會將之刪除。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官提醒法庭內應用杯飲水只能飲凍水&quot;&gt;官提醒法庭內應用杯飲水、只能飲凍水&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，法官陳慶偉今在聆訊期間提醒，法庭內不可飲用樽裝飲料（“No one should drink directly from glass or bottle.”），着庭內人士使用杯子。法官李運騰補充，這是法庭長久以來的傳統，又指只能飲凍水。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊下午續。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/oSSTSr0.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（7日）於西九龍裁判法院（暫代高院）續審。控方讀出開案陳詞中，針對柯耀林、李予信及余慧明3人的涉案言行，指時任醫管局員工陣線主席余慧明提倡全面否決政府議案「攬炒議會」，又倡組織大三罷「令社會停擺」，指「真攬炒」或許才會為香港帶來一線生機。至於柯耀林及李予信均於初選落選，李予信其後以「Plan B」身分出選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方完成閱讀開案陳詞，明日將處理控方傳召社交媒體專家證人的申請，預料周一開始傳召4名認罪被告區諾軒、趙家賢、鍾錦麟及林景楠。法官陳慶偉警告，指在座人士均知道將要傳召的證人身分，「如果任何人在證人作供時，嘗試騷擾或干預證人，會被視為藐視法庭及即時帶離法院大樓。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指柯耀林稱中共為極權國家批警搜民研製白色恐怖&quot;&gt;控方指柯耀林稱中共為極權國家、批警搜民研製白色恐怖&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;時任區政聯盟召集人、西貢區議員柯耀林是新界東候選人，控方指他簽署「墨落無悔」，並發文承諾參與初選協調，支持本土派參與「議會戰線」對抗政權。控方指，其政治宣言宣揚落實「真普選」，又散播對政權及中共沒有根據的不滿，包括指中共為「極權國家」，指極權對香港打壓加劇、嚴重破壞法治及剝奪港人自由權利、政權的暴力「猶如宣告港人治港正式死亡」，並呼籲團結對抗極權以「光復香港」。柯又表明，即使知道大機會因《國安法》被控，仍不會退縮。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指，柯在論壇呼籲議會和街頭戰線「雙結合」，爭取五大訴求，又美化違法的年輕人，指他們的「付出」值得被記住。柯表明會遵守初選協議，又籲支持有「抗爭意志」的候選人，並指自己是「行動派」，會身體力行參與議會和街頭戰線。他在初選前發文批評警方搜查民研辦公室，指是製造「白色恐怖」，籲公眾透過投票反抗。柯最終落敗並發文籲支持其他勝出者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;庭上播放片段，柯耀林在初選論壇被主持問及，2018年民主黨新東補選出現紛爭，曾形容林卓廷「人格卑劣」，「你係咪都堅持原先嘅睇法？」，柯答「係」。庭上傳出笑聲，柯耀林轉身向林卓廷做致敬手勢，林亦回以致敬手勢。主持再問：「萬一你輸咗，阿廷贏咗，你會唔會都支持佢、成全佢？」柯則表示會服膺初選協議書，支持所有出線候選人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指李予信堅持議會及街頭戰線以plan-b身分出選&quot;&gt;控方指李予信堅持議會及街頭戰線、以「Plan B」身分出選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於時任東區區議員、公民黨黨員李予信，是超級區議會候選人。控方指他於2020年3月25日出席公民黨「全面進攻 議會過半 實現五大訴求」記者會，黨魁楊岳橋曾表明，若政府不回應五大訴求，「我哋都會義無反顧咁對預算案投反對票，亦都希望能夠促成35+，一齊否決呢一個預算案」。同日李予信轉發公民黨〈【議會過半 反制政府】立法會過半的願景〉，重申相同承諾。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，李予信以公民黨名義簽署「墨落無悔」，其後報名初選，亦附上認同公民黨宣言的宣傳單張，承諾動用反對權力，促請政府落實五大訴求。控方又指，李予信在7月的初選論壇，強調即使《國安法》生效，仍會堅持在議會及街頭戰線抗爭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;公民黨初選前夕發布名為「【7.11 7.12 初選】兩分鐘睇初選點投票」的影片，稱「即使有國安法都唔會阻擋到香港人對抗極權嘅決心」，籲公眾投票，李予信並在片段解釋議會內要有不同角色和分工，望以初選決定出選人士增加勝算，令民主派奪過半議席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李予信最終落選，他公開表示不會參選立法會，但後來因3名港島區候選人被DQ，他以「Plan B」身份報名參選。警方並在其辦公室和住處搜得其政治宣言單張，及具煽動性的卡和貼紙。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指余慧明倡攬炒議會組織大三罷令社會停擺&quot;&gt;控方指余慧明倡攬炒議會、組織大三罷令社會停擺&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於時任醫管局員工陣線主席余慧明，是衞生服務界候選人，自稱本土抗爭派。控方指她在戴耀廷宣布「35+」計劃及「攬炒十步曲」後、宣布初選前，已發文及受訪表達支持。她於2020年3月在《獨媒》撰文〈踏上這攬炒旅途〉，提倡爭取35席後全面否決政府議案，觸發《基本法》第50條，令特首解散立法會及「制造憲政危機」，「攬炒」議會；又透過組織大三罷「令社會停擺」，「務求煞停一切暴政，達致制度性的改革，再共同建構重光後的香港」，表示「真攬炒」或許才會為香港帶來一線生機。她又籲「各路戰線定必要繼續，黃色經濟圈、國際戰線、文宣戰等缺一不可」，並指「要進行這場時代革命，就看大家對光復香港有多大耐性與決心」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余慧明4月接受《獨媒》訪問，指罷工一役讓她意識到「一定要用任何方法去推翻而家呢個政權、呢個政府，先可以做到一個改變」，亦清楚立會過半目標是透過否決政府所有議案，令立法會停擺，觸發憲政危機，配合罷工等逼使政府正面回應五大訴求。余5月接受《大紀元》訪問亦指「政府提出任何議案我哋都要作出反對」，以迫使政權回應「五大訴求，缺一不可」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余慧明其後簽署「墨落無悔」聲明並報名初選，提名表格附上單張寫有「我若當選，必定承諾行使反對權利反對一切議案，直至香港政府全面回應五大訴求，決一不可為止」。控方指，余在《國安法》落實後，仍受訪指擁護「攬炒」及抗爭原則，堅持對抗政權直至最後，又籲選民投選會對抗政權的候選人。其帖文提到競選口號「一息尚存 抗爭到底」、「初衷毋忘 決戰無降」，初選後感謝選民的帖文亦有口號「重光香港」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余慧明勝出初選後，發文指初選只是議會戰線的第一步，承諾會用盡一切方法令政權「付出代價」。她於7月13日出席抗爭派記者會，重申否決財政預算案迫使政府落實五大訴求，並承諾作為功能組別唯一代表，會盡力擴展抗爭戰線，同日簽署「抗爭派立法會參選人立場聲明」。余慧明7月27日報名參選立會，並在8月受訪，指若未能達成35+她仍進入議會，「我要做要做嘅嘢，繼續係要做嘅啫，要全投反對議案嘅，會繼續做，反對財政預算案嘅，我會繼續做。」警方並於其家中搜得寫有「光復香港 時代革命」、「齊上齊落」的文件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明早續審。控辯雙方一直未能就承認事實達成共識，主控萬德豪並指，周一將會準備一份或多份承認事實。辯方大律師馬維騉望控方確認，是否完成讀出承認事實後才傳召證人，法官陳慶偉着他私下與辯方討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件編號：HCCC69/2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;列席被告早休後遭懲教分開&quot;&gt;列席被告早休後遭懲教分開&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，今日有6名認罪被告列席，他們早上原獲安排與不認罪被告同坐，並由懲教人員分隔。惟早休後，座位被重新分配，6人分成3行坐在被告欄內最盡頭，與所有不認罪被告分隔。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪的被告包括獲准保釋的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信10人，及還柙的何桂藍、吳政亨、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及余慧明6人。認罪的袁嘉蔚、吳敏兒、朱凱廸、岑敖暉、黃之鋒和馮達浚6人亦有列席，開庭前被懲教帶往被告欄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，改由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表為資深大律師潘熙、大律師沈士文、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等。&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>獨媒報導</name></author><summary type="html">控方：何桂藍出席抗爭派記者會重申否決財案 辯方指何無發言 下周一起傳召四名認罪被告 官警告勿騷擾或干預作供</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/cu04ZjQ.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">【初選47人案・審訊第三日】</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-02-08-trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-3.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="【初選47人案・審訊第三日】" /><published>2023-02-08T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2023-02-08T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-3</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2023-02-08-trial-of-hk-democrat-primary-elections-day-3.html">&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（7日）於西九龍裁判法院（暫代高院）續審。控方繼續讀出開案陳詞的附表，列出各被告的涉案行為。其中3名不認罪獨立候選人，包括劉偉聰、楊雪盈及彭卓棋，均有簽署「墨落無悔」並落選，楊雪盈曾以「Plan B」身份報名參選。此外，何啟明被指散播對政權和警察無根據的不滿，指控警暴導致大量原因不明的死亡，又曾發文呼籲捐出 iPad 和 iPhone 等電子器材，以協助初選票站運作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪的被告包括獲准保釋的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信10人，及還柙的何桂藍、吳政亨、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及余慧明6人。認罪的袁嘉蔚、吳敏兒、朱凱廸、岑敖暉和黃之鋒等亦有列席，開庭前被懲教帶往被告欄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方昨日開始讀出開案陳詞的附表，列出各被告的涉案行為，當中誤稱鄭達鴻為「南區區議員」。今日甫開庭，控方更正鄭的身份為「東區區議員」，然後繼續作開案陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，法官陳慶偉發現旁聽席上有人戴白色帽，要求該人士脫帽，並提醒所有旁聽人士法庭內不得戴帽和太陽眼鏡。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，公民黨於2020年7月10日在 Facebook 發布一段名為「【7.11 7.12 初選】兩分鐘睇初選點投票」的影片，稱「即使有國安法都唔會阻擋到香港人對抗極權嘅決心」及不會放棄議會戰線。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;警方在鄭的住所和電子器材中搜得他為論壇準備的「論壇天書」及競選單張，當中承諾他會否決預算案迫特首回應「五大訴求」；又搜得公民黨簽署「墨落無悔」的截圖、初選前後他向逾2千人拉票和謝票的 WhatsApp 訊息、「Michael Cheuk Ki P…」及「區兄」就初選協議的 WhatsApp 討論截圖等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊雪盈稱否決議案向政府問責被指錯誤指控國安法&quot;&gt;楊雪盈稱否決議案向政府「問責」、被指錯誤指控國安法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就獨立候選人、時任灣仔區議會主席楊雪盈，控方指她堅定支持初選計劃，在初選競選單張中稱：「五大訴求、議會過半是我們共同呼喚的將來。」她在論壇指自己清楚知道18區區議會民主派被當局及建制派的打壓，並提倡連結民主陣營力量，以不同角色「一齊上」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，她曾在6月9日的記者會表示「35+」目標是爭取立法會控制權，透過行使《基本法》賦予的憲制權力要求政府「問責」，又承諾否決預算案逼使特首回應「五大訴求」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;初選結束後，楊在個人 Facebook 發布題為「民主路上見！」的文章，表示自己票數不足以出線，但她會遵守初選結果，承諾不參選正式立法會選舉，並呼籲她的支持者投票給民主陣營的其他候選人，以達至立會議席過半。當港島區3名民主派被「DQ」後，楊雪盈曾以「Plan B」身份報名參選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;警方在楊辦事處的電腦中發現「35+」立會過半港島區的協調機制草擬文件。其競選單張寫有「國安壓境 兩制已毀」，控方指她透過錯誤指控引起對《國安法》的強烈反對。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;彭卓棋稱不惜以肢體抗爭癱瘓政府以議員身分支援街頭抗爭&quot;&gt;彭卓棋稱不惜以肢體抗爭癱瘓政府、以議員身分支援街頭抗爭&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就獨立候選人、時任南區區議員彭卓棋，控方指他在論壇提倡街頭、議會及國際戰線，包括將中共標籤為「敵人」，表明面對極權及《國安法》打壓，仍會「聲討賣港派、港共派、中間派」，並全力對抗共產黨；亦會於議會「不惜以肢體抗爭」癱瘓政府並否決財政預算案，並透過於社運現場出現和與執法部門溝通，以其區議員身份和資源支援街頭抗爭。他亦同意建立「香港民族」，並展現反對《基本法》第23條的決心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，他於競選宣傳品自稱「本土抗爭派」，並形容香港警察為濫權及視港人為敵的「極權劊子手」，要求改革警隊及為「手足」帶來公義，並指初選最終目標是「35+」及「攬炒」，逼使政府回應「五大訴求」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表彭卓棋的大律師一度指出，彭卓棋從沒講過「無差別」地否決財政預算案，惟控方在開案陳詞中指他聲言無差別地（indiscriminately）否決財政預算。控方表示稍後會修正開案陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指何啟明散播對警察無根據不滿倡打倒共產黨&quot;&gt;控方指何啟明散播對警察無根據不滿、倡「打倒共產黨」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就時任民協副主席、深水埗區議員何啟明，控方指他在論壇提倡議會及街頭戰線，包括提及2019年8月曾於深水埗警署外與「70+手足」一起「反暴政」、「食TG（催淚彈）」；控方又指他散播對政權和警察無根據的不滿，指控警暴導致大量原因不明的死亡、「極權」透過任意拘控針對年輕人，並指控中共濫用《國安法》打壓港人及導致香港「攬炒」，港人必需反抗到底、「打倒共產黨」，並透過國際線等反抗。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指，何啟明曾發文呼籲捐出 iPad 和 iPhone 等電子器材，以協助初選票站運作；並批評警方搜查香港民研辦公室，指政權會用盡一切方法打壓初選，但他仍無畏無懼。而何啟明勝出初選後，控方指他承諾於議會抗爭，又強調不會容許「犯罪集團」警隊接受任何公帑資助。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;警方於其辦公室搜出民協2019年3月至2020年4月有關初選的會議紀錄，提及「選舉主軸」包括達至35+，及表達民協在35+的角色以游說選民支持。何的競選口號亦包括「反暴政 衛我城」、「立會過半 光復香港」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉偉聰稱議會戰線與前線裏應外合-批極權攻擊司法制度&quot;&gt;劉偉聰稱議會戰線與前線「裏應外合」 批極權攻擊司法制度&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一名獨立候選人、時任深水埗區議員劉偉聰，控方指其政治宣言提及「反惡法 抗警暴 民權重光」，而他在論壇提倡議會及街頭戰線，稱透過爭取「35+」便可修訂打壓人權的惡法，又美化前線抗爭者和「暴徒」為「手足」，讚賞他們展示建制外改變歷史的力量，並指留守後方的人可參與議會戰線，與前線「裏應外合」反抗政權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉亦批評政府為獨裁，指律政司司長及政府委任的代表令公眾對司法獨立嚴重失去信心，其競選單張亦表明港人公民權利被打壓，他目睹極權持續不斷打壓及攻擊香港司法制度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;警方又搜得名為「623 Debate 要點」的筆記，載有劉擬於論壇詢問其他候選人的問題，包括：「黃碧雲：為何不簽署初選立場確認書？是否連否決財政算案，這樣制度內的抗爭都不願意承諾？」他又擬向何啟明指出，即使初選無要求他們簽署共同綱領，他亦自發簽署立場聲明書，確保抗爭陣營參選人有最基本抗爭意志，並問有簽署的何啟明如何看無簽署的候選人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;庭上播放一段九龍西初選論壇片段，劉偉聰回答何啟明質詢時提及律政司司長為司法人員推薦委員會的當然成員，所委任的法官缺乏市民信任，在法治風雨飄搖的時候，法官的質素和認受性至關重要，「當然我會知道 Sunny（張崑陽洋名）會話，法治唔值得再提，但係我唔係 Sunny，但我依然見到陽光，我見到 the sunny sky。」被告欄有人發出笑聲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，陳官強調不需受審的被告只是以列席者的身份出庭（acting simply as an observant），提醒他們不是來參與社交聚會（“You’re not attending social gathering.”），若果作出任何干擾，便會安排他們到另一處聽審，不要濫用可以列席的權利。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（7日）於西九龍裁判法院（暫代高院）續審。控方下午繼續讀出開案陳詞的附表，列出民主黨黃碧雲和民協施德來的涉案行為。其中黃碧雲沒有聯署「墨落無悔」，在初選論壇中遭質疑，她則回應稱會用盡憲制內所有權力和手段爭取「五大訴求」，若否決財政預算案能夠促成此目標，「我哋一定會做」。施德來則被指競選單張內容與「墨落無悔」相當相似（substantially similar），在論壇中聲言與中共「冇討論嘅空間、冇談判嘅餘地」，若當選會否決所有政府議案。二人最終在初選中落敗，之後遵守「35+」協議，沒有報名參選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪的被告包括獲准保釋的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信10人，及還柙的何桂藍、吳政亨、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及余慧明6人。認罪的袁嘉蔚、吳敏兒、朱凱廸、岑敖暉和黃之鋒等亦有列席，開庭前被懲教帶往被告欄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黃碧雲稱民主黨具議會國際街頭戰線技能中共獨裁需團結反抗&quot;&gt;黃碧雲稱民主黨具議會國際街頭戰線技能、中共獨裁需團結反抗&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就民主黨時任立法會議員黃碧雲，其競選口號為「反抗專權 緊抱自由」，政治宣言提及對抗極權和不公法律、追究警暴及全面改革警隊，監察教育局以抵抗白色恐怖及洗腦教育。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黃在論壇提倡議會戰線，強調透過「35+」對抗暴政和「全力抵抗惡法」，又承諾會用盡憲制所有權力和手段爭取「五大訴求」。控方又指，她形容中共為「專制獨裁」、「不公義政權」，表明要團結民主派力量抵抗，又指民主黨曾用盡各種方式反對《逃犯條例》修訂，可展現其反抗決心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;庭上播放九龍西選舉論壇片段，另一參選人劉澤鋒指黃碧雲沒有簽署「墨落無悔」聲明，又質問黃碧雲：「民主黨係咪應承一齊攬炒先？」黃碧雲回應：「我哋係會用盡憲制裡面所有嘅權力同埋手段係爭取五大訴求，如果否決財政預算案能夠促成呢一樣嘢，我哋一定會做。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指，其競選單張指控「健康碼」會將個人私隱及所在傳去中國、大灣區票站受監控，亦提及「民主黨反對國安法」，民主黨會於港人並肩對抗極權。黃亦曾撰文〈有平台 才有博奕之地〉，指民主運動包括國際、街頭和議會戰線，若在議會戰線輕言而退會「三線盡失」，留有一地才能續與威權政府博奕。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃最終在初選中得票不足落敗，她在 Facebook 發布一篇題為「#記者會發言 願榮光歸香港！」的文章，表示尊重初選結果和選民決定，她會為了達至「35+」而遵守協議，不報名參選立法會，並承諾全力支持其他參選的民主派。同日，黃把民主黨的新聞稿張貼在其個人 Facebook，題為「尊重初選結果 承認落敗，黃碧雲宣布不再參選立法會」。黃又在7月15日的民主黨記者會中指出，民主黨過去二十多年，具有議會、國際及街頭戰線所需的技能和經驗。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;民協主席施德來稱要有全面攬炒決心&quot;&gt;民協主席施德來稱要有「全面攬炒決心」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就時任民協主席、黃大仙區議員施德來，控方指《立場新聞》於2020年3月刊出他所撰的文章〈議會過半 夢可成真 – 回應對民協「N+2初選方案」〉，當中提倡議會戰線及初選協調機制。施於同年6月在 Facebook 發文，表明已簽署「墨落無悔」聲明，並稱若果當選立法會議員，將會按照計劃否決財政預算，迫使行政長官辭職。控方提到，原文並無「無差別」字眼，將會在開案陳詞中刪去「indiscriminately」一詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，施的競選單張內容與「墨落無悔」相當相似（substantially similar）。施並在論壇稱：「今日嘅中共，我哋冇討論嘅空間、冇談判嘅餘地，只有抗爭到底」，進入議會後「我哋大家都要否決財政預算案，大家都要否決政府所有議案」、「攬炒呢個政府」。他質詢民主黨胡志偉時，表明「35+」要有「全面攬炒的決心」，但民主黨創黨主席李柱銘卻稱「攬炒好幼稚」，問胡志偉：「嚟緊35+，會唔會全面攬炒政府所有議案呀？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指，他散播對政權不滿，指控中共打壓香港且不可信、沒討論餘地，又指「真正攬炒香港」的是林鄭和中共，故港人要抗爭到底。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施德來報名初選時附上九龍東的「共同綱領」，控方並指其 Facebook 帖文以競選口號「堅定抗爭」、「抗極權」、「衛我城」、「35＋」作「hashtag」，可見其抗爭決心。而施落選後停止選舉工程，並表示雖預計中共打壓無窮無盡，但相信港人會繼續抗爭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（7日）於西九龍法院（暫代高院）續審。控方今續讀出開案陳詞，提及戴耀廷於其中一次新界西協調會議，向與會者表示除了「五大訴求」外，協議應明確表明會無差別否決財政預算案，及落選者不應再參選。庭上播放相關片段，當中鏡頭晃動，大部分時間置於枱底下，有時舉機拍攝桌子對面戴耀廷的發言情況，疑為偷拍片段。此外，控方又指戴耀廷提出「真攬炒十步」，終引致政府停擺、外國制裁中共，當中法庭傳譯主任一度沒有譯出文中「indiscriminately（無差別）」一字，遭法官要求重譯，指為本案「重要字眼（important word）」。控方又指，戴耀廷曾表明不希望製作列表列出各候選人的承諾，以免留下證據。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷提真攬炒十步-官指無差別為本案重要字眼&quot;&gt;戴耀廷提「真攬炒十步」 官指「無差別」為本案重要字眼&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方昨於開案陳詞提及，戴耀廷發起初選推動「攬炒」議程，透過取得立會過半議席，成為「大殺傷力憲政武器」，抗衡中國政府，及迫使政府回應特赦政治犯、追究警暴、雙普選等訴求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今續指，為了進一步推動其抗爭的「大策略（grand strategy），戴耀廷於2020年4月28日發表〈真攬炒十步 這是香港宿命〉，詳列攬炒十步的時間表和路線圖：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;第一步（2020年7至8月）。政府廣泛取消民主派人士參選立法會資格，包括現任議員。民主派由Plan B繼續參選。&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;第二步（2020年9月）。因兩辦干預及DQ，刺激更多港人投票支持民主派，及配合策略投票，使民主派成功取得35席或以上。&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;第三步（2020年10月）。特首及律政司開展司法程序DQ民主派議員，但因法庭需時處理，故民主派繼續主導立法會。&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;第四步（2020年10月至2021年4月）。政府向立法會提出的所有撥款申請都被立法會否決。政府只能維持一般運作。&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;第五步（2021年5月）。立法會否決政府《財政預算案》，特首解散立法會，並以臨時撥款方式維持政府運作。&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;第六步（2021年10月）。立法會重選，民主派或要派出Plan C參選，因Plan B也可能被DQ，但仍取得35席以上。&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;第七步（2021年11月）。立法會再次否決《財政預算案》，特首辭職及特區政府停擺。&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;第八步（2021年12月）。全國人大常委會宣佈香港進入緊急狀態，中央政府把國家安全法直接適用於香港，解散立法會、成立臨時立法會、下屆特首由協商產生，大舉拘押民主派領袖。&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;第九步（2021年12月後），香港社會街頭抗爭變得更加激烈，鎮壓也非常血腥，港人發動三罷，令香港社會陷入停頓。&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;第十步（2022年1月後）。西方國家對中共實行政治及經濟制裁。&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法庭傳譯主任將陳詞譯成中文時，法官陳慶偉一度打斷，指她兩度沒有譯出文中「indiscriminately（無差別）」否決財政預算一詞，指認為該字為本案的「重要字眼（important word）」，傳譯主任後再次翻譯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方播新界西協調會議片段-鏡頭晃動疑為偷拍&quot;&gt;控方播新界西協調會議片段 鏡頭晃動、疑為偷拍&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就戴耀廷和區諾軒舉辦的協調會議，控方指在5月8日的第二次新界西協調會議，戴耀廷向與會者表示當時只餘下「新界西」和「超級區議會」兩區尚未達成協調機制，並指除了「五大訴求」外，協議應明確表明會無差別否決財政預算案，及落選後不會參選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;庭上播放會議片段，似乎為其中一名與會者偷拍所得，當中鏡頭晃動，大部分時間置於枱底下，有時舉機拍攝桌子對面戴耀廷的發言情況，戴有時會被其他人影遮蓋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;當中戴向與會者指，否決財政預算案是令解散立法會出現「最緊要」一步，「如果否決財政預算案呢，我哋先至會行到去下一步」，望協議能訂明「會運用《基本法》賦予立法會的權力」達到「五大訴求」，以爭取「特赦、懲戒警暴同埋重啟政改」。戴提議新界西跟隨新界東的協議，僅剔除「積極（運用）」的字眼，認為與會者均能同意。控方指，張可森、伍健偉、尹兆堅的代表、譚凱邦和王百羽等人有份參與該次會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷召記者會交代初選安排-稱不望列出承諾免留下證據&quot;&gt;戴耀廷召記者會交代初選安排 稱不望列出承諾免留下證據&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，2020年6月2日，戴耀廷將寫有初選目的及時間表的新聞稿草稿給予區諾軒、趙家賢及鍾錦麟，趙家賢並承諾進行修改。翌日，戴耀廷、區諾軒及趙家賢決定於一星期後召記者會交代初選的時間和詳情。記者會前夕，在區諾軒提醒下，趙家賢草擬採訪邀請，戴耀廷並向其他人傳閱各個選區初選協議的最後版本。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年6月9日，戴耀廷、區諾軒，與民主動力的趙家賢和鍾錦麟召開「民主派35+ 公民投票及眾籌行動」記者會，自我介紹為初選組織者及協調者，並交代初選安排。戴確認就地區直選、超級區議會及衞生服務界別，曾召開超過10次會議，以達成35+共識，並稱有信心得到「有規範性嘅結果」，又表明不希望製作列表列出各候選人的承諾，以免留下計劃的證據。庭上播放片段，戴耀廷一度稱「大貪啲，唔係講35+，係講40+㗎啦」，何桂藍等被告發出笑聲。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ （資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴耀廷又確認香港民意研究所會提供技術支援；趙家賢則確認戴及區委託民主動力協助統籌。戴及趙計劃為初選眾籌，戴稱預計需400萬，趙則稱需要350萬，又提醒支持者捐款勿超出1千元，才能歸類為「小額眾籌」，避過相關選舉條例。戴及區亦呼籲各區黃店及區議員協助組票站。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢草擬提名表格草稿戴耀廷與區諾軒就尋找票站討論&quot;&gt;趙家賢草擬提名表格草稿、戴耀廷與區諾軒就尋找票站討論&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同日，鍾錦麟經趙家賢指示發帖，提及初選的路線圖及行動計劃、不同階段目標及所需資源。在6月11至12日，趙家賢向戴耀廷、區諾軒和鍾錦麟發出提名表格草稿，戴耀廷和區諾軒協助審閱並給予意見，戴、區和趙並就表格的提交方法和死線討論。在6月至7月期間，戴耀廷與區諾軒常就尋找合適票站作討論，戴並於6月14日向其餘3人表示已找到100個票站，目標為200個。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方民主動力很早以前已尋求外國勢力協助和關注&quot;&gt;控方：民主動力很早以前已尋求外國勢力協助和關注&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就協助籌辦初選的民主動力，控方指它提供平台，協調初選參與者、招募義工、為眾籌宣傳，及準備器材及物流安排，包括招募逾180名義工和辦簡介會。控方又指，民主動力是成立於2002年的政治團體，根據其2019至2020年工作報告，它除作為民主派平台，亦在很早以前已尋求外國勢力和團體關注和協助香港內部事務，及散播對政府、立法和行政機關的不滿。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，案發時趙家賢為民主動力召集人，鍾錦麟為副召集人，譚文豪和尹兆堅則擔任委員。其中趙家賢、鍾錦麟和同案被捕但無被控的人權律師關尚義（John J Clancey），是民主動力銀行戶口的簽署人，透過網上眾籌平台「GoGetFunding」等為初選籌得逾348萬元。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，款項在趙家賢和關尚義同意下可動用，以向初選提供各項服務。民動將提供的服務名為「製作及宣傳服務」，細分為「提名及核實」、「投票計劃及實行」、「傳媒論壇製作」、「宣傳：廣播軟件、網站、報章、Facebook」、「服務站運作及管理」及「結果點算及公布」，民動就服務向參選人派發收據，但他們不需繳費。警方並從趙的辦公室搜得提名表格等文件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪被告，包括獲准保釋的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信10人，還柙的何桂藍、吳政亨、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及余慧明6人今出席。另外，認罪的岑敖暉、馮達浚、黃之鋒、袁嘉蔚、吳敏兒、朱凱廸6人亦有列席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（7日）於西九龍法院（暫代高院）續審。控方今續讀出開案陳詞，指初選提名表格、「共同綱領」和「墨落無悔」為本案「關鍵文件」，其中初選提名表格和保證金收據，均列明所有參選人須同意協調會議的「35+」共識；九龍東和新界西候選人額外簽署的「共同綱領」，承諾否決財政預算案以落實五大訴求，顯示被告對遵守協議的忠誠；「墨落無悔」則證被告不顧法律後果，仍堅定承諾達成本案串謀目的。控方又指，初選後15名出線被告發布「抗爭派」聲明，顯示他們堅定反抗政府。不過庭上展示「共同綱領」正本時，法官陳慶偉指，該中文原文並無提及「無差別」否決財政預算，主控周天行指會修改開案陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;初選提名表格及保證金收據列明須同意35共識&quot;&gt;初選提名表格及保證金收據列明須同意「35+」共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今續讀出開案陳詞，本案第6至47名被告，於2020年6月19日至22日，向民主動力提交100個選民提名報名參選。控方指，提名表格屬「關鍵文件（key documents）」，當中要求參選人簽署聲明，確保「同意及支持戴耀廷和區諾軒所帶領的協調會議裡達成的共識，包括『民主派35+公民投票計劃』及其目標」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，該協議確保所有參選人支持及遵守戴耀廷草擬的共同綱領，包括動用權力否決財政預算，並確保他們支持「五大訴求」及遵守各區達成的共識。參選人亦須提交1萬元保證金，並獲發收據，同樣列明須同意及支持協調會議的共識，若違反將被沒收保證金。而在選舉延後的9月7日，民主動力向被告發出退還1萬元保證金的收據。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;新界西及九龍東參選人簽額外共同綱領-控方顯示被告忠誠&quot;&gt;新界西及九龍東參選人簽額外「共同綱領」 控方：顯示被告忠誠&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，新界西及九龍東參選人亦在提名表格附上額外簽署的「共同綱領」，承諾無差別否決財政預算迫特首回應五大訴求，並承諾若無法取得該區前5名（九龍東）或前6名（新界西），應即時停止選舉工程及籲選民支持同區的勝出者，控方同列為「關鍵文件」。控方指，該綱領顯示被告對遵守協議的忠誠，而在本案8名新界西及6名九龍東參選被告中，僅施德來一人不認罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;庭上同時展示該「共同綱領」的正本，惟法官陳慶偉指，該中文原文並無提及「無差別」否決財政預算，主控周天行指會作出修改。根據文件，綱領僅提及會「積極運用」《基本法》賦予的權力，否決財政預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方並指，區諾軒是於6月14日通知戴耀廷、趙家賢和鍾錦麟，九龍東候選人達成共識，公開發布共同綱領，承諾爭取積極運用權力否決財政預算案，迫使特首回應五大訴求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方被告簽墨落無悔-證不顧法律後果-堅定承諾達成串謀目的&quot;&gt;控方：被告簽墨落無悔 證不顧法律後果 堅定承諾達成串謀目的&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同列為「關鍵文件」的，還包括由鄒家成、梁晃維及張可森發起的「墨落無悔」聲明。控方引述聲明內容，要求參選人承諾認同「五大訴求，缺一不可」，及承諾行使《基本法》權力否決財政預算案以迫使特首回應「五大訴求」，包括撤回示威者控罪、追究警暴及重啟政改；亦要求承諾若支持度「跌出各區預計可得議席範圍」，須表明停止選舉工程。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;聲明提及擬定原意「僅為確保抗爭陣營參選人，有最基本的抗爭意志」，並呼籲港人「拒絕支持抗爭意志飄忽不定的參選人」。控方指，聲明證明簽署的33名被告不顧法律後果，仍堅定承諾達成本案串謀目的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方庭上展示鄒家成 Facebook 專頁發布的「墨落無悔」聲明時，有被告起鬨稱：「嘩」、「嘩」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒回應墨落無悔-稱即使無文件-協調協議仍實然存在&quot;&gt;區諾軒回應墨落無悔 稱即使無文件 協調協議仍實然存在&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;發起「墨落無悔」聲明的梁晃維、張可森和鄒家成，於6月19日重申簽署協議的重要。控方指，區諾軒發文回應，重申「就算沒有一份文件出台，但協調的協議實然存在」，並具有約束力，不公開不等於參與者沒有承諾遵守，亦「不見得有參與者對運用權力否決財政預算案態度保留」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷屢稱初選不違國安法民研被搜仍如期舉行初選&quot;&gt;戴耀廷屢稱初選不違《國安法》、民研被搜仍如期舉行初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，《國安法》於6月30日生效，戴耀廷翌日向區諾軒、趙家賢和鍾錦麟提起《國安法》下的罪行，又就他對初選會否違法的回應徵詢毛孟靜的意見。戴耀廷和區諾軒其後於7月6日，與兩名香港民意研究所職員召開記者會，解釋初選安排和投票系統，戴並稱作為法律學者，認為初選不會違反《國安法》第22條顛覆國家政權及第29條勾結境外勢力。區諾軒同意，並指「35+計劃」只屬協調，並不會違反《國安法》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rZjv9bC.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7月9日，時任政制及內地事務局局長曾國衞接受《文匯報》訪問，指初選有可能違《國安法》第20條、22條及29條，控方指即使如此，戴耀廷、區諾軒及趙家賢仍於同日，與楊雪盈和余慧明等被告召記者會，戴表明35+目標爭取立法會控制權，行使《基本法》賦予的權力向政府「問責」，並重申初選不違《國安法》。會上朱凱廸特別指出，初選向世界展示香港人不會屈服於北京殘暴統治，籲香港人勇敢站出來揭露中共暴行。會後戴耀廷3人帶領呼喊「支持民主派 35+」等口號，候選人亦舉起「支持民主派35+公民投票」及「7月11-12齊投票」的紙牌。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/nkgN8c2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;為初選投票提供技術支援的香港民意研究所，於7月10日被警方搜查，惟控方指，戴耀廷4名組織者討論後仍同意初選按原定計劃進行，鍾錦麟在趙家賢指示下，在民動專頁發文批搜查民研令初選籌備工作延誤，工作人員會加密保安系統。戴同日提醒提供議辦作票站的區議員，或會違反租約並有法律後果。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;初選於7月11至12日舉行，庭上播放片段，顯示戴耀廷公布初選進度和結果時，重申相信參選人會遵守協議承諾作參選決定。控方續指，中聯辦於7月14日公開譴責初選違《國安法》，但所有被告仍根據協議參選或不參選立法會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;15抗爭派簽立場聲明-控方重申對政府堅定反抗&quot;&gt;15抗爭派簽立場聲明 控方：重申對政府堅定反抗&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，13名勝出的本土派被告於7月15日召開記者會，包括袁嘉蔚、梁晃維、黃之鋒、李嘉達、馮達浚、何桂藍、劉頴匡、鄒家成、張可森、伍健偉、岑敖暉、王百羽及余慧明，重申對抗政府的立場不會動搖。翻譯讀出上述段落後，有被告起鬨。其後庭上播放片段，顯示岑敖暉指一眾抗爭派若進入議會，「會好堅定地行使《基本法》賦予畀代議士嘅權利」，「無論咩內容都會否決否財政預算案」，期間鄒家成等人望向岑敖暉，岑則笑了笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指上述13人，同日與朱凱廸和黃子悅一同發布「抗爭派立法會參選人立場聲明」，並指該聲明重申及確認被告在記者會上聲言作堅定反抗。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過翻查資料，朱凱廸和黃子悅當日均有出席記者會，而伍健偉並無出席，由林進代替。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方若非選舉延期-涉案計劃將實現&quot;&gt;控方：若非選舉延期 涉案計劃將實現&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;政府其後延後選舉一年，控方指稱，若非選舉延期，涉案串謀計劃會繼續執行直至實現，並會嚴重影響對維持香港運作和穩定重要的公共服務及市民的日常生活。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案被告於2021年1月6至7日被捕，控方指，望法庭考慮上述證據，裁定被告有罪。控方其後開始讀出附件內針對各被告的言行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/PZxUn7e.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（7日）於西九龍裁判法院（暫代高院）續審。控方下午讀出開案陳詞附件，列出各被告言行，其中發起「三投三不投」聯署的吳政亨，控方指他是戴耀廷支持者，不但宣傳初選目標，亦在策劃、組織和推動串謀計劃上擔當關鍵角色。其涉案行為包括自資在《蘋果日報》頭版賣廣告，宣傳具約束力的初選；並透過提倡舉辦初選論壇、製作簡報向戴耀廷提議不同的初選機制、響應香港民研派出觀察員監察初選，協助設計及安排舉行初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;庭上播放吳政亨製作的宣傳片段時，吳與馮達浚隨音樂節奏擺動身體，鄒家成忍不住發笑。播放其自拍片段時，何桂藍、馮達浚、黃之鋒等望向吳，吳做出聳肩動作。現時已剃去鬍子的吳又應鄒家成要求除下口罩，向旁聽席展示其樣貌，鄒並摸一摸其下巴。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;吳政亨被指為初選組織者&quot;&gt;吳政亨被指為「初選組織者」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被指稱為「初選組織者」的5人中，只有吳政亨不認罪受審。控方指稱，吳是戴耀廷的支持者，曾協助戴於2016年發起的「雷動計劃」，並在案發時期以「李伯盧」名義行事，不僅宣傳戴耀廷和區諾軒提出的目標，亦在策劃、組織和推動串謀計劃上擔當關鍵角色，包括發起及宣傳「三投三不投」、提倡舉辦初選論壇，及協助策劃和安排初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方吳政亨發起三投三不投聯署-目標協調候選人爭35&quot;&gt;控方：吳政亨發起「三投三不投」聯署 目標協調候選人爭35+&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，為回應戴耀廷和區諾軒有關初選的倡議，吳政亨於2020年3月19日發起「三投三不投」聯署，呼籲選民不要投票給三類人士：不支持舉辦初選、不參與初選及拒絕遵守初選結果的人，以確保候選人遵守協議。吳並於4月9日在《獨媒》撰文〈親共派都叫停初選，民主派有無初選空間？〉，解釋「三投三不投」作為獨立民間運動幫助初選，是為了減少宣傳開支及避免招致選舉經費。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，吳提出聯署目標，即以設計良好的初選協調候選人，以爭取立會議席35+。吳於其「李伯盧」Facebook 專頁宣傳聯署，亦管理聯署專頁，曾形容戴「從佔中、雷動、風雲、初選，為香港，一直挑最難的路而行」，感激戴為其聯署「加持」，「我們會繼續努力，凝聚民間力量，全力支持戴教授，爭取議會過半，35+！」吳又設立 YouTube 頻道宣傳，當中有影片指責不願遵守初選結果的政黨，包括街工，又重申其聯署能令候選人遵守初選結果。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，吳於5月曾在《獨媒》、《立場新聞》等，發布一系列支持戴耀廷主張及批評拒絕遵守協議者的文章，吳亦於2020年7月3日自資在《蘋果日報》頭版賣廣告，宣傳其聯署及初選，又向公眾人物發信尋求對初選及其聯署的支持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方吳提倡舉辦初選論壇-顯示協助安排初選&quot;&gt;控方：吳提倡舉辦初選論壇 顯示協助安排初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指，吳透過提倡舉辦初選論壇，協助安排初選。控方指稱，為響應戴耀廷3月在〈齊上齊落 目標35+〉一文就舉辦選舉論壇的提議，吳政亨於4月撰文〈點解要初選？臨選前退選唔好咩？（二）〉，當中稱：「初選競選時間至少需要有五至六個禮拜，曝光方面需要各友好媒體努力配合，初選辯論亦可在友好電視台或在網上直播。」控方指，其後在區諾軒的協調下，一系列的選舉論壇於2020年6月25日至7月4日期間舉行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;曾製作簡報提議不同機制-控方吳政亨協助設計及安排初選&quot;&gt;曾製作簡報提議不同機制 控方：吳政亨協助設計及安排初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，吳政亨協助策劃及安排初選。控方指，於尚未對外公佈舉辦初選的階段，戴耀廷、區諾軒和趙家賢曾與不同人士開會作宣傳，而吳曾於2020年3月製作詳盡的宣傳簡報，提議不同的初選機制。而吳的電腦亦儲存了2020年6月題為「採訪邀請」的文件，提及吳「其實遠於推動聯署前，已開始推動初選工作。佢有份同戴（耀廷）設計初選計劃」，又指聯署運動是令初選能成功的「骨幹」，亦是提供初選「約束力」的支架，並指經過聯署後有選區由「無約束力」變成半約束力，顯示吳協助宣傳具約束力的初選，「聯署已有實際影響力。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，其 YouTube 頻道發布一段影片「三投三不投全力協助初選投票」，宣傳初選票站地圖和資訊，又稱響應香港民意研究所的「觀察員運動」，派出多名義工擔任「觀察員」監察初選，包括他自己。控方指，吳透過全力支持觀察員運動，協助初選舉行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方初選結束後-吳政亨繼續宣傳&quot;&gt;控方：初選結束後 吳政亨繼續宣傳&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，初選投票結束後，吳政亨繼續透過不同社交媒體平台，宣傳「三投三不投」，包括在 YouTube 發布影片稱「多謝戴耀廷同區諾軒兩人牽頭，令到今次初選成事」，又承認已透過戴向所有候選人發出「三投三不投」的聲明，指不同意無約束力的初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吳又發文〈N以內係正選，N以外係後備，就係咁簡單〉，呼籲所有候選人遵守初選結果，並發布影片總結「三投三不投」如何促進初選進行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄭達鴻被指向歐洲議會游說設救生艇稱35是光復法治最好方法&quot;&gt;鄭達鴻被指向歐洲議會游說設「救生艇」、稱35+是光復法治最好方法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，控方亦讀出時任區議員、公民黨黨員鄭達鴻所涉行為，指公民黨於2020年3月召開記者會，黨魁楊岳橋承諾會無差別否決政府法案，其後所有成員均簽署「墨落無悔」，公民黨並在初選前夕發文稱《國安法》不會阻擋港人對抗極權的決心，籲公眾投票。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指鄭明知《國安法》將實施，仍於初選論壇稱爭取「35+」可「由制度根本改革」，亦是「光復法治」最好方法；又強調否決財政預算案可對抗「極權」，迫特首回應「五大訴求」。他又指在《國安法》陰霾下，一直代表公民黨向歐洲議會游說設立「救生艇計劃」，讓年青人有機會刪除案底。另外，開案陳詞誤稱東區區議員的鄭為「南區區議員」，惟控方並無更正。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明天續審，控方將繼續讀出開案陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件編號：HCCC69/2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;22被告今出席-1&quot;&gt;22被告今出席&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪被告，包括獲准保釋的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信10人，還柙的何桂藍、吳政亨、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及余慧明6人今出席。另外，認罪的岑敖暉、馮達浚、黃之鋒、袁嘉蔚、吳敏兒、朱凱廸6人亦有列席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被告入庭時，吳敏兒向旁聽席揮手，又微笑做出心心手勢，岑敖暉則拉下口罩與妻子做手勢交流，有懲教人員着揮手被告「放低手」。前香港眾志黃莉莉帶同兒子到場，黃之鋒和袁嘉蔚等向他揮手。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，改由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表為資深大律師潘熙、大律師沈士文、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;47人被控以非法手段-嚴重干擾阻撓破壞政權機關&quot;&gt;47人被控以非法手段 嚴重干擾、阻撓、破壞政權機關&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，32人已還柙至今逾23個月。其中16人不認罪，今（6日）於西九龍法院（暫代高院）正式開審，預計審期90日。16名不認罪被告，及原擬不認罪、後改為認罪的林景楠和伍健偉應訊，於庭上正式答辯。其中伍健偉說：「法官閣下，我顛覆極權國家政權未成功，我承認控罪 」，鄒家成逐字高喊：「不！認！罪！」，梁國雄則說：「無罪可認，爭取普選無罪，對抗暴政無罪。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，何桂藍質疑今早才收到最新的開案陳詞，發現控罪詳情已刪去指控被告「威脅使用武力」，與控罪字眼不一，說「你 charge 都唔清楚叫人 plea，點 plea 啊大佬」，法官指其律師會向她解釋。此外，庭上有被告在控方發言時發出聲音，法官陳慶偉警告被告勿干擾法庭程序，否則會安排他整個審訊都坐在囚室門後。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;吳政亨右手紮三角繃帶-認罪6被告列席&quot;&gt;吳政亨右手紮三角繃帶 認罪6被告列席&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理。控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪及周天行，辯方代表包括大律師沈士文、張耀良、黃宇逸、關文渭、馬維騉、盧敏儀、石書銘、黃廷光、Trevor Beel 等，本身是大律師的劉偉聰則會自辯。而審前覆核由大律師沈仲平代表的林景楠，早前透露因沈「沒有根據我的指示向法庭傳達我要求傳達的訊息」而將他解聘，今改由大律師吳漢輝代表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪被告，包括獲准保釋的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、陳志全、柯耀林、李予信10人，及還柙的何桂藍、吳政亨、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及余慧明6人，及原擬不認罪、後改為認罪的伍健偉和林景楠出席。另外，認罪的岑敖暉、馮達浚、黃之鋒、袁嘉蔚、吳敏兒、毛孟靜6人亦有列席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;還柙被告於約10時陸續入庭，林卓廷向獲保釋的黃碧雲揮手，梁國雄入場時有人喊「毛哥！」，法庭職員稱「唔好叫」。早前因做運動意外受傷的吳政亨，身穿西裝出席，右手紮三角繃帶，有旁聽人士讚「幾靚仔」，袁嘉蔚剪了「冬菇頭」，鄒家成則頻頻笑着向旁聽席揮手和比劃手勢。梁國雄妻子陳寶瑩、民主黨劉慧卿、社民連曾健成等均有旁聽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;改認罪兩被告答辯-伍健偉我顛覆極權國家政權未成功我承認控罪&quot;&gt;改認罪兩被告答辯 伍健偉：我顛覆極權國家政權未成功，我承認控罪&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪先表示，原擬不認罪、後改為認罪的伍健偉和林景楠，須再作答辯。法官陳慶偉指那所有被告都要答辯，萬指認為不需要，惟陳慶偉重申看不到為何部分人不需答辯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法庭書記其後向被告讀出控罪，被告逐一答辯，就改為認罪的林景楠和伍健偉，伍健偉說：「法官閣下，我顛覆極權國家政權未成功，我承認控罪 」，林景楠則說：「我認罪。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒家成不認罪-梁國雄無罪可認對抗暴政無罪&quot;&gt;鄒家成：不！認！罪！ 梁國雄：無罪可認，對抗暴政無罪&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於不認罪被告，自辯的劉偉聰在律師席稱「My Lord, not guilty.」，陳志全高聲說：「不認罪！」，鄒家成亦逐字高喊：「不！認！罪！」，身旁被告起鬨。林卓廷面帶凝重說：「法官閣下，我不認罪」，余慧明堅定說：「我不認罪！」，梁國雄則說：「無罪可認，爭取普選無罪，對抗暴政無罪」，有旁聽人士發笑。法官陳慶偉嚴肅向旁聽席說：「這是一個很莊嚴的場合，我一直都尊重每個被告及公眾，所以也希望你給予同樣的尊重，多謝。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何桂藍質疑控罪詳情已改你-charge-都唔清楚叫人-plea點-plea-啊大佬&quot;&gt;何桂藍質疑控罪詳情已改：你 charge 都唔清楚叫人 plea，點 plea 啊大佬&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;輪到何桂藍時，她表示，「唔好意思我有個問題，因為律政司好鍾意做 deadline fighter，我今朝先攞到最新嘅 opening」，並指剛發現控罪詳情已刪除指控被告以「threat of force（威脅使用武力）」的非法手段犯案，但剛讀出的控罪仍有相關字眼，問「我係認緊邊條？」，「咁你仲告唔告我哋威脅使用武力㗎而家？」法官陳仲衡問何的大律師 Trevor Beel 是否已向何解釋修訂，Beel 稱稍後會解釋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後到吳政亨答辯，他指在答辯前，認為何桂藍希望發言。法官陳慶偉指他不是要求答辯，何桂藍即喊：「你 charge 都唔清楚叫人 plea，點 plea 啊大佬？」陳慶偉指其代表律師會向她解釋，何桂藍重申她是不認罪，又指「我都好尊重法庭」，但「我唔明點解問人答辯嗰日條 charge 都唔清唔楚，總之我 not guilty 嘅，唔使嘥時間，多謝」。Trevor Beel 稱因控罪同時提及武力及其他非法手段，但控方在開案陳詞的指控修訂為武力以外的非法手段，故何有此混淆，會再向她解釋。吳政亨最後說：「I plead not guilty my Lord.」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法官稱被告不應在位上叫嚷-警告或安排審訊時坐囚室門後&quot;&gt;法官稱被告不應在位上叫嚷 警告或安排審訊時坐囚室門後&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉其後一度指，理解何桂藍是不認罪，何桂藍即在被告欄高喊：「係啊！」官指她「不需叫嚷（no need to yell）」，何再回應自己是「正常講嘢聲量」。法官李運騰並指，法庭的慣常做法，是當被告有法律代表，便應透過律師作出指示，此時何桂藍與身旁懲教人員發生推撞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法庭其後討論被告在審訊期間使用電子器材及專家證人等安排，期間有被告發笑，伍健偉並在欄內嘲「too simple, sometimes naive」，此時陳慶偉指：「你可否停止？我不會容許被告打斷法庭程序，你不應在位上叫嚷」，又指法庭有規矩和程序，警告若被告再打斷法庭程序，會安排他審訊期間坐在囚室門後。陳又指，他過去曾在另一宗案件中下令被告於整個審訊期間坐在囚室門後，因該被告不斷騷擾作為控方證人的女兒。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法庭於11時20分左右休庭，法官並指已認罪的林景楠及伍健偉可先行離開，惟伍健偉代表律師指他希望繼續留下。散庭前，岑敖暉舉手欲發言，惟法官不作理會，繼續離庭，陳慶偉並說「Counsel（律師）」，着他找律師。散庭時，曾健成高喊：「大家頂住啊，阿毛！阿廷！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;吳政亨申審訊遷就物理治療-官批被告用電腦做筆記&quot;&gt;吳政亨申審訊遷就物理治療 官批被告用電腦做筆記&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，代表吳政亨的大律師石書銘指，吳現時每星期約有一個早上需前往醫院做物理治療，但不希望錯過審訊，望法庭在其治療時間不會安排審訊。法官陳慶偉聞言即提議懲教安排吳於星期六或日求診，石書銘表示懲教也考慮過此做法，但公立醫院的物理治療部一般不會於星期六日辦公。陳慶偉重申，不會為了一名被告而延遲審訊，更何況物理治療的日子未定，指示律師團隊與懲教再進一步溝通。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官亦應辯方申請，批准被告審訊期間使用電腦閱讀文件及做筆記，但禁止他們以電腦來與外界溝通。他又表示，知道因安全原因，懲教或不會准許被告帶電腦回到監房，但法庭不會干預懲教的決定，他亦無權如此做，籲各被告自行考慮。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ZoKZubb.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，32人已還柙至今逾23個月。其中16人不認罪，今（6日）於西九龍法院（暫代高院）正式開審，預計審期90日。控方今透露，區諾軒、趙家賢、鍾錦麟和林景楠4人將任控方證人，控方需時2至3日讀出開案陳詞後，將首先傳召他們作供。有辯方律師表示，直至上月及上周始分別收到1萬3千頁新文件及1,200項沒有標題的未被使用材料，望申請下周一前不會傳召控方證人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;18名被告今早正式答辯，當中伍健偉說：「法官閣下，我顛覆極權國家政權未成功，我承認控罪 」，鄒家成逐字高喊：「不！認！罪！」，梁國雄則說：「無罪可認，對抗暴政無罪，無罪可認。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方上周始交專家證人證供-官質疑會對被告不公&quot;&gt;控方上周始交專家證人證供 官質疑會對被告不公&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控辯雙方現時未能同意所有承認事實，控方望傳召有關社交媒體的專家證人，就 Facebook 及 YouTube 等內容作供，並指僅9名被告同意將相關內容納為承認事實（admitted facts）。主控萬德豪指於1月收到相關證供後，已盡快將證供交予辯方考慮，頭兩份證供於1月16日提交、第3份於2月3日提交，並將於今天提交第4份證供，涉警長6533。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰多次追問，控方會否認為延遲向被告提供證供會造成不公，又指若控方一直未能收到相關證供，直至控方案情完結前最後一天才交予辯方是否有問題。萬稱那會非常不公，但強調現時沒有出現此情況，因控方已盡快提交，又重申辯方有至少一至兩星期準備。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，控方將專家報告交辯方後，辯方需時找專家審視能否同意該供詞；若被告正申請法援，更需時報價決定尋找哪位專家，該專家亦需時撰寫報告以審視能否同意控方專家報告，反問該些程序是否能於兩星期內完成。萬德豪重申現時情況並非如此，李運騰反指他似乎頗「樂觀」，萬再稱控方案情共有55天，辯方會有足夠時間準備最終回應。控方其後又一度指，望能與所有被告就承認事實達成共識，惟陳慶偉指這只是妄想。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方稱上周始收大量文件-申下周一前不傳召控方證人&quot;&gt;辯方稱上周始收大量文件 申下周一前不傳召控方證人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表黃碧雲及林卓廷的大律師沈士文表示，直至上月才收到來自控方的1萬3千頁新文件，包括同案被告的證供，並於上周三（2月1日）才收到1,200項沒有標題的未被使用材料（unused materials）。他又引控方指，將會一邊讀出開案陳詞，一邊播放影片，預料需時2至3日才能完成。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文指，辯方需時索取指示及調整其案情和盤問，望申請下周一前不會傳召控方證人，並指大部分被告均望下周一始傳證人。控方續指，若今午開始讀出開案陳詞，預料下周一可開始傳召證人，首4名出庭的控方證人為已認罪的區諾軒、趙家賢、鍾錦麟和林景楠，預料辯方需要頗長時間盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方大律師馬維騉一度申請先處理不受爭議的議題，稍後才傳召首名證人區諾軒，因區諾軒無論對控辯雙方而言都是重要的證人，他了解案發經過所有階段，而辯方於上周才收到部分證供，需時準備盤問內容。惟申請遭陳慶偉拒絕，又指輪到他盤問時，或已餘下不多的東西需盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;岑敖暉申每日列席審訊-稱朱凱廸亦望列席惟不獲懲教安排&quot;&gt;岑敖暉申每日列席審訊 稱朱凱廸亦望列席惟不獲懲教安排&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已認罪的岑敖暉今日亦被帶往法庭列席，他在午休前以英語親自向法官申請審訊期間每日列席，要求法官向懲教每日簽發提犯令（body order）。岑又提到朱凱廸同樣希望審訊期間列席，但因為沒有提犯令，所以懲教今天未有把他帶往法庭。法官打斷，指岑不能代表朱凱廸作出申請，著朱自行去信法庭申請。審訊現時休庭，下午將讀出開案陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/vono7ad.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，32人已還柙逾23個月。16人不認罪，今（6日）於西九龍法院（暫代高院）開審。控方開案陳詞指稱，由前港大法律系副教授戴耀廷所提倡的「35+」計劃旨在「攬炒」及顛覆國家政權，民主派初選為其中關鍵一步，透過取得立會過半作為「大殺傷力憲制武器」，迫使政府回應訴求。控方續指，被告提倡及參與初選、承諾無差別地否決政府財政預算及其他議案，構成串謀實行犯罪計劃，當中33人簽署「墨落無悔」，而被告在《國安法》生效後仍按初選結果參選或不參選立法會，亦顯示他們遵守初選協議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方以約一個半小時讀出開案陳詞首22段，明天再續，期間施德來、鄭達鴻、鄒家成等抄寫筆記，有部分被告則閉目養神。散庭前，法官陳慶偉特意提醒公眾人士有序及安靜地離開，又指不論立場如何，皆不可以騷擾控辯雙方團隊。陳表示暫無意指示庭內安裝閉路電視，但若任何人作出上述行為，便有可能干犯藐視法庭和判罰。散庭後，被告紛紛向旁聽席揮手，黃之鋒及伍健偉等說「辛苦晒！」，伍健偉則揮手說：「記得睇《一人婚禮》啊！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，何桂藍上午答辯時曾表示，今早才收到控方修訂的開案陳詞，刪去指控被告「威脅使用武力」，惟控罪仍保留相關字眼，問「我係認緊邊條？」，「咁你仲告唔告我哋威脅使用武力㗎而家？」法庭翻譯今午翻譯相關段落時，仍一度讀出控罪詳情內「威脅使用武力」的字眼，有被告起鬨，法官提醒開案陳詞沒有提及暴力，翻譯稱她或與原有版本混淆。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方被告同意以非法手段-嚴重干擾阻撓香港政權機關&quot;&gt;控方：被告同意以非法手段 嚴重干擾、阻撓香港政權機關&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被告今早進行答辯，控方透露區諾軒、趙家賢、鍾錦麟及林景楠將任控方證人。主控周天行下午讀出2月修訂的開案陳詞。他指，本案涉及一群政治人物，與他人串謀組織、策劃、或參與以非法手段，嚴重干擾、阻撓、破壞香港特別行政區政權機關依法履行職能的行為，旨在顛覆國家政權。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 控方代表 律政司副刑事檢控專員 周天行（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案涉及47名被告，案發時戴耀廷為法律系教授，區諾軒為前立法會議員及區議員，毛孟靜、黃碧雲、譚文豪、胡志偉、朱凱廸、郭家麒、楊岳橋及陳志全為立法會議員，尹兆堅、林卓廷為立法會議員兼區議員，梁國雄則為前立法會議員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而趙家賢、鍾錦麟、袁嘉蔚、梁晃維、鄭達鴻、徐子見、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、岑子杰、何啟明、劉偉聰、李嘉達、施德來、張可森、伍健偉、譚凱邦、范國威、柯耀林、岑敖暉、王百羽、李予信21人均為區議員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吳政亨、馮達浚、劉澤鋒、黃之鋒、譚得志、黃子悅、吳敏兒、何桂藍、劉頴匡、鄒家成、呂智恆、林景楠及余慧明13人則為政治人物、工會領袖或商人等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，本案串謀的重要元素，是被告同意透過武力或威脅使用武力外的非法手段，嚴重干擾、阻撓、破壞香港政權機關依法履行職能的行為，即贊成無差別地否決政府提出的任何財政預算或公共開支，迫使特首解散立法會及辭職，以達致顛覆國家政權的目的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方邀法庭就反送中事件引用司法認知&quot;&gt;控方邀法庭就「反送中」事件引用司法認知&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就本案發生的背景，控方指自2019年6月起，香港經歷由示威、暴力升級、破壞和縱火所造成的嚴重社會騷亂，暴力升級令大量財物被損壞、有人受襲擊，主要交通幹道和設施亦遭嚴重破壞和干擾。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方邀請法庭就該段時期的政治及社會事件引用「司法認知」，即法庭毋須證據便可接納為事實，包括：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2019年2月，政府提出《逃犯條例》修訂草案；&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;同年6月12日，立法會被示威者包圍，要求政府撤回草案；&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;同年6月15日，行政長官宣布暫緩草案；&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;同年7月1日，大批市民上街抗議《逃犯條例》修訂草案，其後部份示威者強行闖入立法會大樓；&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;同年9月4日，行政長官宣布撤回《逃犯條例》修訂草案。&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方將依賴同案被告證供初選文章及片段&quot;&gt;控方將依賴同案被告證供、初選文章及片段&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，本案被告均是串謀參與者，並將主要依賴同案被告（accomplice witnesses）證供、有關初選的文章、廣告和宣傳、從被告搜獲的文件和材料，以及多段記者會、訪問、遊行和選舉論壇等公開影片作檢控。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，上述證據會顯示前港大法律系副教授戴耀廷，於約2019年12月發起「35+」計劃。他當時在《蘋果日報》首度撰文，宣揚奪取立法會大多數議席，以解散立法會迫使政府回應訴求；並在翌年1月30日，在 Facebook 呼籲民主派盡快透過初選達成共識，強調奪取過半議席的重要性，其後又與區諾軒在社交媒體發布大量文章爭取他人支持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方戴耀廷稱35目標抗衡中國政府頻撰文提倡攬炒&quot;&gt;控方：戴耀廷稱35+目標抗衡中國政府、頻撰文提倡「攬炒」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年3月26日，戴耀廷與區諾軒舉行記者會，解釋「35+」和初選的計劃，指取得立法會過半議席的目標，是取得足夠影響力，以抗衡中共及中國政府。庭上播放片段，戴表示雖然他或來自民主派光譜的不同部分，但「我諗大家都有一個幾強烈嘅共同理念，就係希望能夠立會過半」，取得「大殺傷力嘅憲制武器」，迫使政府接受其訴求，如問責警暴和重啟政改。戴指他與區諾軒正進行協調工作，強調望在5個選區分別爭取「6 6 4 4 3」議席，並呼籲市民登記做選民。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同月31日，戴在《蘋果日報》發文〈立會過半是大殺傷力憲制武器〉，解釋無差別否決財政預算案，可觸發《基本法》機制解散立法會及迫使特首辭職，「符合這階段抗爭的大策略，就是令現有制度出現極度不穩」，而配合國際社會施壓，便有機會迫使中共在香港民主化上讓步。他並鼓勵公眾盡快取得商業登記證，以爭取功能組別議席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至2020年4月，戴耀廷再在《蘋果日報》發布題為〈攬炒的定義和時間〉和〈攬炒的時代意義〉的文章，進一步提倡攬炒議程。當中提及如何通過初選實現「攬炒」、實施「攬炒」的時間、以及如何利用攬炒作為顛覆的大策略（grand strategy）。他又指若中共解散立法會，會宣告「一國兩制」的終結，而街頭運動不足以使政權讓步，很多市民的心態已轉化，「準備來一次真正的攬炒，決心要死而後生。」同月28日，戴再發表〈真攬炒十步 這是香港宿命〉，訂下「真攬炒十步」，提及要無差別否決政府財政預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方戴耀廷等5人為組織者-初選參選者均公開承諾盡力提倡35目標&quot;&gt;控方：戴耀廷等5人為組織者 初選參選者均公開承諾盡力提倡「35+」目標&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，串謀的關鍵一步是取得立法會的大多數議席，因此被告組織初選，透過在全港各區設立票站，讓選民以紙張或電子方式投票，分別在地區直選（港島、九龍東、九龍西、新界東、新界西）和功能界別（超區、衞生服務界），選出支持率最高的候選人參選立法會，以提高民主派當選機會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，首5名被告：戴耀廷、區諾軒、趙家賢、鍾錦麟和吳政亨，是初選的組織者，他們設立初選的框架及與參與者討論協議條款，在不同範疇上有不可或缺的角色，包括監察、安排及管理財政、後勤和宣傳初選。民主動力和香港民意研究所則獲委託執行初選，並協助後勤安排。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;餘下42名被告則是初選的候選人，控方指他們公開承諾及同意盡力提倡「35+」的目標及遵守初選結果，亦同意若有候選人正式參選後被「DQ」，其他候選人可以「Plan B」身份代為參選，以提高奪取立法會大多數議席的可能性。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/vcxy86l.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
▲ （資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方並指，2020年2月至7月之間，戴耀廷和區諾軒舉辦一連串協調會議，與初選候選人討論如何實行初選，議題包括「35+」及無差別否決財政預算案的共同目標、在地區直選的目標議席數目，及候選人因應初選結果而須遵守的承諾和協議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;33不認罪被告簽墨落無悔-12人不認罪&quot;&gt;33不認罪被告簽「墨落無悔」 12人不認罪&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，33名被告另簽署「墨落無悔 堅定抗爭 抗爭派立場聲明書」，承諾遵守初選協議，動用權力否決財政預算案以迫使特首回應「五大訴求」，包括17名認罪被告：袁嘉蔚、梁晃維、馮達浚、劉澤鋒、黃之鋒、李嘉達、譚得志、朱凱廸、張可森、黃子悅、伍健偉、吳敏兒、劉頴匡、呂智恆、岑敖暉、王百羽、譚文豪、郭家麒、楊岳橋、譚凱邦、范國威，及12名不認罪被告：楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、施德來、何桂藍、陳志全、鄒家成、柯耀林、余慧明、鄭達鴻及李予信。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其中譚文豪、郭家麒、楊岳橋、鄭達鴻和李予信5人，是以公民黨的名義簽署；譚凱邦和范國威則以新民主同盟的名義簽署。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方吳政亨發起三投三不投-確保候選人遵守協議&quot;&gt;控方：吳政亨發起「三投三不投」 確保候選人遵守協議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方並指，為確保候選人遵守協議，吳政亨於3月19日發起「三投三不投」聯署，籲選民不要投票給不支持初選、不參與初選及拒絕遵守初選結果的候選人，其聯署於《蘋果日報》廣告及吳政亨的社交平台廣泛傳播。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方被告於國安法生效後-仍如期進行初選&quot;&gt;控方：被告於《國安法》生效後 仍如期進行初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，即使《國安法》於2020年6月30日實施，時任政制及內地事務局局長曾國衞亦作出公開聲明，但被告為了推動串謀，仍繼續原定協議，於7月11日及12日舉行初選。當中戴耀廷、區諾軒和趙家賢更舉辦了6場初選論壇，以宣傳其顛覆性主張，除尹兆堅和余慧明外的被告均有參與。論壇於網上播放，吸引共39萬8千次觀看次數。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/7MYDDSJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Black Sea region (BSR) has become a central fault line in the strategic competition between Russia and the West. It is also the crossroads for a security space that encompasses the South Caucasus, eastern Mediterranean, Middle East, and the Western Balkans and an important transit node between Europe and Asia. Abutting North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies Bulgaria, Romania, and Turkey, partner states Georgia and Ukraine, and an increasingly aggressive and revisionist Russia, the Black Sea remains vitally important for security and stability both in and beyond southeastern Europe. Along with the wider BSR — which also includes nearby Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Moldova — it has been deeply fragmented since the collapse of the Soviet Union. While some of the littoral states have secured NATO and European Union membership, all are to varying degrees caught in the middle of the unfolding strategic competition between Russia and the Euro-Atlantic West. And as Maximillian Hess points out, “an astonishing ten wars have taken place on or near the Black Sea littoral since the end of the Cold War, more than any other maritime space in the world” — including the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even before Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, the growth of Russian military power and political influence in and around the Black Sea posed a significant threat to regional security, including that of NATO allies and partners. Before Russia began its full-scale invasion, Moscow was seeking a “new nautical sphere of influence” by way of its upgraded Black Sea Fleet and maritime claims. Having failed in its initial goal of overrunning Ukraine entirely or ousting its government, Russia’s aims during the present war have included attempting to consolidate control over Ukraine’s Donbas region, seizing control of Ukraine’s coastal regions, demoralizing the rest of Ukraine, and achieving wider political and military dominance over the BSR. By mid-2022, Russia’s invasion and blockade of Ukrainian ports disrupted half of Ukraine’s exports both within the United States and in NATO leading to sharp rises in food and energy prices in Europe and fears of famine in parts of Africa. Ukraine’s anti-ship and coastal defense capabilities have exacted a toll on Russia’s Black Sea Fleet: sinking the cruiser Moskva, the fleet’s flagship; forcing the withdrawal of the fleet’s submarines; and bottling up many of the remaining platforms in port. However, Russia retains the capacity to strike targets on land and impede navigation at sea, while Russian strategic ambitions in and around the Black Sea remain unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expansion of Russian influence has implications for international security and the global economy more broadly. As Ukraine fights for its survival, Moldova, Georgia, Romania, Bulgaria, and Turkey all worry about the potential for future Russian aggression. They nevertheless maintain widely diverging perspectives on the conflict and relations with Moscow. Turkey remains committed to working with Russia despite their strategic competition in multiple regions, and Bulgaria faces significant Russian malign influence in its economy, media, and political system, as in different ways do Georgia, Romania, and Moldova. Regional NATO partners are vulnerable to Russian military aggression and remain uncertain about the extent of NATO’s commitment to their security. Many also suffer from domestic weaknesses that constrain cooperation with the United States, NATO, and the European Union. The Black Sea exists, moreover, along the seams between regional and functional structures within both United States and in NATO. In part because of these cleavages, the Black Sea has rarely been a top-level priority for either. The U.S. 2022 National Defense Strategy, for instance, does not prioritize the BSR, and U.S. strategic objectives in the region remain unspecified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine is forcing the United States and NATO to devote more attention to the region, one which NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg recognized has “vital strategic importance” to the alliance. At an extraordinary summit in March 2022, the NATO allies agreed to reset their “longer-term deterrence and defense posture across all domains, land, sea, air, cyber and space,” increase support for Ukraine, and deploy four new multinational battlegroups to the region — in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia. At the June 2022 summit, NATO adopted a new Strategic Concept, which identified Russia as the “most significant and direct threat to allies” and updated its core tasks accordingly. Deputy Secretary General Mircea Geoană described a “broader competition between revisionist and brutal and aggressive Russia and our democratic world” around the Black Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2022, U.S. senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Mitt Romney (R-UT) introduced legislation in Congress calling for a more robust U.S. foreign and security policy toward the BSR. It called for more reporting on interagency efforts in the region and, within a year, a new Black Sea strategy “to increase military assistance and coordination with NATO and the EU, deepen economic ties, strengthen democracy and economic security, and enhance security assistance with Black Sea countries.” Yet the United States cannot assume a robust NATO or EU strategy, nor can it rely on the littoral states (or other Western NATO allies) to restore the balance of power and open lines of communication in the BSR. With China seen as the United States’ pacing challenge in the Indo-Pacific, an updated U.S. Black Sea strategy will be resource constrained, and its objectives will likely be defined by regional allies and partners’ perspectives. Indeed, the National Defense Strategy describes alliances and partnerships as an “enduring strength for the United States . . . critical to achieving our objectives,” and it commits the United States to incorporating allies and partners’ “perspectives, competencies, and advantages at every state of defense planning.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that objective in mind, the authors conducted field research in Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania, and Turkey in the spring of 2022 shortly after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began and follow-up meetings in Washington throughout the remainder of the year. Through meetings with government officials, parliamentarians, journalists, scholars, and civil society activists, this research sought to better understand how these countries view their security interests in and around the Black Sea, including the impact of the war in Ukraine, and to determine what they would like to see from the United States and NATO going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on these conversations and analysis of regional geopolitics in the wake of Russia’s full-scale invasion, an effective U.S. strategy for the BSR should&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;further strengthen the U.S. presence across the region through force deployments, weapons sales, investments, and diplomatic engagements;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;bolster NATO’s eastern front while enhancing flexible and “minilateral” cooperation among allies and partners, including with Ukraine;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;seek a new equilibrium with the region’s most potent ally, Turkey, while reassuring other regional states worried about Turkish ambitions;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;prioritize democratic resilience among vulnerable frontline states inside and outside of NATO; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;support and secure projects to enhance regional connectivity that bypass Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russias-revisionist-challenge&quot;&gt;Russia’s Revisionist Challenge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine and the violent conflicts elsewhere in the BSR have all been driven by Russia’s revanchist ambition, advanced through multiple instruments of national power. The collapse of the Soviet Union ended a long period of Russian and Soviet domination of the wider BSR. While Moscow was from the beginning deeply engaged in the ethno-territorial conflicts that broke out following the Soviet Union’s collapse, growing strategic competition with the West (i.e., the United States, Canada, and their European allies and partners) increasingly led Russia to regard the post-1991 era of “geopolitical pluralism” in and around the Black Sea as contrary to its interests. As Nikolas Gvosdev suggests, the resurgence of Russian military power in the BSR “challenges the West’s default strategy in the region since the Soviet Union’s collapse: the inexorable expansion of Euro-Atlantic institutions to encompass the entire Black Sea littoral and contain Russia within its then-limited northeastern coast.” Though Moscow has justified its 2014 and 2022 invasions on the basis of internal developments in Ukraine, they are also consistent with Russia’s long-standing ambitions to roll back U.S. and NATO influence in the region while consolidating what former president Dmitry Medvedev termed a sphere of “privileged interests.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the mid-2000s, Russia began taking advantage of the protracted conflicts around its borders to bolster its own military presence, prevent its smaller neighbors from achieving Euro-Atlantic integration, and deter outside involvement in the region. After Russia invaded Georgia in August 2008, it deployed more than 4,000 troops (including border guards) to the breakaway coastal region of Abkhazia, which Moscow proclaimed to be an independent state (plus another 4,000 to the breakaway region of South Ossetia/Tskhinvali on the Russo-Georgian border). Russia soon began upgrading the border guard facilities at the Abkhazian port of Ochamchire, which could also be used to host naval assets. Under the State Armaments Program to 2020, the Black Sea Fleet received six new submarines and three new frigates, all capable of firing anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCMs) or Kalibr land-attack cruise missiles (LACMs), as well as numerous smaller craft. The deployment of Kalibr-capable platforms is a source of particular concern for NATO given their range (around 2,500 kilometers) and nuclear capabilities. In the coming years, the Black Sea Fleet is also scheduled to receive three additional frigates, six corvettes, and around a dozen small missile ships — though it is now doubtful that these plans will be fulfilled amid the war with Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The annexation of Crimea in 2014 transformed the regional balance of power more decisively in Russia’s favor. NATO halted cooperation with Russia, cooperative mechanisms such as the BLACKSEAFOR naval task force broke down, and both NATO and Russia stepped up the scale and tempo of their operations and exercises in and around the sea. With the annexation of Crimea, Moscow took over Ukraine’s naval assets on the peninsula; since 2014, it has also built up new capabilities in Crimea as well as at its eastern Black Sea port of Novorossiysk. Prior to the renewal of hostilities in early 2022, Crimea reportedly hosted at least four battalions operating the advanced S-400 air defense system. Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missiles, advanced radars and medium-range air defense systems (Pantsir and Buk), Su-24 attack aircraft and Su-30 fighters, along with enhanced Bastion coastal defense systems were all deployed on the peninsula as well. Moscow also dramatically scaled up the presence of its ground forces in Crimea, including tanks, artillery, and combat vehicles. In May 2016, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan lamented that NATO is “absent from the Black Sea. The Black Sea has almost become a Russian lake.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employing smaller naval ships, coastal artillery, and aircraft, Russia has since 2014 aimed to prevent Ukraine from employing asymmetric capabilities to challenge Russian control of the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea littoral between Crimea and the Russian border. At the same time, the Russian Black Sea Fleet employed its larger platforms (submarines, frigates, and missile ships — some normally deployed in the Caspian Sea or the Volga and Don rivers) to implement an anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) strategy against NATO forces across much of the Black Sea. Even before the outset of the 2022 war, these capabilities allowed Russia to dominate the maritime space within the Black Sea, choke off access to Ukraine’s ports in the Sea of Azov, and project power through the Bosporus and Dardanelles Straits to the eastern Mediterranean. As Gustav Gressel notes, because of the rapid post-2014 buildup, “Russia’s current conventional military posture [in the Black Sea] is already far beyond a defensive one.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Black Sea is also instrumental to Russia’s military operations in Syria and wider ambitions in the eastern Mediterranean. Prior to Turkey’s decision in May 2022 to close the Bosporus and Dardanelles Straits to warships, the Russian Black Sea Fleet provided the bulk of the capabilities for its Mediterranean Squadron, which Moscow reconstituted in 2013 for the first time since the end of the Cold War. During the conflict in Syria, Soviet-era landing ships from the Black Sea Fleet (and reflagged civilian vessels) dispatched troops and matériel from Novorossiysk through the straits to Russia’s Syrian bases at Tartus and Latakia. Moscow also used ships from the Black Sea Fleet to “show the flag” in the eastern Mediterranean in an effort to deter NATO or other outside powers from intervening in Syria. With Russia also seeking permanent bases in Libya and Sudan, the eastern Mediterranean risks becoming a contested zone between Russia and NATO as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the growth of such tensions, it was hardly a surprise that the Black Sea became a primary theater when Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. According to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, “Russian naval operations have demonstrated the intent to control access to the northwestern Black Sea, the Sea of Azov, to block Ukrainian ports.” In the first hours of the war, Russian forces carried out amphibious assaults on Snake Island (Острів Зміїний) and near the port of Mariupol on the Sea of Azov. With support from naval artillery, Russian ground forces then sought to take control of Ukraine’s entire coastline. The fall of Mariupol, Berdyansk, and Kherson consolidated a “land bridge” from the Russian border to Crimea, completely isolating Ukraine from the Sea of Azov. Russian forces have also struck Odesa, the largest port remaining under Ukrainian control, on multiple occasions, though a planned amphibious assault in the first days of the war failed to materialize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the signing of a UN and Turkish-mediated agreement creating a grain export corridor in July 2022, a Russian naval blockade had effectively choked off Ukraine’s grain exports, 95 percent of which were shipped from Black Sea ports before the war. Despite efforts by the United States and European Union to organize rail transport, as well as the opening of the export corridor (guaranteed by Turkey), the security of maritime transit to and from Ukraine remains in doubt. The Russian blockade contributed to significant food price inflation around the globe, raising fears of famine in parts of Africa and Asia. Even with the signing of the grain corridor agreement, Moscow’s ability to choke off trade from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports still provides it leverage to press for an end to (or at least a rolling back of) sanctions imposed since the start of the war. Indeed, Russian officials have suggested they are unhappy with the agreement’s implementation, though pressure from Turkey and countries in the Global South forced Moscow to abandon threats to leave the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The larger geopolitical implications of the blockade and Russia’s control of the northern Black Sea littoral are significant as well. Despite military setbacks on land and sea in the summer and fall of 2022, Russia continues to limit Ukraine’s access to the global commons through the Black Sea and the Bosporus and Dardanelles Straits — and Russia’s strategic ambition remains to eventually capture more of Ukraine’s coastline, including the port of Odesa. Even with the losses suffered by its Black Sea Fleet and the recapture of Kherson by Ukrainian forces, Russian control of Crimea and the Sea of Azov allow it to carry out attacks on Ukraine and interfere with maritime traffic across the Black Sea. The further extension of Russian political or military domination of the northern Black Sea coast would leave Ukraine effectively landlocked. If Ukraine cannot export raw materials or import finished products through its Black Sea ports, it will of necessity become increasingly dependent on less efficient land routes — including, in the event of a military defeat, on trade with and transit through Russia. These outcomes would carry significant costs not just for Ukraine but for the Black Sea littoral states and purchasers of Ukrainian agricultural and other goods as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia is similarly taking advantage of the war in Ukraine to pressure the South Caucasus and Central Asian states — as well as NATO ally Turkey — to constrain their economic, political, and strategic cooperation with Europe. Snap military drills that can close off critical sea lanes for months at a time, exclusive economic zone (EEZ) claims, and harassment of civilian vessels risk leaving the states on the Black Sea’s southern and eastern rims increasingly vulnerable and isolated. Volatility in and around the Black Sea also leaves foreign companies more reluctant to invest in new projects, such as the planned deep-sea port at Anaklia, Georgia, or the development of oil and gas reserves in Turkey or Romania’s EEZs. Moscow is meanwhile using financial, informational, and other tools to shape public opinion and political decisionmaking, taking advantage of weak governance, democratic backsliding, and state capture in much of the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of 2022, the combination of Western-supplied weapons, Ukrainian ingenuity and resilience, and Russia’s military operational ineptitude had eroded the combat capabilities of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, badly damaged the bridge linking Russia to occupied Crimea across the Kerch Strait, and driven Russian forces from the major cities of Kharkiv and Kherson. Increasingly bottled up at Sevastopol and Novorossiysk to avoid the anti-ship missiles that sank the Moskva, the Black Sea Fleet now risks being cut off from combat operations on land — more so following the delivery of additional U.S. long-range rocket artillery and anti-ship missile systems. Yet the blockade persists, and Russian forces still control the key ports of Mariupol and Berdyansk. Nor have Russian ambitions been moderated, as the announcement of “partial” mobilization on September 21 suggests — even as rising prices and political volatility indicate that many European states’ appetite for an enduring confrontation with Moscow may be limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with Ukraine’s tactical successes, the combination of military uncertainty in the Black Sea plus littoral states’ weaknesses and hedging heralds further pressure if Russian influence in the wider BSR remains intact. U.S. and NATO interests in the region are thus not confined to Ukraine — though the outcome of the war in Ukraine will have an enormous impact on future security and stability across the wider BSR — and will likely be the most important factor affecting future U.S. strategy toward the region. Even as the United States and its allies continue their support for Ukraine, they need to maintain a wider perspective that recognizes the importance of a free and open BSR and of strengthening connectivity among the Black Sea littoral states and between the littoral states and Euro-Atlantic institutions, including both NATO and the European Union. Doing so requires understanding how the littoral states — all of which (apart from Russia) are NATO allies or partners — perceive the war and their own evolving interests in the Black Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-perspectives-of-black-sea-littoral-states&quot;&gt;The Perspectives of Black Sea Littoral States&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine profoundly affects the wider Black Sea region. The impact is particularly acute for the littoral states and their immediate neighbors because the war directly threatens their security and because the region’s preexisting fissures mean that they will continue to struggle to define a common vision for how to respond. NATO allies Bulgaria, Romania, and Turkey have not found common ground among themselves, much less agreed on a regional strategy that might also encompass Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine. Except for Turkey, the littoral states are relatively weak countries, and all face significant challenges related to the rule of law, corruption, Russian influence, economic dependence on Russia (particularly for energy), and democratic backsliding. Russia’s war in Ukraine and its attempts to militarize the Black Sea pose significant challenges for all of them, as well as for neighboring states in the Western Balkans, eastern Mediterranean, South Caucasus, and Central Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So long as the littoral states are not directly involved in the war, adopting a comprehensive Black Sea strategy with regional leadership is unlikely. Romania plays an important role as an anchor for the United States and NATO in the BSR, while Turkey has the military capabilities but not the political incentives to take on more of a leadership role. As a result, the United States and NATO have had to work with the regional states on a piecemeal and sometimes ad hoc basis. It is therefore critical for policymakers in Washington (and Brussels) to have a nuanced and comprehensive understanding of how these littoral states conceptualize the threats in and around the Black Sea, what forms of assistance they prioritize, and how they might respond to enhanced U.S. engagement in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;turkey&quot;&gt;Turkey&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With NATO’s second-largest military (after the United States), control of the Bosporus and Dardanelles Straits, and a political elite committed to bolstering the country’s strategic autonomy, Turkey remains the linchpin for U.S. and NATO strategy in the BSR. Though Turkey has been a NATO ally since 1952, it has since the end of the Cold War positioned itself as an increasingly independent regional power, leaning into the alliance only when it serves a narrower set of national interests. Especially in recent years, this commitment to an independent foreign policy has included looking to Moscow for economic opportunities and political support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s expanding military footprint in and around the Black Sea nevertheless constrains Turkey’s own options and poses risks to its security; as one former official pointed out, a missile launched from Crimea could hit Ankara in a matter of seconds. While Turkey remains wary of confronting Russia directly, the shifting power balance around the Black Sea provides an incentive for Ankara and its NATO allies to seek common ground as they prepare for what is likely to be an enduring strategic competition — even as Turkey continues pursuing a multifaceted relationship with Russia. The United States and NATO will have to strike a careful balance, encouraging Turkey to be more forward leaning without abetting President Erdoğan’s efforts to undermine Western sanctions on Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key element in Turkey’s pursuit of strategic autonomy is its emphasis on maintaining a kind of regional condominium over the Black Sea, based on Ankara’s strict interpretation of the 1936 Montreux Convention. This agreement limits the number, tonnage, and duration of stay of non-littoral state warships in the Black Sea and allows Ankara to restrict or prevent the passage of naval ships through the straits in wartime. While U.S. and other allied officials sometimes bristle that Turkey’s strict adherence to Montreux limits the deployment of NATO assets, Turkish officials see the convention as a cornerstone of regional security. Above all, it provides international recognition of Turkey’s ownership of the straits, which the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union repeatedly challenged. Ankara views firm adherence to Montreux as a guarantee against an expansion of regional conflicts and sees it as consistent with a rules-based international order. By reinforcing a localized détente with Russia in the Black Sea, Montreux also allows Turkey to prioritize maritime operations in the Aegean and eastern Mediterranean, where its aims are frequently at odds with those of other allies, especially Greece and France — not to mention Cyprus, whose government Turkey does not recognize and has blocked from joining NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ankara’s pursuit of what one academic called “competitive cooperation” with Moscow — including Turkish efforts to bypass U.S. and EU sanctions imposed over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine — remains a source of tension with other NATO allies as well. For historical and geographic reasons, Turkey identifies the conflict with the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which extends into Syria and Iraq, as a larger threat than Russian expansion around the Black Sea. Given Russia’s role as the guardian of the Syrian regime and principal power broker in Syria, cooperating with Russia in and around the Black Sea helps Ankara secure Russian acquiescence to its red lines with respect to the PKK and its affiliates. Ankara also understands that it needs to maintain a working relationship with Moscow to secure its bottom-line objectives in the conflicts stretching from Libya to Syria to the South Caucasus, where Russian and Turkish forces remain engaged on opposite sides. As a senior Turkish official put it, productive relations with Russia “are a necessity, not a choice” for Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the end of the Cold War, Russia has also become a critical economic partner for Turkey. It supplied 44 percent of Turkey’s gas and around one-fifth of Turkey’s oil in 2021 and is constructing Turkey’s first nuclear power plant at Akkuyu. Russia is also an important source of tourists and a market for Turkish agriculture and construction firms, many of which are close to Erdoğan’s Justice and Development Party (AKP). Moscow has often used Turkey’s economic vulnerability and dependence on Russia as a source of leverage — restricting tourist travel in 2015 and again in 2021 and freezing work on Akkuyu for several years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a depreciating currency and inflation that could exceed 80 percent in 2022 ahead of presidential elections next year, Turkey further seeks to position itself as an outlet for Russian trade and investment, even as its U.S. and European allies tighten sanctions; in the months following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the value of Turkish exports to Russia increased 46 percent relative to the previous year. Nor has Turkey closed its airspace to Russia — apart from military flights to Syria — or limited the ability of Russians to enter the country. Indeed, many Russian oligarchs fleeing personal sanctions in the United States or European Union have been spotted in Turkey — along with a much larger number of young, well-educated Russians (and Ukrainians). Ukrainian officials have accused Turkey of facilitating, and even profiting from, the sale of stolen grain. In August 2022, Putin and Erdoğan reached an agreement for Turkey to pay for energy deliveries in rubles and facilitate operation of the Mir payment system in Turkey, to the consternation of many other allies (Ankara later walked back its support for Mir under U.S. pressure). Ankara also welcomed Russia’s offer to use Turkey as a hub for gas sales to Europe following the explosion that shut down the Nord Stream 1 pipeline in September 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This pursuit of economic cooperation amid sanctions reflects Ankara’s broader strategy of cultivating ties with Moscow as a hedge against dependence on what many Turkish officials and analysts view as an unreliable West. While the roots of this Turkish-Russian rapprochement go back to the 1990s, it has become more salient since 2015–16 owing to (1) Erdoğan’s dissatisfaction with U.S. support for groups aligned with the PKK in Syria and (2) Washington’s seemingly lukewarm response to the July 2016 coup attempt by elements in the Turkish Armed Forces associated with the U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gülen (Turkey regards both the PKK and the Gülenists as terrorists, and officials react with equal parts bewilderment and anger to what they see as U.S. support for both groups). Erdoğan’s decision to purchase the Russian S-400 air defense system in the wake of the coup attempt was a particular triumph for the Kremlin — resulting in Turkey’s expulsion from the U.S.-led F-35 fighter program and preventing the deployment of NATO-standard air defense capabilities along the Turkish-Syrian border. The S-400 remains one of the key stumbling blocks to a full reconciliation between Ankara and its NATO allies. Yet for reasons of prestige — and because it aligns with the pursuit of strategic autonomy — Ankara now considers the S-400 issue a “closed chapter” that NATO has to accept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its complex relationship with Russia and increased skepticism toward NATO within the Turkish elite, Turkey has consistently supported Ukraine’s territorial integrity, including Crimea. Since 2014, Ankara has also taken steps to bolster its own capabilities and those of its allies. It continues investing in new surface and coastal defense capabilities (notably the TCG Anadolu-class light carrier/amphibious assault ship). Turkey’s navy has also increased its presence in the Black Sea while deploying maritime patrol aircraft, tankers, and fighter jets to frontline allies and partners, some of whom (notably Romania) are also seeking to purchase Turkish drones. Ankara has also nurtured a long-term defense industrial relationship with Kyiv that has facilitated joint production of drones, engines, ships, and other capabilities. The most visible product of this relationship is the TB2 Bayraktar armed drone that Turkey continues supplying to the Ukrainian military, though Turkish officials are at pains to describe these as purely commercial transactions. During President Erdoğan’s visit to Kyiv in February 2022, the two countries agreed to establish a production facility for Turkish drones inside Ukraine; this deal seems to remain in place despite the Russian invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkey’s traditional balancing act between Russia and NATO has become more complex since the outbreak of full-scale war in Ukraine, even as the war has bolstered Ankara’s perception of its own importance for NATO. Ankara has prioritized avoiding being drawn into the conflict while using its ties to both Moscow and Kyiv to position itself as a mediator. Turkey’s most notable contribution may be brokering and guaranteeing the agreement to export grain from Ukrainian ports, which established a maritime coordination center in Istanbul, and which the Turkish navy is charged with enforcing. Turkey was also instrumental in negotiating a September 2022 prisoner swap. Turkish officials often claim that their Western NATO allies do not sufficiently appreciate either its support for Ukraine or its larger diplomatic role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ankara now recognizes that the war has made its traditional preference for a condominium approach to security among the Black Sea littoral states impossible. Thus far, however, Ankara has been reluctant to articulate a vision for what could replace this approach. Jealously guarding its status as custodian of the straits, Ankara remains opposed to a permanent NATO presence in the Black Sea. It also worries that other allies will push NATO into adopting a needlessly confrontational approach to Moscow — and it still promotes the idea of a negotiated settlement to the war in Ukraine. While Turkish officials believe that Ankara can protect its own security interests in the Black Sea (including by maintaining a working relationship with Moscow), some of the other littoral states are wary of Turkish intentions and reluctant to see Ankara take on greater responsibility for regional security outside a NATO framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the importance Ankara assigns to its relationship with Moscow, Russia’s militarization of Crimea and attempts to sever lines of communication across the Black Sea represent a significant challenge to Turkish interests and could have implications for Turkey’s long-term commitment to NATO. For now, they provide a strong argument for the importance of NATO as a cornerstone of Turkey’s security, despite growing anti-Western sentiment among much of the Turkish elite and the attempt to balance between NATO and Russia. Helping Ukraine emerge from the conflict victorious would therefore bolster the pro-Western elements in the Turkish elite who have seen their influence erode since the failed coup. At the same time, pushing Turkey to adopt a more forward-leaning posture in the Black Sea should be part of a broader effort at improving relations between Washington and Ankara.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;georgia&quot;&gt;Georgia&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s campaign to dominate the Black Sea could have a particularly significant impact on Georgia, where political volatility and state capture have exacerbated existing vulnerabilities as the competition in and around the Black Sea deepens. With around one-fifth of its territory and almost two-thirds of its coastline under Russian occupation, Georgia has limited agency in shaping regional security dynamics. Yet, with its pro-European orientation, NATO partner status, and location astride key transit routes connecting Europe to the Caspian Sea and Central Asia, Georgia’s sovereignty and independence matter; as NATO’s 2022 Strategic Concept states, the “security of countries aspiring to become members of the Alliance is intertwined with our own.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The occupation of South Ossetia/Tskhinvali and Abkhazia in August 2008 deepened Georgia’s political fragmentation and complicated the Georgian government’s efforts to regain control over the entirety of its internationally recognized territory. Since 2008, Russian forces have continued chipping away at Georgian territory through the process of “borderization,” or moving the de facto boundary lines further into Georgia proper. Russian control of Abkhazia constrains Georgia’s connectivity across the Black Sea, holding at risk Georgia’s remaining ports of Batumi and Poti, which Russian forces targeted in 2008, as well as nearby road, rail, and pipeline infrastructure. Since 2008, Russia has reinforced its military presence in Abkhazia, deploying S-300 air defense systems, Tochka missiles, and other capabilities that many Georgians see as part of Russian preparation for a renewed offensive. Even without further kinetic operations, officials perceive Russian “hybrid sea control and sea denial” activities, such as snap exercises that disrupt shipping, as an imminent threat. Because Georgia’s military spending remains low (around $300 million per year) and Russian forces sank or captured the whole Georgian navy during the 2008 war, Tbilisi lacks significant maritime capabilities of its own. It therefore prioritizes deepening multilateral cooperation, especially through its coast guard, as a vital part of its maritime and coastal security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the 2003 Rose Revolution, Georgia’s security strategy has centered on achieving rapid political and strategic integration with the Euro-Atlantic West. Under former president Mikheil Saakashvili (2004–13), Georgia carried out extensive privatization, security service reform, crackdowns on official corruption, and other steps aiming to transform Georgia along “European” lines. Under the auspices of NATO’s Partnership for Peace and its own Integrated Partnership Action Plan, Georgia developed deep institutional ties with NATO and contributed significant numbers of troops to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Along with Montenegro (which would join NATO in 2017), Georgia was one of only two states to adopt an Annual National Program to pursue its NATO membership aspirations. These steps were rewarded with NATO’s 2008 Bucharest Declaration stating that Georgia (and Ukraine) “will become” members of the alliance; the U.S. military also came to Georgia’s aid during the 2008 Russian invasion, airlifting Georgian troops back from Iraq and dispatching a destroyer with humanitarian aid after a ceasefire was in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Georgia also positioned itself as a vital transit state connecting Europe to the Caspian Basin and thence to Asia. Beginning with the opening of the Baku-Supsa oil pipeline in 1998, construction of new oil and gas pipelines, roads, and railways knitted Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey to European markets. This new infrastructure helped Georgia, along with Azerbaijan, reduce its dependence on Russia while giving Europe a stake in its political and economic success. Securing these transit routes is therefore critical to Tbilisi’s ability to maintain its pro-Western orientation. Russia has made repeated efforts to undermine them through investments that would give Moscow a veto over their operations or construction of bypass routes such as the TurkStream gas pipeline. Russia also maintains the capability to disrupt critical infrastructure across Georgia through cyber or kinetic operations, such as a cyberattack that caused an explosion on the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline during the 2008 war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moscow’s ability to sever these transit routes represents a threat not only to Georgia but to Europe’s strategy of energy diversification and to the broader project of consolidating a liberal order in Eurasia. Because of Georgia’s limited military capacity and vulnerability to Russian coercion, Tbilisi would like to see a much more robust NATO presence both in and around the Black Sea, including joint exercises, port visits, and intelligence sharing, to deter further Russian aggression. Georgian officials emphasize that Tbilisi has done all that NATO has asked of it as far as enhancing readiness and contributing to NATO missions (including in Afghanistan) but worry that the alliance is not taking its concerns seriously enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Georgian worries about the extent of Western support are mirrored by growing concern in the United States and Europe that Georgia’s domestic politics are moving in the wrong direction and that, as a result, Tbilisi cannot be counted on as a reliable partner. Georgia therefore risks finding itself caught in a vicious circle, with Tbilisi’s internal problems encouraging the United States and NATO to adopt a strategy of hedging, despite perceptions of a mounting Russian threat. The war in Ukraine has made these concerns acute, with Tbilisi seeking reassurance from the West even as it scrambles to avoid giving Moscow any justification for renewed aggression. Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili and other officials have called for a rapid end to the war, declined to impose sanctions, welcomed large numbers of Russian expatriates, and obstructed efforts to provide military assistance to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equivocation over the war in Ukraine also reflects the larger processes of democratic backsliding and state capture that have accelerated since the ruling Georgian Dream (GD) party came to power in 2013. GD remains closely tied to the ambitions of the oligarch and former prime minister (2012–13) Bidzina Ivanishvili, who made the bulk of his fortune in Russia, including through a large stake in the Russian gas monopoly Gazprom. While Ivanishvili claims to have left politics since stepping down as head of GD in early 2021, members of the opposition and civil society continue to regard him as the power behind the throne and to see his influence in Tbilisi’s reluctance to fully support Kyiv. Regardless of Ivanishvili’s impact on Georgian foreign policy, the decade since GD has come to power has seen growing corruption, deepening polarization, state capture, and a resurgence of authoritarian tactics, including persecution of Saakashvili and his supporters. These shifts have made Georgia’s political system less responsive to public opinion, which remains strongly pro-Western and pro-Ukrainian. They have also helped entrench a community of interest between kleptocratic elites in Georgia and in Russia; in that sense, state capture is itself a vehicle for Russian influence. Beyond state capture, Moscow has also had success promoting its narrative about a conflict between its so-called traditional values and a “decadent” West, including within the hierarchy of the Georgian Orthodox Church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corruption, democratic backsliding, and state capture also complicate Georgia’s relationship with the United States and its European allies. U.S. officials note that state capture limits Georgia’s capacity to absorb and employ foreign assistance or to mount the kind of decentralized defensive campaign that Ukraine is currently undertaking. These concerns, in turn, limit Washington’s willingness to provide military and other assistance to Tbilisi, reinforcing the threat of Georgia’s strategic decoupling from the West. Georgian officials worry that they will be left out of whatever package of measures the United States, NATO, and the European Union adopt to help secure Ukraine. Notably, Georgia was not included when the European Union announced in June 2022 that Moldova and Ukraine would be granted candidate status. Tbilisi similarly worries that any bilateral or multilateral security guarantees that Ukraine obtains as part of an agreement to end the war will not extend to Georgia and that, as a result, Georgia will emerge less secure even in the event of a Russian defeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its attempts to stay on the sidelines, the war in Ukraine and Russia’s campaign to dominate the Black Sea will have dramatic implications for Georgia’s security and strategic orientation. Tbilisi’s pro-Western course — including its role as a transit state for energy and other goods to Europe — depends on maintaining secure communications across the Black Sea. Regardless of whether Moscow intends to carry out further military operations against Georgia, its ability to hold at risk Georgia’s outlet to Europe through the Black Sea imposes a powerful check on Western influence not merely in Georgia but in the South Caucasus and Central Asia more generally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;romania&quot;&gt;Romania&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Romania is the largest littoral state that is a member of both NATO and the European Union, and it has pushed the United States to develop a Black Sea strategy for some time. Bucharest broadly shares the U.S. assessment of the threat posed by Russia, and the Romanian National Defence Strategy identifies the BSR as of “paramount strategic interest” and Russia as an “aggressive” threat. Romania aspires to play a leadership role for NATO in the southeast, and it provides humanitarian and military support for Ukraine, though the latter has been limited by a decade of underinvestment in Romanian defense modernization between 2006 and 2016. It calls for a “comprehensive approach” to the BSR that covers both military and economic issues, transport, energy, environment, and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Senior Romanian government officials describe Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine as an escalation of the conflict that began in 2014 and an attempt to demoralize Ukraine, strangle its economy by cutting it off from the Black Sea, and destroy the civilian and military infrastructure that Kyiv has relied on to engage with the West and operationalize its military support during the conflict. They see Russia’s continuing aggression in Ukraine as dramatically affecting Romanian national security. They worry about Russia’s attempts to control Ukraine’s southern coast and, especially, Snake Island. Russia made multiple attempts early in the war to destroy the Zatoka bridge — the only road and rail route from Odesa to the West — and to capture Snake Island, which sits just 45 miles off the Romanian coast. These attacks suggested that Russia’s overarching strategic aim was to extend its land bridge through the Odesa Oblast, potentially connecting to Transnistria, the 250-mile-long strip of land in Moldova controlled by a Russia-backed de facto administration, creating a land border with Romania for the first time in thirty years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Ukraine’s counteroffensive began in August 2022, Russia’s operational setbacks offer Romania only a temporary relief. Many in Romania believe that Russia’s strategic aims for the region remain unchanged. If Russia were to achieve eventual control over Snake Island, it could further disrupt commercial shipping in and out of Odesa as well as in and out of the Danube delta ports and, hence, threaten Romanian ports in the delta and along the coast. The port of Galaţi, for example, proved essential for shipping agricultural products out of Ukraine while Odesa was blockaded during the summer. Russian control of Snake Island could create renewed legal uncertainty around the delimitation of the continental shelf and the EEZs between Romania and Ukraine, which were settled in 2009 after a decades-long bilateral dispute. Such uncertainty would have implications for both countries’ minerals as well as for oil and gas exploration and extraction. Ukraine’s rockets and artillery have pushed Russian forces off Snake Island, and Russia has since suffered further military operational setbacks. Romanian officials hint, however, that unless Russia’s strategic ambition is defeated in the BSR, they expect Moscow to regroup, rearm, and try again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s dominance in the BSR has depended on its naval capabilities as well as on increasing hybrid attacks and influence operations. Naval hybrid attacks have become a major concern for Bucharest. Moscow has closed off large swathes of the Black Sea for exercises, some of which disrupted Romanian commercial shipping. Moscow has also in some cases announced and then canceled such exercises, presumably to demonstrate political control and ability to disrupt freedom of navigation at will. The vulnerability of Romania’s offshore energy assets is another source of concern — especially in the wake of the September 2022 attack on the Nord Stream 1 pipeline in the Baltic Sea. Russia has also increased cyber and information campaigns against Romania since the start of the war, targeting democratic institutions with anti-Western narratives; it continuously portrays Romania’s hosting of Aegis Ashore launchers, part of NATO’s ballistic missile defense systems, as provocative. Russia has violated Romania’s air space with increasing frequency, and officials expect these events to continue even if a ceasefire for Ukraine is put into place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Romania has long sought a stronger NATO presence in the region, but the political geography is complex. Not only do threat perceptions diverge among NATO allies in the BSR, but Bucharest has concerns about pro-Russian forces among its neighbors, including in Hungary and Serbia, and about a vulnerable Moldova on its northeastern border. Moldova west of the Dniester was once part of Romania, and there is still some segment of the population in both countries — possibly as high as 35 percent in Moldova and 70 percent in Romania — that favors eventual reunification. Moldova is precariously located along Ukraine’s western border; it has achieved EU candidate status, but socioeconomic fallout from the war and an influx of refugees could still threaten Moldova’s security and its stability. Russia maintains approximately 1,400 troops in Transnistria, officially to protect ammunition depots, which store up to 20,000 tons of mostly expired and some still usable armaments; Russian officials have stated that any attacks on these forces will be a casus belli. Bucharest fears any miscalculation or political or military destabilization of Moldova proper, Transnistria, or the volatile Gagauzia region, where Russia also stokes separatist sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2015, Romania significantly increased defense spending, accelerated its defense modernization, especially for land and air, and has attempted to elevate Black Sea security to a priority issue for the United States, NATO, and the European Union. Romania’s modernization began in earnest between 2015 and 2018. It made significant investments in F-16s, acquiring 17 in 2016 from Portugal and accelerated plans to procure an additional 32 from Norway. It also invested in armored vehicles, Patriot surface-to-air missiles, and High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS). Bucharest is now focused on continued modernization; acquiring naval capabilities; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); and coastal defense. It is also shoring up resilience, including through the new Euro-Atlantic Resilience Centre, and addressing challenges in the information environment. Russia’s campaigns push anti-Western messages, including over the fuel and vegetable oil shortages and the grain crisis last year. It has had less success in exploiting the Romanian Orthodox Church; the church’s leadership largely rejects Putin’s narratives, though some factions push Russian narratives at lower levels in the church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Romania has continuously sought to elevate Black Sea security as a priority for the United States. Bucharest consistently called out Russia’s aggression in the region and has made significant investments in infrastructure, including at the Mihail Kogălniceanu base, with its strategic location on the northwest shores of the Black Sea; at the Câmpia Turzii base, a new hub for NATO in the region; and by hosting missile defense systems at the Deveselu air base. Bucharest has also sought to promote regional cooperation in the NATO frameworks. In 2016 it proposed a Black Sea Fleet for NATO, but it proved unsuccessful, Iulia-Sabina Joja argues, in part because of differences in threat assessments vis-à-vis Russia with NATO allies Bulgaria and Turkey. Romania stood up the Multinational Brigade South-East in Craiova, and then the Multi-National Division Southeast Headquarters (for NATO’s tailored Forward Presence), and the Multinational Corps in Sibiu should be operational by 2024. Bucharest has supported NATO’s new battlegroups for Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria. It sought approval to buy Bayraktar drones from Turkey and is open to increased air and maritime cooperation with Ankara and with Sofia, which hosts a maritime coordination center in Varna, Bulgaria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some officials in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs suggested their threat assessments can at times be compounded by concerns that the United States and Western European allies still have a “superficial” understanding of the threat from Russia. For Bucharest, the war in Georgia was a wake-up call, and some officials were frustrated that the United States responded with an attempt to “reset” relations with Russia. Then, Russia’s annexation of Crimea provided further evidence of Russia’s aggression in the southeast, but NATO focused its reassurance efforts on allies in the the northeast. NATO’s tailored Forward Presence in Romania was a smaller and less capable force than the Enhanced Forward Presence in the Baltics and in Poland. Some Romanian officials fear that some Westerners are still reluctant to confront Russia in the region. These fears run deep: they date back to the failure of Western security guarantees during World War II when the fall of France nullified the security guarantees Bucharest received as part of the These fears run deep, dating back to the failure of Western security guarantees during World War II when the fall of France nullified the security guarantees Bucharest received as part of the Little Entente: in July 1940, Romania was forced to give up….rest of the country.” If Ukraine is asked to accept territorial concessions, it would trigger these fears and increase strategic uncertainty for Romania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;bulgaria&quot;&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside Romania, Bulgaria is the only other Black Sea littoral state that a member of both NATO and the European Union. Sofia is committed to addressing Black Sea regional security challenges together with its NATO allies and EU member states. It has generally supported the steps that NATO has taken to strengthen regional defense and deterrence in southeastern Europe since 2014 — with one prominent exception. Bulgaria opposed Romania’s 2016 Black Sea regional fleet proposal after initially agreeing to it; then Bulgarian prime minister Boyko Borisov was effectively caught up in a power struggle between Moscow and Ankara and, likely bowing to Russian pressure, rejected Romania’s call for a joint regional Black Sea flotilla. Bulgaria generally sought to preserve good relations with Russia since the end of the Cold War, and Russia has exploited that good will and Bulgaria’s economic and energy dependence to strengthen its influence and undermine democratic institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bulgaria has not been able to imagine itself as a net contributor to regional security. It struggled to modernize its defense forces for years because of weak institutions, limited funds, and recently, political instability and fragile coalition governments. Also, it paid relatively little strategic attention to the BSR in the past. Historically, Bulgaria has not identified as a maritime state despite its coastline; its post–Cold War orientation looked westward toward achieving NATO and EU membership and addressing instability in the Western Balkans. For much of the post–Cold War period, Bulgarians sought friendly relations with Moscow, and saw no direct threat from the East. Implicit in NATO’s enlargement waves after the Cold War were assumptions that Bulgaria’s eastern neighbors — Ukraine, Georgia, and possibly even Russia — might be next to join the Euro-Atlantic institutions and that some kind of partnership with Russia was possible. During Bulgaria’s transition to democracy, officials saw NATO as a stepping-stone to the European Union and as a “finish line” for Bulgaria’s national security. NATO had no requirement and there was no incentive for Sofia to undertake major defense reforms or invest in modernizing its equipment after joining the alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bulgaria’s place in NATO and the European Union is widely accepted by the Bulgarian people and by all major political parties, including the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), the legal successor to the Bulgarian Communist Party. And yet there is also a sense of ambivalence in Bulgaria with respect to the Euro-Atlantic institutions that affects Bulgaria’s defense and security policies. Bulgarian scholar Rumena Filipova argues that ambivalence reflects the role of identity politics in Bulgaria as well as the country’s process of “Europeanization.” She describes Bulgaria’s Europeanization as “thin” or “ambivalent” and argues that both Western Europe and Russia were treated as “others” in Bulgaria’s national identify formation. Western Europe was seen at times as a “utopia to emulate” and, at others, as a “hostile, exclusive and distant entity that [did not] appreciate the states on its periphery.” Russia, on the other hand, was seen as Bulgaria’s liberator from centuries of Ottoman domination, though disappointment with Moscow remains a constant theme. As a result, Bulgaria has developed both pro-Russia and Russia-critical segments of society and it is particularly vulnerable to anti-Western and anti-democratic narratives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to Romania and other smaller states in the BSR, Bulgarians experienced no widespread “awakening” to Russia’s revisionist threat, influence operations, or hybrid warfare after Moscow illegally annexed Crimea and then destabilized eastern Ukraine in early 2014. Even in the wake of Crimea’s annexation, Bulgaria still sought to preserve good relations with Moscow for domestic political reasons and because of Russia’s significant influence resulting from historic and cultural ties and Bulgaria’s political, economic, and energy dependencies. A small group of academics did begin sounding the alarm, however, about Russian hybrid attacks. In 2015, Russia was suspected of poisoning a Bulgarian arms dealer, Emilian Gebrev, and there were reports of suspicious explosions in his factories, including as recently as July 2022. These incidents were not properly investigated at the time, in part because of corrupt interests. As Bulgaria’s then-president Rosen Plevneliev said in 2015, Bulgarian intelligence was “not willing to counter Russian intelligence and hybrid warfare” in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine however, could mark a major turning point in Bulgaria’s bilateral relationship with Russia and also in its relationships to the Euro-Atlantic institutions. Russia’s invasion and brutality have reverberated powerfully in Bulgaria. Bulgarians were deeply shocked by Moscow’s aggression against Ukraine, and they turned out in droves to publicly protest the war in the early weeks after the invasion. At the time, Bulgaria’s pro-Western prime minister Kiril Petkov hoped to demonstrate Bulgaria’s unequivocal support for Ukraine and express full solidarity with NATO and EU partners in opposing the war. He was partially successful: the government joined EU sanctions, expelled several Russian diplomats, and offered to repair military equipment for Ukraine. Pro-Western officials hoped to do more, but internal political divisions between pro-Russia and Russia-critical politicians as well as narratives about Bulgaria’s supposed “neutrality” in the conflict (despite membership in NATO) limited the government’s initial response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Petkov’s coalition government nearly collapsed over a parliamentary debate in April 2022 over whether Bulgaria should send weapons to Ukraine in the aftermath of the invasion. Pro-Western politicians in parliament hoped Bulgaria might do more for Ukraine, including, for example, by donating some of Bulgaria’s legacy Soviet equipment — which could have made a difference in the conflict — and then perhaps gaining credit to recapitalize Bulgaria’s national capabilities (as Slovenia did). However, Bulgarian president Rumen Radev and the BSP — part of the four-party governing coalition — refused to allow shipment of ammunition to Ukraine, arguing that it could drag Bulgaria into conflict and make it a direct party to the war. Ultimately, Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky offered a path for compromise by requesting only the repair of military equipment. This proposal allowed Bulgaria to publicly side with Ukraine without sending ammunition. Since then, Bulgaria found ways to quietly ship weapons to Ukraine, and in November 2022 lawmakers finally voted to send heavy military aid to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bulgaria generally shares concerns with the other littoral states about Russia’s attempts to dominate the Black Sea and undermine freedom of navigation. The Bulgarian navy has pointed to the Russian revisionist threat for some time, citing Russia’s anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) capabilities in Crimea and its closures of international waters for military exercises as threats to Bulgaria. The government in Sofia sees some limits, however, to what NATO can do to counter Russia in the Black Sea maritime space, in part because of Bulgaria’s attempts to preserve good relations with Russia and because of Turkey’s commitment to strictly upholding the Montreux Convention. For Bulgaria, which has a very small navy, inter-allied cooperation at sea has been complicated by Sofia’s efforts to preserve good relations with Moscow and by its deep-seated suspicions of a militarily strong and politically independent Turkey, which it fears could use its position in NATO for national purposes. (Pro-Russian forces and nationalists in Bulgaria also exploit this narrative for their own purposes). A Bulgarian defense official claimed he feared the Black Sea could become a “Turkish-Russian lake.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Romania has focused on addressing a direct threat from the east, Bulgaria has increased its focus on addressing Russia’s channels of influence in Bulgaria, especially through corruption and rule of law challenges. Former prime minister Petkov said in a recent interview that his government had managed to “curb corruption locally but found we had a bigger enemy: Russian influence,” noting “corruption and Russian influence in Bulgaria are the same thing.” Interlocutors in the Bulgarian Ministry of Defense spoke at length about how Russia exploits corrupt interests in the economy and in the media and elsewhere for influence; they mentioned that even Facebook’s content moderator in Bulgaria has opaque ties to Russia. Russia benefits from corruption and also from preserving political instability in Bulgaria. When Petkov’s government fell in June 2022, President Radev appointed a caretaker government and instructed it to avoid “getting caught up in the conflict” with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has shed light on domestic political divisions and on Bulgaria’s significant political, economic, and energy dependencies on Russia. Early in the conflict, Petkov’s government was able to manage the politics and begin to significantly reduce the dependencies, especially in energy, and chip away at Moscow’s channels for malign influence in Bulgaria. Perhaps the most important of those channels since the end of the Cold War has been the Bulgarian people’s general goodwill and trust in Russia. After Russia’s full-scale invasion in February, public attitudes in Bulgaria changed markedly. A majority of Bulgarians had begun to view Russia as the main threat to their security; more than 60 percent favored tougher sanctions against Moscow, and Putin’s approval rating more than halved to 25 percent. Whether these public opinion trends continue in Bulgaria depends on what happens in the war in Ukraine and on whether Russia can recover its goodwill by stirring nationalist and anti-democratic sentiment in Bulgaria, exploiting prolonged political instability or reconstituting some of Bulgaria’s dependencies on Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bulgaria also reduced its dependence on Russia as a source of energy. In late April 2022, Russia cut gas supplies to Bulgaria and Poland after contracts came up for renewal and both countries refused to make payments in rubles. At the time, Bulgaria was dependent on Russia for approximately 90 percent of its gas supply. Petkov called Russia’s decision “blackmail” and pursued plans to diversify Bulgaria’s energy sources, including by striking a deal with Azerbaijan and accelerating progress on a Bulgaria-Greece interconnector. The United States can help Bulgaria and Greece (and others in the Western Balkans) diversify by providing liquefied natural gas through a new facility in Alexandroupolos, Greece. In the nuclear sector, Bulgaria struggled to transition its Kozluduy nuclear power plant to alternative fuels, but fuel for the plant will likely come from non-Russian suppliers in the future. Petkov’s efforts met some domestic resistance, however. BSP leader Korneliya Ninova called for negotiations with Gazprom to resume supply, and future governments will face pressure to demonstrate that it is both possible and cheaper to diversify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the 2022 escalation of the war in Ukraine began, the Bulgarian government has expelled several Russian diplomats and dismissed senior Bulgarian officials on counts of espionage, including the former defense minister Stefan Yanev. While in office early in the war, Yanev repeated the Russian verbiage about a “special military operation” and attempted to prevent Sofia from expressing full solidarity with Ukraine and with Bulgaria’s NATO allies. Yanev is also reported to have tried to stall progress on NATO’s battlegroup for Bulgaria, insisting on national leadership for the battlegroup and calling on NATO only to fill any necessary gaps. After resigning, Yanev started a new political party, Bulgaria Rise, with some support from within the military, to focus on traditional conservative values. The short-lived coalition government under Petkov managed to generally strengthen Bulgaria’s contributions to NATO and the alliance’s presence in Bulgaria, but it had to do so while managing the optics for domestic political purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has brought a stronger NATO to Bulgaria. Bulgaria now hosts one of the new NATO battlegroups and has taken steps to increase cooperation with Romania, its most important regional ally. Bulgaria supported NATO’s Headquarters Multinational Division Southeast and the tailored Forward Presence after 2016, and it hosts a NATO Force Integration Unit and a Center of Excellence. It engages in cross-border air policing missions and training at Novo Sela, and it has stood up a new Maritime Coordination Center in Varna, which could take over the coordination function from Allied Maritime Command (MARCOM) in Northwood, United Kingdom if opposition from allies, such as Turkey, can be overcome. The summer 2022 blockage of the sea lines of communication also brought a new openness in Bulgaria to potential cooperation with Turkey and a new sense of urgency for Bulgarian defense modernization. The country’s Soviet-vintage MiG-29s cannot be serviced in Russia or Ukraine and will soon come out of service; the next generation will be U.S. F-16s, just as in Romania. Once Bulgaria operates F-16s, it will cut the ties with Russia that shaped a generation of air force generals’ perspectives (including that of President Radev) and open channels for closer cooperation with Romania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political instability in Bulgaria persists, however, and Russia has an interest in perpetuating it. A stable majority seems out of reach and there is no guarantee that a next government will be any stronger or more stable than Petkov’s four-party coalition. Bulgaria has more work to do to address corruption and rule of law challenges, cut dependencies on Russia, and address Russia’s influence in the media and information environment. Academics and analysts who follow Bulgarian politics closely, however, believe that the war in Ukraine dealt a serious blow to Russia’s traditional channels of influence. Even those Bulgarians who still support cooperation with Russia are having to review their position; the Kremlin simply cannot keep them on its side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;toward-a-new-us-black-sea-strategy&quot;&gt;Toward a New U.S. Black Sea Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the building blocks for a comprehensive U.S. Black Sea strategy are already in place. Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine has focused U.S. and European attention on the region. At an extraordinary NATO summit in March, the allies agreed to strengthen defense and deterrence in southeast Europe and the United States has significantly expanded its force presence in Europe. Through diplomacy and intelligence sharing, the United States succeeded, in the first phase of this war, in restoring leadership in NATO and generating solidarity across the alliance and more broadly. Sweden and Finland decided to apply for NATO membership, and the alliance has adopted a new Strategic Concept that identifies Russia as the “most significant and direct threat to Allies’ security and to peace and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge now, as the United States implements its National Defense Strategy and as NATO implements a new Strategic Concept, is to continue support for Ukraine while developing a framework to address Black Sea security in a comprehensive way. The framework should go beyond hardening NATO’s borders to include military, economic, energy, information, security assistance, and other measures, and it should marshal the capacities, capabilities, and experiences of the littoral states and relevant organizations, including NATO, the European Union, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). It should work across seams, including in the United States between the United States European Command (EUCOM) and United States Central Command (CENTCOM) (whose areas of operations cover the Middle East and Central Asia) and across NATO and EU members and partner states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The centerpiece should be learning to think about the BSR as a coherent space that is deeply interconnected to surrounding regions — Europe, as well as the Caspian and eastern Mediterranean. Because the BSR comprises states with varying relationships to Euro-Atlantic institutions, building a comprehensive strategy based on a shared understanding of the Black Sea security environment has proven difficult. Allied defense planning, particularly in the context of a major war against Russia, also remains challenging. The littoral states that are NATO allies or NATO partners, however, all share interests in regional cooperation to improve shared situational awareness, restore the balance of power in the Black Sea, and ensure that the international norms and rules that governed the region in the past are upheld. These include national sovereignty, territorial integrity, freedom of navigation, open lines of communication for telecommunications and energy, and connectivity among the Black Sea littoral states and between the region and the neighboring European Union, Caspian, Middle East, and eastern Mediterranean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine now plays a critical role. The conflict raised the salience of the BSR for Europe. It has highlighted regional vulnerabilities in the face of an expansionist Russia as well as the West’s challenge of safeguarding its interests in a region where states have different perceptions of the Russian threat and varied relationships with NATO and the European Union. Concerned about the potential economic consequences and terrified that the war will spread, some states — Bulgaria, Georgia, and Turkey — are more reluctant to implement measures that Moscow might perceive as provocative. Their reluctance is of different degrees and for different reasons but is at least in part bound up with Russian influence and challenges with corruption, rule of law, and democratic resilience. It also reflects wariness about how the war will play out and the danger that a resentful, expansionist Russia could regroup, rearm, and seek other targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and its allies should in the short term focus on scaling up security assistance to Ukraine in a way that suggests they are serious about enabling Kyiv to push Russian forces from its territory and end the war on favorable terms. Though the outcome of the war remains unclear, a long-lasting confrontation between Russia and the West is almost certain to ensue. While the Black Sea has arguably been a secondary consideration for U.S. and NATO planners since 2014, the prospect of sustained confrontation in the region requires the alliance to place a higher priority than in the past on (1) deterring Russian aggression against NATO allies, while increasing support for neighboring partner states Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine and encouraging cooperation between allies and partners; (2) maximizing the free movement of goods, people, and ideas in all directions around and across the Black Sea; and (3) maintaining robust ties with governments and people east of the Black Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the war in Ukraine and its wide-ranging impact on the BSR, the United States has an opportunity to strengthen its leadership in the region and put a new strategy in place that includes a comprehensive approach to regional security, strengthens deterrence and defense, improves regional allies and partners’ resilience to Russian influence across domains and across the spectrum of conflict, and builds on advantages against Russia’s coercive actions. The new U.S. Black Sea strategy should include several main pillars:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-strengthen-us-leadership-and-presence&quot;&gt;1. STRENGTHEN U.S. LEADERSHIP AND PRESENCE.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States demonstrated decisive leadership in generating unity in Europe in response to the outbreak of war in Ukraine through diplomacy, consultations with allies, and intelligence sharing. U.S. attention and presence in the region matters; it signals to Black Sea allies and partners as well as to Russia that the United States remains focused on the BSR even as it prioritizes other regions and issues. Indeed, U.S. resources and bandwidth will be limited by priorities in the Indo-Pacific and elsewhere, but there is still no regional ally or group of allies that can substitute for U.S. leadership or catalyze regional cooperation. As Jim Townsend argued in his 2021 congressional testimony, “it does not have to be the U.S. that shoulders this burden alone, but it does fall to the U.S. to lead the way.” U.S. leadership and presence can facilitate burden sharing and support the development of a comprehensive strategy, even if the United States is not always at the forefront operationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the military realm, the United States should incentivize regional cooperation and accelerate the modernization of regional forces. The United States has already dispersed forces to Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and elsewhere, and it should ensure that enablers are in place should NATO’s battlegroups need to be supplemented by additional forces. The United States should ensure NATO makes progress toward military mobility and readiness goals and incentivize cooperation among regional allies, including in maritime ISR, coastal defense, and air policing. The United States should accelerate F-16 deliveries for Bulgaria and authorize third-party transfer for Romania’s F-16 deal with Norway. It should attempt to secure congressional authorization for F-16 sales to Turkey while being open to sharing other capabilities with Ankara.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States’ financial, economic, and diplomatic presence are equally important because regional security challenges are multidimensional. The United States should put pressure on NATO and the European Union to coordinate military activities with economic, energy, information, and other initiatives designed to address regional states’ weaknesses and dependencies that Russia has exploited for decades (and which China is also able to exploit). Such programs include the Three Seas Initiative, which supports infrastructure and connectivity within the BSR as well as with neighboring regions and the global economy. The United States should support closer cooperation between NATO and the European Union as well as with the OSCE and others in support of a comprehensive approach to BSR security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has a particularly important role to play in ensuring support for NATO partner states, which cannot count on the protections of Article 5. With both Moldova and Georgia suffering from political uncertainty and instability, U.S. options are limited. Nevertheless, continued, visible engagement, especially through military channels, remains an important tool for reinforcing Georgia and Moldova’s alignment with Euro-Atlantic institutions. At the same time, Ukraine’s impressive resistance against Russian aggression has highlighted the value of relatively small, inexpensive air and coastal defense systems, drones, and other low-end capabilities that can be shared with partner states without compromising NATO readiness. The alliance should also do more to integrate Chișinău and Tbilisi into a shared situational awareness framework through information sharing and provision of sensors and other tools. Regional connectivity initiatives (see below) should also encompass Georgia, Moldova, and other vulnerable partner states where possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-bolster-nato-in-the-southeast&quot;&gt;2. BOLSTER NATO IN THE SOUTHEAST.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should push NATO to go beyond strengthening defense and deterrence for the three allies in the southeast flank along the Black Sea littoral. NATO should also sustain and strengthen support for Ukraine and other regional partners and enhance flexible and “minilateral” security cooperation among allies and between allies and partners within and outside of NATO structures. NATO recognized that its presence in the southeast was inadequate after 2014 and has since taken steps to rebalance its attention and resources from the Baltic states and Poland to the southeast. These efforts included the deployment of four new battlegroups for the region and a significant increase in high-readiness forces to 300,000 troops, which reflects the vision and recommendations laid out by Center for European Policy Analysis authors in 2020 in their report, One Flank, One Threat, One Presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To defend “every inch” of NATO territory, the alliance should also take steps to strengthen the weaker allies along the Black Sea littoral — especially Romania and Bulgaria — by facilitating their modernization, by making more frequent senior-level visits, and by incentivizing bilateral cooperation between Romania and Bulgaria as well as among the allies along the wider eastern flank, including Poland and Greece. To be credible, defense plans for Turkey must be synchronized with national plans, capabilities development, training, and exercises — and plans must be in place to surge multinational forces along the coast, including with air and missile defense and prepositioned equipment. Modernization need not entail enormous financial outlays. Relatively inexpensive uncrewed systems (both aerial and maritime) and coastal defense capabilities can have a significant impact, including for protection of vulnerable offshore energy assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deterring attack on the NATO allies is inadequate for the southeast, however. NATO must sustain its support for Ukraine and Georgia and enhance cooperation among allies and partners both within and outside of NATO structures. NATO and its partners should strengthen their sea power in ways that are consistent with the Montreux Convention, which does not restrict non-littoral states’ ability to dispatch land or air assets to the region. NATO can enhance its sea power through more mobile coastal defense capabilities, through cooperation among the littoral states’ navies and coastguards for situational awareness, and by building on NATO’s maritime presence with the annual U.S.-led Sea Breeze exercise and others open to partner participation. The United States should take advantage of an opportunity to strengthen cooperation between Romania and Turkey at sea and encourage the transfer of NATO’s maritime coordination function from MARCOM in Northwood, United Kingdom, to Varna, Bulgaria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-pursue-a-new-strategic-equilibrium-with-turkey&quot;&gt;3. PURSUE A NEW STRATEGIC EQUILIBRIUM WITH TURKEY.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enhancing NATO sea power will depend on improving relations between the United States and Turkey. Given resource constraints and the need to focus on the Indo-Pacific, any U.S. strategy for the Black Sea will have to encompass a larger role for Turkey; as one U.S. defense official put it, NATO’s options for a stronger defense posture in the Black Sea are “Turkey or nothing.” With its improving naval capabilities (including sea-launched uncrewed aerial vehicles) and strong relationships with most of the other regional states, Turkey seems like a natural cornerstone for an enhanced allied presence in the Black Sea. Ankara, however, remains wary of taking on a more prominent role not just because of internal political and economic difficulties but because it seeks to avoid an escalation of the conflict with Russia, prioritizes other theaters and threats, and questions the extent to which NATO will back it up in any clash that does occur. Other allies and partners, meanwhile, remain wary of a more assertive Turkey. Washington’s challenge, therefore, is to encourage Ankara to do more for regional security while ameliorating other states’ concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the state of its relationships with Washington or Brussels, Turkey’s interest in preventing Russian domination of the Black Sea and commitment to deepening ties with Ukraine and the states of the South Caucasus are broadly consistent with U.S. and NATO priorities. The United States should therefore seek opportunities to work with Ankara on enhancing regional security, leveraging Turkey’s special relationships, especially with Kyiv and Tbilisi, to promote shared objectives. Whether under the NATO umbrella or outside it, Turkey can provide partner states additional capabilities that bolster their resilience and military capabilities — drones in the first instance but also naval platforms, air defense, domain awareness, and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more active partnership in the Black Sea can be one component of a broader effort to revive pragmatic cooperation with Turkey. Such cooperation will require the United States to account both for Ankara’s interests outside the North Atlantic space and for its pursuit of greater strategic autonomy, while also offering reassurance to allies wary of a more ambitious Turkey. Many of the sources of Turkish mistrust toward the United States and NATO are almost ontological and therefore beyond the scope of any specific policy to resolve; others are exacerbated by preelection campaigning. However, at least some problems in the bilateral relationship can be addressed — including securing congressional approval for the sale of F-16s, lightening export restrictions, and downgrading U.S. involvement with PKK-linked groups in Syria. Likewise, the United States could do more to meet Turkey’s requests for air defense capabilities, perhaps in the context of a deal to sideline the S-400 and exempt Turkey from sanctions under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act. Reducing support for PKK-aligned forces in particular would send an important signal that the United States takes Turkish security concerns seriously, which would be critical for getting Ankara to be more forward-leaning on U.S. priorities elsewhere, including in the Black Sea and southeastern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enhancing Washington’s own operations and basing in the eastern Mediterranean, while working diplomatically to ameliorate some of the tensions between Ankara and Sofia — and between Ankara and Athens — would also allow Turkey to shift more of its existing assets to the Black Sea. Turkey’s offer of its Anadolu-class ships to the alliance as a shared NATO capability should also be seriously considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such steps should be offered as part of a broader agreement to improve U.S.-Turkish strategic cooperation, with Washington continuing to press Ankara over its provocations toward NATO allies and undermining of U.S. sanctions (on Russia as well as on Iran). Rather than seeking complete agreement with Ankara, the United States should focus on securing Turkish buy-in on a handful of key issues — including ensuring a forward presence in the Black Sea. Given Ankara’s emphasis on Montreux, any enhanced allied presence in the region will have to remain within the convention’s restrictions. In addition to rotational naval deployments and patrols allowed under Montreux, NATO should emphasize joint operations in the land and aerial domains. Improved situational awareness, air policing, and coastal defense would all enhance regional security while remaining compliant with Montreux. To ensure greater buy-in from the other littoral states, the United States should also encourage Turkey to participate in multilateral operations and initiatives wherever and whenever possible. Such cooperation need not take place under the NATO umbrella; “minilateral” cooperation with states like the United Kingdom and Poland can act as both a force multiplier and a source of reassurance for the other littoral states. A Turkey that is more embedded in multilateral initiatives and on better terms with Washington will be a better partner for both the smaller littoral states and other NATO allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the AKP emphasizing nationalist posturing and pursuing trade and other deals with Russia to shore up Turkey’s flailing economy, more serious efforts to reset U.S.-Turkish relations will have to wait until Turkish domestic politics have — hopefully — calmed down following presidential elections this spring. Either a reelected Erdoğan or a new leader from the opposition might be more pragmatic about NATO and the United States, especially if Washington is willing to address Ankara’s ongoing concerns about Syria and the PKK. Yet Turkey’s transformation into a major regional power with priority interests along its southern border and in the eastern Mediterranean will continue, regardless of whether Erdoğan and the AKP remain in power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4-emphasize-and-strengthen-democratic-resilience&quot;&gt;4. EMPHASIZE AND STRENGTHEN DEMOCRATIC RESILIENCE.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and NATO must consider regional security and resilience in a comprehensive and inclusive way. Russia’s expanding footprint was the result of not only military deployments but success in establishing points of leverage in the political and economic systems of NATO allies and partners alike through corruption, dependencies, and other forms of malign influence. This problem is particularly acute in the wider BSR (along with the Western Balkans), with its constellation of states burdened with weak institutions, ethnic rivalries, and post-Communist political systems. State capture is a significant problem in Georgia, while disinformation and Russian financial flows have further eroded democratic governance in Bulgaria and Moldova. Romania is endangered by persistent cyberattacks, naval hybrid warfare, and disinformation targeting its democratic institutions. State capture, Russian disinformation, and malign influence make BSR states less secure and less capable partners for the United States and NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economic and democratic resilience are the responsibility of individual states, but the United States, NATO, and the European Union play an important role in pushing Black Sea states to strengthen the rule of law and counter corruption, two of the main vehicles for Russian malign influence. They can increase the share of funds devoted to democratic resilience, support efforts to reduce economic or energy dependence on Russia, and help allies and partners move away from legacy Soviet military equipment. The United States and its allies and partners should also keep a watchful eye on the media environment in the BSR, ensure transparency around ownership of mass media, and facilitate exchanges and other programs to build media literacy skills across the region. NATO must continue to demonstrate benefits of Euro-Atlantic integration, deploy counter-hybrid support teams to address diverse threats, and build on local initiatives such as the Euro-Atlantic Resilience Center in Bucharest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;5-promote-regional-connectivity&quot;&gt;5. PROMOTE REGIONAL CONNECTIVITY.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equally important is reducing these states’ vulnerability to Russian economic coercion. Because of the war and sanctions on Russia, a growing share of east-west transit is already moving through Central Asia, the South Caucasus, and southeastern Europe (a regional trade association expects the yearly volume of cargo moving through Central Asia and the Caucasus to increase sixfold in 2022). Not only does that shift allow regional states to capture greater transit revenues, it also creates an opportunity to accelerate the development of critical infrastructure and accelerate economic decoupling from Russia. Sustaining that decoupling over the longer term requires investment in new roads, railways, pipelines, fiber-optics, port facilities, and other infrastructure. As with the Anaklia port project, geopolitical complexity (including Russian influence) and high up-front costs act as a brake on investment. Even China is pulling back because of debt concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This environment provides an opportunity for the United States and its allies to revive the effort to enhance connectivity that animated U.S. and European policy in the late 1990s. Governments and international financial institutions such as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the Asian Development Bank should prioritize projects of strategic significance, such as a Georgian deep-sea port and additional Caspian pipeline capacity, by providing loan guarantees, insurance, and offers of security assistance to encourage investment. The European Union took an important step in this direction in July 2022 when it agreed with the government of Azerbaijan to boost gas imports and enhance the capacity of the Southern Gas Corridor. These institutions should similarly be willing to assist Turkey with the development of new hydrocarbon sources in the Black Sea and (subject to agreement with its neighbors) the eastern Mediterranean. That approach would require an acknowledgment that projects of strategic significance cannot always be left to the market and that a greater degree of state support will likely be necessary to hedge risk and mobilize the necessary investment. It also requires thinking about infrastructure and connectivity as strategic initiatives in parallel with military support. Using existing frameworks like the Three Seas Initiative and the Southern Gas Corridor for building out connectivity across the wider BSR can ensure synergies between new projects while prioritizing those that enhance regional security and stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian invasion of Ukraine has brought to a head long-standing concerns among U.S. allies and partners about the deteriorating security environment across the greater BSR. Regardless of how the war concludes, the Black Sea and its environs will remain on the front lines of strategic competition between NATO and Russia. How the United States manages its commitments to regional allies and partners will have a decisive impact on the outcome of that competition. Because of the region’s fragmentation and location on the far edge of NATO’s zone of responsibility, it represents a particularly challenging environment, but one whose importance the United States should not underestimate. Ensuring a more secure and stable Black Sea would offer a substantial benefit not just to the region itself but to Europe writ large — and to states further east that depend on the Black Sea as an outlet to the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the risks they face from a more aggressive Russia, regional states’ caution in the face of the invasion of Ukraine reflects their own anxieties, above all about the extent to which they can count on NATO protection in a crisis. The alliance’s comparative neglect of the Black Sea, even after 2014, has contributed to these anxieties. Fearful of Russian revanchism, keen to preserve friendly relations with Russia, or uncertain about NATO’s ability to protect them, allies such as Turkey and Bulgaria and partners such as Georgia have walked a careful line in their dealings with Moscow. This understandable caution, has in turn, created openings for Russian information and other influence operations. NATO now faces something of a vicious circle: fearful governments have gone out of their way to avoid provoking Russia, in the process complicating U.S. and other allied efforts to adopt a more robust response. Uncertainty prompts strategic hedging, which only creates further uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cutting this Gordian knot requires recognition that the Black Sea can no longer be peripheral to the campaign of checking Russian aggression. Regional allies and partners need to resolve their own disputes and adopt a more cooperative approach to regional security. Doing so, however, will require an infusion of at least some U.S. leadership, forces, equipment, and attention. The Black Sea should not be a distraction from the pacing threat of China or other security challenges, but it ought to be seen (and resourced) as a crucial theater in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;

It is increasingly urgent that the United States and Japan strengthen the strategic foundations of their partnerships with the Philippines, highlight the mutual benefits of working together, and assess the role of trilateral cooperation in regional security.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As outlined in the 2022 National Defense Strategy (NDS), the United States is engaged in long-term strategic competition with China that is playing out with particular intensity in the Indo-Pacific. Beijing seeks to undermine the U.S. alliance system and carve out vast exemptions to the established rules-based order, including in the maritime space. China’s strategic intent highlights the need for enhanced cooperation between the United States and its allies to address regional security issues, deter illegal maritime activities, and strengthen the use of international law to resolve disputes in the Indo-Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s growing assertiveness in regional waters, including its completion of artificial island bases and militarization of those features in the South China Sea, has radically altered the balance of power, both in conventional military capabilities and in the gray zone short of armed conflict. In the East China Sea, Beijing maintains almost continuous coast guard patrols around the Senkaku Islands, backed by its growing naval and militia forces. This is straining Japanese coast guard readiness and challenging Tokyo’s administrative control over the islands and their surrounding waters. In the Taiwan Strait, China’s aerial patrols are stretching the ability of the Republic of China Air Force to respond. Beijing’s support for nominally civilian actors, such as illegal dredging vessels around Kinmen and Matsu Islands, undermines Taiwan’s administrative control of its surroundings. These gray zone efforts by China all share similar goals and demand greater coordination and information sharing among the United States and its partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. alliances with Japan and the Philippines provide critical access and serve as force multipliers in the region. There is no viable strategy for countering China’s illegal behavior in the East and South China Seas without robust cooperation with Tokyo and Manila, respectively. Both governments are also crucial in thinking through responses to potential Taiwan contingencies. Japan’s emergence as a major security partner for the Philippines makes trilateral alliance coordination even more important. Tokyo has provided maritime patrol aircraft, coast guard vessels, radars, and more to the Philippines under favorable terms. Japan has begun to take part in the annual U.S.-Philippines Balikatan exercises, various bilateral naval and coast guard engagements, and talks on a status of forces agreement with Manila.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is increasingly urgent that the United States and Japan strengthen the strategic foundations of their partnerships with the Philippines, highlight the mutual benefits of working together, and assess the role that trilateral cooperation should play in regional security. With this goal in mind, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) convened a trilateral U.S.-Japan-Philippines Track 2 strategic dialogue in September 2022 in Tokyo, Japan. The dialogue was intended to provide a platform for U.S., Japanese, and Filipino experts and practitioners to discuss practical issues of alliance coordination, share insights regarding each country’s respective strategic outlooks, and consider ways in which the security triangle could be operationalized in a time of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;U.S. alliances with Japan and the Philippines provide critical access and serve as force multipliers in the region. There is no viable strategy for countering China’s illegal behavior in the East and South China Seas without robust cooperation with Tokyo and Manila, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussion largely spanned three key themes: commonalities and differences in how Japan and the Philippines respond to gray zone challenges in the East and South China Seas, challenges and opportunities in bilateral and trilateral support for military modernization in the Philippines, and the growing need for all three countries to consider how a Taiwan contingency would affect not only their alliance obligations but also their respective national security priorities. The dialogue informed the findings and recommendations in this report, but all opinions presented are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect those of the dialogue participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-us-japan-philippines-security-triangle&quot;&gt;The U.S.-Japan-Philippines Security Triangle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S.-Philippines alliance has experienced an upswing since former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte’s decision in 2021 to recall the abrogation of the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA). Early signs demonstrate that the administration of current president Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. is less skeptical of the United States than its predecessor and views the alliance as a top priority. U.S. president Joe Biden’s meeting with President Marcos Jr. in New York in September 2022 represents a positive step forward — as well as the first time a sitting Philippine president has visited the United States since the late president Benigno Aquino III attended the Sunnylands summit in 2016. At the meeting, the United States affirmed its commitment to the defense of the Philippines. Whether these trends continue and the alliance undergoes much-needed modernization ultimately depends on both sides continuing to give high-level political and military attention to the alliance. Implementation of the 2014 Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) remains years behind schedule, and the Armed Forces of the Philippines’ modernization plans require a considerable increase in support. Further, the long-term viability of the alliance rests on a number of agreements and new institutions currently under discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the United States and Japan have an enduring alliance that underpins the United States’ role as a forward-deployed Indo-Pacific power. The partnership is stronger today than at any point in history, underpinned by shared values and a common strategic outlook, particularly as it relates to Chinese revisionism. Since China escalated tensions with Japan in the early 2010s over the Senkaku Islands, combined messaging and efforts by the U.S. and Japanese governments have maintained stability in the East China Sea, demonstrating the potential for robust alliance coordination to blunt the efficacy of gray zone coercion and deter escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s growing role in the Indo-Pacific underscores the value of Tokyo and Washington collaborating more closely in engaging with other alliance partners, including the Philippines. Japan is uniquely suited to this role given its extensive and long-standing security partnership with the Philippines, creating a robust level of security cooperation between Tokyo and Manila. Yet, despite the wide array of ongoing bilateral activities and the significant potential for enhanced Japan-Philippines cooperation, high-level discussion remains relatively limited on the merits of the partnership and how it might be better integrated into the U.S. alliance network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinese-gray-zone-activities-in-the-east-china-sea-and-us-japan-responses&quot;&gt;Chinese Gray Zone Activities in the East China Sea and U.S.-Japan Responses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intrusions by the China Coast Guard (CCG) into the territorial waters of the Japanese-administered Senkaku Islands have been ongoing for close to 14 years, presenting a major security concern for both Tokyo and the U.S.-Japan alliance. Although China’s risk tolerance has increased in recent years, Beijing seems content to maintain the status quo around the islands while steadily building up its maritime capabilities. Since 2012, China has largely abstained from any risky efforts to upend the status quo in the short term — a clear difference from its strategy in the South China Sea. Instead, the CCG patrols around the islands, with periodic intrusions into the surrounding territorial waters, incrementally normalizing China’s contestation of Japanese administrative control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Despite the wide array of ongoing bilateral activities and the significant potential for enhanced Japan-Philippines cooperation, high-level discussion remains relatively limited on the merits of the partnership and how it might be better integrated into the U.S. alliance network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As China gains greater competitive advantages in coast guard and naval power, its intrusions may ultimately prove untenable. Over time, the size of the CCG fleet has grown, enabling a presence around the islands for longer periods, and the frequency of these Chinese incursions has increased. Japan’s Ministry of Defense reported in December 2022 that a Chinese survey vessel entered Japan’s waters for the fifth time in one year, setting a new record. Beijing could take steps that would force Tokyo to choose between backing down or escalating to preserve its administrative control around the Senkakus — a medium-term threat for which Japan is actively preparing by building up coast guard infrastructure in the southern Ryukyu chain. But in the meantime, Japan has taken steps in coordination with the United States to preserve the status quo in the face of Chinese coercion for more than a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing collaboration with Russia has compounded China’s ongoing encroachments into the East China Sea following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. China has showcased its deepening relationship with Russia through joint military activities in the Indo-Pacific, including joint navigation and flights near Japanese territory. In 2022, Chinese and Russian warships conducted joint sails that circled Japan in a maritime show of force. That May, Chinese and Russian strategic bombers flew over the East China Sea following a meeting of Quad leaders (Australia, India, Japan, and the United States) in Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tokyo recognizes that to address China’s gray zone activities and other pressures on Japan, it must increase its force capabilities. In new national security and defense strategies released in December 2022, Tokyo announced plans for unprecedented increases in defense spending. This growth will shatter a long-standing informal cap on spending of 1 percent of GDP. In addition to increasing the defense budget, Tokyo will increase the budget for the coast guard by about 40 percent over the next five years. The decision to boost defense spending is borne not only of security concerns in the immediate neighborhood but also lessons learned from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These steps to bolster defense capabilities are important, but they will not wholly address the widening quantitative gap between Japanese and Chinese naval, coast guard, and air capabilities. China’s 2022 defense budget amounted to at least $229 billion. Even with the planned growth in Japan’s defense budget, Tokyo’s annual spending by 2027 will only be about $80 billion. Japan’s capacity to respond to future gray zone challenges will be constrained by limited human capital and difficulties in recruitment for the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) and coast guard. Japan’s aging population and decreasing birthrate mean that personnel recruitment continues to be a challenge. For instance, while Japan has made progress in building new ships, it has a limited pool of recruits to pull from to man these vessels. Further collaboration with the United States on unmanned technology could help supplement these gaps but is by no means a panacea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S.-Japan cooperation in pushing back against China’s gray zone activities in the East China Sea and stabilizing the status quo around the Senkaku Islands serves as an example of a largely successful response. When tensions around the islands rose during the administration of U.S. president Barack Obama, the United States repeated and elevated long-standing U.S. declaratory policy, for the first time at the presidential level, of the U.S.-Japan mutual security treaty covering the Senkakus. The allies reinforced these rhetorical steps with concrete efforts to strengthen the alliance through enhancements to force posture in Okinawa and the Ryukyu Islands and deeper operational planning related to an East China Sea contingency. Subsequent administrations under former president Donald Trump and current president Biden have regularly repeated that position. The October 2022 U.S. National Security Strategy reiterates the U.S. commitment to a “free and open Indo-Pacific” and the defense of Japan, including protection of the Senkaku Islands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan, meanwhile, bolstered its defense capabilities, including intensifying its coast guard presence around the islands and investing in new JSDF capabilities in the Southwest Islands closest to them. Tokyo also regularly released strong and consistent public condemnations of Chinese actions and regularly demonstrated its air and naval capabilities both independently and with the United States. This collective opposition to China’s coercion eventually caused it to stabilize the number of vessels patrolling around the Senkakus and lower the temperature of its relationship with Japan. Demonstrations of U.S. commitment to the defense of the islands and Japan’s enhanced posture helped to de-escalate the crisis and deepen the alliance. Since then, efforts to modernize the alliance have continued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinese-gray-zone-activities-in-the-south-china-sea-and-us-philippines-responses&quot;&gt;Chinese Gray Zone Activities in the South China Sea and U.S.-Philippines Responses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past 10 years, China has steadily increased its coercive behavior in the South China Sea. This includes militarizing artificial islands in the Spratlys, deploying coast guard ships to prevent the Philippines and other Southeast Asian nations from accessing the resources of their own exclusive economic zones (EEZs), and deploying hundreds of militia vessels to loiter at Whitsun Reef and various locations within the Philippine EEZ. China relies on an array of tactics, including harassing oil and gas exploration and unsafe interactions by aircraft, which complicate Manila’s ability to respond and deter. Additionally, China has profited from the Philippines’ gaps in defense capacity and uncertainty of approach in responding to gray zone crises. In 2014, China’s maritime militia turned water cannons toward Filipino fishermen, leading to confusion in Manila on how to respond, as the incident caused damage but could not be interpreted as an act of warfare. China’s conduct in the South China Sea thus actively exploits the fact that the Philippines remains largely unprepared for crisis scenarios that fall short of conflict and involve nonconventional weapons and incursions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countering gray zone activities will require strengthening the U.S.-Philippines alliance. When the Scarborough Shoal incident took place in 2012, the alliance was unprepared, and when the Philippines asked the United States for assistance, it was disappointed by the United States’ toothless affirmation of their alliance and U.S. silence regarding the Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT). This bred a fear of abandonment and hurt public perceptions of the partnership. Scarborough Shoal stands as a salient example of the erosion of stability in the South China Sea and the U.S.-Philippines alliance since 2012. Fear of abandonment in the face of a gray zone crisis has since been ingrained into the alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lack of contingency planning constrains U.S.-Philippines responses to Chinese gray zone activities, and both sides need to proactively engage with each other on what their respective roles would be in the event of a conflict in the South China Sea. Decisions for the alliance occur at an operational level but not a strategic level. Unlike the U.S.-Japan alliance, which has evolved to counter gray zone activities, the U.S.-Philippines alliance has been stymied by policy and institutional deficiencies. Such deficiencies arise, in part, from a series of complementary but not identical goals in deterring gray zone activities: the United States wants to sustain free and open navigation in the region, while the Philippines aims to protect its territorial sovereignty. Additionally, while the Philippines fears abandonment by the United States, the strength of the Philippines’ own commitment to defend U.S. forces, as part of its obligations under the MDT, remains unclear. Fears of abandonment and entrapment point to the need for institutional frameworks built over multiple administrations to clarify responsibilities and reinforce mutual commitments in the alliance, similar to the U.S.-Japan alliance. An enhanced focus on contingency planning and aligning strategic outlooks will be integral to enacting a decisive and unified counterresponse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better combat gray zone activities, the Philippines and the United States need to consider new tactics to counter low-visibility influence campaigns. China’s ability to escalate tensions and then craft narratives that paint other reactive countries as aggressors gives Beijing a considerable strategic advantage. As such, when countering gray zone activities, strategic public messaging is key. Joint messaging and public release of information related to gray zone challenges — which generally remains slow given bureaucratic roadblocks in Manila — would allow the United States and the Philippines to better counter competing narratives. For mutual security cooperation to be possible in a country beholden to public opinion, foreign policy discourse in Manila must better reflect regional challenges and the Philippines’ national objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Lack of contingency planning constrains U.S.-Philippines responses to Chinese gray zone activities, and both sides need to proactively engage with each other on what their respective roles would be in the event of a conflict in the South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, to effectively deter Chinese activities in the South China Sea, the United States and the Philippines must not only deepen their defense partnership but also boost trade and investment cooperation and enhance the Philippines’ economic resilience. The United States is one of the Philippines’ closest economic partners — and its third-largest trading partner — with almost $150 million in new foreign direct investment last year. President Marcos Jr.’s visit to the New York Stock Exchange and his meetings with U.S. business leaders during his trip to the United States for the United Nations General Assembly signaled his interest in attracting more opportunities from the U.S. private sector. The Philippines is also a member of the Biden administration’s Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, opening the door for both sides to expand their partnership and interests beyond the realm of defense. Deepening the U.S.-Philippines economic partnership will help alleviate some of the pressures associated with China’s perceived economic dominance in the Philippines, which in turn plays a limiting factor in determining responses to gray zone challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bilateral-and-trilateral-cooperation-in-military-modernization&quot;&gt;Bilateral and Trilateral Cooperation in Military Modernization&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although military modernization in the Philippines remains sluggish, concerted cooperation with the United States and Japan — both in bilateral and trilateral settings — could help build momentum and allow Manila to better meet the challenges associated with Chinese gray zone activities. The process of military modernization requires a broad approach, one that encompasses the enhancement of both diplomatic and civilian cooperation. Military reforms must also be rooted in good governance, democratic norms, and principles of anticorruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Philippines is the largest recipient of U.S. military assistance in the region. The United States has committed over $625 million over the last five years to Philippine defense and security capabilities designed to increase capacity in the South China Sea. To promote military interoperability, the allies have recently agreed to engage in 496 bilateral defense and security engagements in 2023, 35 more than in 2022. The U.S. embassy in Manila announced that $100 million would be granted to the Philippines as compensation for its decision to renege on a military equipment deal with Russia. In the next two years, the United States will invest $70 million into cooperative defense capabilities and expand EDCA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan can be a potent player in this space, not least because the Japan-Philippines partnership is far less vulnerable to political shocks than the U.S.-Philippines alliance. For instance, U.S.-Philippines ties faced challenges during the Duterte administration due both to Duterte’s skepticism of the United States and to Washington’s reluctance to enhance ties amid the Philippines’ war on drugs. By contrast, Tokyo had a relatively free hand to deepen cooperation with Manila. Deepening military ties have laid the groundwork for a potential Reciprocal Access Agreement (RAA) between Tokyo and Manila, much like the pacts that Japan has signed with Australia and the United Kingdom. While talks on a potential RAA remain slow, renewed interest from President Marcos Jr. in enhancing ties with Japan could provide an injection of political will and reinvigorate discussions. However, any forward momentum will likely be tempered by concerns from both Manila and Tokyo on how China would respond to the signing of an RAA between the Philippines and Japan. But if past is prologue, rising tension in the region could provide enough of a push to Manila and Tokyo to progress negotiations, in the same way that challenges in the South China Sea eventually pushed the Philippines and Australia toward concluding their Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) in spite of concerns about China’s response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications-of-a-taiwan-contingency&quot;&gt;Implications of a Taiwan Contingency&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan in early August 2022, as well as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and perceived parallels between that conflict and China’s behavior in the Indo-Pacific, have helped sharpen the region’s focus on the prospect of a Taiwan crisis. The Philippines’ proximity to Taiwan means that simply geography, to say nothing of the alliance with the United States, could drag Manila into any military conflict in or around Taiwan. This in turn highlights the need for Filipino strategic thinkers to consider the potential impacts of such a conflict. A cross-strait contingency could lead to both Taiwanese and Filipinos in Taiwan fleeing to the Philippines. With northern Luzon less than 200 miles from Taiwan, and the Batanes Islands even closer, a refugee crisis seems inevitable in the case of armed conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Philippines has nearly 200,000 overseas foreign workers based in Taiwan, and if conflict were to break out across the Taiwan Strait, their evacuation — likely impossible in the face of an outright invasion of the island — would be a top priority. The Philippines also has a much smaller, but still sizeable, number of overseas foreign workers in mainland China and even more in Hong Kong. This raises the possibility that those workers could become political leverage for Beijing in a time of conflict and limit the Philippines’ flexibility in responding to a Taiwan contingency. The direction of public sentiment in such a crisis — whether demanding intervention on behalf of Filipinos in Taiwan or restraint in the name of those in China — is difficult to predict. Much would depend on the details and scale of the crisis, including the number of Filipinos killed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proximity of Philippine territory to Taiwan also makes it an attractive staging point for U.S. intervention and a possible target for Chinese retaliation. The United States and the Philippines have increasingly recognized that Washington would expect access and support in any crisis endangering the lives of U.S. service members. Filipino strategic thinkers seem to recognize this as part of the price of the more “equal” alliance with the United States that both the Duterte and Marcos Jr. governments have sought. To this end, if the Philippine government wants the United States to increase security assistance and stay committed to defending Filipino lives in the contested South China Sea, then Manila must meet matching obligations. U.S. forces will require greater access to the country to rotate forces and pre-position equipment to credibly project power over both the South China Sea and Taiwan. It is unclear the extent to which the Philippine strategic community has internalized the implications of reciprocity — meaning that the Philippines has obligations to the United States under Articles II, IV, and V of the MDT, not just vice versa. The security establishment appears more cognizant of this than the wider political and academic community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Candid, ongoing, and at times difficult discussions on alliance obligations and their role in a Taiwan contingency between the United States and the Philippines at the Track 1.5 and Track 2 levels mirror talks currently underway between the two governments as part of the ongoing process of alliance modernization. At the ninth U.S.-Philippines Bilateral Strategic Dialogue in late 2021, interlocuters from the Biden and Duterte administrations set forth a joint vision for modernizing the alliance with important implications for contingency planning in both the South China Sea and Taiwan. Two components of that statement — new defense guidelines and expansion of the long-delayed 2014 EDCA — will provide important signals on the latter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new defense guidelines, to be released in early 2023, are unlikely to name Taiwan but could include important language on joint responses to regional contingencies in general. EDCA allows the United States to gain access to predetermined Philippine military sites to fund upgrades, pre-position equipment, and engage in joint training and operations. In addition to implementing the agreement at the five previously agreed sites, the allies are seeking to expand it to additional locations, which has fueled speculation that new sites would include facilities in northern Luzon, less than 200 miles from Taiwan. As with the new defense guidelines, announcements on the future of EDCA are expected in early 2023. Moreover, ongoing discussions on the risks associated with a Taiwan contingency have raised expectations that the United States would look to the Philippines to, among other things, help monitor the Bashi Channel and prevent any undetected Chinese breakout from the first island chain in a crisis scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan, meanwhile, could play a critical role in responding to an armed attack on Taiwan. In recent years, Japanese political leaders have publicly pointed to the impact a Taiwan crisis would have on Japan’s security. Japanese views on Taiwan are shaped by geography — a Taiwan Strait crisis could spill over into Chinese strikes on U.S. facilities in Japan or could provoke a new Senkaku Islands crisis. Japan’s clear-eyed view of the risks a Taiwan contingency poses to its own national security contrasts with how other U.S. allies and partners, including the Philippines and Australia, have tended to view such a crisis, primarily through the prism of their alliance obligations. However, Tokyo’s rhetorical acknowledgement of the implications of a Taiwan conflict does not necessarily translate into willingness to commit military resources to defend Taiwan. Given legal constraints on the JSDF, Japan’s role in a contingency scenario may be limited to defending Japanese territory and U.S. bases in the country rather than actively dispatching combatants in or around Taiwan. But even this operational role would be critical in protecting and supporting U.S. forces flowing into the region in a conflict scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Philippines, it remains unclear to what extent the Marcos Jr. administration has thought through the impact of a Taiwan contingency. To this end, the Philippines needs to take major steps toward articulating why Taiwan matters to its foreign policy and national security interests, including, but not exclusively, through the prism of U.S. alliance commitments. In this context, Japan has a key role to play in helping expand Philippine perspectives on Taiwan, and — together with the United States — could socialize further thinking on what role the Philippines would play in a Taiwan contingency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-findings-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Key Findings and Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding:&lt;/strong&gt; China’s gray zone operations are successful because they place the burden of escalation on the U.S. partners and allies being targeted. China crafts narratives that reinforce this burden, painting its activities as peaceful and civilian in nature. The United States and its allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific need to find ways to deter China’s gray zone coercion by, in most cases, imposing nonmilitary costs but, in certain cases, signaling willingness to escalate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 1:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States, Philippines, and Japan need to establish a consistent and coordinated understanding of what qualifies as gray zone activity and which activities they deem unacceptable in the South and East China Seas. Messaging should be harmonized across the board and consistently aligned with international law, including the 2016 South China Sea arbitration award. The U.S.-Philippines maritime security dialogue launched in early 2022 provides a venue for the United States to share lessons learned from the U.S.-Japan responses to gray zone pressure in the East China Sea. That has been an explicit focus of the U.S.-Japan alliance since at least the unveiling of the 2015 defense guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 2:&lt;/strong&gt; In line with the Quad’s nascent Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness, the United States and Japan should continue to invest in the remote sensing capabilities of its Southeast Asian and Indo-Pacific partners, allowing regional states better visibility into activities occurring in their waters. The United States, Japan, and like-minded partners such as Australia should also explore avenues for unmanned data collection in the South China Sea in partnership with the Philippines. The U.S. Navy’s Task Force 59 offers one model for such an effort.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 3:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States, Japan, and the Philippines should strengthen mechanisms to share and publicize information on Chinese gray zone activities with non-allies, particularly Vietnam, to increase the diplomatic and informational costs on Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding:&lt;/strong&gt; The Philippines’ ability to maintain a robust military and law enforcement presence in the South China Sea is vital to defend maritime security and freedom of the seas. But Manila’s resources are limited, and it cannot modernize its military capabilities at the pace required without significant assistance. China’s maritime capabilities, meanwhile, continue to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 4:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States and Japan should accelerate capacity-building efforts for the Philippine military and law enforcement agencies. The United States and the Philippines must continue to upgrade existing EDCA sites and expand the agreement to new facilities. Both Japan and the United States should invest in the technological capabilities and infrastructure of the Philippine armed forces and law enforcement beyond the EDCA sites, preparing them to acquire, operate, and maintain more advanced systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 5:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States and Japan should encourage and facilitate Philippine acquisition of asymmetric strike capabilities to enhance deterrence. This should include anti-ship and anti-air missiles, loitering munitions, and other unmanned platforms. The United States and Japan should increase joint training and exercises focused on asymmetric capabilities, including lessons learned from Japan’s investments over the last decade in the East China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 6:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States, Japan, and the Philippines should open avenues for more dialogue on military modernization and contingency planning. This is especially timely as Manila considers what will come after the third and final phase of the Armed Forces of the Philippines Modernization Program, which runs from 2023 to 2028. As part of the coordination process, a trilateral and quadrilateral (with Australia) component should be added to more U.S.-Philippines and U.S.-Japan military engagements and dialogues. Japan concluding an acquisition and cross-servicing agreement (ACSA) and RAA with the Philippines will be key to more robust multilateral alliance coordination.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding:&lt;/strong&gt; In the event of a Taiwan contingency, China will hope to isolate the United States and its allies from each other. Some domestic actors within each country, especially the Philippines, will urge neutrality. But the political, strategic, and geographic realities mean that the Philippines and Japan will likely find themselves drawn into such a crisis. The Philippines has spent the least time planning for that eventuality and needs to build up its political, economic, and military readiness if it is to coordinate effectively in an allied response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 7:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States and Japan should enhance economic support to the Philippines with a conscious goal of helping it become more resilient to Chinese coercion. Otherwise, Beijing’s economic leverage will play an outsized role in Philippine strategic calculations. Japan’s government is currently revising its official development assistance principles to align them more closely with strategic priorities. That should add impetus to invest in Philippine resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 8:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States and the Philippines must achieve a shared understanding of their mutual treaty obligations beyond the South China Sea. A more resilient alliance must be a more equal one, as demanded by consecutive Philippine administrations. That means not only will the United States have obligations to the Philippines, but the Philippines will have obligations to the United States as well. The new defense guidelines, expected to be announced in early 2023, will be an important step in the right direction. But reaching and institutionalizing a shared understanding of mutual obligations will be an ongoing process.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 9:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States and the Philippines need to elevate their relationship across the board. A resilient alliance needs more than military cooperation. The United States should also invest in more diplomatic and economic cooperation. This could include opening more diplomatic missions beyond Manila; enhancing support for clean energy, critical mineral supply chains, and other areas of shared economic interest; and negotiating a bilateral free trade agreement in the absence of any U.S. multilateral trade initiatives in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

This policy seeks to maintain the UK’s standing internationally while strengthening existing global relations. UK relations with Southeast Asia and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) form an important component of this new policy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article examines the achievements made in deepening engagement between the UK and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) since the publication of the UK’s Integrated Review in 2021. It assesses the obstacles that are impeding greater cooperation, and argues that the UK has achieved significant success in enhancing UK–ASEAN relations by adopting a position of trusted extra-regional power in Southeast Asia. In a 2021 ‘State of Southeast Asia’ survey canvassing the opinions of ASEAN policymakers, academics, researchers, businesses and civil society activists, the UK came in sixth as most ‘preferred and trusted strategic partner’ for ASEAN to hedge against the uncertainties of the US–China strategic rivalry. The UK also replaced New Zealand and Russia as preferred strategic partner for Southeast Asia in the event of US unreliability. In 2022, the UK strengthened its position as preferred strategic partner, overtaking South Korea and India to claim fourth place. The UK also ranked joint sixth as ‘the most influential economic power in Southeast Asia’ and joint fifth as country with the ‘most political and strategic influence’, after failing to rank under either metric in 2021. This is indicative of the future role regional states envision for the UK in Southeast Asia. This analysis suggests ways in which the UK can capitalise on these growing sentiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A UK security presence can promote stability in Southeast Asia. This will help the UK to achieve its aims of upholding an open international order and maintaining access to vital international trade routes, while supporting the autonomy of regional allies. The UK can also leverage the advantages offered by its recent Dialogue Partner status to gain membership of other multilateral forums, such as the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), in addition to formalising economic relations through regional trade partnerships. As Dialogue Partner, the UK gains deeper access to ASEAN and its other dialogue partners, in addition to enhanced practical cooperation in areas of mutual economic and political interest. Dialogue Partner status benefits the UK by providing it with a voice at Indo-Pacific security and defence forums, helping the UK to strengthen bilateral relations with forum members, which could then be used as a stepping-stone to greater economic cooperation. Further success in these areas is dependent on several factors. In the security realm, regional states will be looking to the UK to help mitigate, rather than exacerbate, US–China security competition. Economically, ASEAN’s recent success finalising the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) means that it now has access to the world’s largest free trade zone. ASEAN can therefore enter any future trade negotiations with the UK from a position of strength. Critically, the states of Southeast Asia will be looking for a sustained UK commitment to the region that upholds and respects ASEAN centrality in Southeast Asia. The challenge for the UK will be meeting these expectations while securing its own interests in a region of geostrategic importance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;uk-relations-in-southeast-asia-an-overview&quot;&gt;UK Relations in Southeast Asia: An Overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK began to seek closer relations with the Asia-Pacific region during the 2010–15 Coalition government led by David Cameron. The 2015 National Security Strategy and Strategic Defence and Security Review committed to strengthening security and prosperity partnerships throughout Asia. It recognised that the region presents ‘significant economic opportunities for the UK, and considerable influence on the future integrity and credibility of the rules-based international order’. In a 2012 speech in Malaysia, then Prime Minister Cameron heralded a new era in UK–Southeast Asia relations, stating that the ‘era of benign neglect is over’. The statement coincided with UK accession to ASEAN’s Treaty of Amity and Cooperation, the regional organisation’s legally binding code for inter-state relations. The government’s Asia-focused strategy gained significant momentum following the Brexit referendum in 2016. Then Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson announced: ‘Britain is back East of Suez’ in a speech in December 2016. In the referendum’s wake, the UK announced a ‘Global Britain’ strategy that ‘intended to signal that the UK will … continue to be open, inclusive and outward facing’ to respond to global challenges in an ‘increasingly complex, interconnected and volatile world’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ASEAN and Southeast Asia are a critical component of the UK’s ‘tilt’ to the Indo-Pacific, as explained in the government’s 2021 Integrated Review. The strategy confirms that ‘the Indo-Pacific region matters to the UK: it is critical to our economy, our security and our global ambition’. As part of this strategy, the UK will ‘adapt to the regional balance of power and respect the interests of others’ while seeking ‘to work with existing structures such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations’. The UK confirms a strategic approach that uses ASEAN as a vehicle to enhance relations with its 10 member states. It also capitalises on areas of mutual interest, citing a deep commitment to multilateralism and a desire to work with existing bodies such as ASEAN to strengthen institutions and the international order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to Brexit, the UK’s relationship with ASEAN was mediated through the EU; an independent relationship is vital following the country’s exit from the EU. ASEAN’s rapid growth and young workforce make it an area of significant opportunity for UK businesses and investors. The states that constitute ASEAN vary significantly economically, politically and culturally. There are vast differences in wealth across the group – Singapore and Laos are both ASEAN member states. Despite these disparities, all member states have experienced significant growth since 2000. ASEAN is the world’s fifth largest economy. In 2020 it had a combined GDP of US$3 trillion and population of 661.8 million. Its total merchandise trade has multiplied by over 3.5 times, reaching more than US$2.6 trillion in 2020. Southeast Asia also has growing geostrategic significance. It is the site of great power security competition between the US and a rising China, and heightened maritime tensions in the South China Sea, both of which have destabilised the international order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;uk-strategic-plans-and-successes&quot;&gt;UK Strategic Plans and Successes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK began to prioritise a greater regional presence in Southeast Asia post-Brexit. This included the establishment of a British Defence Staff in Singapore in 2016, a regional trade commissioner based in Singapore from 2018, a dedicated ambassador to ASEAN in 2019 and new trade deals signed with Singapore and Vietnam in 2020. Trade reviews have also been conducted with Indonesia and Thailand, with a view to future bilateral agreements. A September 2021 Joint Ministerial Declaration on Future Economic Cooperation between ASEAN and the UK identified areas for future cooperation. These included: Covid-19 economic recovery; UK–ASEAN supply chains and maintaining open markets; regulatory frameworks and standards; digital innovation; sustainable growth; skills and education; and public–private sector partnership. A programme of extensive economic cooperation raises the possibility of a future UK–ASEAN free trade agreement (FTA), something that the EU has been attempting to implement, unsuccessfully, since 2007. A UK–ASEAN FTA does not appear to be a current priority for the regional bloc, however. This is likely due to its focus on establishing RCEP, the world’s largest free trade zone that covers a third of world trade. The UK formally applied to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) in February 2021, of which four ASEAN states are currently members. If successful, it may also seek deeper engagement or accession to RCEP. However, the UK is not currently prioritising RCEP. In a UK Parliament debate in the Lords Chamber, the RCEP was described as ‘a much shallower and less significant partnership than the CPTPP’. The CPTPP was cited as a priority for the UK, representing a ‘significantly deeper agreement that will set standards globally in a large number of areas’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frameworks for greater UK–ASEAN relations also include becoming an ASEAN Dialogue Partner ‘to work together on global challenges, support ASEAN’s central role in regional stability and prosperity and enable sustainable development in South East Asia’. The UK was granted Dialogue Partner status in August 2021. The Dialogue Partnership with the UK was the first to be concluded in 25 years, paving the way for cooperation on trade, investment, climate change, the environment, technology and education. Following its application to become Dialogue Partner, the UK foreign secretary attended two UK–ASEAN Ministerial Meetings and hosted the ASEAN Chair at the G7 Foreign and Development Ministers meeting in May 2021. As Dialogue Partner, ASEAN will expect the UK to help to fund and support joint projects and commit funding and technical support for ASEAN initiatives. The UK can also use its Dialogue Partner status to increase its multilateral engagement with ASEAN through participation in the ARF and the ASEAN Defence Ministers Meeting Plus (ADMM-Plus). Membership of these forums is not guaranteed, requiring the approval of all states and a lift on the moratorium on new members. The UK applied for ADMM-Plus Experts Working Groups (EWGs) observer status in 2018, although this was vetoed by Russia and China. As part of an August 2022 Plan of Action to implement UK Dialogue Partnership, the UK will explore UK engagement with the ADMM-Plus, including where it can add value to EWGs through proposed observer programmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK already had a modest security presence in Southeast Asia prior to its exit from the EU. This included a permanent military presence in ASEAN members Brunei and Singapore, and membership of the 1971 Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA) pact alongside Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore. The UK regularly participates in joint FPDA exercises, including one hosted by Singapore in August 2021 designed to enhance interoperability between the five members. Post-Brexit, the UK aims to strengthen Indo-Pacific ‘defence and security cooperation, including in maritime security’. In a March 2021 Defence Command Paper, the UK government committed itself to a more ‘proactive … persistent presence’ in regions of interest, including the Indo-Pacific. The UK has enhanced its security presence in the region to achieve this goal, providing counter-terrorism expertise to Southeast Asian security and law enforcement agencies, and establishing a regional counterterrorism and extremism unit at its High Commission in Kuala Lumpur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security cooperation with ASEAN member states has paved the way for greater UK power projection in Southeast Asia. On 24 July 2021, HMS Richmond undertook an exercise with the Royal Thai Navy. In April 2021 HMS Queen Elizabeth, along with a UK carrier strike group comprising 10 warships, began its first operational deployment in Asia and the contested waters of the South China Sea. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: ‘When our Carrier Strike Group sets sail next month, it will be flying the flag for Global Britain – projecting our influence, signalling our power, [and] engaging with our friends’. The Carrier Strike Group is an important demonstration of the UK’s tilt. Engagements with ASEAN members including Brunei, Cambodia, Vietnam and Thailand show a commitment to regional security and Southeast Asian allies. UK security policy in Southeast Asia supports US strategy for the region. Like the US, the UK has an interest in maintaining freedom of navigation for international trade through the region’s waters and upholding an international order in Asia. Maritime activities will include training and capacity-building for regional states, humanitarian and disaster relief operations, and UK power projection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;obstacles-challenges-and-the-view-from-asean&quot;&gt;Obstacles, Challenges and the View from ASEAN&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ASEAN states have navigated different power configurations in Southeast Asia since the end of the Cold War, implementing strategies that allow them to coexist among the great powers, while resisting hostile balance-of-power politics. They have achieved some success in this regard by adopting a strategy that combines some elements of great power acceptance through collaboration or partnership with some power rejection, particularly with regards to formalised security and defence cooperation. By adopting this strategy, ASEAN has been able to pursue greater regional integration, while ‘embarking on an ambitious economic and diplomatic effort to give regional actors a stake in regional cooperation, growth and stability’. Growing geopolitical competition in Southeast Asia has strained ASEAN’s ability to hedge between the great powers. As a result of China’s increasingly assertive behaviour in areas such as the South China Sea, US President Joe Biden has called on regional allies in Southeast Asia to help counter China’s influence. This increased competition has given new impetus to the UK–ASEAN relationship. ASEAN’s desire to maintain the status quo in Southeast Asia through a non-aligned strategy has coincided with the UK’s desire to re-engage with the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of these geopolitical considerations, ASEAN ultimately welcomes greater cooperation with the UK in areas of mutual interest. The UK is ASEAN’s 12th largest trading partner and sixth largest source of foreign direct investment. A UK Mission to ASEAN looks to extend UK soft power into the region by working with member state embassies to deepen engagement and explore new political-security, economic and socio-cultural collaboration. The UK is also engaging with ASEAN on the region’s post-Covid-19 pandemic recovery through an ASEAN–UK Troika Dialogue. Troika dialogues consist of meetings between ASEAN and UK ministers with the aim of developing friendly relations and holding mutually beneficial discussions. As part of the troika, Singaporean Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishan ‘reiterated Singapore’s strong and consistent support for the UK’s continued engagement of ASEAN post-Brexit’. The UK benefits from regional champions that support a UK presence in Southeast Asia. It will need to develop bilateral relations beyond historic allies such as Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei if it is to be fully accepted into the region. Strengthening relations with Indonesia will be crucial in this regard. ASEAN’s most populous country has traditionally been viewed as de facto leader of ASEAN, in addition to being a secular democracy. Recognising the importance of Indonesia for Southeast Asia, the UK unveiled a UK–Indonesia Partnership Roadmap in 2022 to deepen relations by 2030. Stronger relations with Vietnam are also important, as Asia’s fastest growing economy and one of the ASEAN states under threat in the South China Sea. UK–Vietnam engagement has increased significantly in recent years. Vietnam supported British membership in regional diplomatic and economic blocs such as ASEAN and the CPTPP. Both agreed a joint refreshed strategic partnership agreement in September 2020. They have also strengthened trade partnership through a Joint Economic and Trade Committee in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The achievement of Dialogue Partner status is testament to UK–ASEAN deepening engagement. It is likely the UK will seek an FTA with the bloc, in addition to bilateral FTAs with ASEAN member states. As noted by Jürgen Haacke and John Harley Breen, ‘building a formal relationship may be a pre-requisite for strong and effective UK-ASEAN relations in the future and could affect the extent to which HMG [Her Majesty’s Government] is able to promote the interests of UK business in the region’. Formalising an FTA with ASEAN will come with significant challenges, however. These include navigating disparities in intra-ASEAN development, managing member state protectionist policies and foreign ownership restrictions, and tackling issues of democracy and governance considering the dubious human rights records of some ASEAN member states. ASEAN’s recent success with RCEP means it may also be less receptive to an FTA with the UK. ASEAN ‘will likely bargain hard and press Britain to make certain concessions in exchange for its greater access into their markets. ASEAN members’ demands may be too much for Britain to accept’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK admission to additional ASEAN-led institutions such as the ARF or East Asia Summit may also impact the regional power balance. Ian Storey and Hoang Thi Ha argue that ‘admission of the UK is seen as tipping the balance in favour of the US and its allies and partners within these mechanisms’, a point that risks antagonising China. This makes the 2020 announcement of a trilateral security pact between Australia, the UK and the US (AUKUS) for the Indo-Pacific region a potential challenge for Southeast Asia and ASEAN. AUKUS has exposed the lack of common interests and threat perceptions within the regional organisation. The Indonesian Foreign Ministry stated it was ‘very concerned about the continued arms race and projection of power in the region’. This view was shared by the Malaysian Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob, who feared it would ‘provoke other powers to act more aggressively in the region, especially in the South China Sea’. Despite a risk-averse approach to AUKUS, both Malaysia and Indonesia have continued to pursue closer relations with the UK. The UK has also solidified its position as a trusted extra-regional power as shown in the 2022 Southeast Asia survey. This suggests that AUKUS has not unduly damaged regional perceptions of the UK, particularly among ASEAN internal actors. Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong welcomed the AUKUS arrangement by stating that it would ‘contribute constructively to the peace and stability of the region and complement the regional architecture’. The Philippines’ Rodrigo Duterte was similarly positive in September 2021, stating ‘the enhancement of a near abroad ally’s ability to project power should restore and keep the balance rather than destabilize it’. Despite AUKUS members vocalising their support for ASEAN and its central role in the region, there is a fear that AUKUS risks undermining ASEAN centrality in favour of externally driven security arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s ability to commit the necessary resources for a permanent security presence in Asia has also been questioned. For Storey, ‘the UK’s strategic focus will remain on the Euro-Atlantic area, and especially the requirement to respond to an increasingly assertive Russia’. This argument is particularly salient following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The counterargument is that the UK has other methods of upholding security in the Euro-Atlantic region, including nuclear deterrence, land-based missile systems and fast naval power redeployment if necessary. As such, there does not need to be a trade-off between maintaining a security presence in the Indo-Pacific and the Euro-Atlantic. Southeast Asia has been broadly receptive to an increased UK security presence due to deteriorating US–China relations and increased great power security competition. As Lynn Kuok observes, the states of Southeast Asia view a greater UK security presence as a means to ‘maintain the balance of power, take the edge off US–China rivalry and expand the region’s strategic options’. This includes training on security and maritime law to help regional states assert their maritime rights, building domestic and regional capabilities to support regional states in combating transnational organised crime, and cooperation on the peaceful use of nuclear technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this optimism was tempered by ‘lingering doubts about the UK’s staying power in the region’ caused by the economic impact for the UK of Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic. While it is hoped that the UK may help to mitigate security competition in Asia and assist regional states in hedging the great powers, the announcement of AUKUS and China’s response risk inflaming, rather than diffusing, regional tensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK economic, diplomatic and security commitments towards Southeast Asia are a notable post-Brexit success story. The UK’s Dialogue Partner status with ASEAN is a significant diplomatic achievement, which can pave the way for greater integration and entry into regional multilateral forums. Regional power projection through the UK Carrier Strike Group has been largely welcomed by ASEAN states due to increasing US–China tensions and ongoing sovereignty disputes in the South China Sea. Economically, the UK’s assistance in regional&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Covid-19 recovery and funding for ASEAN projects and initiatives benefits the region while allowing the UK access to a dynamic and growing market. This has resulted in the UK adopting a ‘preferred and trusted strategic partner’ status for ASEAN members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step for the UK is to flesh out its relationship with ASEAN through joint projects and diplomatic negotiations. The UK and ASEAN share several areas of mutual interest, including a respect for multilateralism and the international, open order, and a desire to maintain stability in Southeast Asia. There are areas of divergence however, including differing perspectives on governance, democracy and human rights. The challenge for the UK is to balance its core economic, security and political interests in Asia against those of ASEAN. The UK can overcome these challenges through soft power initiatives and practical economic support for humanitarian projects and infrastructure in the region. Examples include support for Covid-19 recovery, including the donation of vaccines, grants and funding to promote education, arts and cultural exchanges, UK investment in renewable energy sources and capacity-building for clean transport and urbanisation, and funding and provision of humanitarian assistance in the wake of natural disasters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The greater challenge will be navigating US–China security competition and the UK’s position within the existing balance of power. As an ally of the US and a member of AUKUS, the UK risks destabilising UK–China relations and upsetting those ASEAN members that support China or favour regional neutrality. The UK can allay regional fears by focusing on regional state maritime capacity-building and cooperation, freedom of navigation, and peaceful maritime dispute resolution. There is significant potential for the UK to capitalise on its existing success to achieve deeper integration with ASEAN and Southeast Asia. This will be predicated on a sustained commitment of diplomatic, economic and security resources to the region. Of these, funding initiatives will be particularly welcomed by ASEAN, in addition to the UK’s vocal support for ASEAN centrality in Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

The strength of this ecosystem allows CCP Inc. to compete internationally as a well-resourced group of coordinated actors. However, recent changes to the operation of CCP Inc. — and the external environment in which it operates — foreshadow major challenges for the ecosystem.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Framing “CCP Inc.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“CCP Inc.” is a framework for analyzing and conceptualizing Chinese international economic behavior. Over the past two years, this CSIS project has examined the behavior of Chinese companies, state-owned banks, diplomatic officials, and other party-state actors through five in-depth case studies on different industries and national contexts. These cases provide a substantial empirical foundation for better understanding China’s dynamic state capitalist system. Drawing on this new repository of information, this report explains what CCP Inc. is, how it is changing, and the challenges it poses to the international system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project’s detailed case studies are premised on two fundamental ideas: first, that the features of the domestic Chinese economic system are key to better understanding China’s international behavior and, second, that the CCP Inc. system is not static, but rather the outcome of a constant process of adaptation and institutional tinkering. The term “CCP Inc.” evolved in the wake of two related, more general concepts. “Japan Inc.” gained currency during the 1970s to describe the close cooperation in Japan between a few large zaibatsu (major business conglomerates) and government agencies, especially in pursuit of export-driven industrialization. By the late 1990s, China’s rapid growth brought the term “China Inc.” into use, to describe concerted international action by Chinese state-owned firms or as an omnibus term to encapsulate China’s economic success. In both cases, the “Incorporated (Inc.)” term primarily described a pattern of informal coordination based on common national interests and long-term relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“CCP Inc.” is different. This concept describes a system with an intentionally designed hierarchical structure that facilitates coordinated action, as well as elements of informal coordination. It includes state-owned and private firms, and its architecture is designed to allow top Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leaders to achieve priority goals with a wide variety of instruments. As a system, it employs financial tools — some of them highly sophisticated — to achieve some aims indirectly. The system labeled “CCP Inc.” did not grow up accidentally but is the result of careful institutional design, thoughtfully considered and systematically implemented. As the ambitions of Chinese leaders have soared in the twenty-first century, CCP leaders have given much attention to strengthening and honing the CCP Inc. system. This has been done in part to restrain insider opportunism and corruption and improve efficiency, but also to increase the party’s ability to steer behavior within the corporate sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;As the ambitions of Chinese leaders have soared in the twenty-first century, CCP leaders have given much attention to strengthening and honing the CCP Inc. system.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this careful and purposeful attention, the system does not always work well. Moreover, Chinese policymakers also, on occasion, subject this system to new and unanticipated types of stress. A critical example occurred in summer 2021, during the “regulatory storm,” when the government introduced policies that severely constrained the actions of a number of China’s most prominent private high-tech firms, notably Alibaba. These “regulatory storm” policies have since become the new normal, with only minor recalibrations. Such abrupt top-down changes — discussed further below — demonstrated clearly that CCP Inc. is not a static institutional setup. Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s actions may have disrupted the internal functioning of the CCP Inc. model — and certainly subjected it to new types of stress — but did not change its basic elements or its fundamental objectives. Indeed, Xi’s increased domestic ambitions show that the fundamental trends producing and sustaining CCP Inc. also produce internal stresses that may provide new opportunities to understand how it works. Since outsiders cannot directly observe the inner workings of CCP Inc., the opportunity to observe the system’s response to shocks like the ones administered by Xi Jinping is especially valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This research project is primarily concerned with the impact of CCP Inc. on international business and, by extension, on international economics and politics. However, to understand the emergence of CCP Inc. — and its difference from vague and informal notions of “China Inc.” — it is essential to understand its institutional basis. These fundamental arrangements are, of course, primarily domestic. The first half of this report therefore examines the domestic institutional foundations of CCP Inc., paying particular attention to changes in the Xi Jinping era. The second half then considers the international behaviors that proceed from the CCP Inc. system, drawing significantly from the case studies conducted for this project. These two very different types of evidence are combined to provide insights into the operation and impact of CCP Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CCP Inc. is rooted in existing Chinese institutions and evolved gradually from the looser “China Inc.” model. This evolution reflects the different demands Chinese leaders have placed on the system, as well as the persistent modifications they have made in pursuit of those demands. As it exists today, CCP Inc. is distinctive in the following dimensions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under Xi Jinping’s leadership, the CCP has set more ambitious goals that extend far beyond economic growth and profit maximization, explicitly including national greatness and strategic positioning. These goals are not just different, they are broader and more inclusive, incorporating a diverse set of both domestic and international objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The expanded CCP agenda includes “market steerage,” not just economic growth. That is, the party now seeks to achieve very concrete and specific economics-related outcomes. Of these, it is prioritizing high-tech industrial development, but it also aims to shape a broad range of key “strategic” areas. In other words, party objectives are not just “add-ons” that can be analogized to corporate social responsibility or the requirements of a public-interest stakeholder. They include the pursuit of concrete economic and strategic outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Corporate governance institutions in state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have been restructured in ways that dramatically enhance CCP control. These changes specifically enable the party to transmit its goals directly to enterprise leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;New financial channels have been created that multiply options and substantially enhance leaders’ ability to steer resources toward specific objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The CCP has heightened its direct and indirect influence over private businesses. Party leaders have explicitly endorsed “mixed ownership” so that state agencies and enterprises with small equity stakes in private firms have greater visibility into firms’ decisionmaking and more instruments with which to influence their decisions. Leaders and government agencies can then use ownership stakes, along with financial and regulatory tools, to shape a private firm’s decisionmaking to ensure it conforms to party strategic objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these five changes mark a qualitative shift away from traditional notions of “China Inc.” or “Chinese state capitalism” and toward a substantially different and more ambitious system. It will become clear that the institutional features sketched here give Chinese leaders the capacity to send a range of policy instructions through the CCP Inc. system. But do they actually do so? Is the system in fact used this way? And if the system is used this way domestically, is it also deployed internationally to achieve strategic goals? Since the internal operations of the CCP Inc. system cannot be observed, there is no straightforward way to prove that this is the case. However, the preponderance of evidence from the case studies performed in this project shows that the goals and institutions created in the CCP Inc. system are almost certainly used in coordinated ways to achieve China’s strategic objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report first examines the broadest system-level features of CCP Inc., particularly the specific institutionalized elements that can be tracked with relative confidence; these are all domestic institutions and are well documented. It then briefly examines tacit and less explicit elements of coordination within the domestic economy, which appear to have been severely shaken by the sudden “regulatory storm” of summer 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More specifically, Chapter 1 describes Xi Jinping’s shift from “growth” to “greatness” as the ultimate objective of policymaking and argues that this is a long-run driver of the changes in CCP Inc. While the “regulatory storm” and Xi’s other recent disruptive actions were unexpected, they are consistent with his intensification and shift in objectives. Chapter 2 examines the changes in SOE corporate governance that have helped strengthen the CCP Inc. system. These were intentional changes carried out as part of a structural reform. As such, they are intended to reduce agency loss and make the system more efficient, as well as to increase the ability of policymakers to steer market actors. Chapter 3 describes some of the new financial instruments that Xi’s government has created. These complement the strengthening of direct administrative tools within the state sector and allow control to be exerted on a broader canvas. Chapter 4 looks at the way structural reforms have blurred the boundaries between private and state-owned business, again as part of an intentional effort to improve policymakers’ ability to steer private sector activities more effectively. These innovations in governance and finance were already changing the landscape for private business even before the “regulatory storm” of 2021. Chapter 5 concludes the first half of the paper with a more speculative assessment of the role of private business in CCP Inc. It argues that there had, in fact, been a set of norms that governed party-state behavior prior to 2021 and that those norms demonstrated a degree of restraint by top political leaders. The willingness to abandon this restraint made the events of 2021 troubling and disruptive — and augurs poorly for CCP Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second half of the paper extends the analysis to the international arena, drawing on case studies to show how the international evidence, though often indirect, provides a lens through which the operation of CCP Inc. can be inferred. Chapters 6–8 make no attempt to summarize these rich case studies, instead drawing on them selectively as a source of insight. The case studies were chosen with sectoral diversity in mind. None of them can be considered “typical,” but they reflect midrange conditions with respect to three important dimensions of host country conditions: government capacity, financial stress, and strength of civil society. This is largely because cases were selected for which significant information was available in public press accounts. This selection process tended to exclude two types of economies: those countries with strong government capacity and little financial stress, who manage their relations with CCP Inc. carefully, producing fewer instances when miscalculations expose the inner workings of the system; and those countries under extreme financial stress and with limited government capacity (such as Sri Lanka or Pakistan), who often provide less information about specific Chinese projects and are less transparent overall. For these reasons, midrange cases were more likely to provide the detailed information sought by the research team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Chapter 6 discusses, the cases display abundant evidence of the CCP Inc. ecosystem of related companies at work. Cooperation lies on a spectrum from tight subordination to Chinese state goals (as with space activity in Argentina) to loose coordination of economically interested actors, with private firms playing leadership roles (as with telecommunications in Malaysia and finance in Portugal). Each of the case studies shows evidence of cooperative behavior of the type that characterizes CCP Inc. These can be summarized as (a) firms assisting other Chinese firms that are nominally their competitors to enter international markets; (b) a (seemingly intentionally exploited) division of labor between different kinds of public and private firms; and (c) reliance on a wide variety of funding sources that facilitate rapid expansion while obfuscating the total magnitude of government support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter 7 draws on case studies to sketch a pattern of international activity that derives from the institutions of CCP Inc. An important aspect of this pattern is what this report labels a “peripheral strategy.” For all the talk of “belts and roads,” the actual pattern that emerges is one of building assets in regions that are peripheral — that is, adjacent to important economic centers and transportation networks but institutionally relatively weak and vulnerable themselves. This pattern holds in Eastern Europe, Asia, and Latin America. The electricity sector provides a telling example of how this works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter 8 draws together evidence of backlash against CCP Inc. that emerges from the case studies. China’s economic advance has generated negative reactions in many countries, often playing a role in national elections in democratic nations. Ironically, this backlash tends to intensify the peripheral strategy pattern noted in the previous section. Developed countries are more likely to react negatively to the evidence of collusion and noneconomic motives manifested by CCP Inc. actors. In those countries, CCP Inc. behavior has already emerged as a political issue and a significant (if intermittent) liability to party objectives. Less developed countries are often less sensitive to these issues and thus more welcoming to CCP Inc. actors. Indeed, the low prices and subsidization of activity provided by CCP Inc. makes it welcome in nations that struggle with their own financing needs and desperately need infrastructure. Thus, such activity in the periphery is not solely an intentional strategy; it also emerges in an evolutionary process, from the interaction between CCP Inc. opportunism and the vulnerability and poverty of less developed countries, in particular from the inadequacy of their infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final section concludes and brings together different strands. It is clear that CCP Inc. is not a seamless, well-oiled machine that rolls through strategic parts of the world. Rather, it is a complex assemblage of actors who face substantial challenges, two of which are especially important. First is the difficulty of coordinating market actors when the CCP is quite literally changing the rules on a day-to-day basis. These rules shape the actions of qualitatively different actors, so abrupt changes make coordination more complicated and, on balance, more difficult. Second, the character of CCP Inc.’s noneconomic objectives and obvious collusion are creating a substantial backlash in many parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, despite these challenges, CCP Inc. is still a formidable and well-resourced group of coordinated actors. The CCP Inc. ecosystem has an internal logic, consistency, and adaptability that allow it to achieve significant objectives. This report argues that recent changes will make the operation of CCP Inc. more troubled and less successful in the next few years. Yet that does not mean it will pose less of a challenge to a global rules-based order. On balance, that challenge may increase. As Covid-19 fades globally, China will resume and intensify its international activities — including, undoubtedly, by making adjustments designed to strengthen and fortify the CCP Inc. ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;from-growth-to-greatness&quot;&gt;From Growth to Greatness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Xi Jinping’s Changing Goals for China&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decades, analysts understood China as a political economy in which all other policy goals were subordinate to economic growth. This was the hallmark of Deng Xiaoping’s vision for China. “Development is the only hard truth,” Deng famously stated in his valedictory Southern Tour of 1992. In turn, market-oriented economic reform was essential precisely because it was seen as necessary to sustain high-speed growth. With the creation of a market economy after the turn of the century, as well as the end of the special conditions powering “miracle growth,” this set of priorities began to change by 2010 at the latest. Under the leadership of Hu Jintao and Li Keqiang (2002–2012), the priority given to market reform was somewhat lessened, and demands for improvements in social welfare and the physical environment, as well as deeper human capital accumulation, were increasingly heard. Under Xi Jinping, however, these diverse goals have increasingly been subordinated to the drive for national greatness and the strengthened political and ideological hegemony of the CCP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key part of these shifts has been the steadily increasing role for techno-industrial policy and the steadily increasing desire to heighten direct government intervention in the economy. Originally introduced in 2006 as part of a vaguely defined effort to find “new growth drivers” and support “indigenous innovation,” the industrial-policy push has gained strength, emphasis, and resources ever since. The 12th Five-Year Plan, promulgated in early 2011, still stated that “development is the key to solving all of our problems,” but declared the intention of the plan was to “make technological progress and innovation the fundamental support for the accelerated transformation of the economic development mode.” What was plausibly a moderate shift in development strategy at first has increasingly become part of the drive to become a great nation, achieve technological primacy, and attain a heightened level of global security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a broad sense, the drive for national greatness is consistent with economic growth, since only an economic power can be a global power. But the shift from economic power to national greatness in all dimensions (not just economic) nonetheless yields three important macro-level changes, which correspond to imperatives that Chinese leaders believe they must pursue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Chinese leaders are not merely more ambitious; they increasingly identify concrete policies and programs that they have determined are consistent with greater national power. While some of these policies are amorphous and constantly redefined (such as the Belt and Road Initiative), many are clearly defined strategic initiatives. These programs show up frequently in the project case studies: Chinese leaders have committed to the Global Energy Interconnection Initiative (Greece); to the cultivation of Portuguese-speaking countries (Portugal); to the support of technical standards that privilege Huawei’s fifth-generation (5G) wireless telecom ambitions (Malaysia); and so on. These policies do not always originate in the ambitions of Xi Jinping and other top leaders; they sometimes emerge from system insiders, such as state-owned utility giant State Grid, who use their direct bureaucratic connections to lobby for their own programs (in this case, longdistance, ultra-high-voltage systems that tie together international power grids). However, they become CCP Inc. policies when they are adopted at the top and stamped with the central leadership’s imprimatur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, because objectives are more diverse, Chinese leaders are seeking more diverse and separate levers of power. It is no longer the case that various instruments are close substitutes in contributing to economic growth and therefore all more or less adequate. Rather, leaders need a range of instruments to achieve discrete objectives. CCP Inc. is an agglomeration of various institutions that allows Chinese leaders to achieve this greater flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, Chinese leaders seek to “go out” and shape the environment outside China, first nearby and then globally. “Going out” is not only expected to contribute to economic growth, but also to create an international environment that is favorable to China in multiple dimensions. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is the obvious example; while uniting a plethora of economic objectives, it is a clear expression of China’s geopolitical ambitions as well. The impact of such overarching initiatives is multiplied by the ability to have different, apparently independent actors cooperating, whether tacitly or explicitly. The CCP Inc. ecosystem also enables enhanced impact due to its ability to harness various kinds of capabilities (an effect evident in the Malaysia and Portugal case studies).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the CCP has sought a higher degree of control domestically as well. Whether this is driven by insecurity about party rule, as some think, or by a desire to maximize power for external objectives is to some extent an unanswerable question. What is clear is that Xi Jinping has sought a vastly higher degree of political and ideological hegemony over Chinese society than has been seen since Mao Zedong. This affects how CCP Inc. actually functions. Whereas in the past, a tacit cooperation undergirded by a joint interest in economic growth would be enough to unite state and private firms, Xi insists on a higher degree of discretionary control over diverse actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Xi Jinping has sought a vastly higher degree of political and ideological hegemony over Chinese society than has been seen since Mao Zedong. . . . Whereas in the past, a tacit cooperation undergirded by a joint interest in economic growth would be enough to unite state and private firms, Xi insists on a higher degree of discretionary control over diverse actors.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-new-soe-corporate-governance-system&quot;&gt;The New SOE Corporate Governance System&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The foundational element of CCP Inc. has been the development of new formal institutions of party control within the state sector. These formal institutional mechanisms give the CCP the ability to oversee state-owned businesses directly. Formal institutions not only permit the occasional direct exercise of authority, but also backstop all forms of indirect and tacit coordination. There have been dramatic changes in formal SOE governance since 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-communist-partys-role-in-enterprise-decisionmaking&quot;&gt;The Communist Party’s Role in Enterprise Decisionmaking&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changes in the governance structure of state-owned companies have brought them much more directly under the control of the CCP. The “factory-manager responsibility system,” which had guaranteed the superior authority of the chief executive officer (CEO) over the party secretary since the 1980s, has been gradually abolished. The party committee was first given a “strategic” role in the firm that overshadowed that of the board of directors, which is itself now routinely chaired by the party secretary. Implementation began during the late 2010s, and the new rules were finally formally approved and publicly released at the beginning of 2020. As part of these changes, existing elements of corporate governance were reorganized to such an extent that the fundamental nature of firm-authority relations has transformed. In a sense, “state ownership” has been replaced by “party ownership,” except that the CCP does not get to harvest the revenues produced by “its” firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the 1980s through the 2000s, the SOE corporate governance system went through important changes as genuine corporations were created. However, throughout this time, the power relationship between managers and party officials was quite stable. First, the manager was the acknowledged top authority within state-owned industrial and commercial enterprises, which is no longer the case. Second, the decisionmaking chain has been radically restructured. The party committee used to occupy an intermediate and relatively powerless position in the chain, reviewing strategic decisions made by the CEO before they were passed on to the board of directors. Today, the party committee’s position has been doubly enhanced. In the first place, it is now supposed to initiate key strategic decisions in the enterprises, then pass them on to the CEO to draw up a concrete proposal. Furthermore, this proposal must then be approved by the board of directors, whose chairman is now routinely the party committee secretary. With party control at both ends of the decisionmaking chain, there is no ambiguity about who is in charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beck and Brødsgaard recently laid out these changes and described their initial implementation in an article for China Quarterly. The role of party committees in SOE corporate governance has been dramatically strengthened and institutionalized. Crucially, these changes have been widely implemented not only in wholly state-owned firms, but also in mixed-ownership firms where the state has a significant minority stake. Xi Jinping himself has explicitly declared the fundamental importance of this shift in SOE governance, calling the integration of party leadership in “all aspects of corporate governance” and the embedding of the Communist Party in the corporate governance structure “the distinctive elements of the modern state-owned enterprise system with Chinese characteristics.” As is true in many other aspects of Chinese society, party rule has become institutionalized, and channels of control have become more direct, shorter, and more monopolistic in character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be sure, there are important elements of continuity. The basic building blocks of standard international corporate governance systems remain. There is a separation between the board of directors and the chief executive officer. The board has ultimate responsibility for the firm’s overall direction and strategic choices, while the CEO oversees day-to-day operations. However, the operational function of these governance elements has changed fundamentally. The party committee chairman now explicitly takes the chair of the board of directors, and the CCP assumes many of the board’s functions in corporate governance. The party’s existence is no longer shrouded in secrecy. It declares itself to be the representative of a broad spectrum of society’s interests — broader than just that of profit — so a new “stakeholder” has been introduced into the corporate governance system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the party is no longer operating in secret, there are no disclosure requirements, so outside observers routinely know nothing about the meetings and decisions of the top body in the firm. External (“independent”) directors still exist, but their role in the decisionmaking process will have changed, since they now discuss proposals that have already been approved by the party committee. Clearly, this process reduces the extent to which the board of directors brings together stakeholders who are united by their interest in profitability and makes it far easier to impose a diverse set of objectives on the firm (indeed, this is presumably the purpose). The board of directors tends to be a locus of consultation and ratification, rather than the prime decisionmaker per se.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;setting-performance-indicators&quot;&gt;Setting Performance Indicators&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new rules are explicit that the party committee’s pre-decision powers should include the “three importants and one big,” referring to all major strategic decisions, appointments, and projects, as well as largescale capital operations. Clearly, this means the large-scale foreign operations that are the focus of this report are directly decided by party committees, which are themselves sworn to take direction from higher-level party organizations. More broadly, this process opens the way for the party to impose its multiple objectives and priorities on state-owned firms directly. In calm times with a benign leadership, this means social and environmental considerations could be introduced into corporate decisionmaking. In turbulent times with an activist leadership, this means any consideration or priority that the CCP adopts can be directly translated into state-enterprise decisions. This obviously has relevance for fighting Covid-19, disaster relief, and numerous other issues. It inevitably indicates that profit and efficiency do not have a presumptive claim on enterprise decisionmaking. To present a current example: Should an energy company set coal and oil prices to world levels, increasing profits but importing inflation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implementation and consolidation of this new system is being guided by the SOE Reform Three-Year Action Plan (2020–2022). This document does not describe the end state of the new corporate governance system but rather outlines specific steps and actions SOEs are supposed to take before the end of 2022 in order to implement the system. It is carefully designed to make sure that the institutions adopted are compatible with the incentives that policymakers want to create. Throughout, the objective is to regularize and institutionalize the new SOE corporate governance system. It is intended to give firms greater stability and greater freedom within a clearly defined (but expanded) scope of operation, while permanently building in the new noneconomic objectives that are to be the hallmark of — and justification for — CCP control. Three features of the new system help demonstrate this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the regulations encourage greater freedom of operation and stronger incentives for firms within carefully specified ranges. Managerial performance contracts with clear key performance indicators (KPIs) are an important component. China Energy Investment Corporation, a model of implementation, reports that all 4,059 managers among its 1,076 subsidiaries have signed performance contracts with fixed terms and annual and monthly KPIs. This is part of an overall system of labor contracts, performance agreements, and evaluation of success indicators in which “floating wages” linked to KPIs make up 60 percent of the company’s wage bill. Designated high-tech firms are allowed to be listed on the stock market and pay managers with stock options, SOEs in ordinary commercial sectors are allowed to invest in private firms, and superiors are not supposed to administratively intervene in subordinate firms or subsidiaries. Supervision is to primarily take the form of a shareholder preserving the value of their firm. Other new regulations cover SOEs investing abroad: The China State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) will designate each firm’s main line of business and put together a “negative list” of restricted investments. Firms are required to avoid the negative list and, “in principle,” not invest outside their main line of business without special permission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, besides profit and capital value, there is a separate set of public goals that are now incorporated into managers’ performance contracts and incentive systems. According to the Three-Year Action Plan, “Macroeconomic adjustment, technological innovation, and development of strategic emerging industries should be included in the managerial performance indicators.” For example, for China Energy Investment, KPIs include reductions in carbon emissions and anti-poverty actions benchmarked against global leaders. In principle, every top manager in the entire state-enterprise system should now have a set of policy KPIs in addition to their profit, revenue, and value indicators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the party’s role in the SOE has been strengthened in multiple, overlapping ways. In the most obvious sense, the party committee is given the dominant voice at key steps in the decisionmaking process (as described above). In addition, a manager’s employment contract must include “party building” as one of their KPIs. Finally, the KPIs of the party officials themselves must also include the firm’s profitability and preservation of capital. As the action plan notes, “At present, there is a degree of integration between party building and operational decisionmaking. For example, the decisionmaking of the party committee comes before decisionmaking of the board of directors, but the integration of work at the basic level still needs further exploration.” In other words, party committees are explicitly being told not to limit themselves to ideology and training but to actively guide the enterprise. This is an effort to ensure that the incentives of party officials and managers are unified, not spread across separate tracks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These three features together make clear that this corporate governance system is carefully designed to give SOE managers stronger incentives and greater freedom within a clearly defined scope. Contracts and KPIs make the incentive system more precise about what firms’ obligations are in terms of policy objectives. This makes sense because one of the objectives of the redesigned system is to reduce insider control — that is, to reduce the extent to which SOE managers, through opportunistic and outright corrupt methods, have been able to exploit their positions for private gain. Increased oversight by the CCP is intended to restrict managerial opportunism as well as increase the party’s ability to steer certain sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;organization-and-competition&quot;&gt;Organization and Competition&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third important change in state-owned firm governance is to the principles by which SOEs have been organized. During the 2000s, central SOEs were consolidated and the total number shrunk toward 100, but two principles were followed: (1) each firm was supposed to concentrate on its core business, and (2) competition between at least two firms was maintained in each sector. After about 2008, a new emphasis on “big and strong” SOEs prevailed. Firms were still merged, but without respecting the need to maintain competition, such as among railway equipment and airplane manufacturers, two sectors where head-tohead competition was eliminated. Moreover, gigantic firms were created by merging, for example, coal and electricity giants, in the hope that these new firms would internalize the costs of energy transition. In this particular case, the merger did not reduce competition in the coal or electricity industries, but it did create a larger, more powerful firm that could extend its reach into numerous areas and serve as a more effective conduit for central government priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These changes in industrial organization were designed to make SOEs more effective and powerful, in part by reducing the market competition that would otherwise drive them to focus on speed and profitability. It was understood that these more effective and less market-constrained entities would also be more useful instruments for policymakers. This approach further supported an implicit functional division of labor between public and private firms. State firms were more able to take on policy and regulatory functions, while private firms could pursue their competitive advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-channels-for-government-financial-resources&quot;&gt;New Channels for Government Financial Resources&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese policymakers have created a series of new financial channels over the past decade that have greatly enhanced the ability of CCP Inc. decisionmakers to steer businesses indirectly. The first component consists of new financial regulations, introduced along with the revised SOE corporate governance, that aim to move toward a more “financialized” system — part of a broader shift toward an “investor state.” The second component consists of a variety of special purpose funds designed to help achieve state aims. The third component is a new approach toward managing (or “steering”) the process by which new firms raise money on capital markets. These three new components come on top of the longstanding state dominance of the banking sector in China, which had already put in place a robust system of policy banks and state-run commercial banks. Put together, these channels provide ample flexibility to CCP Inc. policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 1 provides a visual representation of this complex financial system. The range of channels and key actors provides a combination of discretion and massive scale. There are three all-encompassing state hierarchies that are relevant to the provision of financial support for privileged firms or projects. The first is the ownership governance hierarchy of the state sector, which was the focus of the previous section; the second is the fiscal (government budget) hierarchy; and the third is the state-run financial system. Figure 1 also highlights five important strategic actors, scattered across all three state hierarchies, who have a specific strategic responsibility to shape enterprises’ investment and decisionmaking. Financing can be provided in other ways, of course, but these five highlighted actors have special strategic roles in the system. Several of them straddle the line between government and capital markets (which should not be thought of as an arena separate from government control or influence).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;internal-financial-channels-of-the-state-sector&quot;&gt;Internal Financial Channels of the State Sector&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The institutions most strategically located within this hierarchy are the state capital investment and operations companies (SCIOs). Introduced as pilots in the mid-2010s, the SCIOs were intended to take over an active role within the investor state — that is, not just to serve as passive holders of a government stake, but to actively restructure state firms as an investment bank might. For example, Guoxin (rendered into English as China Reform Holdings) is a “state capital operation company” subordinate to the national ownership agency, SASAC. Initially established to help central SOEs restructure by shedding “non-core” and unprofitable assets, Guoxin has become a permanent, robust actor. Among its portfolio of objectives is to help SOEs looking to expand abroad: in the past 10 years, it has invested 187.2 billion yuan ($26.9 billion) in projects outside China. The SOE Reform Three-year Action Plan strongly emphasizes the diffusion of SCIOs beyond the initial pilots. In quantitative terms, these companies are likely a drop in the bucket compared to funding from massive state-owned financial institutions, including China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank. However, SCIOs work in close coordination with big SOEs and provide a direct, discreet channel to achieve large-scale objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;government-guidance-funds&quot;&gt;Government Guidance Funds&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government guidance funds (GGFs) are a new type of financial entity that has proliferated rapidly in the past decade. GGFs have roots in preexisting local government funds and financial linkages to state-owned enterprises, state-owned banks, and even fiscal authorities. However, they are standalone entities, funded from public and (theoretically) private sources. An individual GGF is set up with a managing agency — which is responsible for day-to-day operations, like the manager in a venture capital firm — and limited partners, who provide funds and participate in an annual or semiannual board meeting. This institutional setup allows the managing partner to bear responsibility and be rewarded for successful investments. GGFs took off in 2014 and grew rapidly until 2018, when the growth rate cooled. By mid-2020, their combined registered investment totaled 11.27 trillion yuan ($1.62 trillion). Actual fundraising and investment lagged behind the growth of the approved scale, but investments have continued to increase through the first half of 2022. Each GGF has a declared purpose, as well as a designated scope. Most are directed toward specific industries, especially hightech ones targeted in China’s industrial policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many GGFs, such as the National Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund (known informally as the “Big Fund”), are huge and unique. As should be apparent from Figure 1, one important feature of GGFs is that they receive funding from all three of the main channels, as well as the complete spectrum of government actors. They are also empowered to raise private sector money, but thus far seem to have been overwhelmingly dependent on direct and indirect government financing. Nevertheless, from the perspective of CCP Inc. policymakers, GGFs have a useful combination of legal independence and an explicit policy mandate. Many of these funds operate internationally and fly under the radar as independent, potentially mixed-ownership entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;manipulation-of-capital-markets&quot;&gt;Manipulation of Capital Markets&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capital markets are generally considered to be the most dispersed form of financing — and the one least subject to government control. Since start-ups and firms with contrarian business strategies can potentially find a few “believers” among the multiple entities that transact in capital markets, these flexible and independent institutional frameworks are often praised for enhancing exchange at the expense of government control. The growth of capital markets in Japan after the 1980s was one of the chief causes of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry losing dominance and the end of the extreme forms of “Japan Inc.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is different because of the numerous state-controlled entities that operate in its enormous capital markets. Within the broad swathe of capital market operations, there are scores of state-owned venture capital funds that raise financing from all three of the main channels shown in Figure 1. These markets provide funds directly (to start-up companies and projects) and indirectly (through GGFs). Government entities’ increasingly ambitious and targeted programs inevitably mean there is more direct government support to new firms — and more efforts to shape their development trajectories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most recent initiative by the government to shape new, generally private, start-up firms takes the form of the “Little Giants” (小巨人) program, which offers strong government support to companies in technological niches where China has traditionally had a weak presence and relied on imports. This program kicked off in July 2019, and there have been three batches of firms selected for investment as of the end of 2021, reaching 4,762 in total (with solicitations for a fourth batch launched in June 2022). The central government aims to nurture 10,000 such firms over the 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021–25), with provincial governments fostering another 100,000 that will serve as a seedbed for national-level designation. Predominantly small and hightech, 90 percent of these firms are in manufacturing. Originally, the government budgeted 10 billion yuan ($1.4 billion) to support around 1,000 national-level “Little Giants,” but since the program appears to be expanding rapidly beyond that amount, the cost is undoubtedly much bigger — and growing quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Little Giants program represents an important extension of government influence into a realm generally dominated by private firms. Analogous industrial policy in Japan and South Korea, by contrast, mainly privileged a relatively small number of existing firms, issuing them policy preferences so they could ramp up production quickly, reach economic scale, and become national champions. Even Chinese policymakers have often worried about the potential for “excess entry” by firms seeking to profiteer off government preferences, which can lead to a serious waste of resources. Chinese industrial policies have traditionally managed these issues by pursuing a threefold strategy: (1) take a relatively hands-off policy in the early stages of a market; (2) have a modest bias toward state-owned firms; and then (3) rally behind whichever firms emerge triumphant from the early stages of competition and anoint them as “national champions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Little Giants program departs sharply from this traditional orientation. It explicitly involves government intervention at an early stage of the firm creation process. New firms are supported both by direct subsidies (typically modest) and by tacit protectionist policies — for example, requiring established firms that rely on foreign, high-tech components to purchase a minimum 20 percent of total supplies from domestic firms (where Little Giants are often the only available domestic suppliers). Such policies can be found in major national-level projects, including space exploration and high-speed railways, according to the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT). Finally, because of the potential for fraud and misrepresentation, Little Giants are supposed to be reviewed after three years, creating additional paperwork and opportunities for government intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to expanding the scope of government intervention, the Little Giants program also exemplifies a new channel of government influence. Beneficiaries of the program are being rushed into listing on China’s stock markets, especially the “Second Boards” in Shanghai and Shenzhen, as well as the “New Third Board” over-the-counter system in Beijing. For example, at the Beijing New Third Board, national-level Little Giants comprised 40 of the 203 newly listed firms in the first half of 2022. In short, the state is pushing relatively new firms to list on the market with an explicit government imprimatur, then inviting investors to buy in, thus providing finance for the firms. This verges on market manipulation, raising clear moral hazard risks, as government bureaucrats “pump” the stocks while insiders prepare to “dump” them when they underperform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overview-of-financial-channels&quot;&gt;Overview of Financial Channels&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past few years have seen a proliferation of dedicated financial institutions that facilitate the party’s direction of resources to priority sectors and projects. To be sure, in terms of overall volume, the state-owned banks still provide the largest share of resources. State-owned commercial banks provide low-cost credit to favored borrowers, but the bulk of their lending goes to support ordinary daily business. Policy banks — whose entire mission in life, after all, is to support government development financing, including abroad — play an enormous role in financing CCP Inc.’s foreign activities. The Export-Import Bank has a special remit to support Chinese projects, particularly in Africa; China Development Bank operates all over the world. Moreover, as shown in Figure 1, state-owned banks not only provide enormous volumes of direct financing, they all have standalone investment bank subsidiaries (sometimes labeled “securities companies”) that take a much more proactive role in structuring and providing finance. These subsidiaries are important in establishing and funding GGFs and underpin virtually all state efforts to steer capital markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These multiple financial channels can be used with subtlety and discretion to achieve almost anything. In the most extreme case, the government can utilize financial instruments with no apparent link to the state, in essence laundering the funds. But far more common is a blend of financing from a variety of indirect channels, all of them apparently acting through capital markets and in line with market opportunities. This proliferation of financial channels and strategic financial actors complements the changes made within the state sector, which — while remaining of roughly constant size relative to the economy — is now a more effective instrument of party wishes. Long gone are the days when the state sector was seen as a problem or burden, a bunch of loss-making “dinosaurs” dependent on infusions of aid to stanch the red ink. As their maneuverability and responsiveness increase, state institutions are obviously becoming more effective instruments through which the party can create pressure and impose its will on the broader economy, including on private enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, changes within state sector governance made the realization of CCP Inc. more feasible. The channels of CCP control over SOEs became more direct and more institutionalized while also remaining extremely discreet. Simultaneously, the number of state-run financial channels proliferated, giving policymakers more tools to influence private sector actors as well. Today, strategists have many different options for supporting business actions that align with CCP strategic objectives. Offering a greater variety of particularistic benefits — and more channels through which to deliver them — has made it much easier for CCP Inc. strategists to bring the interests of private firms into alignment with their own. It is no longer a question of whether the state sector in China is unusually large, but rather an issue of whether the entire economic system is subject to state guidance and whether the Chinese economy functions in a way that is compatible with multilateral institutions and the legal systems of other economies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;institutions-of-influence-in-the-private-sector&quot;&gt;Institutions of Influence in the Private Sector&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For over a decade, the penetration of private firms by government and party actors has been increasing. Focusing on shares of equity ownership, one recent paper by Chong-en Bai et al. used registration records for all companies in China to show that while private owners’ share of total registered capital increased by 22 percentage points between 2000 and 2019, almost all of this (19.4 percentage points) came from the expansion of the state-connected private sector. These firms, which either have direct equity ties with state owners or indirect ties with other private firms that have such connections, represent the growth sector of the economy. These are also generally large firms: of the 1,000 largest, 78 percent have direct or indirect links with the state; of firms not in the top 100,000, only 6 percent are connected. In this sense, the Hongqiao Group, which plays such an important role in the Guinea case study, exemplifies a broader phenomenon. As Bai et al. put it, “The net effect is that a large share of the Chinese economy is neither completely state owned nor completely privately owned but is rather this gray zone with mixed ownership.” This was not a significant feature of the Chinese economy 20 years ago, in the heyday of “China Inc.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to stress that these changing patterns of ownership are the outcome of intentional policy choices, in particular the promotion of “mixed ownership,” which was first prominently put forward during the November 2013 Third Plenum of the Party Central Committee. At that time, the specific policies meant to support mixed ownership were only vaguely alluded to. The party encouraged private firms to take stakes in state-owned enterprises and state-owned firms to take stakes in private firms. It is not possible to trace which pathway has been more significant, but state-connected private firms are much more common in sectors where SOEs are also more dominant, such as the aerospace industry. Some proportion of connected private firms have doubtless been set up to allow private parties to share in the privileges maintained by existing stateowned firms, while some proportion may reflect the extension of state controls to successful private firms. The ownership data does not reveal what these shares are, but it does clearly show that the conditions of interpenetration have been steadily increasing over the past 20 years. The increase in mixed ownership means that there is abundant scope for CCP Inc. managers to employ the expanded state instruments described in the preceding sections to steer private firms as well, even if less directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CCP Inc. system reflects institutional innovations that are designed to allow mixed-ownership private firms to operate with less direct control and fewer restraints than state-owned firms. In the first place, SOEs are allowed — even encouraged — to profit from their stakes in private firms. Indeed, since one of the KPIs of SOE managers is to maximize the total value of the enterprise’s assets, the greater freedom given to mixed-ownership subsidiaries encourages them to maximize the overall value of the state’s ownership stake in the economy. Furthermore, policy designers are less worried about SOE managers engaging in opportunistic and corrupt behavior when dealing with private firms because private firms have shareholders who act as a check on insider dealing and protect the value of their company. Again, this is an intentional part of the state sector corporate governance reform. For example, the SOE Reform Three-Year Action Plan says that when outsiders have at least a 30 percent stake in a state-majority subsidiary, then outsiders must be given board representation so they can voice their interests. Similarly, provisions that allow SOE managers to receive stock options and other high-powered compensation are designed to smooth the way for mixed-ownership firms with similar mechanisms. Thus, mixed-ownership firms can take risks and explore lines of business that would not be available to a state-owned firm, with significant implications for both high-tech sectors and in the international arena. All this is part of a system designed to streamline oversight and increase transparency for corporate partners within designated spheres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The CCP Inc. system reflects institutional innovations that are designed to allow mixed-ownership private firms to operate with less direct control and fewer restraints than state-owned firms.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been substantial changes in the relationship between CCP Inc. and private firms since 2019. Changing international conditions have interacted with the increasing ambition of policymakers (described in Section 2), who have introduced new tools and shifted the arenas in which these tools are employed. First, in the wake of heightened tensions between China and the United States, particularly regarding U.S. sanctions against Huawei, China’s industrial policy objectives have tilted sharply toward self-reliance. That means not only that the intensity of industrial policy (the overall claim on resources) has increased, but also that the specific sectors and subsectors that are the focus of industrial policy have changed. In particular, to achieve self-sufficiency, China has to invest in numerous economic subsectors in which there is currently almost no domestic presence, such as semiconductor production machinery. This inevitably calls for a more interventionist government approach since the broad, generalized encouragement of high-tech enterprise that has long been a feature of Chinese industrial policy has not spontaneously generated entrants into these subsectors. Indeed, the Little Giants program should be seen as a response to this particular challenge. CCP Inc. is now demanding more specific forms of behavior from private firms than it has been accustomed to demanding in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, there has been a shift in the way that key actors within CCP Inc. — especially Xi Jinping — view nonpriority private-firm activities. In the past, the party’s general attitude toward private business has been encouraging, at least since the promulgation of the “three represents” by Jiang Zemin in 2000. Outside of a few high-priority technologies, the party would presumptively support a wide swath of economic activity since it generates employment, increases gross domestic product (GDP), and — in higher-tech sectors — builds capabilities that strengthen China’s technological drive. China has long protected its private, homegrown “national champions,” especially in the high-tech space. Firms such as Alibaba, Tencent, and Huawei have benefited from protectionist policies that allowed them to grow from infant industries to global giants. As the Malaysia case study discusses, their domestic fortress markets make them more profitable and provide other resources that have facilitated their international expansion. Holding company Fosun’s profitable domestic operations also backstop its expansion in Portugal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This presumptive support for private enterprise has now changed. For a variety of reasons, CCP Inc. has begun to actively discourage certain types of private sector activity, even when they signify high technological capacity. In summer 2021, building on previous regulatory actions restricting Alibaba’s subsidiary Ant Financial, Xi Jinping unleashed a flurry of actions that actively discouraged a wide range of internet-based services, including finance, ride hailing, and gaming, among others. At the same time, his political objectives appear to have changed as well. The desire for stronger ideological and political hegemony over society seems to have led Xi and his followers to adopt a much harsher attitude toward “capitalists” (private entrepreneurs). The regime initially seemed untroubled when its actions led to a dramatic destruction of stock market wealth later that year. Thus, in a set of actions complementary to the increase in tools to positively induce compliance by private business, there has also been an increase in the regime’s willingness to impose negative sanctions on ordinary private business activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The economic implications of these two shifts are significant. While CCP Inc. has always displayed a de facto focus on high-tech manufacturing, it is now working to prevent an overall transition toward a postindustrial, service-based economy. The 14th Five-Year Plan explicitly calls for maintaining the industrial share of the economy. As a development focus, hardware is now officially preferred to software. This is sometimes considered to be support for a “German model,” as opposed to an “American model,” of the high-income economy — reflecting the contrast between the relative prominence of German manufacturing firms and the global dominance of American internet firms — and it has a certain popular appeal (“real men make tangible things,” to quote a version of a popular saying). Chinese propagandists even suggest an analogy between the Little Giants and the specialized, medium-sized manufacturing firms that make up the German Mittelstand. However, these comparisons are extremely inaccurate. German Mittelstand firms are traditional, generally family-run firms that have developed strong specializations over generations, often developing out of craft traditions in the nineteenth century. The German specialization in manufacturing is the result of accumulation of human capital over decades, not of government policy that prioritizes that type of firm. The kind of intense preferential policies favored by China for its new start-ups is quite foreign to German practice. Ironically, if anything, it mimics the Silicon Valley approach to launching and rapidly scaling new, “disruptive” firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;behavior&quot;&gt;Behavior&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restraint and Violation of Implicit Norms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus far, this report has discussed the policy changes of the last few years as incremental changes within the framework of CCP Inc. — while also acknowledging that their implementation has caused consternation and confusion among many Chinese actors. CCP Inc. has already afforded enormous power and discretion to Chinese policymakers, seemingly providing them with many of the things they wanted. Yet the actual exercise of discretionary power by Xi Jinping set off a kind of crisis, leading foreign and domestic capitalists to wonder, “Is China investible?” The scramble to readjust policy positions in 2021 — not a definitive rollback, but certainly an important rearrangement of policy — can only be understood in this light. Clearly, Xi’s actions in 2021 violated an implicit understanding that facilitated the operation of CCP Inc. Perhaps this disruption can help reveal some of the “hidden rules” (潜规则) at work in the framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it may not be immediately apparent, the effectiveness of the traditional (pre-2021) CCP Inc. depends on a degree of restraint by officials and policymakers. CCP Inc. is not merely an extension of party control into new arenas; it also represents a kind of compelled alliance that binds private firms to government and party actors in business realms. To keep such an alliance in robust health, the party has to be flexible and make occasional concessions. It also needs to respect the fundamental interests of the private business class, even as it wields the tools to insist that the private business class respect the fundamental interests of the party. More generally, there are three kinds of restraint that implicitly underly the “classic” model of CCP Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Private firms are accepted as legitimate, successful private firms are allowed to grow, and entrepreneurs are allowed to get rich. The extension of this principle is that private firms are fully qualified to be “national champions” — to both serve as instruments of national greatness and profit from the achievement of national goals. For example, Alibaba’s success in Malaysia was supported by CCP Inc., and CCP Inc. was strengthened by Alibaba’s success.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The instruments used to guide private business and bring about alignment among the commercial interests of private firms and CCP strategists are market-conforming. The instruments described in the previous section are generally deployed as positive pressures to bring about voluntary compliance through incentive alignment. Private businesses can basically continue to operate as profit maximizers and leave it to the strategists to manipulate the market environment. Private firms simply need to be alert to the signals sent by strategists, who provide important information about favored business opportunities. In other words, from the position of private firms in any mixed-market economy, this is different in degree but not in kind.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strategic direction adheres to a broad vision that can be readily communicated to a very diverse set of actors. Despite the proliferation of specific instruments and incentives, all actors need to be able to “get with the program.” In the case of CCP Inc, that program is one of national greatness, national security, and technological primacy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These principles are not written down; rather, they had been taken for granted because they were characteristics of the system as it evolved in the early 2000s, when China finally emerged from decades of market-oriented reform and state sector downsizing with a functioning and rapidly growing market economy. China’s leaders understood the value of what they had achieved and were in no hurry to undermine the achievement with ill-considered policies. Tacit cooperation was in place, and planners were not interested in disrupting it. As China’s commitment to technological development intensified after 2006, new industrial policies were steadily added, layered on each other, and made more generous, but they all generally took market-conforming configurations. Tax exemptions, subsidies, low-interest loans, and government-supported funds were all piled one upon the other. While none of the instruments were perfectly (or even elegantly) applied, on balance the instruments achieved a minimum standard of “at least, do no harm.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite adhering to these principles, China’s policymakers would sometimes apply harsh negative sanctions to private companies. Threats and punishment have always been part of CCP relations with private firms. For example, in 2017, Chinese regulators took dramatic steps to dismantle the corporate empires of Hainan Airlines and Anbang Insurance Group, as well as Fosun, the private conglomerate at the center of the Portugal study. These actions were designed to send a signal to private businesses, as demonstrated by the People’s Daily article cited in the Portugal study. For a signal to be effective, it must be publicized, and Fosun’s compliance and return to the fold was clearly laid out in this People’s Daily editorial, which included specific praise for how the firm facilitated the entry of state-controlled UnionPay into Europe. This signaling and publicizing of both the sanction and the resolution should been seen as systemic features. Readers of this editorial would also understand that the redemption of Fosun’s CEO, Guo Guangchang, was in stark contrast to the fates of the Hainan and Anbang CEOs, both of whom were sent to prison and saw their corporate empires dismantled. The events of 2017 did not signal a crisis of the CCP Inc. model: the corporate moguls were plausibly guilty of financial manipulation, and an astute owner like Guo Guangchang could be welcomed back into the club of national champions once he displayed sufficient contrition. The threat of coercive action was always in the background and retained its effectiveness because it was only rarely and intermittently deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “classic” form of CCP Inc. provided important payoffs. The private firms with the greatest technological expertise — including Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu — were inducted into the national team. Market forces remained strong enough that obviously failed projects could be identified and terminated relatively easily (companies and projects in China go bankrupt when they cannot meet their targets and funders tire of losing money). During 2020, hundreds of failed semiconductor projects were closed down. This commitment to market instruments prevented planners from pouring resources into bottomless pits of failed investments. In short, adherence to norms of restraint made the operations of China’s planners more effective and less costly — and underpinned a generally cooperative relationship between the state and private actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi Jinping’s bundle of new policies in 2021–22 violated all three of these understandings of implicit restraint. The position of big private companies in China is less secure than it has been since 1989–91. Official spokespeople have issued various veiled and not-so-veiled warnings to Alibaba cofounder Jack Ma that he is not indispensable. This is an abrupt shift from the idea that all companies are Chinese companies and all are members of the national team. As a result, the message is muddied. It is not clear what is demanded from private companies except absolute compliance to the boss’s will. For the first time in recent memory, a company can get in serious trouble for getting too far out ahead of the CCP Inc. program. In political terms, the degree of consensus underlying joint actions by the party and private business has been thoroughly shaken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;_&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Xi Jinping’s bundle of new policies in 2021–22 violated all three of these understandings of implicit restraint.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commitment to market-conforming instruments was noticeably absent in the rush of policy. As described earlier, this was perhaps most clearly displayed in the apparent lack of concern when new regulations destroyed billions of dollars of stock market value. But the same indifference was in evidence across the board as policy objectives were rushed forward without any consideration of appropriate instruments to achieve them. Indeed, even designating an appropriate regulatory agency was not thought out in advance, leading to conflicts between two and sometimes three competing agencies. Perhaps the most striking was the sudden adoption of the “common prosperity” narrative without any movement (or even apparent effort) to address the regressive elements in the Chinese tax code. No country has ever achieved common prosperity without a progressive tax code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In economic terms, the government’s waning commitment to market-conforming instruments is probably the most damaging of the recent “rules changes.” Even as the commitment to industrial policy is becoming broader and more costly, the quality of the information coming back to policymakers is likely to deteriorate. Consider the case of the Little Giants one more time. It is likely that these firms can list on public markets and attract funding. But it is not because of the judgment of investors that these firms are viable or especially productive, but rather because they are known to have policymakers’ imprimatur. It may be an astute shortrun move to buy these stocks, but the purchaser will be looking to dump the shares once the policy-led bubble has peaked. The quality of the information coming from the stock market can only decline. The crucial tacit and informal relations that underpin relations between the state and private business are changing; negative sanctions have become more prominent and are likely to induce more defensive and protective behaviors. The internal relations of CCP Inc. have been weakened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;international-economic-coordination&quot;&gt;International Economic Coordination&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case studies carried out as part of this project display abundant evidence of the CCP Inc. ecosystem at work. In the first place, CCP Inc. is clearly prioritizing a variety of concrete strategic goals and achieving them through a diverse “team” of interrelated corporate actors. These strategic goals lie on a spectrum from most to least specific government priority. Argentina’s Espacio Lejano Deep Space Ground Station is tightly subordinated to the Chinese objective of filling a temporal gap in the country’s satellitetracking capabilities and enable further deep space missions. Geography and geopolitics limit the options Chinese policymakers have (since continuous satellite tracking requires a Southern Hemisphere outpost), and the CCP Inc. team delivered a successful project under these highly constrained conditions. In the Greek electricity and Portuguese finance sectors, CCP Inc. mobilized actors to achieve entry into the EU economic zone through peripheral economies (see Section 8). The Greece case also shows strategic action in promoting intercontinental electric-grid connections, a specific program that serves both China’s strategic interests and the specific economic interests of State Grid (one of China’s largest SOEs). In Guinea, China has mobilized various actors to ensure access to a key mineral resource. At the other end of the spectrum, in both Malaysia and Portugal, it has pursued a more diverse set of objectives, in which there is less of a concrete strategy for achieving the broader goal of economic penetration. Dynamic private firms take the lead (as Alibaba did in Malaysia and Fosun in Portugal).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the case studies shows evidence of cooperative behavior among Chinese state-owned, private, and mixed-ownership firms, although to varying degrees. The Malaysia case shows Huawei taking the lead in providing fourth- and fifth-generation telecommunications infrastructure to Malaysia, but also assisting its nominal domestic competitor ZTE to gain a share of government contracts. Alibaba moved forward in Malaysia with multiple business projects, but many of these require close cooperation with Chinese state firms that serve key roles. For both the e-Logistics Park built at the Kuala Lumpur airport and the Smart Cities program rolled out for the city of Kuala Lumpur, Chinese state-owned firms provided crucial hardware (physical infrastructure investment) to complement Alibaba’s software. Indeed, this general pattern is repeatedly demonstrated by CCP Inc.’s international operations: the big Chinese state-owned construction companies play a powerful role in establishing beachheads, building physical infrastructure, and creating conditions for expansion of other Chinese businesses, including private firms. This is evident in state-owned shipping giant COSCO’s investment in the Greek port of Piraeus, which served as a foundational business deal for China’s growing footprint in Greece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Portugal, a study of CCP Inc. revealed a less common pattern of a private financial company taking the lead in penetrating a market, then facilitating entry by a broad range of Chinese companies. BCP Millennium, the private bank controlled by China’s Fosun, helped state-owned giant China Three Gorges Corporation take a controlling interest in utility company Energias de Portugal (EDP). However, it is worth noting that BCP Millennium’s financial resources were substantially bolstered by its relationship with Chinese state-owned commercial bank ICBC, with which it signed a memorandum of understanding and which underwrote Fosun’s important insurance policy with Fidelidade in 2014. In turn, BCP Millennium became the first issuer of UnionPay bank cards in Europe, fulfilling a strategic objective of Chinese policymakers — dating back to China’s World Trade Organization accession agreement — to create a domestic and global competitor to Visa and Mastercard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all these cases, there is a de facto division of labor between different kinds of public and private firms. In Guinea, the private Hongqiao Group, with its own roots in the state sector, plays a particular kind of bridging role, in a sense, keeping one foot in each camp of public and private. Often, private firms are left to pursue their own profit-oriented projects, while state-owned firms (with their cost competitiveness bolstered by a range of implicit and explicit subsidies) build the physical and financial infrastructure necessary for the realization of those profitable projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cases also show CCP Inc.’s ability to draw on an exceedingly rich and diverse suite of financial channels to support international operations. This abundant financing allowed Chinese state actors to outbid other suitors for strategic assets. This is evident in the case studies, which detail bids for stakes in privatizing electric grids in Greece and insurance businesses in Portugal. This predominantly shows the massive financial power of China’s commercial and policy banks. In other situations, businesses can call on a wide variety of financial conduits, as discussed in Section 4. China’s government guidance funds (GGFs) were important sources of money for overseas acquisitions, including in the United States, where their relatively independent legal status made them subject to fewer suspicions and controls. This has faded since the United States set up a formal process to vet more investments as the nature of GGFs became better known.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expanding Chinese businesses can call on a wealth of financial channels to carry out their overseas projects. A private firm like Fosun — once it has reestablished its compliance with government objectives — can draw on a wide range of implicit government financial support. Alibaba, a financial powerhouse on its own, does not need direct financial support but does require a friendly regulatory environment so it can move money across China’s borders (something that, for ordinary citizens, is tightly constrained). The benefit of these financial channels lies precisely in their diversity. They attract less attention since many tranches of different types of financing can be mobilized for a strategic initiative, each one seemingly of modest size and well-suited to a specific project. They provide funding in a dizzying variety of forms and at different terms, making it difficult to establish whether the overall terms are favorable and what the total amount of state support is. Finally, the presence of these different financial channels provides implicit insurance to Chinese firms venturing abroad, which have reason to believe that such financing streams exist to support them in the event their overseas business ventures founder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the cooperation between SOEs and private firms in third-country markets could equally be the result of tacit cooperation: simple strategies of mutual assistance based on common interest and the understanding that superiors will look benevolently on such cooperation. This is easy to achieve when companies are working hand in glove with the government to penetrate new markets. But it should also be clear that the institutional changes described earlier facilitate such cooperation. They make SOEs more disciplined (focused on their assigned tasks); they provide abundant, diverse financing; they make it easier for SOEs and private firms — to say nothing of mixed-ownership firms — to cooperate; and they help nimble private firms explore new market opportunities abroad. These changes in the internal structure of CCP Inc. and the financial institutions available to serve it were initially driven by domestic policy considerations and the desire to shape the domestic economic system. They also inevitably have an impact on international operations. These are not accidental outcomes but rather intentional, hoped-for results of the institutional design process — the purpose of which has been, from the beginning, to enhance the CCP’s ability to effectively steer the system toward priority objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;peripheral-strategies&quot;&gt;Peripheral Strategies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The institutional design of CCP Inc. might be said to underly a pattern of operations known as a “peripheral strategy.” In a peripheral strategy, CCP Inc. organizations target a relatively small, peripheral market or country, then use the ability to coordinate among affiliated organizations to strengthen their position by “stringing together” operations. It is true that the evidence for this pattern is largely circumstantial; it is difficult to come by direct evidence of coordination. However, there is indirect evidence: China often officially announces initiatives it supports, and (according to case study evidence) these are concentrated in peripheral economies. China’s friendship initiatives with Portuguese-speaking countries comprise one such example, in which Brazil — the most populous Portuguese-speaking country by far — is curiously underemphasized. This diplomatic approach is echoed by other initiatives in which China focuses attention on smaller, relatively weak countries that are more distant from the center of regional affairs (and perhaps unused to such lavish attention). This is obviously true in Southeast Asia, where Cambodia and Laos receive intensive Chinese support while Singapore and Vietnam maintain a much more formal and prickly relationship with China (with Malaysia falling somewhere in between).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe is an especially interesting case. China’s peripheral strategy has been incorporated into a formally designated “forum,” the China and Central and Eastern European Countries (China-CEEC) cooperation framework, initially known as 16+1. While the China-CEEC grouping does have a Beijing-based secretariat, it is essentially a noninstitutionalized umbrella concept grouping together countries, each of which is essentially in a hub-and-spoke bilateral relationship with China. (In this, it is like the Belt and Road Initiative, which it pre-dates by one year.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this study, China-CEEC cooperation is significant because it reflects a peripheral strategy on two levels. First, the forum obviously presents a channel to deepen relations with a set of European countries without dealing with either the EU bureaucracy itself (12 of the 17 historical members, including the most economically significant, are EU members) or the stronger, more advanced countries that dominate EU decisionmaking and foreign policy. Second, the China-CEEC countries receiving special attention have much smaller economies than the EU principals, with significantly lower average GDP per capita; they are far less important economic partners for China than any of the major EU players. The cooperation framework is often considered a challenge to the European Union — even though EU norms clearly encourage a multiplicity of cooperation frameworks — because China seeks to cultivate special relations with weaker partners in a way designed to undermine EU solidarity and collective decisionmaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an additional sense, the China-CEEC framework also facilitates a peripheral strategy because it throws a cloak of common amity over a cluster of very dissimilar bilateral relationships. This provides some cover for the much closer relations that China has with Serbia, Hungary, and Greece than with others in the group, constituting a kind of periphery within the periphery. In early 2022, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine caused a shift in attitudes and diplomacy among all the CEEC countries toward a more pro-Western stance, exemplified by Czechia, which assumed the EU presidency for the second half of 2022. Whether a shrunken China-CEEC framework will survive China’s pro-Russia “neutrality” after the Ukraine invasion remains to be seen. The context of peripheral strategy is important when considering the CCP Inc. case studies examining Greece (a latecomer to the China-CEEC framework) and Portugal (through the Portuguese-speaking country initiative).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A peripheral strategy can also emerge through more complex evolutionary processes. A domestic Chinese business venturing abroad may seek to “test the waters” and learn how to operate in a smaller, less competitive market. With lower stakes, the company’s risk is reduced and assistance from friendly financial institutions is greater. If the approach works in the smaller markets, it can be scaled up in larger, more competitive markets after experience is gained. In addition, peripheral countries are more likely to be under financial stress and less likely to have robust alternatives to Chinese funding that are founded on strong domestic governance. An ironic feature of both the Greece and Portugal case studies is that initial Chinese entry was greatly facilitated by the economic conditions in both countries in the wake of the 2008–10 global financial crisis. Both countries were forced to privatize state-owned utilities to qualify for financial support from the “troika” (the joint action of the International Monetary Fund, European Central Bank, and European Commission). In such an evolutionary process, the periphery emerges as a privileged center of Chinese firms’ attention because of the less demanding nature of business in the peripheral economy, both in terms of market competition and regulatory scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;electricity-investment-as-part-of-a-peripheral-going-out-strategy&quot;&gt;Electricity Investment as Part of a Peripheral “Going Out” Strategy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these same principles can very clearly be seen at work in the electricity sector — also the subject of the CCP Inc. case study on Greece. Electricity has two characteristics that make it especially interesting. First, all the major Chinese players are state owned, which is generally not the case with other electricity multinationals. However, these state-owned firms seem to seize opportunities created by privatization of public electricity assets abroad. Second, the electricity industry can be divided into generation, transmission, and distribution components. Generation is (potentially) a broadly competitive sector, while transmission is prone to natural monopoly and is thus typically highly regulated. Countries carrying out robust programs of privatization and market regulation usually prevent any company from straddling the boundary by holding assets in both generation and transmission. This is because it is relatively easy for transmission companies to create economic benefits for related parties in the generation business. In China as well, electricity transmission is the monopoly of two state-owned companies, State Grid (in 27 provinces) and Southern Power Grid (in 4 provinces) — which are, in theory, not allowed to hold generation assets. In terms of international operations, non-Chinese electricity multinationals are based in many different countries, but almost all of them are concentrated in the generation subsector. State Grid and China Southern Power Grid, in contrast, tend to invest in transmission and distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, Chinese electricity investment is quite different from that from other countries. The primary entry point has been funding for transmission or distribution in overseas projects. Through its wholly owned subsidiary State Grid International Development Ltd. (SGID), State Grid owns stakes in transmission and/or distribution networks in nine electricity markets: Brazil, the Philippines, Portugal, Australia, Italy, Greece, Oman, Chile, and Hong Kong. State Grid’s trackable overseas investments stand at $28.6 billion, and it self-reports overseas equity of $65 billion. Despite its enormous ambition, it initially limited its overseas investment in electricity generation projects. This was partly because well-regulated economies (such as Chile’s) rigorously police the boundaries between generation and distribution. For these reasons, State Grid initially focused almost exclusively on the acquisition, development, operation, and passive equity investment in transmission and distribution (T&amp;amp;D) assets in liberalized electricity markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet while State Grid’s investments were initially restricted to T&amp;amp;D, other Chinese state-owned firms have invested in generation. In Chile, four major Chinese electricity SOEs are present, including China Southern Power Grid and State Grid, which has a 57 percent share of electricity distribution. In addition, Chinese state-owned power generator State Power Investment Corporation obtained five operating hydropower plants in Chile (through acquisition of an Australian company) in 2016. In 2018, large hydroelectric developer and operator China Three Gorges Corporation bought an existing Chilean company, giving it control over a range of renewable energy projects in development. This has created fertile ground for additional Chinese manufacturers and developers, such as Jinko Solar and Xinjiang Goldwind, to sell equipment and become actively involved in the engineering and construction of renewable energy projects in Chile. There is no evidence of collusion among these firms, and Chile’s regulatory capacity is comparatively strong. Still, it is impossible to ignore how entry by diverse state and private firms has created a supportive environment for all Chinese enterprises in Chile, giving them collectively a dominant position in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Brazil, State Grid has a big presence in electricity transmission through its subsidiary State Grid Brazil Holding, which represents a 12 percent share of Brazil’s total transmission and distribution market. In addition, State Grid has a controlling interest in the publicly listed CPFL Energia, the second-largest private energy company in Brazil. The biggest private energy group in Brazil is Enel (a subsidiary of the Italian “green super-major” company of the same name). State Grid thus controls the third- and twenty-second-largest Brazilian energy companies. The tenth-largest is EDP Brazil, a subsidiary of Energias de Portugal, which in turn is minority owned (but arguably controlled) by China Three Gorges Corporation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its initial entry strategy and substantial technological expertise in electricity transmission, State Grid seems to be nibbling at the edges of regulatory regimes in numerous countries. State Grid’s ambition of gaining a stake in Greece’s electricity generation sector is a strategic business innovation that also raises various unresolved regulatory issues. Already, as the Portuguese case study makes clear, China Three Gorges Corporation’s stake in EDP gives it access to the largest Portuguese industrial group and one of the largest European players in the electricity sector, operating in 20 countries. Clearly, this participation also skirts the boundary of the regulatory principle of separation between generation and transmission. The entry of Chinese electricity giants often seems to be driven by opportunistic considerations: Liberalized and privatized markets present opportunity, and Chinese firms have the abundant financing to be able to step in as buyers. In so doing, they end up taking positions in some surprising segments, notably transmission and distribution, but also in generation, sometimes carried out by other Chinese state-controlled groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;backlash-and-coordination-failures-in-the-international-arena&quot;&gt;Backlash and Coordination Failures in the International Arena&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The record of CCP Inc. in the international arena, examined across five case studies, presents some striking patterns. On the one hand, penetration of new markets (particularly in weak, peripheral economies) has been dramatic, surprising, and — at least in some cases — remarkably successful. Chinese firms seem to be very good at identifying new opportunities in developing countries, then exploiting the opportunity with help from other Chinese partners. This implies that foreign governments and businesses should be wary of the colocation of many Chinese firms and track their behavior. This lesson is relevant to the electricity sector discussed above, where unusual patterns of subsector concentration and state-firm clusters can be observed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, CCP Inc.’s activities overseas are marked by numerous coordination failures. This should not be surprising. Even with the most sophisticated instruments, it is still difficult to precisely control the actions of hundreds of disparate actors in the service of scores of different strategic objectives. There are two main sets of problems: coordination failures and backlash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;coordination-failures&quot;&gt;Coordination Failures&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A persistent weakness in the performance of CCP Inc. is a pattern of overpromising but underdelivering state aid in infrastructure construction. In many countries, there is a sense that China promised substantial help for major projects that never materialized. This is certainly true in the CEEC, where — despite high hopes — significant investments have been modest in countries besides Greece, Serbia, and Hungary (even though most of these countries are also Belt and Road affiliates). Even in Greece, promises of investment and project development across the energy sector have not been fully realized, creating a pattern of underperformance that cannot be explained solely by EU pushback against Chinese influence in critical sectors. More examples can be found in Central America, where a wide range of ambitious projects have fallen through, including for high-speed railways in Costa Rica and Mexico and canals in Nicaragua and Panama. Similarly, in Guinea, Chinese companies failed to meet promised development timelines for the country’s massive Simandou ironore mine, even as the same players logged successes in other mining ventures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These outcomes highlight that CCP Inc. is a vast economic entity composed of a range of heterogeneous actors with different short-run incentives. The agencies promising are not generally the same as the ones delivering; firms that are expected to deliver certain results will refuse or stall if they anticipate suffering significant losses. To be sure, the CCP leadership can induce — or compel — those actors to work in concert in the highest-priority cases, but it can only exercise this kind of explicit and particularized control in times of need. In other situations, it needs to rely on implicit cooperation and internalization of strategic objectives or simply on mutual interest and understanding of the broader rules of the game. Indeed, the part of the system that is theoretically most subject to direct state control — the provision of subsidized infrastructure projects by government development banks — is actually an area where coordination and follow-through appear to be relatively weak. In some respects, it is easier for CCP Inc. to discipline and steer Fosun than it is to discipline State Grid. Fosun is more vulnerable, and its owners have more at stake; State Grid is an indispensable and highly resourced part of the national system. State Grid’s individual leaders and managers can be disciplined, but that will not necessarily bring the organization as a whole under control. Coordination is not necessarily easier when people are in direct command relationships, as the outcomes of innumerable government and military operations throughout human history clearly show. The concrete coordination needed delivering specific state projects may in fact be a weakness of the CCP Inc. system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The CCP leadership can induce — or compel — those actors to work in concert in the highest-priority cases, but it can only exercise this kind of explicit and particularized control in times of need. In other situations, it needs to rely on implicit cooperation and internalization of strategic objectives or simply on mutual interest and understanding of the broader rules of the game.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;backlash&quot;&gt;Backlash&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activity by CCP Inc. firms often leads to a backlash in host countries. This theme of wariness about state connections was evident across this project’s case studies examining CCP Inc. in Malaysia, Greece, Portugal, and Argentina. Coordination among these firms and their local allies has become a red flag to many countries. Suspicion leads them to stall and sometimes cancel CCP Inc. initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;GLOBAL PUSHBACK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pushback has impacted projects differently, depending largely on host-government relationships with China versus their relationships with the United States and European Union. In Greece and Portugal, EU concerns about China’s reach — particularly in Greece’s electricity grid — served as a counterweight to Greek and Portuguese efforts to pursue China as a needed financier of infrastructure and privatization projects. In the Argentina and Malaysia case studies, U.S. concerns about the expansion of CCP Inc. affected the prospects of Chinese projects. In Malaysia, this arose in the form of pushback against Huawei, which ended up limiting the telecom giant’s global operations in countries that were more closely aligned with the United States. In Argentina, both U.S. and Argentinian protests clouded the construction of the Espacio Lejano Deep Space Ground Station, which was marked by Chinese military ties and secrecy around terms of use. Moreover, Argentine startup Satellogic, a leading private-owned purveyor of satellite imagery, pivoted away from partnerships with Chinese firms in favor of ones with U.S. firms, likely driven by an understanding that it would need to do so to remain eligible for Western defense and intelligence contracts. The variation among cases clearly shows that there is a global backlash against Chinese collusive behavior led by developed nations, including the United States and the large EU countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;LOCAL PUSHBACK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All politics are local. Backlash has a significant impact in host countries, based on their specific domestic politics. Idiosyncratic power relations create unpredictable dynamics that often make CCP Inc. ties a political liability — even when they provide economic assets. Since CCP Inc. actors are often unfamiliar with local politics and generally have little expertise and no experience understanding democratic processes, they are often clumsy in handling these relations. In many cases, including those represented in the CCP Inc. case study reports, charges of corruption linked to discomfort over close ties with Chinese actors have led to the fall of governments. Most spectacularly, the 60-year reign of the United Malays National Organization was brought to a crashing end in 2018 by corruption charges against Prime Minister Najib Razak, leading to the party’s electoral loss that year. While Razak’s worst corrupt act was looting the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) state investment fund, allegations that Malaysia overpaid for Chinese infrastructure projects in return for kickbacks to politicians figured prominently in the election. In Malaysia, the pushback was predominantly based on local issues, and Razak’s successor promptly negotiated substantial reductions in the price Malaysia was paying for Chinese projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar pattern is evident in many democratic countries. Out-of-power parties make nontransparent China ties an issue in electoral campaigns, which does seem to help them in cases where they displace the governing party. This was likely true in Argentina in 2015, when Mauricio Macri (temporarily) ousted the regime of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner and Alberto Fernández. Other countries in Latin America, including Panama and Costa Rica, have experienced similar dynamics. Sri Lanka’s spectacular economic crisis has been brought on in part by unstable alternation between political parties who have made ties with China a central issue. In Africa, the multidimensional Chinese economic presence often creates political backlash, as in Zambia, where politicians have rallied anti-China sentiment as a populist strategy across multiple election cycles. Each of these cases, however, displays very particular — even idiosyncratic — patterns linked to the local exercise of political power and the types of interest groups that wield influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nondemocratic countries — and fragile democracies — can also pose challenges to CCP Inc. because of the complexity of interests at play. In Guinea, Beijing’s close ally President Alpha Condé was deposed in a military coup in 2021, and Chinese efforts to develop the Simandou iron-ore mine were stalled by the new military government, which took issue with failures to meet promised development timelines. Concerns about the state-commercial connectivity of CCP Inc. did not feature as an explicit, public issue in Guinea, but CCP Inc. nevertheless had to make an adjustment to the new post-coup structure of power, which took time and resources. So while the ecosystem faced less scrutiny linked to Western concerns about China’s international reach, CCP Inc. in Guinea had to handle a different set of challenges tied to poor governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;REBOUND FROM BACKLASH&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite major losses caused by local pushback, CCP Inc. has shown great resilience and an ability to rebound from these reversals. In Malaysia, for example, after Razak’s 2018 defeat, former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad assumed power. Mohamad succeeded in reducing the price of several Chinese infrastructure projects, notably the Kuala Lumpur–Singapore high-speed railway, but also promptly resumed business relations with Alibaba, sealed with a friendly visit to Hangzhou to visit Jack Ma. Political instability has continued in Malaysia through the November 24, 2022, appointment of Anwar Ibrahim as prime minister, so it is difficult to make firm conclusions. However, it appears that new leaders have strong incentives to ignore past tensions and normalize relations with China. CCP Inc. is quite capable of providing individualized goods for the new leaders, just as they did with the old, and perhaps in less conspicuous and blatantly illegal forms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar dynamic was visible in Argentina. Despite Macri’s anti-China rhetoric ahead of his election in 2015, his policies quickly assumed a less hostile stance. China’s deep space ground station was built and continues to operate today. Moreover, after the return of a Fernández-led government in 2019, Chinese-Argentine economic relations are again gaining momentum, buoyed by Argentina signing on to the BRI, as well as a new spate of major bilateral infrastructure deals and even discussion of allowing Argentina to join the BRICS grouping. The different outcomes underline that potential coordination among CCP Inc. firms and state actors is only a red flag in certain contexts, highly dependent on the state of political relations with China. Similar sequences were evident in Panama and Costa Rica, where new leadership groups promptly moderated their critical rhetoric and resumed cooperation with China. CCP Inc. policymakers seem to understand this process reasonably well. They adopt flexible, short-run policies, then wait for relations to resume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report has made clear that CCP Inc. refers to a fundamental set of institutional arrangements for managing and steering the Chinese economy. These arrangements are novel and different enough from previous ones to warrant a new label; this project proposes “CCP Inc.” The report has also shown that important changes in the CCP Inc. model have occurred in the past few years, following a consistent logic of strengthening the CCP’s direct control over state actors, diversifying available instruments of influence, and increasing indirect controls over private actors. Despite heightening the party’s capabilities, the changes have, on balance, increased the challenges faced by CCP Inc. decisionmakers and perhaps made the model less effective. There is more risk and less certainty or unity of purpose among the constituent actors of CCP Inc. Information flows about economic actions are less smooth and provide less useful information. There is an unusually high level of policy uncertainty in China today and an increased global (and local) backlash against its activities. These changes suggest that the CCP Inc. system will be less efficient and face more obstacles going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lower efficiency, however, is complemented by party leaders’ greater ambition. CCP Inc. has committed to an even more ambitious form of industrial policy and to achieving technological self-reliance. The way the Russian invasion of Ukraine has intensified the global East–West split has put new pressure on Chinese activities worldwide. This will undoubtedly have an enduring impact in Europe, destroying China’s peripheral strategy among Eastern and Central European states. Paradoxically, it will also intensify China’s global peripheral strategy because most developing countries have declined to join the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries in their effort to isolate Russia and will continue to be receptive to Chinese overtures. Presumably, China will seek to establish deeper and more intimate ties with a range of developing countries, going beyond its initial market penetration to establish more mature trading and investment relationships. This will require greater coordination among diplomats and development banks, areas that (paradoxically, as noted above) have not been strong in the past. The coming phases will provide new tests as well as new opportunities for CCP Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Xi Jinping continues to amplify rhetoric of national greatness — which he has used to support his selection to a third consecutive term as president — he is likely to resume assertive diplomacy and initiatives as the postCovid-19 world reduces barriers. Flexibility and adaptability are potential strengths of the CCP Inc. system, but it remains unclear whether policymakers have the will to roll back damaging, overassertive policies and then commit to the long-term, patient investment of policy resources required to reestablish lost credibility. It may be easier for them to simply continue to swing into direct command-and-control techniques — despite the damage to economic performance this implies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CCP Inc.’s challenge to the rules-based international order is undiminished. China seeks not only to maintain and expand the trade and investment flows tying it to the rest of the world, but also to ensure that those links incorporate more Chinese bargaining power and contribute to national security and economic interests. China seeks to be part of more bilateral relationships in which it has the upper hand and to participate in more production networks in which it controls the scarce links with prized technologies. This is a recipe for increased tension with many economic partners since it downplays the benefits of market-driven production networks, while security considerations spread to previously ordinary economic relationships. To make matters worse, there is every indication that China will defend these new concepts within the international organizations in which it plays an important role. CCP Inc. is constantly reformulating itself and adapting to changing internal and external demands. In turn, this steady self-reformulation reveals tensions and contradictions but also requires a deepened understanding of this formidable economic system.&lt;/p&gt;

The war has not diminished Russia’s core economic and security interests in the region, but it has had some impact on its military readiness there in the short term, especially in terms of ground capabilities, if not at sea or in the air. In addition, there are some preliminary indications that sanctions and export controls may diminish Russia’s ability to deploy precision munitions to the Arctic to a degree. At the same time, Russia’s use of hybrid tactics in the region seems to be increasing in both frequency and severity. The United States and NATO will need to take stock of these developments in a region they have not historically prioritized as they begin to implement their new, respective strategies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s unprovoked and brutal invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 disrupted the European security architecture and altered the risk calculus underpinning the foreign and security policies of its neighbors. This shift was also stark in the Arctic, which had for a long time been hailed by many as a highly cooperative and unusually peaceful part of international affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the Arctic Council ceased to function when its seven members other than Russia suspended participation in official meetings. This left the region without its main intergovernmental venue for cooperation. Next, in search of security, Finland and Sweden requested to join NATO. Furthermore, Russian “hybrid tactics” — to now possibly also include the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, as well as that of undersea cables in the Arctic and near-Arctic, among other activities — have raised the level of alarm in NATO members like Norway and nearby states. Finally, the increased security concerns are also seen in newly released policy documents, such as the U.S. Arctic Strategy. The first U.S. government-wide Arctic strategy since 2013, it states that Russia’s war in Ukraine has “raised geopolitical tensions in the Arctic” and created “new risks of unintended conflict,” a point that is also emphasized in the U.S. National Security Strategy (NSS). However, the Arctic has not been a top security priority for the United States or NATO in recent years, and there are weighty arguments that this might be a problem that needs addressing as tensions rise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s military interests in the Arctic are ostensibly defensive: to defend its second-strike, sea-based nuclear deterrent capability operating out of the Kola Peninsula; to defend the homeland; and to protect its regional economic endeavors, especially oil and gas megaprojects like the Yamal LNG and Vostok Oil ventures, and the Northern Sea Route (NSR), which Russia views ambitiously as a future global trade thoroughfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia also has offensive goals. First, it seeks to use the Arctic as a staging ground for power projection, especially into the North Atlantic Ocean via the Greenland-Iceland-UK (GIUK) Gap. Second, it may consider hybrid activities to intimidate or coerce European Arctic countries. Finally, in an unlikely — but not unthinkable — wider NATO-Russia conflict, having escalated to a war, one can imagine Moscow risking a limited incursion into Norway or Finland in a bid to protect its critical nuclear assets in the Kola Peninsula by creating greater defensive depth through, for example, the establishment of more western anti-access/area denial system systems at relatively easily defended sites west of its border. This scenario resembles Cold War-era fears. A perhaps more likely modern conflict scenario could involve long-range precision strikes of high-value assets like the Norwegian or future Finnish F-35s and the infrastructure needed to keep them flying. In addition, in accordance with basic military-strategic theory, one can also assume that command and control sites, radars, and important bases supporting key naval capabilities or anti-submarine warfare planes such as P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft would be attractive targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has not materially changed these Russian core interests. The need to protect the nuclear second-strike capability based out of the Kola Peninsula will be undiminished, and even heightened, in the likely event that Finland joins NATO. If and when this scenario plays out, critical military installations such as the Northern Fleet’s strategic submarine base at Gadzhiyevo will be less than 200 kilometers away from the border of a new NATO country. As a response, Russian defense minister Sergei Shoigu, after meeting with President Putin, stated in December that new military bases would be established: “Given NATO’s desire to build up military potential near the Russian borders, as well as to expand the North Atlantic Alliance at the expense of Finland and Sweden, retaliatory measures are required to create an appropriate grouping of troops in Northwest Russia.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, despite the diminishing European market for Russian Arctic fossil fuels — and the evaporation of foreign investment in such projects from sanctioning countries — there is little evidence Putin intends to reduce his economic ambitions in the region: an NSR development plan including roughly 1.8 trillion rubles in funding was approved in August 2022, and work continues on oil megaprojects. It is reasonable to assume Russia will maintain its regional military posture commensurately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper first reviews Russia’s prewar Arctic military assets before investigating which of these assets have been used and potentially lost in the invasion of Ukraine. Taking stock of these potential war damages, as well as the impact of sanctions on Russia’s defense industry, the third section assesses the relative attractiveness of hybrid tactics for Russia to assert itself in the Arctic. The fourth section analyzes some implications of these findings for NATO and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;command-and-unit-structures&quot;&gt;Command and Unit Structures&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Northern Fleet Joint Strategic Command is Russia’s Arctic military command and the core of its regional presence. The fleet’s area of responsibility includes the western and central Arctic. The Eastern Military District commander is responsible for the eastern Arctic, all the way to the Bering Strait. The fleet’s primary responsibilities are to defend and ensure beneficial operational conditions for Russia’s second-strike nuclear capability, as well as the homeland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Northern Fleet has five operational formations, each with several tactical units. Most are housed on the Kola Peninsula. These include three naval formations, the 45th Air and Air-Defense Forces Army (AADA), and the 14th Army Corps. The naval formations include the Northern Fleet’s Submarine Command and fleet, as well as the Kola Flotilla, which contains most naval assets intended for Arctic-specific use, including some main surface combatants. There is also the 61st Naval Infantry Brigade, which includes some reconnaissance forces among other assets, as well as special forces units in Polyarny. The 45th ADAA was formed in December 2015. Its precise tactical makeup is not publicly available, but reports indicate that it bears responsibility for anti-missile systems and distributed units on bases in the central Russian Arctic. The two main units of the 14th Army Corps are the 200th Motorized Rifle Brigade and the 80th Arctic Motor Rifle Brigade, in addition to other smaller subordinated units working on tasks like command and control, among other roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Northern Fleet also oversees the restoration of dozens of Soviet-era military installations that now dot the Russian Arctic, east of the Kola Peninsula. These installations vary in size and the degree to which they host troops and kinetic capabilities. Roughly, there are 3 major bases, around 13 airfields, 10 radar stations, 20 border outposts, and 10 emergency rescue stations. Finally, there are military assets that are not based in the Arctic but should be considered in the analysis. For example, two Russian airborne assault units are assigned to help protect the Kola Peninsula: the 76th Guards Air Assault Division and the 98th Guards Airborne Division. These divisions, as well as the 106th Guards Airborne Division, have trained for Arctic-specific missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;specific-capabilities&quot;&gt;Specific Capabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Submarines.&lt;/strong&gt; The Northern Fleet hosts eight of Russia’s ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) of the Delta IV and Borei classes. Their purpose is strategic: to maintain Russia’s retaliatory nuclear strike capability. The Delta IV submarines are each capable of carrying 16 SS-N-23 Sineva submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), as well as, reportedly, the SS-N-15 Starfish anti-submarine missile. The Borei submarines can carry 16 SS-N-32 Bulava SLBMs. The Northern Fleet is believed to have approximately 16 other active combat submarines, including six nuclear-powered attack submarines (SSNs) of the Akula, Victor III, and Sierra II classes, five nuclear-powered guided missile submarines (SSGNs) of the Severodvinsk and Oscar I/II classes, and five Kilo-class diesel submarines (SSKs). The upgraded Akula-class submarine will reportedly be armed with some variant of the Kalibr missile. The Sevorodvinsk submarines carry two variants of the Kalibr — both the land attack missile (SS-N-30) and the anti-ship variant (SS-N-27). The formidable submarine is also armed with the SS-N-26 Strobile anti-ship cruise missile, i.e. the P-800 Oniks. The Oscar II-class is armed with SS-N-19 Shipwreck and SS-N-16 Stallion anti-ship missiles. Victor III and Sierra II submarines are armed with the SS-N-21 Sampson cruise missile. One could also argue that the Northern Fleet has access to auxiliary submarines for noncombat functions, ostensibly including undersea research, but most likely also including covert tasks, even though these officially report to the Main Directorate of Deep-Sea Research. Not all submarines are made equal, of course — some are outdated and noisy, and some have limited combat potential. Overall, anti-submarine warfare experts consider Russia’s subsurface fleet to be formidable. The deployments of the Kalibr are especially notable: it is a long-range precision missile at the high end of Russian capabilities. It gives the Russian Navy the ability to hit distant targets — between 1,500 and 2,500 kilometers — from platforms that can be difficult to detect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surface Combatants.&lt;/strong&gt; As of 2019, the Northern Fleet officially had 37 surface vessels, including 10 operational large vessels and the Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier (the only one in The Russian Navy), although the latter was damaged in a pair of accidents a few years earlier and will likely not re-enter service before 2024. The Admiral Kuznetsov is armed with the SS-N-19 Shipwreck anti-ship missile and the SA-N-9 Gauntlet surface-to-air missile, among other systems. The fleet’s flagship vessel is the Kirov-class nuclear-powered missile cruiser Pyotr Velikiy. Kirov-class cruisers also use the Shipwreck and Gauntlet systems, as well as other surface-to-air missiles. A second Kirov-class cruiser has been under reconstruction since 1999; although The Russian Navy claims it will be back in service in 2023, work on this vessel has repeatedly been extended. There is a Slava-class guided missile destroyer (the Marshal Ustinov), which uses the SS-N-12 Sandbox anti-ship missile, as well as having surface-to-air missile systems. There are also two Gorshkov-class frigates, which are armed with both the land-attack and anti-ship variants of the Kalibr, as well as Oniks missiles, two Udaloy I/II-class anti-submarine warfare ships, and one Sovremenny-class destroyer that uses the SS-N-22 Sunburn anti-ship missile. The fleet has an estimated eight landing ships (Ropucha- and Ivan Gren-class). It also has two ice-class ships of its own and can call on 46 “civilian” icebreakers. It also has a small fleet of minesweepers. Finally, there are ice-reinforced auxiliary vessels, such as a logistics ship, a tanker, and two research vessels.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ground Capabilities.&lt;/strong&gt; Russia’s major ground capabilities are limited in the Arctic. According to a prewar study from the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), the three brigades had between them approximately 50 tanks, 450 armored personnel carriers, and an indeterminate number of “cross-country vehicles and multipurpose articulated tracker carriers,” as well as various artillery systems and some attack aviation capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Air Combat Capabilities.&lt;/strong&gt; According to RUSI, Russia has four major air units in the Arctic. At Severomorsk, there are two: the 279th Shipborne Fighter Regiment with approximately 24 Su-33 fighter jets and the 100th Shipborne Fighter Regiment with 24 MiG-29K fighters. At Monchegorsk, the 98th Mixed Air Regiment has an estimated 12 MIG-31BMs, 12 Su-24Ms, and an indeterminate number of Su-24MR reconnaissance crafts. Finally, there is an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) regiment at Severomorsk, as well as maritime patrol aircraft like the Il-38N and Tu-42. Before the war in Ukraine, there were also an estimated 30 bombers under the command of the Northern Fleet, many of which were housed at Olenya under the control of the 40th Mixed Aviation Regiment. In addition, there are occasionally Tu-95 and Tu-160 bombers forward deployed across the Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/2sqkrz2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image5&quot; /&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Missile Capabilities.&lt;/strong&gt; The distinction between defensive and offensive missile capabilities is not sharp in practice, and the below capabilities can be used for multiple ends. The Northern Fleet operates a “hardened, Arctic-capable, multilayered air defence and sea denial system,” which is part of the Bastion defense concept. In addition to the key air defense capabilities on the Kola Peninsula, including the S-400 system, there are three Arctic bases most critical to this concept: Nagurskoye, on Alexandra Land Island, Franz Josef Land; Temp base on the main New Siberian Island in the east; and Rogachevo base on Novaya Zemlya. Each has some combination of long-range S-300 and S-400 anti-air systems, medium-range P-800 Oniks anti-ship missiles, short-range Pantsir and Tor M2DT surface-to-air systems, and coastal defense K-300P Bastion-P and 4K51 Rubezh systems. In addition, the S-400 is deployed at Severodvinsk, and the S-300 system is deployed at Olengorsk on the Kola Peninsula and to the Tiksi air base in the eastern Russian Arctic. The latter system, it should be noted, has been reported as being used in a surface-to-surface offensive role in Ukraine. As the S-400 is a similar system, it may be similarly versatile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/xK6z2qQ.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image6&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the Northern Fleet reportedly “holds 20 percent of Russia’s precision strike capability in peacetime, and possesses the launch platforms of all its air-launched Kinzhal [hypersonic] ballistic missiles.” Kinzhal missiles have reportedly been fielded on bombers and MiG-31s. In addition, the Admiral Gorshkov frigate and Sevorodvinsk submarines have tested the hypersonic Tsirkon anti-ship missile in the Arctic at least eight times since fall 2020. Both the Sevorodvinsk- and Oscar II-class submarines are able to launch both the Tsirkon and the supersonic P-800 Oniks cruise missiles, making them “increasingly lethal at long ranges.” The fleet’s largest ammunition storage for submarine-launched ballistic missiles is at Okolnaya Bay on the Kola Peninsula. The result of all this is a dense missile defense network with offensive potential in the western Russian Arctic that becomes more open as one moves eastward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Domain Awareness.&lt;/strong&gt; Russia claims to have deployed its Rezonans-N radar system to bases on Novaya Zemlya, the Kanin Nos Peninsula, and at Indiga. These systems may be notable in that, according to some Russian sources, they can detect hypersonic missiles and stealth planes and possess supposedly advanced over-the-horizon capabilities. It is not clear, however, if the indication and warning they can provide against stealth aircraft can come early enough to ensure interception. There is reportedly also a “dual-use air-surveillance radar station” on Graham Bell Island. Sopka-2 radar systems are deployed at the Temp, Nagurskoye, and Rogachevo air bases. Finally, Russia has some space-based intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities pertaining to the Arctic, including Meridian-M communications satellites and an Arktika-M weather satellite for navigation support.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electronic Warfare.&lt;/strong&gt; Russia reportedly maintains electronic, or electromagnetic, warfare centers at Severomorsk, Kamchatka, and Primorsky Krai. Analysts note that the systems likely deployed to centers such as these could facilitate anti-submarine warfare and interfere with maritime communications. Russia’s doctrine emphasizes electronic warfare. It may be used to jam Western communications, radars, and datalinks for one of several purposes: to confuse an adversary, to blind them, and/or to lengthen or interrupt adversary decisionmaking processes and kill chains. If used well, this can provide a battlefield advantage. This capability can also be used maliciously in peacetime, as Section Two describes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;section-two-impact-of-the-war-on-russias-conventional-capacity&quot;&gt;Section Two: Impact of the War on Russia’s Conventional Capacity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;direct-impact-of-the-war&quot;&gt;Direct Impact of the War&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Establishing credible unclassified reports of destroyed Russian assets or decimated units is challenging, but a few assertions can be made. First, relatively early in the war, some Northern Fleet naval assets were sent to the Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea, or Ukraine itself, including the Marshal Ustinov — which is now one of only two remaining Slava-class cruisers after the sinking of the Moskva in April — and three large landing ships. Second, the three large landing ships carry an estimated 30 tanks and 1,000 troops between them but, even though they took off from a Northern Fleet port originally, they made a port call in Kaliningrad before sailing south to the Black Sea. It is therefore highly likely that some assets the ships were transporting were not from the Northern Fleet. Third, no Northern Fleet warships or submarines have been reported destroyed in the conflict. The Marshal Ustinov left the region during the summer, and at least one of the landing ships has been seen in the Arctic as recently as September. Fourth, there are no credible reports that any of the Northern Fleet air combat capabilities identified above have been destroyed in the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifth, and most notably, there are reports that several Russian Arctic units have been deteriorated, especially ground forces. The 200th Motorized Rifle Brigade and 61st Independent Naval Brigade have been involved in the fighting in Ukraine, as has the 80th Arctic Motor Rifle Brigade and the 76th Guards Air Assault Division. What is more, there is reason to believe one battalion tactical group of the 200th has been not only involved in the fighting but effectively wiped out: an adviser to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky asserted in March that 645 of the group’s 648 soldiers had been killed. Eighteen of the tanks confirmed to be destroyed in Ukraine are T-80BVMs, a type that the 200th had at its disposal. Finally, a Northern Fleet unit of marines that reportedly “trained for reconnaissance and sabotage operations behind enemy lines,” the Special Underwater Forces unit 69068, may have been effectively eliminated. However, as the war goes on, credible independent verification of the war losses is difficult to obtain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;impact-of-sanctions&quot;&gt;Impact of Sanctions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to direct attrition due to the war, it may be useful to consider the impact of sanctions and export controls on the Russian economy and defense industry, both with respect to forthcoming capabilities destined for the Northern Fleet and to advanced systems in the Arctic that depend on foreign technology and may be in demand for Russia’s war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the first question, there is a sizeable list of assets that the Northern Fleet is supposed to receive in the coming years. Another Borei-class SSBN is due to join the fleet, as are the following submarines: three Akula SSNs undergoing refits to, it is believed, give them the ability to launch Kalibr cruise missiles; three more Severodvinsk SSGNs; and an indeterminate number of next-generation Lada-class SSKs. The ambitious Lider-class destroyer project had intended to build eight of these advanced vessels, which would have been split between the Northern and Pacific Fleets. Even before the recent round of sanctions, the project was beset by difficulties and a reported lack of funding. Its current status is not clear based on public information. As noted earlier, the Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier is currently undergoing repairs. A second diesel-electric icebreaker may be forthcoming for the navy, as well as one new Arctic patrol icebreaker. Two more Rezonans-N complexes are expected to be constructed by the end of the year. Russia also intends to launch three more Arktika-M satellites by 2025 and has claimed that two early-warning Voronezh systems will be operational by the end of 2022. Finally, it has been speculated that Russia’s long-rumored, nuclear-enabled, autonomous torpedo drone, the Poseidon, could be based on the Kola Peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall state of the Russian economy and the impact of sanctions may affect its ability to field these and other capabilities on schedule. Sanctions have already significantly impacted the Russian economy. Some analysts predict it will not return to prewar levels until the end of the decade, and the threat of secondary sanctions will only increase over time. Some sectors have been significantly affected and, as of June 2022, imports from sanctioning countries had “collapsed by 50 percent or more in comparison” to the same period in 2021. Russia has already fallen into a recession. At the same time, there are signs of resilience. Russia has shown some ability to source goods from some non-sanctioning countries, and India and China have increased oil purchases, compensating so far for the loss of the EU market. Furthermore, the Russian defense sector is relatively less dependent on imports than those of other countries. Moscow is willing to prop up the sector and divert funding to it at the expense of others, such as healthcare or education. Experts have estimated that defense spending in the first seven months of 2022 exceeded the same period in 2021 by about $20 billion, and the defense procurement budget may have increased by roughly 45 percent over the past year. Overall, there is some consensus among experts that the Russian defense industry will still be able to produce less sophisticated weapons systems, but that high-tech capabilities will be an issue, both because of export controls and because of brain drain. Despite attempts to increase its self-sufficiency in the last eight years, Russia has relied on foreign technology in its defense, especially when it comes to high-end computer chips. For example, as of June, Russia’s main armored vehicle manufacturer had ceased tank production for lack of foreign parts; tank variants like the T-90 rely on Western electronics. Even parts of Russia’s military tactical communications system reportedly depend on Western components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few specific findings are relevant to the Arctic theater. First, Ukrainian forces found five U.S.-made chips in a captured defense Pantsir air defense system, which has been deployed to the major bases on Alexandra Land Island, the New Siberian Islands, and Novaya Zemlya, as well as on the Kola Peninsula; it was intended for use to support the 80th Arctic Motor Rifle Brigade. Second, some precision-guided munitions also depend on Western components, including the Kalibr, Iskander-M, Kh-101, and 9M727 cruise missiles, as well as the 9M549 guided artillery rocket. The Kalibr is used — or intended for use — by the Northern Fleet’s Gorshkov frigates, Severodvinsk SSGNs, and Akula-class SSBNs, and was intended to be used by the Lider-class destroyers as well, if that project ever comes to fruition. As of September, Ukrainian intelligence estimated Russia had used 55 percent of its stockpile of guided missiles, though these are dated numbers associated with very high uncertainty. The Ukrainians similarly assessed that Russia was down to only four dozen hypersonic missiles. Russia has in recent years often tested such missiles in the Arctic theater. It also had plans to deploy some, such as the Kinzhal missile, to the region. Without advanced and imported chips, Russia may not be able to fully build these stocks back up — though recent reporting from the New York Times indicates that the country may have some resilience in this regard. Nonetheless, given the likely shortfall at present, there may be a competition between missile needs in the Arctic and in other theaters like Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize, Russia’s conventional land forces in the Kola Peninsula, including naval infantry and possibly special forces, are today depleted and substantially weakened. Russia’s ability to successfully conduct a rapid conventional ground incursion toward its western neighbors in the Arctic is in the short term even more minimal than before the war. Its ability to do so in the medium and long term will depend on its ability to recruit new conscripts and train them for Arctic operations. There is also reason to think that the same issues relating to “low morale, poor execution of combined arms, subpar training, deficient logistics, [and] corruption” may bedevil Russian forces in the Arctic, as they have in Ukraine — though one should not underestimate Russia’s potential to learn from its failures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the toll from the Ukraine war is not necessarily reflected in the other service branches in the Russian Arctic. The naval components of Russia’s Northern Fleet, particularly its strategic submarine fleet, continue to give Moscow a credible second-strike capability. One can also assume the same situation to be the case for Russia’s strategic air force, as well as intelligence collection capabilities, special purpose ships and submarines, and other parts of the Kremlin’s nonconventional power-projecting apparatus. As such, Russia’s ability to threaten the West in the Arctic with naval and air assets in the short term has been affected less. Its ability to do so in the medium to long term will depend on how sanctions impact its defense industry: given the assets the Northern Fleet was due to receive that are in varying stages of development or construction, it may be supposed that the fleet will be somewhat less formidable in 5–10 years than it might otherwise have been if sanctions had never been imposed. One potential weakness is that precision munitions will be harder to come by for the entire Russian armed forces, to include some Arctic capabilities. This may make certain offensive measures against Arctic NATO allies less attractive, such as the scenario discussed in section one, wherein Russia may consider, in the early stages of a wider NATO-Russia conflict, using such munitions to strike at key targets inside of Norway, Finland, or Sweden. Russia’s Arctic air defense capacity is hardly affected at all, except to the extent that the Pantsir system will become more difficult to replace. While Russia has other advanced air defense systems in the region, such as the S-300 and S-400, those are intended for long-range protection; the Pantsir is used for short-range base defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;section-three-hybrid-threats-in-the-arctic&quot;&gt;Section Three: Hybrid Threats in the Arctic&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the conventional thus accounted for, it must be further noted that other capacities, such as Russia’s propaganda machine and “hybrid” tools of influence, also continue to work at full steam. Observations from NATO’s northern flank suggest that campaigns where hybrid instruments play a role might be on the rise in Russia’s northern neighborhood. However, as the term “hybrid” often lacks a clear definition, this conceptual aspect needs to be addressed before laying out some empirical observations of Russia’s increasing use of a hybrid playbook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hybrid warfare” is a problematic term to define in a scientifically satisfactory way. It is often used interchangeably with “hybrid threats” or “hybrid influence,” essentially being expressions for composite hostile activities in what has been described as the “gray” or “blurred zone” between peace and war. While it is hard to settle on a precise, commonly accepted definition, the connotation is nonetheless frequently used by policymakers, military experts, or in media when describing “gray zone events,” or threats, that do not fit the traditional dichotomy of peace and war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on the Multinational Capability Development Campaign’s “Countering Hybrid warfare” project, in this publication we apply the term hybrid warfare to mean “the synchronized use of multiple instruments of power tailored to specific vulnerabilities across the full spectrum of societal functions to achieve synergistic effects.” These instruments of power are also designed to be under the threshold of what is viewed as an act of war, hence not triggering an Article 5 response from NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When scrutinizing recent events in the northern parts of NATO’s area of responsibility, Norway stands out as a country where multiple hybrid threats seem to have been observed recently. During fall 2022, numerous unidentified drones have flown over or around important parts of Norwegian communication infrastructure, airports, or military facilities. In addition to these installations, large drones have also overflown oil and gas facilities, such as Kårstø, a crucial facility for processing and transporting gas out of Norway. The flying of drones also included illegal photographing on Svalbard, the remote Norwegian archipelago between the North Pole and the northernmost tip of mainland Norway. Suspicious activity also led to the arrest of no less than seven Russian citizens in a short amount of time in fall 2022 for illegal photographing across the country. At about the same time, the Norwegian Police Security Service arrested and charged an illegal Russian spy who was working under a fake identity as a researcher at University of Tromsø, Northern Norway. Of other earlier suspicious activities that have been reported by media, the Russian Orthodox Church’s friendship visit from the Russian border city of Severomorsk to Kirkenes deserves to be mentioned. As the priests arrived on the visit, they displayed an unusual interest in studying the Kirkenes’ water supply. However, the desired on-site study trip was canceled by the mayor of Kirkenes after discreet advice from the Chief of Police in Finnmark. Similarly, substantial parts of eastern Finnmark in northern Norway have for several years been affected by the jamming of GPS signals. This electronic interference originates from Russia and is affecting various nonmilitary activities in Finnmark, such as civilian aviation. As of today, Norwegian Aviation Authorities report that “the jamming from Russia is more frequent than ever before.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/7CKVhg9.png&quot; alt=&quot;image8&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3: Pipelines on the Norwegian Continental Shelf.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: “Oil Pipelines on the Norwegian Continental Shelf,” Norwegian Petroleum Directorate, September 9, 2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the aftermath of the sabotage of the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines in the Baltic sea, Norway’s gas pipelines to Europe have been recognized as a “prime target for sabotage.” This realization comes after years of reporting on consistent suspicious Russian activities in the Norwegian littorals, where key ports and subsurface cables and pipelines have drawn a lot of interest from Russian “research” or fishing vessels. Worrying reports, such as the cutting of a subsurface fiber-optic cable stretching from mainland Norway to Svalbard, as well as the damage of fiber-optic submarine cables near the Faroe and Shetland Islands, point to a pattern fitting the traits of hybrid warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given Russia’s conventionally weakened capacity in the Arctic, and the high tensions between Russia and the West, it is reasonable that such hybrid campaigns might turn out to be the preferred Russian tool to target communities in its Arctic neighborhood in the future, at least for the short and medium term. While it is debated what the true intention of the abovementioned campaigns might be, the actual mapping of potential targets is one hypothesis, while other likely intentions might simply be the desire to create uncertainty and fear in the population or to signal Russian dissatisfaction with Western policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;section-four-implications-for-nato-and-the-united-states&quot;&gt;Section Four: Implications for NATO and the United States&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Russia’s capacity to project power into the North Atlantic Ocean from the Arctic seems unchanged. This was the only threat pertaining to the Arctic, or High North, that NATO allies agreed to put in the new 2022 Strategic Concept, and so it is especially notable. It was not specifically discussed in the U.S. Arctic strategy, but it is the United States, along with Canada, whose naval assets would need to cross the North Atlantic Ocean to reinforce European allies in an Article 5 contingent. Allied plans to invest in surveillance capabilities, especially radars in the area of the GIUK gap, will help mitigate this challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Russia’s relative incapacity to threaten a conventional military land incursion into European Arctic allies will be welcome news to the Biden administration, whose recent strategic documents do not indicate a high prioritization of the region in terms of defense. Most notably, the NSS lists the Arctic last in its overview of regional policies. The strategy is cautious about promising U.S. presence in the Arctic, saying it will only be exercised “as required, while reducing risk and preventing unnecessary escalation.” The U.S. National Defense Strategy mentions the Arctic fleetingly and is also cautious: “U.S. activities and posture in the Arctic should be calibrated, as the Department preserves its focus on the Indo-Pacific region.” Its emphasis is on stability, homeland defense, and maritime domain awareness, and there is no language in the Arctic section about deterring threats to Arctic allies and partners. This language does appear in the U.S. Arctic strategy, which states, “We will deter threats to the U.S. homeland and our allies by enhancing the capabilities required to defend our interests in the Arctic.” The document promises needed investments in domain awareness capabilities and icebreakers. Still, it also emphasizes avoiding escalation and notably states that it “may be possible to resume cooperation under certain conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the three documents seem to indicate an administration that will take regional threats in the Arctic seriously and will likely continue to show occasional presence and participate in exercises, but that will prefer cautious actions so as not to threaten the relative stability of the region. Doing so allows the administration to focus on other geopolitical priorities, like China, and not excessively complicate other regional priorities like climate change research and economic development. One finding from this paper that may therefore be of interest is that there are indirect, light-touch ways to enhance Arctic security: effective imposition of the sanctions regime concerning dual-use computer chips seems to be one way to diminish the conventional Russian threat in the Arctic that does not involve deploying U.S. military assets or personnel to the region. If the administration is seeking to balance the need to protect allies and partners with a desire to not overly militarize the region, this could be notable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, given the state of Russia’s conventional armed forces, Russian aggression toward Arctic European states may continue to lean heavily on hybrid tools. There have been encouraging signs of a Western response to this, such as Norway’s deployment of the Home Guard to protect critical infrastructure, and NATO allies’ assistance to help them do so via increased allied ship patrols in the North Sea. Norway also recently adopted its annual Flotex naval exercise to include a component focused on protecting oil and gas installations. Even the U.S. Arctic strategy recognizes the challenge, promising to focus on “building the resilience of critical infrastructure,” including against cyberattacks. This is a welcome recognition from the Biden administration of Russia’s penchant for using hybrid tactics in the High North — however, the administration may not yet have fully recognized that this tool is likely becoming more attractive to Russia in the Arctic, relative to conventional force. NATO allies like Norway, and future members like Sweden and Finland, may need to further impress this probability on the United States and other allies at the NATO level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it is probably too early to give an accurate and comprehensive estimate of the future Russian warfighting capability in the Arctic, given the impact of the Ukraine war. It would be prudent, however, given what is known and what is coming to light, to revisit assumptions that guided prewar analysis, campaign modeling, and wargaming concerning the region. Indeed, U.S. military doctrine is explicit that assumptions should be constantly reconsidered in light of new information, and NATO doctrine echoes this. As NATO’s new Supreme Allied Commander Europe starts crafting the alliance’s new regional defense plans, there is an opportunity to consider some of these preliminary findings in High North scenarios. In the meantime, the old saying, sometimes attributed to Winston Churchill, that “Russia is never as strong as she looks; Russia is never as weak as she looks,” might be a prudent approach for the West with respect to its security and defense planning in the Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;

As demonstrated by the case of Argentina, these close ties can benefit Chinese party-state actors going overseas by providing material state support — but can also become a liability by engendering skepticism among host countries and potential business partners over Chinese firms’ motivations. To explore these elements of the CCP Inc. ecosystem, this report examines two recent projects in China-Argentina space collaboration: first, the construction of China’s first international deep space ground station, and second, the dynamics of Chinese business collaboration with Argentine satellite technology start-up Satellogic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does China’s expanding space sector reveal about the country’s state capitalist economic system? This case study examines the CCP Inc. ecosystem of Chinese regulators, state-owned and private financiers, technology companies, and military entities key to becoming what Chinese leader Xi Jinping has termed a “great space power” (航天强国). China’s ambitions include developing world-leading space technology and systems, pursuing deep space exploration, and shaping the norms of global space governance. Toward these goals, China continues to enhance bilateral and multilateral cooperation with a growing number of countries. This case study examines how the complex ecosystem of Chinese party-state actors serves — and sometimes limits — Beijing’s space ambitions by investigating Chinese commercial and state-backed investments in Argentina’s space sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s broader state capitalist system has evolved since Xi Jinping assumed power in 2012. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) extended its control over both China’s private sector and state-owned enterprises (SOEs), while SOEs merged and consolidated into bigger entities with more expansive networks of subsidiaries, as part of an initiative to improve efficiency. State investment has taken on increased importance as a method for steering Chinese companies toward the pursuit of strategic objectives. These developments have created a complex ecosystem in which state-owned and private-owned Chinese companies are subject to state and party influence via an array of financial, ownership, and personnel conduits — but are still able and encouraged to pursue commercial aims within the bounds of the CCP’s strategic interests. This new paradigm of Chinese state capitalism is known as the “CCP Inc.” system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Globally, CCP Inc. benefits Chinese companies; rather than go it alone, Chinese companies enter new markets and projects as part of an ecosystem of government and commercial entities in pursuit of common economic goals. Yet CCP Inc. can also be a liability for Chinese firms, engendering skepticism overseas about their motivations; close connections with CCP and state actors make it difficult for individual Chinese firms to distance themselves fully from broader party-state aims when approaching potential partners abroad. The effectiveness of CCP Inc. varies substantially by country and industry, depending on China’s diplomatic relationships with the target state and the degree of CCP control over the sector in question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This case study explores how CCP Inc. has enabled China’s space sector to grow its international footprint through key projects in Argentina. From the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System to successful explorations on the far side of the moon and a mission to Mars, China’s national space capabilities have improved dramatically in the past three decades. Along with eye-catching interplanetary missions, China’s space sector recently underwent a less publicized structural transformation. In 2014, China opened the sector to private investment, expanding the role of commercial actors in the country’s space program. However, as this case study shows, the core of the sector remains closely linked to state agencies, SOEs, and military organizations — even more so than other industries examined in this series of CCP Inc. case studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s space cooperation with Argentina illustrates how state, military, and commercial entities have broadened the overseas footprint of China’s space sector. Space cooperation between China and Argentina began through diplomatic channels. In the early 2010s, amid deepening bilateral relations, Argentina agreed to host China’s first international deep space ground station: the Estación de Espacio Lejano (Spanish for “deep space station,” referred to in this report as the “Espacio Lejano Station”), which was constructed by Chinese SOEs that had track records of working on People’s Liberation Army (PLA) contracts and is now managed by a Chinese military-linked state entity. As commercialization of the Chinese space sector has grown, commercial deals by private Chinese companies have also become an increasingly important part of China-Argentina space cooperation, particularly through deals focused on satellite technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This case study proceeds in three parts. Chapter 1 provides a brief introduction to China’s space sector and China-Argentina space cooperation. Chaper 2 examines the development of the Espacio Lejano Station, which remains a source of controversy within Argentina and internationally due to its links to the PLA. Finally, Chapter 3 explores the role of Chinese commercial space engagement in Argentina through examination of deals between Chinese companies and Argentine satellite imagery start-up Satellogic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinas-space-program-and-china-argentina-space-cooperation&quot;&gt;China’s Space Program and China-Argentina Space Cooperation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to the more established industrial sectors examined in previous CCP Inc. case studies on mining, financial services, energy, and telecommunications, China’s space industry is relatively new and quickly evolving. It is also tightly interwoven with government and military bodies to a degree unparalleled by market economies, even those with substantial state involvement in the space sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand this deep integration, one need only look at the composition of China’s space sector today, which consists of three primary groups of actors (see Figure 1): the state-owned “national team” of government agencies and major SOEs; entities linked to the PLA; and — since 2014, when deregulation opened the door for private investments — a burgeoning set of commercial actors who are interlinked with the other two groups. As a window into CCP Inc., the evolution of China’s space industry over the past decade demonstrates how China’s state capitalism can simultaneously open more opportunities for commercial development while maintaining tight state control over private sector involvement in a strategic industry. The important role of the PLA in this sector also impacts how international companies and governments engage with China’s space industry, as demonstrated by the projects in Argentina detailed in the second and third sections of this report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/sAe29Bk.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Three Overlapping Actors in China’s Space Sector: State, Commercial, and Military.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ research based on multiple sources cited throughout this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “national team” of China’s space industry is the well-established core of the national space program, compared to the country’s relatively new commercial space sector. It consists of government agencies, central SOEs, and hundreds of SOE subsidiaries. Two state agencies, the State Administration for Science, Technology, and Industry for National Defense (SASTIND) and the China National Space Administration (CNSA), oversee China’s space industry as civilian administrators, while the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) plays a key role in aerospace research and technology development. Marc Julienne, head of China research at the French Institute of International Relations, has described SASTIND as the “nerve center” for the country’s space program; as the name suggests, the organization is focused on defense. According to China’s State Council, it was established to serve “the needs of national defense, military forces, national economy, and military-related organizations,” in addition to the “coordination of communications and cooperation on the use of nuclear power and space activities with countries and international organizations.” Under the purview of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Council (SASAC), two SOEs — China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) and China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC), each with hundreds of subsidiaries — form the core of the government’s aerospace research and development (R&amp;amp;D) and defense sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2014, Chinese regulators lifted numerous restrictions on private investment in the space sector, resulting in a growing number of start-ups and new, mixed-ownership SOE subsidiaries with private investors, which together comprise China’s commercial space sector. At the time, the State Council released a statement commonly referred to as “Document 60,” which encouraged “private capital to participate in the construction of national civil space infrastructure” such as satellite launch and operations, as well as ground systems. Later, the State Council’s 2016 white paper on space highlighted efforts “to increase the level of commercialization of the space industry” by encouraging the participation of “nongovernmental capital and other social sectors” in space-related activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with this government backing for commercialization, new players joined a preexisting ecosystem of government and military-linked entities. According to the white paper, “commercialization” does not require that funding come solely from nongovernment actors — rather, “commercial” entities can be funded by both government and nongovernment actors. Some analysts estimate that the number of commercial space sector companies is over 200 but note that this figure would vary based on how broadly “commercial” is defined. Commercial companies often share close institutional and personnel connections with the “national team.” For example, a 2019 study by the Institute for Defense Analyses found that many founders and executives of Chinese start-ups in the field were previously affiliated with CAS or with the major SOEs in the aerospace sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The military plays a direct role in China’s space program through the PLA Strategic Support Force (PLASSF), which assumed responsibility for space activities after its creation in 2015. A product of China’s military reorganization that year, the PLASSF was tasked with integrating the space domain more closely into China’s military operations. According to analysts of China’s space industry, the PLA — via the Strategic Support Force — works closely with SASTIND to coordinate R&amp;amp;D and manufacturing to support China’s space activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-growing-space-presence-goals-and-strategy&quot;&gt;China’s Growing Space Presence: Goals and Strategy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese leadership has specified national space goals in authoritative documents: quinquennial State Council white papers on space; publications by top state agencies such as SASTIND and the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC); and the national Five-Year Plan, a development agenda passed every five years by China’s legislative body, the National People’s Congress. The State Council’s most recent space strategy white paper, published in January 2022, emphasizes China’s continued goal to “strengthen its space presence in an all-round manner” in order to boost self-reliance in science and technology, secure its role in space governance, and enhance its national security (among other objectives). Internationally, the space sector features in China’s flagship Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) through the Spatial Information Corridor, an initiative designed to provide comprehensive spatial information services (such as BeiDou satellite navigation) for countries along the BRI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2015, China’s defense white paper officially elevated space to a military domain. The paper argued that “outer space has become a commanding height in international strategic competition” now that the “first signs of weaponization of outer space have appeared.” These publications affirm that Chinese leaders view space as a pivotal playing field in geopolitical competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese leadership encourages the array of state-owned, military-linked, and commercial actors in China’s space industry to support the state’s space goals. For example, Document 60 (which allowed for private capital in China’s space sector) promotes investment in specific space technologies such as satellites, remote-sensing data, and ground stations, specifying key areas that commercial actors are expected to support. While many countries have military aims in space, as the U.S. Space Force demonstrates, defense analysts characterize China’s military as more actively involved in the national space sector compared even to that of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the state actively encourages cooperation between the military and civilian pillars of China’s space industry. A prominent aspect of China’s ational defense and military strategy is its pursuit of military-civil fusion (MCF), which involves “infrastructure and resource sharing” and “joint innovation of military and civilian science and technology,” as Xi stated in a 2018 meeting of the Military-Civil Fusion Development Committee. China’s 14th Five-Year Plan, published in 2021, emphasizes the need to deepen military-civil cooperation in space in the context of national aerospace technology development. In 2018, SASTIND outlined the requirements to apply for projects with the organization, specifying that applications should “strengthen civilian-military coordination on relevant scientific research plans [民口、军队有关科研计划的协调], [and] make proper links with defense industry scientific research projects already implemented.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese government’s broader efforts to promote and enhance dual-use technologies aim to encourage innovation and investment that supports both China’s economic goals and military development. While companies are not legally required to support these MCF goals for space, MCF still plays a key role in China’s space strategy and commercial space development because the state incentivizes companies to develop new technologies that support China’s military abilities in space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s space white papers also make clear that its leaders see the sector as a source of innovation in the country’s technology economy and view China’s growing space presence as a way to “promote high-quality economic and social development.” For example, these white papers have repeatedly stated that China aims to promote the application of its satellites and space technology in order to “serve national security and national economic and social development.” These goals contributed to decisions to allow commercial space ventures, boosting the sector’s rapid growth in recent years. Since 2014, new satellite and rocket companies have emerged with greater frequency, generating high-value jobs and enabling China to make inroads into overseas markets for Chinese space technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By allowing private investment in China’s space sector, Chinese authorities have claimed a bigger stake in the fast-growing global commercial space economy. According to measurements by the Space Foundation, the global space economy had grown to a value of $469 billion by mid-2022, primarily due to increasing revenue in the commercial space sector. This marked a 54 percent growth in industry value over the past decade. While the United States is still by far the largest government spender on its space industry, China is now beginning to lead in other metrics, such as number of orbital launches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To extend the reach of its space technology and tap into the growing global space economy, China has pursued global partnerships while building up its domestic space industry — which, in turn, informs understanding of China’s international space engagement. The remainder of this case study dives into China’s space engagement with Argentina, where close diplomatic ties and opportune financial circumstances facilitated frequent collaboration on both commercial and state-linked projects. The mix of state, military, and commercial entities characteristic of China’s domestic space industry is reflected in Argentina, where official diplomatic engagement and PLA actors played central roles in creating space industry ties, followed by commercial deals to deepen space cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;two-decades-of-steadily-deepening-china-argentina-relations&quot;&gt;Two Decades of Steadily Deepening China-Argentina Relations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argentina’s diplomatic and economic relationship with China has deepened significantly over the past two decades. China has become one of Argentina’s major creditors, offering a source of investment during Argentina’s perennial financing challenges. According to the Inter-American Dialogue lending database, China’s policy banks have lent $17 billion for infrastructure development projects in the country since 2007 — more than China has lent to any other Latin American nation — and commercial banks have entered into 36 agreements in the country. Though China’s overseas spending and lending dropped off during the Covid-19 pandemic, in 2022 China pledged support for Argentina to join the BRICS bloc of emerging market powers (made up of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa), indicating both a continued appreciation for Argentina’s economic importance and a geopolitical interest in expanding the bloc’s footprint in the Western Hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A steady trend of friendly relations across different Argentine and Chinese administrations deepened government-to-government ties throughout the past two decades. Current and former presidents Alberto Fernández (2019–present), Mauricio Macri (2015–19), and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (2007–15) desired varying degrees of closeness to China, but ultimately each advanced the bilateral relationship during their terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/dfamsgH.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;President Xi has enjoyed friendly relations with the past three Argentine governments, led by Alberto Fernández (left), Mauricio Macri (center), and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (right).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This strong diplomatic relationship created a foundation for Chinese investment in and cooperation with Argentina across a variety of industries, including mining, agriculture, telecommunications, and energy. In addition to these more traditional areas for Chinese investment, space has become an important component of bilateral ties. Over the past two decades, the two countries signed multiple space cooperation frameworks, China offered technical and financial support for Argentine satellites, and — most critically — Argentina granted China land to construct its first deep space ground station on foreign soil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;china-argentina-space-cooperation&quot;&gt;China-Argentina Space Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s efforts to strengthen international space cooperation with Argentina can be traced back to the early 2000s. In 2004, Chinese president Hu Jintao and Argentine president Néstor Kirchner (the husband of later president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner) signed a joint agreement on the “Cooperation of Peaceful Utilization of Outer Space Technology” during Hu’s visit to Argentina. During this trip, Hu also visited a space satellite manufacturing company, Investigación Aplicada S.E (INVAP), which was responsible for creating and launching satellites for Argentina’s newly formed national telecommunications company, Empresa Argentina de Soluciones Satelitales Sociedad Anónima AR-SAT (ARSAT). In 2005, China offered to sell Argentina a full satellite-launching system at a great discount in exchange for ARSAT stock — a deal that, if it had gone through, would have created a Chinese ownership stake in the state telecommunications company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/HkrWPuH.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Argentine president Néstor Kirchner and Chinese president Hu Jintao during Hu’s 2004 visit to Argentina.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While INVAP ultimately chose a different contractor and ARSAT remained Argentine-owned, China’s engagement in Argentina’s space sector broadened and deepened in the years after Hu’s visit. Both state- and privately owned Chinese firms have supported Argentine satellite development through financing and technology provision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since those initial steps toward space cooperation, China and Argentina have worked together on multiple space projects led by a combination of state, military, and commercial actors. Notable ongoing projects include the China-Argentina Radio Telescope (CART) in Argentina’s San Juan Province and the recently announced partnership between Argentine satellite manufacturer Ascentio Technologies S.A. (Ascentio) and Chinese commercial space firm Emposat (航天驭星, previously known as Satelliteherd) to develop a ground station. The CART is an example of international engagement led by the national team of China’s space sector; the project was officially approved by China’s Ministry of Science and Technology as one of the country’s major international collaborative science projects in 2010, with the Argentine provincial government of San Juan administering its construction. The Ascentio-Emposat deal, on the other hand, demonstrates how the commercial wing of China’s space industry drives growth in international engagement while still working closely with the national team. Emposat, a private company founded in 2016, frequently partners with Chinese government- and PLA-affiliated organizations such as CAS and SOEs such as CASC to pursue projects abroad. In addition to a new partnership with Argentina’s Ascentio, Emposat has contributed to the construction of ground stations across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with the proliferation of China-Argentina space industry business deals and infrastructure projects, the current state of space ties is outlined in official agreements between the two nations. Under the current administration of President Fernández, China and Argentina frequently include deepening space cooperation as an important part of the overall bilateral relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most notable achievement of China-Argentina space engagement is the construction of a PLA-run deep space ground station in Argentina’s Neuquén Province. Both the unique position of the Espacio Lejano Station in China’s space strategy and the group of CCP Inc. actors responsible for its construction merit a closer look. The following chapter examines in detail the circumstances behind the space station agreement and how different Chinese actors worked together to construct and run the secretive site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinas-first-international-deep-space-ground-station&quot;&gt;China’s First International Deep Space Ground Station&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s ambition to become a “great space power” involves expanding its “deep space network” (深空网路), a series of large radio dishes that provide a better understanding of deep space; more frequent telemetry, tracking, and command (TT&amp;amp;C) capabilities; reliable communication with launched satellites; and more precise navigation. Deep space ground stations are thus critical to realizing Beijing’s goals of furthering lunar and planetary exploration and increasing TT&amp;amp;C coverage. Operation of ground stations and satellite TT&amp;amp;C functions fall under the purview of the PLASSF Space Systems Department, the military organization responsible for the bulk of the PLA’s space operations, including control over the four satellite launching sites and three TT&amp;amp;C sites that provide the infrastructure for China’s growing ambitions in space. In 2020, China launched more satellites into space than any other country, and it completed more than 60 orbital launches in 2022 alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;background-on-ttc-deep-space-ground-stations-and-cltc&quot;&gt;Background on TT&amp;amp;C, Deep Space Ground Stations, and CLTC&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;TT&amp;amp;C systems facilitate communication between satellites and ground stations by downlinking transport data from a satellite — such as its location and overall performance — and allowing ground stations to give commands to satellites. The frequency of communication with satellites depends on the number and placement of ground stations, since connections can only be established when the satellite or space object is within range (or view) of the ground station. As a deep space ground station, the Espacio Lejano Station also allows China to have more frequent communication with and access to deep space objects, which have longer orbital periods and come into view less frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Established in 1986, China Satellite Launch and Tracking Control General (CLTC, 中国卫星发射测控系统部) is the main organization in charge of China’s TT&amp;amp;C and space launch sectors. Verifying the chain of command above CLTC is not simple; examining public corporate registration documents, external analytical accounts, and CLTC’s subsidiary structure produces an uncertain picture. Online company registry databases show CLTC registered as a company wholly owned by the Commission for Science, Technology, and Industry for National Defense (COSTIND, 国防科工委), a civilian ministry of the State Council that was discontinued in 2008 and succeeded by SASTIND. That ownership structure would make CLTC a civilian body, but other indicators suggest that it is in fact a subordinate body of the PLASSF’s Space Systems Department. China’s satellite launch centers fall under the jurisdiction of the PLASSF’s Space Systems Department and are also subordinate to CLTC. Additionally, CLTC’s current and past leadership has included members of the PLASSF, with the same individual serving simultaneously as the chief of staff of the PLA General Armaments Department and the chairman of CLTC. Overseas space companies have, at times, stopped working with CLTC in preference for commercial TT&amp;amp;C companies due to CLTC’s ties to the PLA. As this evidence suggests, CLTC is intimately involved with both China’s civilian space program and the PLA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China currently has three deep space ground stations: two within China (in Kashgar and Jiamusi) and one abroad (in Neuquén Province, Argentina). The Espacio Lejano Station thus fills a temporal gap in China’s global coverage. Adding a ground station on the other side of the globe allows China to improve the frequency of communication with its satellites. Since ground stations most easily communicate with satellites when they pass overhead, the additional deep space ground station in Neuquén gives China more continued access to them. Notably, ground stations can also gather information from other satellites that pass overhead, not just Chinese ones. Thus, more deep space ground stations allow for faster and more frequent gathering of data, which can help China understand the behavior of other countries’ satellites. The station’s official purpose is to expand deep space capabilities, with Chinese statements about it emphasizing its role in lunar exploration. For example, the Chinese National Space Administration (CNSA) says the Espacio Lejano Station played an important role in the 2019 Chang’e 4 mission to the far side of the moon. China’s space presence in Latin America extends beyond Argentina: CLTC constructed facilities for the Santiago Satellite Station, a ground station with three TT&amp;amp;C antennas in Chile’s Andes mountains. The station is operated by Swedish Space Corporation, which leased operation of two of the antennas to CLTC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agreement for the construction of the Espacio Lejano Station was reached in 2012, during a period of particularly strong diplomatic and economic ties between the Chinese government and the administration of Argentina’s president Christina Fernández de Kirchner. The agreement codified that the Espacio Lejano Station would be managed by CLTC and constructed with the aid of Chinese SOE contractors, subsidiaries of China Communications Construction Company. Operational since 2018, the station quickly became a flashpoint within Argentina and internationally — particularly within the United States. As discussed later in this chapter, the opacity around the station’s construction, political controversy around the terms of the deal, and CLTC’s links to the PLA have fueled suspicion about China’s intentions for the station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Espacio Lejano Station reveals two observations about the PLA’s position in the CCP Inc. ecosystem. The station agreement and its construction were facilitated by Chinese officials, state-owned construction firms, and a PLA-linked organization (CLTC) that now runs the station. Through one lens, this could be seen as a case study of how the PLA rallied other parts of the CCP Inc. ecosystem to advance China’s military interests abroad. At the same time, throughout the process, these military ties featured as key reasons for pushback against the Espacio Lejano Station and setbacks to Chinese investments in Argentina’s space sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-espacio-lejano-station-agreement&quot;&gt;The Espacio Lejano Station Agreement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The framework agreement for the Espacio Lejano Station was signed in 2012 by Argentina’s civil space agency, Comisión Nacional de Actividades Espaciales (CONAE), CLTC, and the province of Neuquén, where the station is located. These parties then signed a further follow-on agreement in 2014. The deal granted China 50 years of full sovereignty and tax exemption over a 200-hectare (500-acre) plot of land to build the deep space ground station. China received the right to construct, establish, and operate ground tracking and data collection without needing to specify what the technology and data would be used for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contract guaranteed CONAE the use of 10 percent of the deep space ground station’s operating time per year. However, the agreement does little to limit China’s operations there. Rather, it specifies that Argentina cannot “interfere [with] or interrupt the normal activities carried out under the Cooperation Agreement” and that if Argentina were to take any decisions that might interfere with China’s activities, it must inform China in advance and explore alternative options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The total cost of the station to China remains unclear. According to records captured by the AidData database, CLTC spent $50 million (USD) in state funding for the project in 2012, while Chinese media reports in 2015 say that CLTC was expected to invest $300 million. The framework agreement also includes language about the Chinese government paying Chinese workers according to their own labor laws, suggesting that the $50 million could refer to the amount the Chinese government — via CLTC — paid its own contractors and workers for the station. Though the framework agreement was first reached in 2012, the deal did not pass Argentina’s Congress until 2015. The station has been operational since 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial Espacio Lejano Station agreement was reached during the administration of President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (2007–2015), a period marked by both financial troubles for Argentina and a deepening of the Sino-Argentine partnership. In 2014, China and Argentina upgraded their relationship to a comprehensive strategic partnership and dramatically deepened their economic ties. China and Argentina signed dozens of commercial deals, China offered an $11.4 billion (RMB 70 billion) currency swap between the two countries’ central banks, and Argentina benefited from Chinese loans to upgrade its infrastructure. The bilateral relationship has since remained relatively strong, grounded in these expanding economic ties. In 2015, a new center-right government led by President Mauricio Macri initially raised concerns about transparency in dealings with China. He pledged to review — and potentially cancel — major bilateral deals with China as he attempted to deepen relations with the United States and Europe. However, Macri ultimately maintained the arc of continued alignment with China, meeting with Xi five times and accepting further financing and business deals during his tenure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Espacio Lejano Station spotlights the linkages that often exist between high-level state goals (China’s aim of becoming a leading international space power) and individual projects overseas. Examining how the station was constructed and how it is now run underlines the benefit of being able to draw on party-state support for strategic projects. As the following section shows, CLTC relied on Chinese construction companies with a track record of working with the PLA to build the Espacio Lejano Station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;construction-and-management-in-neuquén&quot;&gt;Construction and Management in Neuquén&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Per the diplomatic agreement between the Chinese and Argentine governments, Chinese state-owned construction companies built the station. According to Chinese government press releases and media reports about the station, two subsidiaries of China Communications Construction Company (CCCC, 中国交通建设公司) — China Harbor Engineering Company (中国港湾工程有限责任公司) and China Communications Fourth Highway Engineering Bureau (中交第四公路工程局有限公司) — led this process, alongside an Argentine construction firm, Electroingeniería S.A. CCCC is a majority state-owned and publicly traded company that has played a significant role in China’s island-building in the South China Sea and the military stations upon them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few details regarding the selection process for contractors at the Espacio Lejano Station are publicly available, but the involvement of these firms follows a precedent set in the South China Sea and elsewhere, in which the PLA uses select construction companies to work on sensitive projects. With construction now finished, the Espacio Lejano Station is managed by CLTC and one of its sub-entities, Xi’an Satellite Control Center (XSCC), both of which are subordinate to the PLASSF Space Systems Department. After China’s military reforms in December 2015, the Space Systems Department acquired authority over China’s space-related test bases, which include XSCC and satellite-launch bases. XSCC, which is China’s largest satellite control center and the main center for China’s TT&amp;amp;C operations, was designated by CLTC as the entity responsible for “construction and operating matters” at the Espacio Lejano Station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cooperation between CLTC and the two construction SOEs — China Harbour Engineering Company and China Communications Fourth Highway Engineering Bureau — shows how connectivity with Chinese firms enables the PLA to execute international projects. Just as CCCC constructed islands in the South China Sea that proved crucial to PLA expansion there, PLA-affiliated CLTC relied on military-industrial support companies to construct the Espacio Lejano Station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CLTC’s role has been central to accusations that the station is essentially run by the military, drawing criticism from the local community and analysts abroad. The PLA’s involvement and the secrecy that Espacio Lejano Station is able to maintain — in no small part due to the fact that China relied on its own contractors — has attracted suspicion from local residents, Argentine legislators, and international analysts alike. This suspicion reveals the drawbacks of military involvement in the CCP Inc. ecosystem and foreshadows hurdles for China’s space industry — and its bid for a greater international presence — going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;suspicions-surrounding-ccp-inc-at-the-espacio-lejano-station&quot;&gt;Suspicions Surrounding CCP Inc. at the Espacio Lejano Station&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emanating from both local and international observers, concerns about the potential uses of the Espacio Lejano Station stem from a combination of factors: secrecy around the space station’s operations, the dual-use nature of the space technology involved, the PLA’s presence, and the impression that Argentine interests are not being served in the deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the local level, residents living nearby have expressed concerns that the station is a military base disguised as a research facility. Horacio Quiroga, former mayor of Neuquén (the capital city of Neuquén Province), told media that, in his view, the installation is “practically Chinese territory.” On the national level, legislators have rallied for further oversight, including through a 2019 effort by Argentina’s Senate majority leader to create an independent monitor for the station. Internationally, analysts highlight that the technology used at ground stations like Espacio Lejano is inherently dual-use and could serve military or civilian purposes. U.S. military officials have also voiced concerns about the potential military use of the Espacio Lejano Station to target the space activities of the United States or its partners and spy on U.S. satellites. Any internet search in either English or Spanish turns up pages of results revealing concerns among these various actors about the Chinese military’s involvement in Neuquén.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While none of these concerns prevented the Espacio Lejano Station from being built, they did affect its reputation. Still, the Argentine government stood by its agreement and sought to reassure the public. In 2016, Argentine minister of foreign affairs Susana Malcorra and her Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, signed an additional protocol affirming that the station would be used only for peaceful purposes. Argentina’s current ambassador to Beijing, Sabino Vaca Narvaja, maintained that “China shares all information about its space program with Argentina” after the commander of the U.S. Southern Command questioned the potential military uses of the station. In a 2021 meeting with China’s vice minister of industry and information technology, Zhang Kejian, who oversees the CNSA, Vaca Narvaja underlined Argentina’s interest in deepening space cooperation and highlighted the Espacio Lejano Station’s aid to China’s Chang’e 5 lunar probe as a positive example of bilateral cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/nl3cFeP.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Satellite imagery of the Espacio Lejano Station shows an unusually large number of administrative and housing facilities on site given the size of the ground station itself. The vast amount of leased land around it — far more than the deep space station currently uses — could also indicate intentions to expand the installation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, reassurances from Argentine and Chinese officials have not changed the facts that the station remains operated by a PLA-linked administrator, official oversight by Argentina is limited, and the installation continues to house dual-use technology. Because CLTC drew on Chinese SOEs to construct the station, Argentine companies’ involvement has been limited. The degree of concern that has emerged about the Espacio Lejano Station clearly demonstrates a critical liability of the CCP Inc. ecosystem: suspicions regarding the intentions of the Chinese state and, in this case, the Chinese military are extended to each of the country’s international projects, particularly those that involve strategic technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Espacio Lejano Station shows that close ties to the military can be a reputational liability for China’s overseas space efforts, but also that the close connections between the civilian and military sides of China’s space industry benefit the PLA by enabling it to conduct international space projects. As previous CCP Inc. case studies in this series underline, engagements with one Chinese firm or institution are not carried out in a vacuum. CCP Inc. involves a web of relationships between parent and subsidiary companies, financiers, and Chinese officials, as well as personnel ties to the CCP. Within the space industry, the PLA is part of that list of relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the following section shows, the close integration of the PLA into the space sector is often a factor in whether overseas investors and firms choose to engage with China’s commercial space projects. In the space industry, profit-seeking Chinese companies frequently work with the PLA or toward MCF aims. In Argentina, business dealings between Argentine satellite start-up Satellogic and multiple Chinese space companies reveal that the latter may act in pursuit of commercial aims but are never too far removed from the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;satellogic-and-chinas-commercial-space-sector&quot;&gt;Satellogic and China’s Commercial Space Sector&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argentine start-up Satellogic’s engagement with Chinese companies illustrates how China’s burgeoning commercial space sector is increasingly involved in international investments. Founded in 2010, Satellogic has grown into a pioneering satellite technology company valued at over $200 million on the Nasdaq, as of writing. Satellogic describes itself as operating in the commercial “NewSpace” sector, where it focuses on building more cost-effective satellites. The company’s vertically integrated structure — in which it manufactures the various parts of its satellites rather than relying on vendors — enables it to roll out new technology quickly. The company has major ambitions: it plans to launch enough satellites into orbit to provide global, high-resolution imagery, refreshed every day — a mission Satellogic says will “completely reshape the business model” for imagery data. Satellogic’s latest launch, in January 2023, brought its total fleet up to 30 operational satellites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Satellogic has collaborated with state-owned Chinese firms for technology support, received major investments from a private Chinese company, and entered the Chinese market through a contract with a Chinese data science company to provide imaging services. Though Satellogic’s partnerships were commercial, they still brought the Argentine start-up into the fold of the state-linked Chinese space sector. After the company set its sights on going public in the United States and gained new U.S. investors, it appears to have pivoted away from its Chinese partners, naming SpaceX as its preferred launch partner and divesting itself of any ownership stake by Chinese investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;satellogics-history-of-partnership-with-chinese-firms&quot;&gt;Satellogic’s History of Partnership with Chinese Firms&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Satellogic partnered with China Great Wall Industry Corporation (CGWIC, 中国长城工业集团) to launch its early satellites. CGWIC is a fully owned subsidiary of the SOE CASC, but it describes itself as a “commercial” organization because it is authorized by the Chinese government to provide commercial launch services. It also partners with military-affiliated organizations in China’s space industry, including CLTC. In 2015, 2016, and 2017, CGWIC signed initial agreements that helped Satellogic launch satellites into low-earth orbit and, in 2019, signed a multiple launch agreement (MLA) for 90 Satellogic spacecraft. In November 2020, CGWIC sent 10 Satellogic satellites into orbit in the company’s largest launch to date, bringing the total number of CGWIC-launched satellites to 17.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/LEzXCE6.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;A Chinese rocket carrying China’s remote sensing satellites is launched from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in Gansu Province. China has ramped up its rocket launches in recent years and completed more than 60 orbital launches in 2022 alone.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese investors also played a critical role in providing seed money and follow-on investments that facilitated Satellogic’s development. Privately owned Chinese technology and media conglomerate Tencent participated in three rounds of investment in Satellogic prior to the company’s listing on the Nasdaq. Subsequently, according to filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Satellogic (referred to in the filings as “Nettar Group Inc.”) raised a total of $40 million from Tencent, via its subsidiary Columbia River Investment Limited, over six rounds of funding between January 2015 and September 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months ahead of Tencent’s 2019 investment, Satellogic signed a $38 million agreement with Chinese data science company Zhong Ke Guang Qi Space Information Technology Company (known in English as ABDAS, 中科光启空间信息技术有限公司) — a private company that was set up with the support of CAS — to provide ABDAS with imaging services of China’s Henan Province. This agreement granted ABDAS exclusive access to a fleet of satellites and decisionmaking authority over which specific regions to observe when passing over Henan, giving it the observational data needed to support crop yield and evaluate compliance with environmental regulations. This was Satellogic’s first deal for a “dedicated satellite constellation,” wherein customers can lease ownership over satellites when they pass over a specified geographic region. While none of the companies involved ever confirmed a link between Satellogic’s agreement with ABDAS and Tencent’s investment, industry analysts have speculated that Satellogic’s relationship with Tencent may have helped it navigate its partnership with ABDAS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Satellogic’s cooperation with ABDAS also extended to a project of close interest to the CCP. At the end of 2019, ABDAS and People’s Data Company (人民数据管理有限公司) jointly launched the People’s Nebula (人民星云) project, which combines satellite services with big data to “build a comprehensive aerospace data product sharing service platform” that will, in turn, facilitate China’s access to satellite imagery and data. The People’s Data Company was established under the CCP’s top newspaper, the People’s Daily, which expanded its services to include data management and cloud computing. Satellogic provided Henan Province complete control over its dedicated satellite constellation, but (if successfully completed) the People’s Nebula project will allow China to access satellite-provided data on a far larger scale, without needing to utilize a third party such as Satellogic. This project requires building and launching a series of satellites, the first of which (Renmin-1) was developed by Satellogic and launched by CGWIC. While few details are publicly available about this deal, Satellogic’s existing relationship with Tencent and CGWIC likely contributed to Satellogic developing the first satellite for People’s Nebula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese collaboration with Satellogic demonstrates the various forms of international engagement China’s space industry takes. CGWIC, a company plugged into the state-owned and military-linked facets of this sector, played a key role in helping Satellogic get its first satellites off the ground and renewed its partnership with a multiple launch agreement in 2019. Tencent offered a source of private financing and, in addition to investing in Satellogic, has invested in other foreign space companies, including the U.S. firms Planetary Resources and Moon Express. Satellogic’s agreement with ABDAS was mutually beneficial, providing utility to Henan Province and enabling Argentina to access the Chinese market — and likely led to Satellogic’s involvement in the People’s Nebula project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;satellogics-shift-away-from-ccp-inc&quot;&gt;Satellogic’s Shift Away from CCP Inc.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this track record of collaboration, Satellogic began shifting toward new U.S. partners in the past few years. In July 2021, Satellogic announced its plans to go public in the United States via a merger with CF Acquisition Corp. V (CFV), a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) sponsored by Cantor Fitzgerald, a U.S. financial services firm. Cantor Fitzgerald also provided $58 million to a $100 million private investment fund, to which Liberty Strategic Capital (a private equity firm founded by former secretary of the treasury Steve Mnuchin) invested an additional $150 million in January 2022. Shortly after Satellogic received this influx of U.S. capital, it announced a MLA with SpaceX for its next 68 satellites, with CEO Emiliano Kargieman describing SpaceX as the company’s “preferred partner for rideshare missions” in “2023 and beyond,” signaling a move away from CGWIC in future launches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that the 2019 CGWIC MLA promised to launch 90 spacecraft, Satellogic may still be working with the Chinese SOE — but any such collaboration is no longer highlighted on either Satellogic’s or CGWIC’s websites. Additionally, Satellogic dropped Tencent as an investor after its final investment in September 2019. Documents filed with the SEC in March 2021 ahead of the company’s public listing show that Satellogic repurchased shares and promissory notes from Tencent subsidiary Columbia River Investment Limited (CRIL) in exchange for owing CRIL a $40 million loan — removing any ownership stake for Tencent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/3oakyhr.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4: Timeline of Satellogic’s Partnerships.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ research based on multiple sources cited throughout this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shift away from Chinese partners is further explained in Satellogic’s F-1 SEC filing (a form required from foreign companies before listing in the United States). The document notes that a significant part of Satellogic’s growth plan relies on demand from international defense and intelligence customers and that “continued concerns regarding prior ownership of a minority interest in the Company’s shares by a Chinese entity and its minor operations in China could impact the Company’s ability to win bids from or enter into customer contracts with certain government agencies or commercial customers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the key role of Chinese partners in — quite literally — getting Satellogic’s early operations off the ground, the company seems to have decided that the business risks of continued collaboration with Chinese companies outweigh the opportunities. This decision underlines the particularly sensitive nature of the space industry. Though Satellogic is a commercial company, it is still cognizant that defense and intelligence uses of space technology remain central. Even Tencent, a private company, was impacted by Satellogic’s (or new U.S. investors’) concerns about links to the Chinese state. Satellogic repurchased Tencent’s shares to eliminate the Chinese company’s ownership stake despite its significant involvement in early funding rounds. The complex relationships and unclear boundaries in China’s space industry may dissuade international cooperation as it becomes more difficult for Chinese companies to separate themselves from the PLA and international perceptions of the Chinese government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-constrained-commercial-space&quot;&gt;China’s Constrained Commercial Space&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business agreements and investments between Satellogic and various Chinese companies show a very different side of China’s space industry compared to the state-led construction of the Espacio Lejano Station. Satellogic is a commercial actor working with Chinese space companies via business partnerships rather than bilateral agreements. It provides insight into how commercial deals factor into China’s pursuit of space industry goals and how private actors such as Tencent are investing in the sector. From looking at Satellogic and China’s domestic space sector more broadly, it is clear that private investors and Chinese businesses are able to pursue commercial ends only within a closely state-aligned environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take Tencent, for example. Tencent’s investment in Satellogic could be seen as a purely private sector agreement. But at home, it has been working on its own launch of a space program in collaboration with the Chinese National Astronomical Observatories. Since China opened its space sector to private investment, the sector has seen an influx of startups and commercial space companies, but almost all of these still have a degree of state involvement and are typically only 30–50 percent privately funded. Many of the most successful “commercial” enterprises are subsidiaries of CASC or CASIC — or receive a combination of funding from large government organizations such as SASTIND or provincial governments in addition to private investment. Companies often tailor their innovation targets to support national security goals or government priorities to guarantee more funding. Meanwhile, the CCP supports these companies because they can innovate faster and work on projects that government organizations would not necessarily pursue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s model for the commercial space industry emphasizes the importance of centering private space ventures around national defense and security goals. In this context, the definition of “commercial” is limited, since most Chinese commercial space companies have elements of state ownership, connections to the PLA, or both. For example, it is common for prominent commercial space companies — such as ExPace, a commercial launch-vehicle maker and subsidiary of CASIC that provides services to foreign customers — to have leadership and personnel overlap with that of state-owned entities. ExPace’s chairman is simultaneously the deputy director of CASIC; in his dual roles, he has tasked the company with advancing successful commercial launch constellations and spaceplanes, which ultimately helps advance China’s broader space goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opening China’s space sector to private investment has brought increased sources of funding while retaining the level of state alignment needed to ensure that this private financing continues to serve China’s strategic interests. Meanwhile, government funding in the sector allows the CCP to steer the growing array of commercial and state-owned companies. This creates a business ecosystem that is very tightly controlled — even more so than other industries in China. While financing, personnel ties, ownership structures, and political initiatives create conduits of party-state influence that are recognizable across the CCP Inc. state capitalist system, the strategic nature of the space industry and its close links to the military differentiate it from more traditional economic sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the CCP Inc. ecosystem of China’s space sector, teasing out the motivations of individual actors is extremely difficult. Tracing the connective tissue between the parts and the whole — such as links between certain companies, state administrators, and the PLA — is feasible. But discerning to what degree Chinese space companies are motivated by profits and growth opportunities, versus dedication to state policy, is another matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case of China-Argentina space cooperation mirrors themes evident in China’s other international engagements. Through CCP Inc., Chinese firms benefit when their commercial objectives align with state and military goals, enabling access to preferential state financing, diplomatic support, and other advantages. Additionally, by integrating state and business aims, the CCP Inc. system enhances party- state influence over commercial decisionmaking while maintaining ambiguity regarding whether certain corporate decisions are ultimately motivated by business or by state strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet this complex ecosystem comes with risks for Chinese firms and, in turn, party-state goals overseas. Concern in host countries about Huawei compromising fifth-generation (5G) network security — or State Grid using its role in national electric grids to gain political leverage — centers on the strong connections between the Chinese party-state and China’s global commercial reach. The Espacio Lejano Station has been plagued by international and domestic political debates criticizing its opacity and military management. In the past few years, Argentine firm Satellogic has eschewed Chinese partnerships in favor of new investments and business deals in the United States, almost certainly due to Satellogic’s assessment that links to China could undermine its ability to compete for international defense and intelligence contracts. CCP Inc. can be a liability for Chinese actors seeking to engage commercially overseas. As the global space industry grows and China aims to build its position within it through further international partnerships, Chinese actors will face a delicate balancing act between navigating the risks of the CCP Inc. system and seeking to realize its advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

Although the West has a post-victory strategy for Ukraine, namely a framework for reconstruction and a path toward EU and NATO membership, it lacks a vision for Russia in the aftermath of a Ukrainian victory. This issue brief argues that the West should offer an alternative path for Russia and outline a vision for a more liberal future. Doing so could have a powerful effect on Russia and add pressure on the Kremlin.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine is sapping the strength and resilience of Vladimir Putin’s regime. Russia’s continued military failures there, combined with high casualties and worsening economic deprivation, could put his regime at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion has been more than a military debacle. The war has pulled back the curtain on the Kremlin and revealed an incompetent, corrupt, and poorly run state. It threatens to undermine Putin’s very legitimacy. The Kremlin prioritized modernizing its military for more than two decades, and despite substantial investment and presidential attention, the Russian military’s performance has been shambolic. Russia is perhaps now more isolated and less respected than at any other time during Putin’s 23-year reign. He is now asking more of the public than ever before. Desperate to salvage the situation in Ukraine, he has mobilized hundreds of thousand Russian men to replace the estimated 100,000 soldiers already killed or wounded in the war. There is now talk in Moscow of the war being existential. Keeping hold of territory in Ukraine is not existential for Russia — but it may be increasingly existential to the survival of the Putin regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Ukraine continues to reverse Russia’s post-February 2022 territorial gains, it may make Putin’s position untenable in Moscow. The West, led by the United States, is supporting Ukraine with modern advanced Western weaponry, massive financial aid, a global diplomatic campaign to isolate Russia, and an unprecedented sanctions effort designed to strangle the Russian economy. The Western objectives in Ukraine, despite claims otherwise, are relatively straightforward: to weaken Russia, preserve Ukrainian democracy, and enable Ukraine to reclaim its territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Keeping hold of territory in Ukraine is not existential for Russia — but it may be increasingly existential to the survival of the Putin regime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The West does not have a strategy of regime change in Russia. However, if its overall efforts prove successful and Ukraine can end the conflict on its own terms, Putin’s regime could fall. A failed war, combined with economic deprivation and loss of prestige, makes regime collapse a possible outcome. While it is hard to see how Putin departs, it is also hard to see how his regime survives such a situation. But although the West has a post-victory strategy for Ukraine, namely a framework for reconstruction and a path toward EU and NATO membership, it lacks a vision for Russia in the aftermath of a Ukrainian victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This issue brief assesses the potential for the war to prompt a transition of power in Russia, as well as the possible ramifications of this. It concludes, contrary to much of the prevailing view, that if Putin leaves power, it will likely be due to a reaction against the war and Putin’s hardline approach. The potential for Ukrainian military success to cause regime instability in Moscow has generated understandable nervousness among many Western governments about what could follow Putin. In fact, there is a growing assumption that what follows his reign could very well be worse. Such a pessimistic outlook might seem sober — but, as this issue brief argues, it could very well be wrong. This is because regime supporters and war hawks will, most likely, vigorously seek to keep Putin in power, prop up the regime, and stay the course. Thus, for a transition to occur there will need to be a strong demand for change. This will likely be driven by two interlocking factors: the Putin regime’s loss of legitimacy (with the public, the security services, elites, and the state) and the existence of a clear alternative to Russia’s current path. Ukraine and the West have created the conditions for the first, Putin’s loss of legitimacy. However, the West has not yet offered an alternative vision for Russia’s post-Putin future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a clear and more rational path for Moscow: end the war, reconcile with the West, and reverse Russia’s economic, diplomatic, and cultural isolation. However, while Russia can end the war on its own, reconciling with the West and reversing Russia’s isolation is ultimately up to the West. Thus, as this issue brief argues, building momentum for change inside Russia also requires signaling from the West that it is both open to future reengagement with a post-Putin Russia and that it believes such an alternative future is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. and European leaders could make clear to Russia — both the public and especially elites — that the West ultimately sees Russia as part of Europe. There is therefore a path out of Russia’s isolation after Putin departs. Europe could pledge to “welcome back” a post-Putin Russia that ends the war, respects its neighbors, releases dissidents, restores political freedoms, and seeks to positively reengage with the West. The goal would be to make it known that an alternative European future is possible for Russia should Russians seek it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether this is possible or likely is a separate discussion. The West’s objective in offering a positive vision for Russia’s future is to put additional pressure on the regime by undermining the Kremlin narrative that the two are inevitable adversaries and by creating clear incentives for Russia to pursue a different course. This does not mean adopting a policy of “regime change,” something the West has rightly disavowed and has no means to implement in practice. Instead, it simply means leveraging the power the West does possess: its appeal. People, especially Europeans, want to be part of it; countries want to join it. There is no clearer example of this than Ukraine, where the government’s 2013 rejection of a closer relationship with the European Union spurred the Maidan Revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calling on Western leaders to talk about reintegrating Russia into Europe may seem utterly tone-deaf. Missiles continue to descend on Ukrainian cities, targeting playgrounds, pedestrian bridges, and civilian infrastructure. In the wake of Russia’s initial missile barrage on civilian infrastructure, Former Finnish prime minister Alexander Stubb assessed that “Russia is in the process of isolating itself from Europe for decades. . . . It did not have to be this way, but Putin decided otherwise.” The war in Ukraine has unleashed immense and justifiable anger not just toward the Kremlin but also toward the Russian public, with some prominent voices arguing that Russians are complicit through their support for Putin. There has been no mass protest or robust anti-war movement. Instead, the voices of dissent and criticism come from the far right, pushing Putin to increase the brutality. Because of this assumption that Russians are complicit, it is not surprising that when three civil society groups in Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, the Ukrainian government criticized the Nobel Committee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as much as righteous indignation toward Russia — and therefore the Russian public — is understandable and warranted, applying collective guilt is ultimately a self-defeating strategy. Doing so will likely strengthen Putin and Russian hardliners inside the country who claim that the West is nurturing hatred toward the entire Russian nation. If there is no way back for Russians, no alternative to isolation, why not just persist with a hardline anti-Western path? Moreover, since Russia is not going to be occupied by a conquering power, the reality is that there will be no accountability or justice for war crimes or reparations unless Russia itself is a willing participant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus far, the West has not provided any clear incentive for the Russian people or elite to mobilize against the regime. Currently, the message the West is sending is that Russia will be treated like Germany was after World War I and will face crushing reparations. Such calls may be morally and legally justified, but they also bolster Putin by demobilizing those with anti-regime sentiment. The Russian public or members of the elite are unlikely to mobilize against the regime if it means inheriting continued economic ruin (never-ending sanctions plus reparations), continued diplomatic isolation, and (potentially) more territorial concessions. Instead, Russians are more likely to act if there is a clearly better path available and if they have confidence there will be clear benefits for Russia should they succeed. Moreover, knowing that the regime, not the West, is preventing a better future can lead to growing frustration, which in time can grow and boil over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The West shifting its rhetorical approach toward Russia and offering a positive vision for a post-Putin future might have little to no impact. However, it could add an additional source of pressure on an increasingly brittle regime and potentially open the door to rebuilding relations. Such a shift has little cost but significant potential upside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This issue brief first assesses the stability of the Putin regime, analyzing its strengths and weaknesses. It then sketches out potential trajectories of how Putin might depart. Finally, it outlines possible Western policy options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;auditing-regime-stability&quot;&gt;Auditing Regime Stability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion over the fate of the Putin regime is highly speculative and may seem little more than an esoteric policy discussion — but it does have tangible policy implications. A pessimistic view about what comes after Putin or a presumption that his regime is stable could prompt Western leaders to advocate seeking a swift end to the war, pressuring Ukraine to negotiate prematurely, and seeking to return to a more “stable and predictable” relationship with the Kremlin. However, a view that Putin’s regime could be unstable and that a post-Putin Russia might seek to reconcile with the West results in a different policy course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While still unlikely, the potential for Putin’s departure from office can no longer be discounted. The adage that autocratic regimes look stable until they aren’t holds true. Indeed, if Putin were to leave power, historians would likely treat it as inevitable and engage in fierce debates over which of the multiple causes was most important. What is clear is that the regime is on increasingly shaky ground and is getting squeezed on four interrelated fronts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, Russia is suffering significant setbacks on the battlefield.&lt;/strong&gt; Ukraine now has a military advantage, benefiting from advanced Western weaponry and heightened morale. Kyiv has made remarkable gains around Kharkiv and retaken Kherson. If Ukraine continues to make significant battlefield advances and reclaim most or all the territory Russia has seized since February 2022, the war would become an unmitigated failure for Russia, amounting to a humiliating military defeat. This is especially the case for Putin, who has justified his tenure by pledging to restore Russian greatness and military strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military defeat on the battlefield can easily upend a country’s social and political order and lead to a crisis of legitimacy for the government. Argentina’s military junta, for instance, stepped down just three days after it surrendered to the United Kingdom following its invasion of the Falkland Islands in 1982. Putin would need to shed blame and responsibility for military defeat to the military and other officials, but doing so could prompt a counterreaction from military and security officials who blame Putin and other political leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian reliance on amassing forces and its tolerance for high casualties might also slowly undermine support for the war and the regime. If many Russian soldiers are killed or wounded over the winter and early spring, with newly mobilized soldiers rushed to the frontlines bearing the brunt of the losses, it could lead to significant blowback on the home front. This could create a situation in which Russia’s military, which tends to accept high casualties, could run directly counter to the interests of the regime. Moreover, mobilized forces are older. They are men often with prior service who are now in their late 20s and older and are more likely to have families and dependents than 18–27-year-old conscripts. These losses will be deeply felt socially and economically in their communities, especially among Russia’s ethnic minorities. If Russia loses ground on the battlefield while suffering high casualties among mobilized soldiers, the reaction could be explosive. Thus, a long attritional war might favor Russia on paper — but also sap support for the regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second, mobilization could endanger public support.&lt;/strong&gt; Putin has built up a significant reservoir of public trust when it comes to use of the Russian military. The Russian public has seen the relatively successful deployment of force in Chechnya, Georgia, Ukraine, and Syria. Moreover, little to no sacrifice was required of the public for these past military operations. Russians expected the “special military operation” in Ukraine to be the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the war has been brought home to the average Russian through the “partial mobilization.” As Leonid Volkov — Alexei Navalny’s chief of staff and chairman of the Anti-Corruption Foundation, which has been conducting polling inside of Russia since the war began — assessed, “Mobilization made them [the Russian public] aware of what’s actually going on. It reached out to almost every family in the country. It shocked those who believed in Putin’s ‘stability’ for decades.” Hundreds of thousands of Russian men have now been arbitrarily incorporated into the military to fight in a war that may have already resulted in more than 100,000 casualties. Additionally, partial mobilization has sent around 400,000 Russians, primarily men, fleeing their homeland. A September 2022 poll by the Levada Analytical Center showed that the majority of Russians experienced “anxiety, fear, and horror” or “anger” following the news on partial mobilization, while a growing number of citizens now consider the special military operation to be “rather” or “very” unsuccessful (31 percent in September 2022 versus 15 percent in May 2022).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is little sense among Russians of what the war is about. General support for the war may remain high, but there is also strong support for a peaceful negotiated settlement, reflecting an overarching desire to end the fighting. Kremlin messaging about the war has also shifted continuously throughout the conflict, adding to the confusion. Though the war was initially about “denazification,” now its messaging tends to focus on conflict with NATO. Indeed, the public was prohibited from even calling the special military operation a “war.” Overall support for Putin and the invasion may look stable, but public support can shift rapidly against wars of choice when sacrifices mount. For instance, when fighting erupted in Iraq in spring 2004, a year after the U.S. invasion, public opinion in the United States abruptly swung against the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third, the Russian economy is gradually being strangled by sanctions and export controls.&lt;/strong&gt; The announcement of massive sanctions by the United States, European Union, and others after the outbreak of the war led the value of the ruble to collapse, prompting a massive increase in interest rates. Yet the Russian economy has seemingly stabilized. The value of the ruble recovered, interest rates have been lowered, and the Russian economy is estimated to have contracted by only 3 percent in 2022. However, as Konstantin Sonin argues in Foreign Affairs, this is due to a drop in imports, which decreases the need for dollars or euros. Sanctions may not have affected the regime’s behavior, but there is substantial evidence that sanctions are effective at gradually strangling an economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already, factories are closing and layoffs are mounting — and the effects will likely grow. Russia is transitioning to a fully fledged war economy, impacting the country’s ability to fulfill basic consumer needs. The mobilization of Russian men will also disrupt the labor market, as will the need to invest limited and shrinking resources to support the war effort. The downward economic spiral will only put more strain on the Kremlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fourth, Putin’s credibility as a leader is gravely damaged.&lt;/strong&gt; Putin made a catastrophic error in invading Ukraine. As Mark Galleotti argues, “Putin-the-man may still cling to power for years, but Putin-the-legend is dead.” Never in the past had Putin appeared strategically weak or incompetent. His gross military miscalculation in Ukraine, which has taken the lives of tens of thousands of Russian soldiers and subjected the country’s citizens to long-term economic uncertainty, has damaged the president’s carefully crafted image as a formidable global player. Instead of restoring Russian greatness, Putin will have left Russia weak, isolated, and humiliated on the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;regime-stabilizing-factors&quot;&gt;Regime-Stabilizing Factors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Putin’s downfall is by no means inevitable. There are also several factors that contribute to continued support for the regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, the war has prompted greater repression.&lt;/strong&gt; Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Kremlin has significantly increased its repression and effectively closed down independent political forums. Dissidents have been jailed, with many facing years-long imprisonment. Journalists, academics, and policy analysts have fled Russia to avoid arrest. Anti-war protesters have been given long jail sentences. Thus, there is almost no political space to mobilize against the regime, which makes fomenting popular unrest exceptionally difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second, mobilization might succeed in achieving Russia’s more limited war aims: to hold the territory it currently occupies in Ukraine.&lt;/strong&gt; Putin’s mobilization may blunt Ukraine’s military gains, as Russia will likely seek simply to defend the territory it controls, while Ukraine would need to go on the offensive to retake territory. The war might stagnate over the winter — and, come spring, Russia’s new wave of freshly trained mobilized forces could prevent Ukraine from advancing. A stalemate, a new frozen conflict, would work just fine for Putin by de facto eliminating Ukraine’s path to EU and NATO membership. The war would then shift out of public consciousness, and Putin would gain breathing space to better address the immediate needs of the Russian public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third, Russian propaganda has mobilized the country for war.&lt;/strong&gt; Putin failed to prepare the Russian public for a long, bloody campaign that requires sacrifice, even going so far as to prohibit calling the “special military operation” a “war.” However, in September, in preparation for partial mobilization, the Kremlin sought to build public support for more prolonged conflict. The Russian annexation of Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson created an opportunity to mobilize the Russian public, with Putin holding an elaborate ceremony and rally near the Kremlin to mark the occasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia is also now justifying the conflict by claiming it is fighting NATO. According to a special report by the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), an overarching narrative that the Kremlin employs domestically asserts NATO is using “Ukrainian Nazis” to “break” Russia. This is not a war against Ukraine but against a collective West that seeks to see the great Russian civilization stripped of its values, traditions, culture, and morale. As researchers at RUSI argue, “The decision to ideologically mobilize the Russian public for war with the use of increasingly radicalizing language was not a nationalistic response to events but was instead directed centrally . . . to put Russia on a war footing.” This message could resonate with some Russians, stabilize support for the war, and mitigate the Kremlin’s loss of legitimacy and prestige.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fourth, Kremlin elites are dependent on Putin.&lt;/strong&gt; Putin has created a regime that centers around him, making it highly risky for insiders to seek his ouster. Thus, as the next section shows, supporters of the regime will likely push back strongly against efforts to remove him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;assessing-a-transition&quot;&gt;Assessing a Transition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to predict how Russia would transition to someone else or something new if the situation becomes untenable for Putin — yet the emerging consensus that Putin would likely be replaced by someone worse may be unfounded. An effort to replace Putin will probably emerge out of a movement to end the war, not to further it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most analyses of what could come next tend to look at Putin’s court and examine who among his inner circle might be a potential successor. This has led to fears that Putin could be replaced by even more of a hardliner, such as Security Council secretary Nikolai Patrushev. Such analysis can lead to the conclusion that the West should favor stability in Russia and a face-saving end to the war for Putin because a humiliating defeat could give rise to a truly unhinged president (i.e., it is better to deal with the devil you know — Putin — than the devil you don’t).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is difficult to see a dynamic forming in which Putin is replaced by a marginally more hawkish figure from within his inner circle. This is because Putin is already hawkish. This is, after all, his war, on which he is already doubling down. Under Putin’s “partial mobilization,” the military is bombing civilian targets, committing war crimes, pulverizing cities, and showing a willingness to take enormous battlefield losses. The Russian strategy being pursued is the hardline strategy. Moreover, Putin has also shown that he listens to hardliners. Those advocating taking the war to Ukrainian civilians and mobilizing the population have gotten what they wanted. Yet, for hardliners there is always more that can be done. A more depraved hawk could marginally dial up the atrocities or could move to use a nuclear weapon — but this is a road to ruin. In fact, the effort to move in a more hardline direction could prompt the elite and public to step in to stop such a leader from ascending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The replacement of Putin with a more hardline figure is not impossible, but neither does it help fellow hawks preserve the regime. Putin has a two-decade relationship with the Russian public and has built up an immense reservoir of trust. Although that reservoir is being depleted, any new hardline successor would likely come from within the regime’s inner circle and would have similar baggage. Why orchestrate a risky soft coup to just stick with the same hawkish approach?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, if power transitions to a member of Putin’s court, the new administration will likely be short-lived due to infighting. In Egypt in 2011, Hosni Mubarak tried to end his 30-year reign by transferring power to his former intelligence chief, Omar Suleiman, whom he abruptly made vice president. However, this was not sustainable, and the armed forces almost immediately assumed power until elections could be held. Any time a long-standing autocrat departs, it destabilizes the entire governing network they have built up over the course of their rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin has created a regime that centers around him, a power-vertical, in which he is not just the key decisionmaker but also keeps all the nodes of power in balance. If he is removed, the system would likely be in danger of toppling. Putin himself has not figured out the conundrum of succession, either how to leave or who should succeed him. Instead, he has kept all options open while preventing the rise of any undisputed successor. The 2020 constitutional reforms, instead of bringing clarity on a transition, allowed him to stay in power for life. This is in part because of Putin’s ego; many politicians are reluctant to leave the stage. However, it is also because he cannot figure out how to leave without the system collapsing — and his legacy with it. If Putin surrendered his position at the top of the patronage network he has spent over two decades constructing, he would no longer be able to guarantee his personal safety, nor the security of his wealth. The same goes for Putin’s closest lieutenants, who rely on his legitimacy to defend their own positions within the country’s vertical power structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is therefore hard to see how the existing regime survives without Putin. Far from pushing Putin out, hardliners and regime stalwarts are probably incredibly reluctant to move against him. In fact, they will likely do everything they can to keep him in power. This is perhaps the most important factor protecting the regime from collapse. Thus, if Putin is replaced or loses power, it will likely be because the war in Ukraine goes very badly. It will be because there is a desperate need for change, not just for a new leader but for a new approach to the war that does not double down on but rather ends it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scenarios-for-a-power-transition&quot;&gt;Scenarios for a Power Transition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several ways in which a change in power could occur in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, the regime might become unable to govern and simply collapse.&lt;/strong&gt; Daniel Treisman’s article in Foreign Affairs outlines how “a comprehensive meltdown of the regime” could come about, “as multiple challenges overwhelm its [the Kremlin’s] capacity to react and dysfunction drains confidence in Putin’s leadership.” He explains, “An overcentralized system can work tolerably in quiet times. The clear lines of command even help in minor crises. But the need for Putin to weigh in personally becomes a serious flaw when problems are complex and fast developing. The center is quickly overwhelmed, which can lead to cascading mistakes. . . . As the burden grows, so does the danger of loss of control.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bureaucrats and functionaries in this scenario might quietly rebel by hesitating, delaying, and obfuscating. In doing so, they gradually stop propping up the regime. This is, after all, Putin’s experience in Dresden: When his KGB outpost was surrounded, he called for military reinforcements, but “Moscow was silent.” Instead of trying to curry favor with Moscow, regional governors might hedge and begin pushing back, as they are uncertain about which way the political winds are blowing and do not want to be caught on the wrong side. Perhaps governors in certain provinces might refuse to repress anti-war protests or deflect blame away from the Kremlin. As Treisman concludes, “Most of the regime’s enforcers are motivated by corruption rather than conviction, but they act out of faith that the system will survive. When that faith fades, the result is not a coup but foot-dragging, inaction, and ultimately desertion.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second, elites or insiders might initiate a coup.&lt;/strong&gt; The need to blame someone if the war goes badly could prompt the security services and the military, as well as oligarchs, to mobilize. However, Putin has worked hard to coup-proof his regime, and there are few informal connections between leaders of the security services’ various power centers. Treisman explains that “the obstacles to such a coup are formidable. Putin has rigged the system with numerous tripwires to prevent one. Multiple agencies watch over each other. . . . Those with armed men at their command lack the mutual trust to organize a conspiracy, and any attempt to do so would be hard to hide.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But working in an intense crisis environment can also quickly build connections, relationships, and trust among officials. Moreover, if a person’s job and life are on the line, they may be more willing to take risks to plot or scheme. As one former Putin confidant in Moscow described “the atmosphere in the halls of power” to the New York Times, “We’re giving each other looks, but to say something is impossible.” However, as pressure builds, the risk calculation can shift as well, and discontented oligarchs with large reserves of cash could bribe or incentivize officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;History is also replete with coups led by resentful mid- and junior-level officers mobilizing against their inept senior officers and political leaders. Russian officers’ utter mismanagement of the war in Ukraine and the disregard for the well-being of their soldiers could trigger a backlash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third, regime stalwarts might move to replace Putin, not to end the regime but to save it.&lt;/strong&gt; A new leader could be appointed simply to try to relieve pressure on the regime. This might be someone from inside who could end the war and negotiate with the West, perhaps a technocrat — for example, from the Central Bank or the Ministry of Finance — or a Western-friendly oligarch. As Vladimir Milov, a former deputy minister of energy and an economic adviser to Alexei Navalny, has remarked, “This may look as something resemblant of the environment which existed in the Soviet Union before 1985 and the arrival of Gorbachev: he started his ‘perestroika’ not out of the blue, but rather as a response to diminished public credibility of the Soviet system and visible bottom-up popular demand for change.” Alternatively, power could be transferred to a regime insider in a desperate effort to maintain continuity, as occurred in Egypt with Mubarak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fourth, mass protests or movements might emerge.&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, there appears to be little prospect of Russians mobilizing against the regime. Putin’s approval ratings remain high, dissidents have been jailed or exiled, and repression has been dialed up. However, outrage or discontent can emerge from unlikely places under an autocratic regime. In Argentina, it was the mothers of the disappeared who stood up to the military junta. What sparks a protest against an autocratic regime can sometimes come from seemingly nowhere, such the self-immolation of a fruit seller in Tunisia or the murder of a young woman arrested for allegedly not wearing a headscarf in Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These four scenarios for regime transition are not mutually exclusive. They can — and likely will — interact with and reinforce each other if a transition occurs. Protests can prompt elites to act and bureaucrats to stop working. A clear defeat in the war could lead to growing pressure on the regime from all quarters: elites, the public, and the security services. These pressures could become self-reinforcing, forming a vicious cycle for the Kremlin in which defections or protests in one part of society facilitate them in others, prompting individuals in power to take actions that would have been deemed unimaginable weeks earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications-for-us-policy&quot;&gt;Implications for U.S. Policy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developments inside Russia will be decided by Russians. However, the West does have the ability to influence perceptions among elites and the public about what a post-Putin Russia might look like, which could both add to pressure on the regime and help shape the perceptions and ambitions of those who comes after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, for this to occur, Russia would have to end the war in Ukraine, open up political space, and reengage the West and Ukraine productively. U.S. president Joe Biden could make clear that a post-Putin Russia that takes such steps would see sanctions and travel restrictions melt away. Russia would be welcomed back to global sporting competitions, from the World Cup to the Olympics. It might also regain its global status, rejoin the Group of Seven, and restart the U.S.-Russian security dialogue aimed at building trust and putting limits on conventional and nuclear forces. Biden and European leaders could even float a longer-term possibility of Russia joining the European Union and NATO — which has an open-door policy in which any country can join if all allies agree, meaning membership is potentially open to Russia, too. While this may sound fanciful and utterly implausible, there is little reason not to leave open the possibility. The strength of the West’s message comes from the fact that this is obviously a better course than doubling down on a hopeless, endless war for imperial aggrandizement that has resulted in huge human losses, economic strangulation, and international pariah status for Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the Kremlin has found the notion that Russia is inevitably at odds with the West useful in justifying its isolation from Europe. Putin has even attempted to construct a “Eurasian” identity for Russia, with which he has sought to contrast the increasing liberalism of the West with Russia’s traditional conservatism, such as on LGBTQ+ issues. The Kremlin’s rhetoric and propaganda has shifted perceptions; as a 2021 Levada poll found, fewer Russians think of Russia as a European country than did in 2019 or 2008. Yet Russia is a European country in that it has historically been oriented westward and been a pivotal player in European affairs. The pre-Soviet tsars were heavily orientated toward Europe, and even during the Soviet and Putin eras, Russia’s major geopolitical, economic, and culture focus has been toward Europe. In other words, Putin’s efforts to construct a Eurasian identity naturally at odds with Europe rest on shaky ground — though his narrative has been bolstered by current tensions with the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could prove powerful to reject the premise that the West and Russia are inevitably at odds and highlight that Putin is the one isolating Russia, preventing it from having a European — and thus more prosperous — future. While getting such a message to penetrate Russian society and override state propaganda is difficult, it is not impossible. Messages and narratives can and do find a way to reach Russian elites and the highly connected public. Since the partial mobilization in September, the broader Russian public is also now seeking more credible information about the war in Ukraine. Biden and European leaders could give high-profile addresses and interviews on notable outlets run by Russian expatriates, such as Meduza, TV Rain, the Moscow Times, and iStories. The Biden administration could engage the growing Russian expatriate community and empower its efforts to broadcast accurate information about the war to the Russian public. Latvia’s recent suspension of TV Rain was in this sense self-defeating. Instead of stifling these outlets, the West should be supporting and encouraging them, as they are the most effective vehicle for reaching the Russian public. The West should also be engaging Russians online, including on platforms such as Telegram and YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It could prove powerful to reject the premise that the West and Russia are inevitably at odds and highlight that Putin is the one isolating Russia, preventing it from having a European — and thus more prosperous — future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Describing possible futures for a post-Putin Russia could create another avenue of pressure on the Kremlin. Although such a messaging effort may have little to no impact, the cost of promoting a new narrative is virtually nothing. Meanwhile, it could have several beneficial effects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, it could increase public frustration with the Putin regime.&lt;/strong&gt; The West could try to make clear that Putin is the one preventing Russia from having a European future. This — combined with military defeat, economic deprivation, and geopolitical isolation — might contribute to some Russians believing change is possible and help trigger popular unrest. To be clear, a new message from the West or speech from a U.S. president is not going to trigger popular unrest in Russia. But the belief that another path is possible for Russia, combined with military defeat, economic deprivation, and geopolitical isolation, might.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second, it could undermine Putin’s war narrative.&lt;/strong&gt; Making clear to Russians that the West’s issue is with Putin and not with the average Russian also helps undercut Putin’s desperate effort to mobilize public support for the war. Putin needs to make up for lost time since he had deliberately sought to demobilize the Russian public at first by describing the war in Ukraine as a “special military operation.” In doing so, he was signaling that this was a limited, technical mission the public did not need to worry about. He even initially cracked down on anyone who dared call it a “war.” The Kremlin has not prepared the public for sacrifice or a prolonged conflict. With the war going badly, the enemy now has to be cast as more than just Ukraine — because “mighty” Russia cannot be getting ground down by “puny” Ukraine. The narrative has thus shifted to it being a fight against the West, which is out to destroy Russia. However, a message of possible Western-Russian reconciliation post-Putin would directly undercut the regime’s broader narrative of eternal struggle with the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third, it could mobilize those upset with the direction Putin has taken.&lt;/strong&gt; It might help shift the calculation of elites, especially as pressure builds on the regime. Instead of sitting on their hands, elites might begin to take risks and seek out like-minded figures. Additionally, if regime collapse causes a sudden power vacuum and there is competition for power, a new leader or faction could gain support by arguing they can get sanctions removed by ending the war and improving relations with the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fourth, it could help nudge the aftermath of regime collapse in a positive direction.&lt;/strong&gt; Laying out a Western or European vision for Russia’s future now could mitigate paranoia about the West’s intentions within Russia if the regime collapses. The West could highlight that it does not seek the country’s breakup or the destruction of the state — especially given its tremendous concerns about the security of Russia’s nuclear arsenal, the potential for renewed ethno-national violence, and the threat of successionist movements as a result of a geopolitical vacuum. Acknowledging that the West would be eager to reengage post-Putin Russia happens to both be entirely accurate and may reassure future Russian leaders, political operators, and influencers that they do not have to fear renewed engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The path toward any potential partnership or reincorporation will entail a careful confidence-building dance in which each side, deeply skeptical of the other, gradually grows to trust the other’s intentions. This process broke down in the post–Cold War period, especially during Putin’s rise to and consolidation of power. Many nations, especially Russia’s neighbors, will be deeply skeptical of its potential rehabilitation and favor an uncompromising policy that weakens Russia or furthers its disintegration. While this skepticism may be warranted, the main U.S. objective in a post-Putin Russia would be to transform it from an anti-Western, revisionist actor into one that — even if not entirely Western-aligned — at least does not threaten its neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, engaging in the rhetoric of reconciliation does not mean softening sanctions, slowing military assistance to Ukraine, or delaying pursuit of war criminals. On the contrary, the regime, the elite, and the Russian public should know that the present path is a road to economic ruin, global pariah status, and military collapse — though such rhetoric should avoid stereotyping or characterizing Russians as irredeemable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critics might describe the discussion of a post Putin-Russia as the United States shifting to a policy of “regime change.” However, there is no point to pursuing regime change because the United States does not have the means to execute such a policy short of direct military intervention, which is unthinkable in the Russian context. Contrary to Putin’s vehement claims, the United States cannot cause “color revolutions.” All it and Europe can do is offer potential inclusion in the West should a country go down a democratic path. But that may be the biggest incentive of all; Ukraine’s 2014 Maidan Revolution, for instance, happened when people took to the streets to demand a European future. Since the Biden administration’s goal is to put pressure on the Putin regime, it is a logical extension to put ideological pressure on the Kremlin as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others might claim that talk of reincorporating Russia could let it off the hook for its crimes, arguing that Russia needs accountability for its actions. The problem with this argument is that bringing war criminals to trial and collecting potential reparations requires Russia’s willing participation, which will likely depend on Russia seeing a path or trajectory for cooperation with and inclusion in the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-a-liberal-democratic-russia-possible&quot;&gt;Is a Liberal Democratic Russia Possible?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is good reason to doubt the potential for a liberal democratic Russia that is not hostile to the West. Putin is in many ways a reflection of the Russian public. He is popular in no small measure because hardline nationalism is popular within Russia, while democracy remains badly stained by the political chaos and economic collapse of the 1990s, which led to the development of crony capitalism instead of a strong and vibrant market economy. Much of the Russian public has also been fed anti-Western propaganda for most of the past century. Thus, any new leader or regime might revert to a hardline nationalist posture in order to maintain public support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Russia might not be able to survive as a state without autocratic rule, as its multiethnic polity built through imperial conquest could fall apart without Moscow wielding uncompromising authority. Even if Russian leaders seek a democratic future, the country could still unravel. Russia could descend back into the lawless chaos of the 1990s, when mafia groups, armed oligarchs, and separatist movements took advantage of the weakened state. This is undoubtedly a concern, but Russia today is very different. In the early 1990s, it faced a difficult transition from a command economy to a free-market one, and the resulting economic collapse severely weakened Russian state capacity. By contrast, a move away from Putin could bring tremendous economic benefits. A new, more liberal regime in Moscow would not face the same struggles as in the 1990s. Moreover, though there is a real potential for a new wave of secessionist movements, it is counterbalanced by broader Russian patriotism, identity, and attachment to the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The odds are slim that Russia will choose a liberal, democratic, pro-Western path — even if the public were free to do so — but neither is it impossible. Although creating a multiethnic representative democracy in Russia, a country with a near-continuous autocratic history, seems far-fetched, similar things were said about Germany after World War II. Europe, a continent almost always at war throughout its history, came together in a federal union. While Russian NATO or EU membership currently seems implausible, the West should at least be open to the potential possibility, however slim or distant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has exposed the folly of the West’s excessive optimism about the “end of history” after the fall of the Soviet Union, particularly the vision that economic engagement would inevitably lead to democratic change. But that vision, while simplistic, was not contrived out of thin air. It was borne out of lessons of the post–World War II and the post–Cold War European experience. The West may be in danger of going too far in unlearning the lessons of its past and assuming its adversaries are intrinsically wicked and immune to the appeal of democracy. Part of the West’s strength is the belief that, on balance, systems in which people are free to select their leaders will do a better job overall than other forms of government. The West should not forget the inherent appeal of its free democratic system, which so worries autocrats because it inspires revolutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The West may be in danger of going too far in unlearning the lessons of its past and assuming its adversaries are intrinsically wicked and immune to the appeal of democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if the skeptics are right, which they may be, that Russia would never be incorporated into the West and is doomed to have an autocratic future, Western leaders should still convey an integrationist message to add pressure on the Putin regime and undermine its narrative about the war in Ukraine. Demonstrating that an alternative future is possible will likely do more to undermine Putin than any performative condemnations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the future of Russia will be determined by Russians, not by the West. However, it costs nothing to let Russians know that, if they pursue democracy, the West will embrace them. Such action might affect how Russians think about the Putin regime and their future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as rhetoric of retribution may feel justified, just as it did toward Germany after World Wars I and II, the smarter path focused on rehabilitation and integration. The West did not offer this out of generosity but because of geopolitical competition with the Soviet Union. Similarly, encouraging and incentivizing a post-Putin Russia to drop its anti-Western outlook and its malign revisionist approach to the international order would have profound geopolitical implications for the United States vis-à-vis China, European security, and the liberal world order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Significantly, the Soviet Union collapsed not when Reagan or the West had an iron fist but when they had an outstretched arm. The Green Movement in Iran erupted not when the United States was threatening to bomb the country but after a newly inaugurated President Obama addressed the Iranian people in a Nowruz message, offering a “new beginning” that became impossible when, three months later, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was reelected president under dubious circumstances. Correlation does not equal causation, but there is never one factor that causes revolution. Offering a segment of society hope for a better, more liberal future can have a powerful effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The war in Ukraine has had multiple impacts on the Korean peninsula. It has reminded South Korea of the strategic importance of the U.S.-ROK alliance as a buffer against hostility from outside powers, while also intensifying concerns about South Korea’s vulnerability as a nuclear-weapons-free power facing a nuclear-armed North Korea. For North Korea, the war in Ukraine seems to have amplified the importance of nuclear weapons for its security while prompting Pyongyang to consider a new “first-use” nuclear doctrine as well as the operational deployment of tactical nuclear weapons — imitating Putin’s tactics in Ukraine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The war in Ukraine has also produced a favorable external environment for North Korea’s continued development of its nuclear and missile programs. North Korea’s increasing weapons capabilities, its threats to use nuclear weapons for offensive purposes, and the vulnerability of U.S. national missile defense interceptors to North Korean multiple independent reentry vehicle technologies have led the South Koreans to question the credibility of U.S. extended deterrence.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Collectively, these shifts in the strategic landscape call for the United States and its allies to reexamine traditional approaches to the North Korea nuclear issue and devise ways to increase the credibility of U.S. extended deterrence. The recent election of South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol, whose positions on North Korea and regional issues align closely with those of the Biden administration, presents opportunities for the alliance to pursue new initiatives that will enhance the stability, security, and prosperity of the region.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This report presents actionable recommendations for navigating North Korea policy and strengthening U.S. extended deterrence during these uncertain times.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;on-north-korea&quot;&gt;ON NORTH KOREA&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea is unlikely to return to diplomacy until it achieves its weapons development goals explicated in recent speeches. Nonetheless, the allies should map out policies that prepare for whatever actions Pyongyang may take in the coming weeks and months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prepare for an eventual return to negotiations, with low expectations for short-term breakthroughs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Devise roadmaps toward complete and verifiable denuclearization that include interim steps to reduce threat levels and build confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Signal openness to diplomacy and continued readiness to talk without preconditions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhance defense, deterrence, and sanctions enforcement.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To strengthen deterrence and defense:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Resume &lt;strong&gt;joint military exercises&lt;/strong&gt; that had been suspended or downgraded in previous negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support South Korea’s military improvements&lt;/strong&gt;, including the Kill Chain, early deployment of Iron Dome, directed energy possibilities, upgraded ship-based defenses, and an additional Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery — moving South Korea to the top of the list for its purchase, given the urgency of the North Korean missile threat.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Expand &lt;strong&gt;U.S.-ROK space cooperation&lt;/strong&gt; to strengthen reconnaissance capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Do not, under current circumstances, deploy U.S. tactical nuclear weapons to the Korean peninsula nor condone the acquisition of nuclear weapons by South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Develop a &lt;strong&gt;broad counter-missile strategy&lt;/strong&gt; that focuses on detecting and defending against North Korean missiles and launchers, disrupting its capability networks, and destroying its launchers and missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Investigate new concepts of missile defense, such as boost-phase systems that would help overcome the limitations of current systems.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Increase &lt;strong&gt;trilateral defense coordination&lt;/strong&gt; among the United States, South Korea, and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Reinstate the Trilateral Consultation and Oversight Group as a regular channel of communication and policy coordination on North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Consider additional forms of military cooperation to deter North Korea, including information sharing, anti-submarine warfare, missile defense, contingency planning, and regular trilateral exercises.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bolster sanctions enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Lead efforts, together with Japan, to &lt;strong&gt;enforce existing North Korea sanctions&lt;/strong&gt;, including deterring illegal ship-to-ship transfers and pressuring countries to return North Korean laborers working overseas in violation of international sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Be ready to offer &lt;strong&gt;sanctions lifting but only for substantive and difficult-to-reverse steps&lt;/strong&gt; on denuclearization by North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Expand secondary sanctions against China and Russia if they do not comply with UN Security Council Resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communicate positions on humanitarian assistance and human rights as separate from denuclearization diplomacy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider immediate humanitarian assistance to North Korea through the international aid community to improve conditions for North Korean citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Appoint a U.S. special envoy for North Korean human rights.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;on-us-extended-deterrence&quot;&gt;ON U.S. EXTENDED DETERRENCE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. extended deterrence commitment to South Korea involves two central purposes: to deter North Korean aggression, and to prevent nuclear proliferation. The commitment has physical and psychological aspects that both affect its credibility. As such, &lt;strong&gt;extended deterrence requires consistent U.S. demonstrations and assurances of both capabilities and will.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid policies that put the two purposes of extended deterrence into conflict&lt;/strong&gt;, for instance, by advancing deterrence but setting back nonproliferation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provide reassurance and clarification on existing and new U.S. capabilities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Emphasize that the U.S.-ROK “community of fate” — referring to the 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea that tie the country together with the United States strategically — forms the core of extended deterrence, regardless of additional U.S. capabilities that may be introduced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improve joint planning and execution.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create a &lt;strong&gt;framework for joint nuclear planning&lt;/strong&gt;, similar to a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) planning group.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sustain practices such as sending a senior South Korean liaison officer to U.S. Strategic Command.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reactivate the high-level Extended Deterrence Strategy and Consultation Group (EDSCG).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Streamline protocols for direct Space-Based Infrared System access to South Korea in addition to the geographic commanders, as the United States does for Israel and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supplement U.S. extended deterrence dialogues with South Korea and Japan with a &lt;strong&gt;track 1.5 trilateral strategic exchange&lt;/strong&gt; in order to stay informed about developments in each country and identify opportunities for coordination&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pursue U.S. military adjustments and improvements.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Change the regional strategic and nuclear posture to allow for more robust and constant demonstrations of U.S. capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This could entail the continuous presence in the region of either U.S. submarines equipped with nuclear cruise missiles or strategic bombers or investing in infrastructure in South Korea to receive U.S. dual-capable aircraft.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Improve U.S. national missile defense capabilities vis-à-vis North Korea, including through accelerating plans to deploy interceptors equipped with Next Generation Interceptor technology and investing in boost-phase missile defense technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Restore funds for and continue pursuing the U.S. nuclear sea-launched cruise missile program.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lay pre-decisional groundwork for possible redeployment of U.S. low-yield nuclear weapons at some point in the future.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider allied tabletop planning exercises that would be explicitly pre-decisional and leave the timeline and scope of weapons deliberately ambiguous.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Calibrate decisionmaking to shifts in the security environment and the North Korean threat level.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reorienting-the-alliance-in-a-shifting-global-landscape&quot;&gt;Reorienting the Alliance in a Shifting Global Landscape&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world is experiencing a number of tectonic shifts that present new challenges for the U.S.-ROK (Republic of Korea) alliance and reinforce its importance as a basis for peace and stability in Northeast Asia. The aftershocks of the Covid-19 pandemic have roiled international commercial markets and raised new questions about supply chain resilience, prompting major industries to consider fundamental changes to future plans. Chinese president Xi Jinping’s increasingly active management of China’s economy is creating new geopolitical risks for international businesses. And tightening relations between China and Russia — solidified with Xi and Vladimir Putin’s declaration at the Beijing Olympics of a partnership with “no limits” — point to a global geopolitical realignment that will be reinforced by economic trends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine, following Russia’s unprovoked invasion on February 24, has monumentally impacted world politics and Asia. The war has made Russia weaker militarily and economically (due to the impact of unprecedented sanctions) but also more dangerous, as a declining power willing to take on more risks. China’s support for Russia has diminished its soft power as a defender of sovereignty and territorial integrity while increasing its vulnerability to secondary sanctions it cannot afford due to its own mounting economic problems. And the United States is now focused on Europe and needs to recalibrate its global strategy even as China remains its pacing threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the world becomes more bifurcated between authoritarian and democratic powers, the war in Ukraine has several implications for the United States and its allies: a shifting balance of power due to Russia’s decline; complication of Xi’s designs on Taiwan given Moscow’s multiple failures and heavy sanctions; greater U.S. and Japanese attention to reinforcing deterrence in the Taiwan Strait; greater cohesion among democratic countries; heightened unity of purpose and appreciation for the liberal international order as a foundation for global peace and stability; and the undermining of the Xi-Putin narrative that the future lies with China and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This degree of change presents a perilous and uncharted landscape but also new opportunities for coalition building for Washington and Seoul to navigate in the coming months. Since this group last met in early 2021, the U.S.-ROK alliance has made significant progress in tackling some of the headwinds that have previously held the relationship back from its full potential. During the early months of the Biden administration, contentious issues such as negotiations over the Special Measures Agreement were resolved, paving the way for a successful summit between Presidents Joe Biden and Moon Jae-in in May 2021 and the release of a comprehensive U.S.-ROK Leaders’ Joint Statement that advocated for deeper cooperation across several dimensions of the relationship. The recent election of South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol, whose positions on Japan, North Korea, China, and Indo-Pacific strategy align closely with Washington, will enhance the alliance’s effectiveness in dealing with the region’s most pressing challenges. The successful first summit of the two leaders in May 2022 laid out an ambitious agenda for Washington and Seoul as President Yoon seeks to build South Korea’s role as a global player and supporter of the rules-based international order. Channeling these shared perspectives into concrete initiatives that will enhance the stability, security, and prosperity of the region during a period of compounding uncertainties will be the central challenge for the alliance in the year ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;This degree of change presents a perilous and uncharted landscape but also new opportunities for coalition building for Washington and Seoul to navigate in the coming months.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications-of-the-war-in-ukraine-for-the-korean-peninsula&quot;&gt;Implications of the War in Ukraine for the Korean Peninsula&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to its broader global and regional implications, the war in Ukraine has had multiple impacts on the Korean peninsula, with varied takeaways for the alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For South Korea, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sparked a strong response at the societal level — with individuals and civic groups rallying to support Ukraine and condemn Russia’s actions — as well as a strengthened appreciation for the importance of liberal values in a country’s foreign policy to promote stability and security. The war has also reminded South Koreans of the strategic importance of the U.S.-ROK alliance, grounded in shared values as well as security guarantees that decrease the chances that South Korea will find itself in Ukraine’s situation. For alliance managers in Seoul and Washington, the war in Ukraine has validated the importance of focusing on military readiness before a threat is realized, rather than after. All of these effects should help to fortify the U.S.-ROK alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the war in Ukraine has intensified concerns among South Koreans about their vulnerability as a nuclear-weapons-free power facing a nuclear-armed North Korea, particularly given the possibility that new leadership in the United States in the coming years might, again, consider U.S. troop withdrawals as the Trump administration did. While the Yoon government will manage this concern through strengthening extended deterrence with the United States and trilateral coordination with the United States and Japan, policy discussions within South Korea are likely to continue to feature a range of suggestions to reduce South Korea’s vulnerability, such as the rotation of dual-use strategic assets, redeployment of U.S. tactical nuclear weapons, and introduction of a nuclear sharing plan on the peninsula in the style of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine seems to have underscored for North Korea the importance of nuclear weapons for its security. Whether this is the correct conclusion or not, the regime reiterated its nuclear ambitions in April 2022, thereby decreasing prospects for denuclearization. North Korea drew a similar lesson from the Iraq, Libya, and Afghanistan cases. Again, whether correct or not, North Korean officials stated with conviction during the Six Party Talks in 2006 that the United States would not have attacked a nuclear-armed Iraq or Afghanistan (implying the same for a nuclear-armed North Korea).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea has also noted Putin’s threat to use nuclear weapons to deter NATO’s intervention in Ukraine. At a military parade on April 25, Kim Jong-un noted that “our nukes can never be confined to the single mission of war deterrent” and suggested that he would consider the pre-emptive use of these weapons to deter threats from outside forces or to gain superiority in a conventional conflict. These statements seemed to reveal a new “first-use” nuclear doctrine for Pyongyang in which the threat of nuclear weapons could be used to deter the United States from intervening in any armed conflict on the Korean peninsula, mirroring Putin’s moves in Ukraine. The possibility of North Korea’s development and operational deployment of tactical nuclear weapons, in particular, has heightened concerns among South Koreans regarding the reliability of U.S. extended deterrence and amplified calls for the redeployment of U.S. tactical nuclear weapons on the peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final implication of the war in Ukraine for Korea is the favorable external environment it has produced for North Korea’s continued development of its nuclear and missile programs. Previously, Beijing and Moscow were willing to join forces with the United States and its allies to punish North Korea following its provocations, even as they helped North Korea evade sanctions. Since the start of the war in Ukraine, however, Beijing and Moscow have refused to enforce existing sanctions and vetoed any further actions against North Korea in the UN Security Council. Given this situation, additional nuclear tests by North Korea would be unlikely to prompt a serious reaction from China and Russia. This marks a critical juncture in regional dynamics — with Beijing and Moscow now viewing Pyongyang’s provocations more as a means to gain advantages over Washington than a concerning threat to regional stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collectively, these shifts in the strategic landscape call for the United States and its allies to (1) reexamine traditional approaches to the nuclear issue in the diplomatic and military realms and (2) devise ways to enhance the credibility of U.S. extended deterrence in order to reduce South Korea’s (and Japan’s) sense of vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;north-koreas-actions-and-objectives&quot;&gt;North Korea’s Actions and Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pyongyang was relatively quiet during the first year of the Biden administration. This could be a result of severe internal difficulties due to its strict Covid-19 lockdown and ongoing economic challenges or because it wanted to find out if the Biden administration might consider lifting the sanctions that Pyongyang had aimed to negotiate an end to during the failed 2019 Hanoi summit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the start of 2022, however, North Korea has embarked on an extensive missile testing campaign, conducting missile launches on 22 separate occasions, ranging from short-range hypersonic missiles to intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). These tests have helped North Korea make significant advances toward its aim of achieving a reliable capability to penetrate U.S. missile defenses and strike the U.S. homeland. Pyongyang could then use this capability to deter a U.S. attack on North Korea while generating doubts among U.S. allies in the region that Washington would put one of its own cities at risk by responding to a North Korean attack on an ally. North Korea also likely aspires to employ tactical nuclear weapons as an asymmetric capability to fundamentally change the balance of power on the Korean peninsula in its favor, enabling Pyongyang to dictate the terms of interaction with South Korea in the economic, security, and political spheres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kim Jong-un laid out his weapons development objectives in unusual detail in his January 2021 remarks at the Eighth Party Congress of the Workers Party of Korea (see Box 1). At the April 25 military parade, Kim reiterated his determination to improve the country’s nuclear capabilities “in terms of both quality and scale.” His ultimate goal is to achieve credible, albeit rudimentary capabilities to build three legs of a potential nuclear triad, as well as a tactical nuclear weapons capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 1: Excerpts from Summary of Kim Jong-un’s Remarks on Weapons Development during the January 2021 Eighth Party Congress of the Workers’ Party of Korea&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recalling that the Party Central Committee decided to develop a global strike rocket with more powerful warheads and an improved warhead control system and carried out this historic task by relying on the patriotism and loyalty of national defence scientists, the report affirmed that the new-type gigantic rocket on an 11-axis self-propelled launcher displayed during the military parade in celebration of the 75th founding anniversary of the Party fully demonstrated the ultra-modernity and great striking capability of our nuclear force.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The national defence science sector developed the super-large MLRS, a super-power attack weapon the world’s weaponry field had never known, and proceeded to develop ultra-modern tactical nuclear weapons including new-type tactical rockets and intermediate-range cruise missiles whose conventional warheads are the most powerful in the world.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The report also noted that in the period under review the sector of national defence scientific research was conducting research into perfecting the guidance technology for [a] multi-warhead rocket at the final stage, finished research into developing warheads of different combat missions including the hypersonic gliding flight warheads for new-type ballistic rockets and was making preparations for their test manufacture.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The report made public with pride that the standard of the goal in the modernization of medium-sized submarine was set correctly and it was remodeled experimentally to open up a bright prospect for remarkably enhancing the existing subsurface operational capabilities of our navy, that the design of new nuclear-powered submarine was researched and was in the stage of final examination and the designing of various electronic weapons, unmanned striking equipment, means of reconnaissance and detection and military reconnaissance satellite were completed, and that other achievements were made in national defence research of gigantic significance in developing the People’s Army into a powerful one with the strongest military muscle in the world.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It is necessary to develop the nuclear technology to a higher level and make nuclear weapons smaller and lighter for more tactical uses. This will make it possible to develop tactical nuclear weapons to be used as various means according to the purposes of operational duty and targets of strike in modern warfare, and continuously push ahead with the production of super-sized nuclear warheads.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The report also set a goal of attaining an advanced capability for making a preemptive and retaliatory nuclear strike by further raising the rate of precision good enough to strike and annihilate any strategic targets within a range of 15,000 kilometres with pinpoint accuracy.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;And the tasks were brought up to develop and introduce hypersonic gliding flight warheads in a short period, push ahead with the development of solid-fuel engine-propelled inter- continental underwater and ground ballistic rockets as scheduled, and possess a nuclear- powered submarine and an underwater-launch nuclear strategic weapon which will be of great importance in raising the long-range nuclear striking capability.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The report also referred to the need to secure the ability of reconnaissance and information gathering based on operation of a military reconnaissance satellite in the near future, and conduct in real earnest the most important research to develop reconnaissance drones and other means of reconnaissance capable of precisely reconnoitering up to 500 km deep into the front.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Making the military equipment intelligent, precise, unmanned, high-performance and light should be set as the priority target of the munitions industry, and research and development be oriented to this end.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korean behavior and rhetoric suggest that missile and nuclear tests will continue in the coming weeks and months. Externally, as noted above, North Korea faces a favorable environment for weapons development, with the United States focused on the war in Ukraine and China and Russia more closely aligned and unwilling to impose sanctions on North Korea following provocations. China and Russia are also as amenable as ever to facilitating North Korea’s evasion of sanctions so that Pyongyang can acquire necessary components for its weapons programs. The intensification of U.S.-China competition also benefits North Korea, as China is more willing to support North Korea, regardless of its behavior, in order to secure Pyongyang’s allegiance against the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internally, North Korea is dealing with a deepening economic crisis and poor health conditions, made more severe by the outbreak of Covid-19. These hardships also incentivize continued testing because displays of military prowess can help the regime boost loyalty and morale among the population during difficult times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;North Korea faces a favorable environment for weapons development, with the United States focused on the war in Ukraine and China and Russia more closely aligned and unwilling to impose sanctions on North Korea following provocations.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, North Korea’s continued military provocations serve to increase the possibility of drawing the newly elected Yoon administration and the alliance into a crisis that could lead to sanctions relief or other concessions desired by North Korea. Even absent a crisis, continued testing will increase North Korea’s potential bargaining leverage for an eventual return to diplomacy. Most experts agree that Pyongyang is not likely to return to diplomacy anytime soon. However, after North Korea is satisfied with its capability advancements, it may attempt to negotiate a testing moratorium in exchange for sanctions relief. Ending sanctions likely remains the top aim for Pyongyang. Among other things, it would relieve pressure on the regime following its ill-fated efforts to rebuild the economy through a path of “self-reliance,” which remains unlikely to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specific capabilities to watch for in upcoming tests include continued nuclear testing (perhaps of a smaller, lighter weapon that could fit on top of a missile); multiple independent reentry vehicles (key to frustrating the missile defense systems of opponents); additional tests of submarine-launched ballistic missiles; and development of air-launched cruise missiles (an additional leg of a potential North Korean triad).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;building-core-strategic-principles-to-guide-north-korea-policy&quot;&gt;Building Core Strategic Principles to Guide North Korea Policy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike President Biden’s China strategy, as elucidated by Secretary of State Antony Blinken on May 26, 2022, the administration has not provided a full public explication of its North Korea strategy. The classified policy review by the government completed in spring 2021 has not yet been presented in a speech or document. Nevertheless, some of the core tenets of the policy can be gleaned from statements by administration officials. First, the United States seeks complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. Second, the basis of any policy is a position of strength based on enhanced military readiness and improved defense and deterrence capabilities. Third, the United States is not opposed to diplomacy; on the contrary, it is willing to engage “any time, any place, anywhere” with North Korea, without preconditions. The focus of diplomacy is not an “everything for everything” deal of the type sought by former president Donald Trump, though the United States is willing to pick up the themes laid out in the first Trump-Kim summit and the Singapore Declaration of 2018 (i.e., denuclearization, peace regime, normalization of political relations, and return of prisoners of war/missing in action [POW/MIA] remains). The administration is not continuing the “strategic patience” policies of non-dialogue during the Obama years. Instead, officials describe their policy as a pragmatic, calibrated approach based on substantive negotiations aimed at denuclearization. The current state of non-dialogue in the negotiations, resembling the Obama years, is not for lack of U.S. efforts but stems from the absence of interest from North Korea (reportedly, nearly 20 attempts have been made by the Biden administration). Fourth, Biden has not ruled out a meeting with the North Korean leader provided that it would cap a serious and substantive negotiation and deliverable. Fifth, the United States is open to humanitarian assistance that would help North Koreans, and this assistance would not be tied to progress on denuclearization. Sixth, the United States supports Japan’s desire for a satisfactory resolution of the abduction issue and a return to the Pyongyang Declaration of September 17, 2002.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having assumed office only in May 2022, the newly elected Yoon administration outlined its “audacious” plan (담대한 구상/damdaehan gusang) for denuclearization in August 2022. First, the goal is the complete and irreversible denuclearization of North Korea. Second, South Korea seeks stronger military readiness with the United States and a bolstering of extended deterrence capabilities. Third, in achieving denuclearization, the government will undertake a “principled” approach that involves employing pressure for denuclearization and nonproliferation, as well as sanctions for human rights abuses in North Korea, but also offering North Korea economic benefits and political normalization. Related to the latter point, the fourth tenet is that South Korea supports a peace regime, but only as the exit point to diplomacy, not the entry point. Fifth, South Korea supports humanitarian engagement and a “green” détente in inter-Korean environment and ecology issues, separate from denuclearization negotiations. This includes the provision of food and medicine in return for minerals purchases, as well as support for transportation and energy infrastructure development in North Korea, with a firm commitment from Pyongyang to denuclearization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though offered in different frames, the Biden and Yoon approaches to North Korea share many similarities — more than between Biden and the previous South Korean government — in terms of the core goals of denuclearization, sanctions pressure, and bolstered defense and deterrence capabilities. At the May 2022 summit meeting, the two leaders demonstrated the overlap in their policies. As President Yoon noted in his opening remarks at the joint press conference following the summit meeting, “We, as the leaders of the two countries, reiterated our common goal of the complete denuclearization of the DPRK. There is no compromise for security. Under this shared belief, we concurred that strong deterrence against North Korea is paramount.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s disinterest in engagement should not discourage allied action. Whether diplomacy returns tomorrow or one year from now, the allies should internalize key strategic principles and map out policies going forward. With the election of the Yoon government, there is a moment of policy unity between Washington and Seoul that should be used to prepare for whatever actions Pyongyang may take in the coming weeks and months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;With the election of the Yoon government, there is a moment of policy unity between Washington and Seoul that should be used to prepare for whatever actions Pyongyang may take in the coming weeks and months.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;policy-recommendations-on-north-korea&quot;&gt;Policy Recommendations on North Korea&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategic-principles&quot;&gt;Strategic Principles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following strategic principles should guide allied policies with respect to North Korea. Agreement on and internalization of these principles will ensure that, amid the coming unexpected twists and turns of diplomacy, crises, and even conflict, the two allies will remain focused on key common goals and preservation of a strong, united alliance. Straying from these principles for short-term gains is not in the mutual interests of Seoul and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ultimate policy objective is to achieve complete and irreversible denuclearization.&lt;/strong&gt; While there may be interim steps along the way, the two allies should work toward this final goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There should be no surprises between the allies.&lt;/strong&gt; The temptation to engage in and attain marginal benefits from secret bilateral negotiations with North Korea (part of Pyongyang’s tactics to split the U.S.-ROK alliance) should be weighed against the damage done to trust in the alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The core of any negotiation strategy with North Korea is a strong alliance, measured in terms of readiness and defense and deterrence capabilities.&lt;/strong&gt; Neither ally should be willing to trade away alliance equities (e.g., cessation of military exercises) for short-term steps by North Korea. Strong U.S.-Korea-Japan trilateral policy coordination is an integral part of defense and deterrence capabilities. The allies should devise a range of actions to maintain the credibility of U.S. extended deterrence under shifting conditions (detailed further in the following section).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The United States and South Korea will support inter-Korean engagement that is accomplished in conjunction with steps on denuclearization.&lt;/strong&gt; While South Korea should have some leeway to pursue engagement with North Korea, both allies must internalize that there will be no true peace and reconciliation on the Korean peninsula without the removal of the nuclear threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The United States and South Korea will support humanitarian assistance and improved human rights in North Korea separate from denuclearization.&lt;/strong&gt; Such assistance, monitored by the international community, helps improve the human condition and conveys compassion and non-hostile intent on the part of the United States to the North Korean people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The core of any negotiation strategy with North Korea is a strong alliance, measured in terms of readiness and defense and deterrence capabilities.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The North Korean nuclear threat is a regional and global security problem.&lt;/strong&gt; While the United States and South Korea are key interlocutors, the nuclear threat engages the interests of all actors in the region, as well as the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the United Nations. The allies should seek to engage new partners in the region and beyond who have the means and will to increase pressure on North Korea to denuclearize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China is a critical player on denuclearization, but the United States and South Korea should not depend on Beijing’s cooperation or cave to Chinese pressure tactics.&lt;/strong&gt; Given that China’s interests with respect to North Korea have increasingly diverged from those of the United States and South Korea, Chinese pushback should be anticipated and Beijing should not be expected to act with regard to anything but short-term self-interest and transactional politics. Allied actions to strengthen deterrence vis-à-vis North Korea will complicate China’s regional ambitions, potentially prompting Beijing to reconsider its permissive attitude toward Pyongyang’s provocations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;specific-north-korea-policies-pursuant-to-the-principles&quot;&gt;SPECIFIC NORTH KOREA POLICIES (PURSUANT TO THE PRINCIPLES)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because North Korea is unlikely to return to diplomacy until it achieves its weapons development goals, the United States and South Korea should pursue policies along three tracks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prepare for an eventual return to negotiations, with low expectations for short-term breakthroughs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enhance defense and deterrence capabilities and sanctions enforcement to both protect against North Korea’s growing threats and negotiate from a position of strength, if and when Pyongyang returns to dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Communicate positions on humanitarian assistance and human rights as separate from denuclearization diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prepare for an eventual return to negotiations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Devise roadmaps toward complete and verifiable denuclearization.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In pursuit of the goal of denuclearization, parties should consider interim steps that reduce the threat and build confidence among distrustful counterparts in the negotiation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These interim steps could start with a missile (including long- and short-range options) and nuclear weapons test ban in return for partial sanctions lifting (with snapback clauses) and interim energy provision.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;While reaching an agreement on a test ban will not be easy, this interim goal is more achievable than other possible measures, such as a freeze on fissile material production that would require North Korean cooperation for verification.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once a testing freeze is achieved, a separate but parallel political dialogue channel should be opened to address issues outside of the denuclearization negotiation, including mutual threat reduction, political normalization, the return of POW/MIA remains, and a peace regime.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The denuclearization channel should focus on next steps after the freeze, including the phased, verified shutdown and eventual disablement and dismantlement of key fissile material and nuclear weapons production facilities. This would be followed by declaration of fissile material and warheads in preparation for disablement, dismantlement, and removal.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A separate negotiation should be instituted that focuses on missile technology control and inspection of undeclared North Korean missile bases.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States and South Korea should consider a Nunn-Lugar-type program for scientific talent in North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States and South Korea should require China to carry its fair share of the costs associated with any energy assistance incorporated in a shutdown of North Korea’s programs and facilities, ensuring that China’s financial and reputational well-being are at stake with any North Korean noncompliance&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Signal openness to diplomacy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States should appoint a full-time special representative for North Korea. Even in the absence of negotiations, the envoy could work to coordinate potential roadmaps for North Korea’s denuclearization among key stakeholders in Washington, Seoul, and Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States and South Korea should continue to express a willingness to engage with North Korea. This could involve sending joint communications from senior envoys indicating a readiness to talk without preconditions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enhance defense, deterrence, and sanctions enforcement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthen defense and deterrence.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States and South Korea should resume joint military exercises to enhance military readiness. These have been suspended or downgraded as part of previous negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The allies should consider expansion of the scope and nature of exercises, particularly those elements that improve the extended deterrence commitment for dealing with a nuclear North Korea. These improvements need not be publicized.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The allies should not trade a cessation of military exercises for a reversible test ban by North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States should support South Korea’s military improvements, including the “Kill Chain,” early deployment of Iron Dome, an additional Korean Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery, directed energy possibilities, and upgraded ship-based defenses.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The United States should include South Korea in its efforts to develop an “all-in-one” sensor that would integrate listening, communicating, jamming, and injecting functions.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The United States should move South Korea to the top of the list for purchase of a THAAD battery, given the urgency of the North Korean missile threat.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The United States should also consider potentially allowing South Korea to station some of its assets on U.S. bases, such as allowing South Korea to acquire and deploy dual-capable fighters in Guam, if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States and South Korea should update their wartime operation plans, establishing new military directives to incorporate broader conflict scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;U.S.-ROK space cooperation should be expanded in order to enhance reconnaissance capabilities to detect and deter North Korean threats.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The allies should not under current circumstances redeploy U.S. tactical nuclear weapons to the Korean peninsula nor condone the acquisition of nuclear weapons by South Korea (the latter comports with the policy of the allied government).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Support for these policy options within South Korea is driven, in part, by doubts regarding the credibility of U.S. extended deterrence. This can be addressed through alternative policy initiatives that avoid the downsides of these options (detailed in the following section).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhance counter-missile strategy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The allies should develop a broad counter-missile strategy that focuses on detecting and defending against North Korean missiles and launchers, disrupting its capability networks, and destroying its launchers and missiles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As an element of this strategy, the allies should strengthen missile defense coordination. This is essential given North Korea’s advances in its missile defense evasion capabilities and the legacy technologies that the United States currently relies on to counter the North Korean ICBM threat to the homeland.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The allies should work to harden potential targets of North Korean missile strikes in South Korea, including critical infrastructure and other facilities in the greater Seoul metropolitan area.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The allies should also investigate new concepts of missile defense, such as boost-phase systems, in their nascent phases, which would help to overcome the limitations of current U.S. missile defense systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase trilateral defense cooperation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States, South Korea, and Japan should reinstate the Trilateral Consultation and Oversight Group as a regular channel of communication and policy coordination on North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The three allies should consider additional forms of military cooperation to deter a nuclear North Korea, including information sharing, anti-submarine warfare, missile defense, contingency planning, and regular trilateral exercises to develop and demonstrate combined capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The three countries’ recent agreement to resume joint missile early warning exercises, which could include the interception of a dummy North Korean missile, is a step in the right direction.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To improve transparency, South Korea and Japan should engage in trilateral briefings about their respective defense improvement plans as well as developments related to extended deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bolster sanctions enforcement.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States and South Korea, together with Japan, should lead efforts to enforce existing sanctions on North Korea, including deterring illegal ship-to-ship transfers by North Korea and pressuring countries to return North Korean laborers working overseas in violation of international sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The allies should be ready to offer sanctions lifting but only for substantive and difficult-to-reverse steps on denuclearization by North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States and South Korea must step up pressures on China and Russia to enforce UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) sanctions against North Korea, including trigger clauses in those resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Should China and Russia not comply with UNSCRs, the United States should expand secondary sanctions against China and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Increase support for humanitarian assistance and human rights.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States and South Korea should consider immediate humanitarian assistance to North Korea through the international aid community to help improve the conditions for North Korean citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Covid-19 vaccines, cold-chain storage, personal protective equipment, and test kits are necessary to mitigate the current spread of Covid-19 inside of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The border lockdown, which has been in place for 33 months, has generated the need for additional assistance in food and medicines.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States should support the South Korean government’s proposal for a “green détente” dialogue with North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States must appoint a special envoy for North Korean human rights.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States and South Korea should jointly advocate for North Korean human rights by co-sponsoring North Korean human rights resolutions in the United Nations and taking every available opportunity to speak up on this issue there and at other fora.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The two governments should also support NGO initiatives to increase the North Korean population’s access to outside information and enforce the implementation of existing human rights-related sanctions.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;policy-recommendations-on-us-extended-deterrence&quot;&gt;Policy Recommendations on U.S. Extended Deterrence&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-present-and-future-of-extended-deterrence&quot;&gt;The Present and Future of Extended Deterrence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. extended deterrence commitment to South Korea refers to Washington’s pledge to devote the full range of its military capabilities, including nuclear weapons, to deter and, if necessary, defeat an external attack on South Korea. It involves two central purposes: to deter North Korean aggression in all of its forms, and to prevent nuclear proliferation by providing South Korea with an alternative to developing its own nuclear weapons to meet its security needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This commitment has physical and psychological aspects that both affect its credibility.&lt;/strong&gt; Acquiring and demonstrating the military capabilities the United States needs to protect South Korea from North Korean threats is critical but insufficient. For extended deterrence to be effective, North and South Korea must also believe that the United States is willing to use these capabilities to defend its allies — even if it means risking Washington, D.C., or New York to save Seoul or Tokyo. As such, &lt;strong&gt;extended deterrence requires consistent U.S. demonstrations and assurances of both capabilities and will.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;North Korea’s increasing weapons capabilities, its threats to use nuclear weapons for offensive purposes, and the vulnerability of U.S. national missile defense interceptors to North Korean multiple independent re-entry vehicle technologies have led the South Koreans to question the credibility of U.S. extended deterrence in recent years.&lt;/strong&gt; In general, doubts regarding the credibility of extended deterrence can be expected to grow whenever North Korea’s capability or will to attack South Korea or the U.S. homeland exceeds the United States’ (actual or perceived) capability or will to defend South Korea from an external attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future developments could further heighten doubts regarding the credibility of U.S. extended deterrence.&lt;/strong&gt; For instance, if a &lt;strong&gt;new U.S. administration&lt;/strong&gt; comes to power &lt;strong&gt;that does not place alliances at the center of its regional strategy&lt;/strong&gt; (similar to the Trump administration’s approach in questioning the need for U.S. troops in South Korea) &lt;strong&gt;or returns to a policy of strategic patience&lt;/strong&gt;, questions about the will of the United States to uphold its extended deterrence commitments will proliferate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China’s growing military capabilities also loom in the background of this picture.&lt;/strong&gt; China’s military modernization efforts in recent decades have been a focus of U.S. regional policy writ large but not a target for U.S.-ROK deterrence policies on the Korean peninsula. This is because the perceived risk of China using its military to either invade South Korea directly or support a second North Korean invasion has been deemed to be low since the end of the Korean War. After all, an outbreak of militarized hostilities on the peninsula would significantly increase the chances of two destabilizing developments that Beijing seeks to avoid: U.S. troops mobilizing near the North Korea–China border and a severe humanitarian crisis on its doorstep. Even considering China’s increasingly unhelpful behavior with respect to North Korea since the start of the war in Ukraine, these general assumptions regarding China’s aversion to militarized hostilities on the Korean peninsula remain sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this could change if China perceived that renewed conflict on the peninsula had a good chance of severing, rather than unifying, the alliance. This would decrease the likelihood of U.S. troops on its border and open new possibilities for China to increase its influence on the peninsula. These types of hypothetical scenarios are on the minds of South Koreans as they consider the possibility that future U.S. administrations could downgrade the importance of alliances, thereby increasing the chance that South Korea will be left to fend for itself against North Korea and China. The relevance of Chinese military capabilities for South Korea’s security has also increased in recent years in light of Beijing’s increasing tendency to view Seoul’s defensive postures vis-à-vis North Korea as directed at China, showcased in its actions to punish South Korea for the THAAD battery deployment in 2017. There is a strong possibility that Beijing will use similar logic to argue that any future U.S. moves to improve U.S. national missile defenses against North Korea are actually efforts to deter China, thereby injecting broader concerns about strategic stability into the picture. These scenarios — both hypothetical and real — point to the need to factor the evolving significance of China’s military capabilities for the Korean peninsula into discussions about the future of extended deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strategic-principles-1&quot;&gt;STRATEGIC PRINCIPLES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Efforts to strengthen U.S. extended deterrence should be guided by an acknowledgement of its dual purpose (deterrence and nonproliferation) and nature (physical and psychological), as well as a firm understanding of the conditions that have caused, or are likely to cause, South Koreans or others to question its credibility.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The psychological question of how to build trust and belief in U.S. extended deterrence is a good place to start in devising new initiatives. After all, the issue that has perhaps the highest potential to divide the allies in the coming months — whether to redeploy U.S. tactical nuclear weapons on the peninsula — is driven more by psychological than by physical factors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Avoid policies that put the two purposes of extended deterrence into conflict, for instance, by advancing deterrence but setting back nonproliferation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ensure that policies designed to enhance credibility respond directly to the specific factors undermining credibility at that time and do not create new military dilemmas.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The psychological question of how to build trust and belief in U.S. extended deterrence is a good place to start in devising new initiatives.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New extended deterrence policies should not lose sight of the fact that the U.S.-ROK “community of fate” is and will remain at the heart of U.S. security commitments to South Korea.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “community of fate” refers to the 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea that tie the country together with the United States strategically, ensuring that North Korea cannot use nuclear weapons or attack South Korea conventionally without killing Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This community of fate links events on the ground to the U.S. nuclear umbrella and makes it credible, thereby forming the core of extended deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anything the allies do to enhance extended deterrence should aim to build on the community of fate, not displace it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;specific-extended-deterrence-policies-pursuant-to-the-principles&quot;&gt;SPECIFIC EXTENDED DETERRENCE POLICIES (PURSUANT TO THE PRINCIPLES)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policies to strengthen U.S. extended deterrence should be pursued along six general tracks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Public communications;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Joint planning and execution;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trilateral discussions and operations;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;U.S. military adjustments and improvements;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pre-decisional groundwork to prepare for the possible future deployment of U.S. tactical nuclear weapons; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Coordinating positions on China.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these efforts will help to bolster the psychological or physical aspects of extended deterrence, often simultaneously, by showcasing U.S. capabilities and will to uphold its commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Public Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provide reassurance and clarification on existing and new U.S. capabilities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States should continue to broadcast at the highest levels its commitment to provide extended deterrence to South Korea using “the full range of U.S. defense capabilities, including nuclear, conventional, and missile defense capabilities,” as President Biden did in the May 2022 U.S.-ROK Leaders’ Joint Statement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When referencing the “full range of U.S. defense capabilities,” the United States should emphasize that the U.S.-ROK “community of fate” — anchored in the presence of 28,500 U.S. troops on the peninsula — forms the core of extended deterrence, regardless of additional U.S. capabilities that may be introduced.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Public communications should acknowledge quiet alliance conversations about the potential redeployment of U.S. tactical nuclear weapons and possible preliminary measures (see point 5 below) while stressing that the allies would not commit to deployment without careful consideration of the downsides.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Improve joint planning and execution.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The allies should take a number of steps to improve joint planning and the execution of various aspects of extended deterrence, including:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Create a framework for joint nuclear planning. This would be similar to a NATO planning group for nuclear weapons use, with planning conducted bilaterally and trilaterally (with Japan) and control remaining in the hands of the United States. Experts see this as one of the most critical steps to developing stronger bonds of trust between the allies in the current environment.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sustain practices such as sending a senior South Korean liaison officer to U.S. Strategic Command. This practice began a few years ago and gives South Korea a presence inside the key headquarters that plans for and executes any use of nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Reactivate the high-level Extended Deterrence Strategy and Consultation Group (EDSCG) as soon as possible. This will help in generating combined assessments of the risk of strategic deterrence failure and in setting policies that mobilize specific responses to these assessments.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Streamline the protocols for direct Space-Based Infrared System access to South Korea in addition to the geographic commanders, as the United States does for Israel and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Revive track 1.5 unclassified dialogues in parallel with EDSCG meetings to incorporate a broader range of perspectives and potentially involve participants from Japan and other strategic partners, such as Australia, the United Kingdom, and France.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Potentially explore the prospects for multilateral nuclear umbrella guarantees by engaging other like-minded partners, such as the United Kingdom and France.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Expand trilateral operations and discussions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The allies should welcome new opportunities to bring together U.S.-Japan and U.S.-South Korea discussions and exercises related to extended deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Even though the state of the debate in Japan on options for strengthening extended deterrence is in a different place than in South Korea, the two countries should take advantage of the fact that they share concerns about the credibility of extended deterrence.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Supplement the two extended deterrence dialogues with South Korea and Japan with a track 1.5 trilateral strategic exchange in order to stay informed about developments in each country and identify opportunities for coordination.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States, South Korea, and Japan should look for ways to trilateralize operational activity that involves strategic assets, such as along the lines of Blue Lightning missions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The allies should consider undertaking a nuclear planning exercise trilaterally.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pursue U.S. military adjustments and improvements.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States should consider changing its regional strategic and nuclear posture to allow for more robust and constant demonstrations of its capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Specifically, this could entail the continuous presence in the region of either U.S. submarines equipped with nuclear cruise missiles or strategic bombers or investing in infrastructure in South Korea to receive U.S. dual-capable aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Regarding the relative value of different strategic assets, relying primarily on sea-based systems makes the most sense from an operational standpoint, while rotational deployments of dual-capable aircraft would have more political reassurance value than operational military significance.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States should improve its national missile defense capabilities vis-à-vis North Korea, including through accelerating its plans to deploy 20 additional interceptors equipped with Next Generation Interceptor technology, currently slated for 2028, and investing in boost-phase missile defense technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Both of these initiatives would enhance the United States’ capacity to deflect a North Korean attack on the U.S. homeland with nuclear-tipped missiles (deterrence by denial) while avoiding an unviable “numbers game” — involving a scramble to produce enough U.S. interceptors to match increasing numbers of North Korean launchers — that would ensue from continued reliance on old technologies.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States should continue its nuclear modernization efforts, including the Long Range Stand Off Weapon and B-21, and should not include the “no first use” or “sole purpose” clause in the upcoming Nuclear Posture Review.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The United States should also restore funds for and continue pursuing its nuclear sea-launched cruise missile (SLCM-N) program.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;These efforts would help to reassure South Koreans — and convince North Koreans — of U.S. capabilities to fight and win a war against North Korea, thereby upholding deterrence by punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lay pre-decisional groundwork for possible redeployment of U.S. low-yield nuclear weapons.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The allies should consider tabletop planning exercises for the possible redeployment of U.S. nuclear weapons to South Korea. This planning should be explicitly pre-decisional. The timeline and scope of weapons, such as low-yield nuclear SLCMs or gravity bombs, should be left deliberately ambiguous. Decisionmaking would be calibrated to shifts in the security environment and the North Korean threat level.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Such planning exercises could entail cumulative phases, including:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Studies of the environmental impacts of redeployment;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Mapping of possible locations for facilities for storage;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Joint training on nuclear safety and security, including storage security, incident response, and recovery operations;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Certifying Korea-based U.S. F-16 units or F-35 replacements for combined exercises and nuclear missions; and&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;More committal physical steps toward redeployment, such as building storage facilities — a process that could take a few years to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The committal, physical steps would only be pursued if North Korean threat levels continued to escalate after other options to strengthen extended deterrence were exhausted (e.g., if North Korea intensifies its provocations even after the United States deploys nuclear SLCMs to the region, creates a joint nuclear planning framework, and ramps up its nuclear modernization efforts).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The redeployment of tactical nuclear weapons could heighten tensions on the peninsula despite its intended deterrent effect. This type of pre-decisional preparatory framework would signal commitment to the allies and resolve to North Korea while not yet crossing the proliferation threshold. It would also create new pressure on North Korea to stop ratcheting up threat levels if it does not want to see U.S. tactical nuclear weapons return to the peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coordinate positions on China.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The allies should establish a bilateral consultative mechanism to share assessments of the implications of China’s military capabilities for the Korean peninsula and coordinate potential responses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The allies should develop plans to jointly respond to Chinese pressure tactics aiming to derail allied deterrence initiatives directed toward North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States should respond to any Chinese complaints about Washington’s efforts to strengthen its missile defenses against North Korea by highlighting the degree to which the U.S. homeland missile defense system is neither intended to nor capable of defending against ICBM capabilities as large and sophisticated as China’s.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If China returns to a more helpful posture on North Korea issues, the United States and South Korea should consider incorporating Beijing into multilateral talks to secure China’s responsibility as a major stakeholder in North Korea’s denuclearization.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea policy is famously known as the “land of lousy options.” Currently, North Korea’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs look unstoppable. Decades of failed denuclearization diplomacy, however, cannot deter the allies from seeking new avenues of engagement with the modest goal of slowing down the program’s growth. Failing that objective, the United States must be cognizant that contingency planning, enhanced military readiness, and strengthened extended deterrence measures with South Korea and Japan serve to make U.S. alliances in Asia stronger, which in turn impose costs on North Korea for its proliferation behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The speakers were senior UK and Estonian government officials with significant experience in foreign and defence policy, alongside experts on Russian foreign and military policy. The first session considered lessons identified at the political, strategic, operational and tactical levels of warfare. The second session focused on options for better managing Russia in the future and what changes to the European security architecture might be required (see Annex for discussion points). This report contains a non-attributable summary of the discussions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary-of-roundtable-themes&quot;&gt;Summary of Roundtable Themes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants agreed that much of the future of European security is dependent on how the war on the ground in Ukraine ends. There was a general sense that Russia was likely ultimately to lose the war and must incur significant costs for deterrence to be re-established. The best-case scenario was that a future Russia would wish to buy into a rebuilt collective security system. The worst-case scenario was that Russia turns inwards and continues an aggressive and isolated path, and a North Korea-type scenario develops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has been significantly conventionally weakened by the war thus far and will need a further period of defence modernisation and doctrine development into the future. However, this does not mean that Russia will become a less dangerous defence and security actor. Therefore, Russia is likely to use unconventional and hybrid means more prominently in the short to medium term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The confrontation with Russia remains a long-term struggle. All NATO nations, individually and collectively, need to understand that there is no return even to the 23 February 2022 security relationship with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unity of purpose is the Western centre of gravity and must be maintained and protected at all costs. Moreover, the war has also highlighted NATO weaknesses and there must be a mutual recognition of these if the Alliance is to address them to be strong enough to guarantee the security of its member states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-estonianuk-defence-and-security-relationship&quot;&gt;The Estonian–UK Defence and Security Relationship&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Estonian–UK relationship and current levels of defence and security cooperation were described as ‘exemplary’ in terms of the bilateral relationship, multinationally through NATO and minilaterally through the Joint Expeditionary Force and other initiatives. The level of strategic integration is unprecedented. Each side could not wish for more from the relationship, with very few countries seeing eye to eye in the defence and security sphere to the same extent as Tallinn and London. However, there is still scope to build on this relationship – an example provided was the Estonian (as well as other Baltic and Nordic countries’) operation of a ‘total defence model’ that the UK could learn from in terms of building its own resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-joint-strategic-assessment-on-the-war-in-ukraine&quot;&gt;A Joint Strategic Assessment on the War in Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has already changed the fundamentals of European security. Russia has not only attacked Ukraine, but the very principles of European security itself – national sovereignty, the inviolability of national borders and the use of aggression as a tool of statecraft, particularly directed at the civilian population. Moreover, the war has animated a common threat assessment for Europeans across all the defence and security dimensions – conventional, hybrid, nuclear, energy, protection of critical national infrastructure (CNI), emerging and disruptive technologies (EDTs), and food. As the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (AFRF) have been exposed as poor compared with perceptions of them prior to the conflict, participants unanimously agreed that it is likely that President Vladimir Putin will ‘double down’ on non-conventional threats, such as nuclear and hybrid, as Russia does not delineate between conventional and unconventional levers or war and peace as separate constructs, and will always prioritise its defence and security policy over domestic considerations. Conversely, NATO’s significant challenges have also been exposed to its potential adversaries and competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has demonstrated a flagrant disregard for international norms for years. Conference speakers agreed that the current war, while ultimately Putin’s decision, should be considered as ‘Russia’s war’. Strategically, this is a war between Russia and the West, and it will not be won, or ended, kinetically on the battlefield in Ukraine. However, what happens on the battlefield will determine the foundations for the architecture which will follow. Despite multiple operational and tactical setbacks, Russia is not yet facing strategic defeat, although it is paying a heavier price than anticipated, both domestically and externally. Russia is still progressing its strategic intent. Its forces currently occupy approximately 20% of Ukraine and Moscow has established greater control over Belarus. Sanctions, while having an impact, are unlikely to bring Russia to its knees in the near future – Iran and North Korea were offered by one of the Estonian speakers as examples of states still functioning following decades of sanctions, capable still of developing advanced weaponry and military technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estonian and UK officials agreed that Russia will likely be strategically weakened in the short term if Ukraine comes out of this war without concessions on its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Should Russia gain any territory as a result of the war, it is the West and rules-based order that will be strategically weakened, not Russia. The poor Russian military performance presents opportunities for the Euro-Atlantic community. Yet, there needs to be a conscious understanding and effort if NATO is to take full advantage of the AFRF’s current weakness and the valuable insights on Russian vulnerabilities that the war has produced. Merely taking the additional time afforded to NATO to rectify weaknesses is insufficient and will not produce genuine strategic advantage. Moreover, NATO has been strengthened through unity and the adoption of its New Strategic Concept, and the imminent accession of two new members – Finland and Sweden. However, NATO must also be wary of the global context. While Ukraine has gained significant support through its informational campaigns in the West, the picture is more mixed elsewhere, such as in the Global South (broadly, the regions of Latin America, Asia, Africa and Oceania). It is important that the West recognises this and that the Russian narrative and propaganda gains traction outside English-speaking and other Western nations, which are actively targeted through its global network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe must be resilient. Ukraine fatigue must not set in among the electorate or political leaderships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin is likely using the winter and the shift of the ‘Special Military Operation’ to a stalemate on the ground to buy time to recover and enable ‘Ukraine fatigue’, as Western governments grapple with other political imperatives such as inflation, recession, and energy and other cost of living pressures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lessons-identified-from-the-war-in-ukraine&quot;&gt;Lessons Identified from the War in Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has challenged the strength of the AFRF and exposed its rigid command structures and culture, in direct contrast to Ukraine’s adaptability, flexibility and innovation. Despite a poor tactical and operational performance by the AFRF, however, Russia will continue to be a direct military threat. Previous underperformance of the AFRF, such as in Georgia in 2008, did not sufficiently prompt the requirement for change, but the strategic shock of its performance in 2022 may finally provide the recognition, and acceptance, of the necessity for wider cultural changes throughout the Russian defence and security community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants highlighted that the Western assessment community had previously overestimated Russian capabilities and underestimated Ukraine and there is a risk that the reverse may now occur. It was also noted that this was also true in assessments of the relative strengths of the Taliban and Afghan National Security Forces and could reflect a strategic weakness in how NATO assesses its adversaries and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a debate on the timeframes for NATO transformation and when the AFRF will pose a legitimate and credible conventional threat to Europe again. There was a warning that future credibility, for example, between 2030 and 2035, relied on decisions being made now and therefore there was actually not much time for action. The earliest assessments were that Russia could recover conventionally by 2023, with the caveat that additional personnel and equipment would be ‘operationally useful by Russian standards’ as its industry had retained industrial capacity and was able to secure components through illicit procurement and Iranian networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a serious risk that Ukraine runs out of ammunition, due to expenditure rates and limited stocks of NATO states, as well as a lack of spare industrial capacity to ramp up production in the short term. However, it was noted that ‘Ukrainians are good at sustaining momentum’ and were receiving more military aid before winter 2022 and continue to win the hearts and minds of Western media, people and thus governments to act on the relevant demand signals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the same day as the conference, RUSI published a report, ‘Preliminary Lessons in Conventional Warfighting from Russia’s Invasion of Ukraine: February–July 2022’ which one of the authors discussed in detail. The main findings pertinent to NATO defence planners are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no sanctuary in modern warfare. The enemy can strike throughout operational depth.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Warfighting demands large initial stockpiles and significant slack capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unmanned aerial systems and counter-UAS are essential across all branches and at all echelons.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The force must fight for the right to precision. Precision is not only vastly more efficient in the effects it delivers but also allows the force to reduce its logistics tail and thereby makes it more survivable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For land forces, the pervasive ISTAR on the modern battlefield and the layering of multiple sensors at the tactical level make concealment exceedingly difficult to sustain.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications-of-the-war-in-ukraine-for-nato&quot;&gt;Implications of the War in Ukraine for NATO&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO, thus far, has responded well and in unity to a war which has been a real test for the Alliance. While not directly involved militarily, NATO is a critical actor and it was noted that the Russian pre-war proposals of December 2021 were primarily concerned with the US and NATO, not Ukraine. Words and non-military means did not deter Russia from launching a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and NATO, or its membership, must not self-deter and allow Russia the initiative to manage escalation. There was a recognition among the speakers that NATO did not do enough to deter Russia from its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Moreover, all NATO members need to understand, both individually and collectively, that there is no return to the relations with Russia that existed on 23 February 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO’s New Strategic Concept, unveiled at the June 2022 Madrid Summit, drastically altered the NATO defence and deterrence posture in Europe and rebalanced away from the other core tasks of crisis management and cooperative security. The priority is now implementation and the delivery of the Madrid commitments quickly and fully to ensure credibility. Defence and reinforcement plans need to be resourced, with fighting formations stocked, trained, equipped and ringfenced for their mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All participants agreed that the unity demonstrated at Madrid is the Alliance’s centre of gravity and must prevail, as it would be naive to think Russia will not test Europe again. But Madrid is only the starting point and increased investments in defence and security should become the norm, not just in financial terms but also in manufacturing capabilities to obtain better outputs and therefore outcomes. The demand signal is there, and contracts need to be signed for long-term requirements to bring industry on board and ensure European strategic advantage. Increased defence spending and investment is predicated on political will and Allies have a duty to help. The transformation that NATO requires is not just process driven but one of mindset and culture. It needs to jettison the counterinsurgency mindset that has dominated the past 20 years of Alliance activity and get back to preparing for conventional warfighting as the requirements are very different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants agreed that the NATO Vilnius Summit in June 2023 would be critical and hoped its outcome would be increased resilience and full implementation of the Madrid vision for the future of the Alliance. NATO plans need to be approved, the defence investment pledge revised and Finland and Sweden need to be welcomed as full members. NATO cannot and should not be scared of success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-future-of-russia-as-a-european-security-actor&quot;&gt;The Future of Russia as a European Security Actor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 70 years of general peace that Europe has experienced since the end of the Second World War was built on the presence of the US and its security umbrella and transatlanticism – an assessment that participants from both Estonia and the UK shared. By 1945 appeasement and the use of aggression were discredited on the European continent, but now appear again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s war in Ukraine is pivotal, due to its scale, how it will change Ukraine as a nation, and how it will establish new norms of European security and reinforce the principle that larger states do not get a veto over smaller ones. Putin’s aggression cannot pay off, in any way, as other authoritarian states, especially China, are watching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was reinforced that Russia has no intention of losing its war in Ukraine and has identified Western unity as a centre of gravity which must be attacked, through producing economic pain, scaring the West into paralysis through nuclear and hybrid escalation, and providing false-hope narratives as traps to damage unity. Russia’s national strategy has been to deter responses by NATO while taking slices out of its neighbourhood, and the war has now changed attitudes and beliefs in Russia’s neighbourhood. Participants agreed that the status of Crimea is fundamental to the security future of both Russia and Ukraine and cannot be treated separately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was further noted that the West must also learn from its past mistakes to manage Russia better in the future – both the strategic failure to deter Russian designs on Ukraine from 2014 to 2022 and the grand strategic failure to deal with Russia adequately since the end of the Cold War and understanding the realistic military threat it poses. There must be a recognition that the West is stuck with Putin or ‘Putinism’ for some time. It would be a mistake to think that democratising Russia, such as the manner of Western engagement in the 1990s, will be possible. The imperialistic mindset is entrenched in Russian society that the West has only a very limited ability to influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;managing-what-comes-next&quot;&gt;Managing What Comes Next?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants were unanimous in agreeing that managing what comes next depends on how this phase of the war ends. However, regardless of the ultimate outcome, it was agreed that existing security frameworks need to be rethought and what can be salvaged and built upon needs to be identified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conference participants disagreed as to how the war on the ground would play out in 2023 and beyond but were steadfast in their belief that Russia must be defeated. Regardless of how the war ends, the European security order has transformed as Russia has flagrantly violated European and international norms by brutally invading a neighbouring country entirely unprovoked. Also, the significant write down in Russian combat power due to poor AFRF performance, with only modest investment from NATO Allies (primarily the US), has provided time and space for Europe to undergo its own military transformation as demanded by NATO’s Strategic Concept. Yet this investment to date has already strained Allied military capability and readiness, exposing NATO weaknesses, which must be urgently rectified. The multitude of Russian weaknesses on the battlefield must be decoupled with assessing the change in relationship between Russia and its partners, including Belarus, Iran and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key aspect raised was that it is currently difficult to assess what has genuinely changed in Russia as a result of the war. The strategic intent – to occupy the whole of Ukraine and disrupt the European and international order – remains. Moreover, the values, world view and approach that Putin incarnates are likely to endure beyond Putin himself. Most of the criticism in Moscow is about not going hard and fast in the war, rather than the legitimacy of the war itself. The speakers agreed that while Russia might experience some destabilisation, there would be no ‘colour revolutions’ and that any challenge to Putin’s power would likely come from the right and not the liberal centre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linked to this was a sense among participants of a growing disconnect between Russian capabilities and the country’s ambitions and self-identity as a great power, which is fundamental to national identity. The foundations are built on Russia’s permanent seat at the UN Security Council and its nuclear status, its military might and its ability to act as a regional hegemon. Following the war, the last two are now under threat, which could cause Russia to act more aggressively and in an unpredictable manner, especially to compel its neighbours to act in certain ways and influence behaviours. In this context, it is likely that Russia will continue to exploit differences among NATO, and EU, members. Frozen conflicts are Russia’s comfort zone and their manipulation is key to Moscow’s exercise of power; therefore anything that is pushed on Ukraine towards that status is counterproductive, will look like a win for Russia and will therefore be unacceptable to NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;assessing-the-european-structural-relationship-with-russia&quot;&gt;Assessing the European Structural Relationship with Russia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussions highlighted that European security, and the architecture underpinning it, must now be rethought. In terms of arms control, the war in Ukraine feels like the closing of an era, akin to the end of the Cold War. Certain components, such as the OSCE, especially the Vienna Document, endure, and New START is robust and remains critical. However, participants agreed that the era of cooperative security agreements that have characterised the previous 30 years do not feel like tomorrow’s world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was emphasised that Estonia and the UK are part of a community of democracies which take longer to make decisions, but make stronger decisions collectively, with legitimacy, transparency and accountability. Estonia and the UK want the war to end as soon as practically possible, but no concessions can be given to Putin. Therefore, these decisions must be made with a rational and coherent strategy which will benefit European security. There was doubt that this is moving quickly enough as Western countries are experiencing economic pain (inflation in Europe is currently highest in Estonia). A strategic breaking point of unity is approaching and some speakers believed it to be unsustainable, giving a particular warning about the pain of next winter for Europe, in addition to the current one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The speakers all agreed that security guarantees must be provided to the future Ukrainian state, including a capable and integrated Ukrainian military, linked to industry, that can match Russia. However, there was no consensus on the form those guarantees should take. It should not be the uncertain assurance of NATO’s 2008 Budapest Summit commitment to eventual Alliance membership for Ukraine but must include an honest and realistic assessment of what kind of assistance Allies can supply to Ukraine in the long term, including force modernisation and NATO standardisation, and resupply for a future crisis. Strengthening Ukrainian deterrence of future Russian threats is critical and can be done through intelligence support, sanctions, military technical assistance and training programmes, which are all measures that would support Ukraine on its journey to join NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

The political and defence ties between Belarus and Russia have gained new prominence as a result of the war in Ukraine. But a nuanced understanding of this relationship suggests that Russia’s dependence on Belarus for logistical support and training could become a weakness.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This paper examines Belarus’s military role as the provider of fundamental logistical and practical support for the Russian armed forces, without which the Russian army would struggle to function, particularly during wartime. It identifies some of the ideological, practical and political points of contention in the two countries’ security relationship and seeks to challenge prevailing wisdom that casts Belarus as the only dependent party. For now, Russia’s and Belarus’s occasionally differing threat perceptions may be temporarily consolidated around the Ukraine war, with Western sanctions – including those specifically targeting Belarus for its role as co-aggressor – obliging President Alexander Lukashenko to turn to Russia to guarantee his political future and prop up the economy. But Russia’s dependence on Belarus as a defence manufacturer and logistical provider could one day become a critical vulnerability, particularly in the event of significant political or economic change in Belarus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;key-findings&quot;&gt;KEY FINDINGS&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Analysis of the Belarus–Russia relationship tends to focus on Belarus’s political and financial dependence on Russia, but in defence, Russia’s reliance on Belarus for military-grade components, as well as logistical services in war and peacetime, could be an area of critical weakness for Russia, particularly in the longer-term event of regime change in Belarus.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Belarus and Russia cooperate military and politically through several platforms and agreements, of which the Union State and the Regional Group of Forces are the most significant. The Ukraine war may have aligned Lukashenko’s and Putin’s threat perceptions of NATO for now, but while defence is often framed as their closest area of cooperation, significant frictions remain between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a high degree of interoperability between the armies at a strategic, operational and tactical level, but Belarus is not a mere military district of Russia. Belarus’s most important role in the current Ukraine war is acting as the tyl (rear) of the Russian army. Belarus performs vital functions as a logistical supplier; hosting and offering medical and practical support to Russian troops stationed on Belarusian territory and facilitating the transfer of troops and hardware around the country and into Ukrainian territory through its rail network. But frictions remain in defence, among them Belarus’s frustrations at receiving secondhand Russian weapons, Russian attempts to take over Belarusian defence-industrial manufacturers, and periodic disagreements over military-ideological training.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are links at numerous levels, including between the Belarusian and Russian senior military command, with many officers having received training at Russian institutions, which makes the political loyalties of the Belarusian armed forces difficult to gauge. These close links are particularly stark in the defence-industrial complex. Belarus is one of the few manufacturers of some military-grade components and repair services suitable for Russian army equipment, and Russia has failed to fully replace these industries domestically – hence its decades-long efforts at ‘integrating’ the Belarusian military-industrial complex into its own, which have been resisted so far. Belarus has long been pigeonholed as a defence exporter of unfinished components, which it sells to a limited range of clients abroad, but mostly to Russia. This mutual dependence also has a great impact on Russia, aspects of which would function less efficiently without Belarus’s machine parts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Economic pressure on Belarus, including sanctions that are isolating Belarus from the international supply chain, could have implications for Russia’s defence industry. Unless Russia gives greater support to the Belarusian economy, particularly its industrial sector, reliable supplies of components will be difficult to acquire, and are likely to impact on Russia’s ability to rearm, as well as deliver on its existing contracts as a global weapons supplier.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Belarus was used as a launchpad for the offensive on Kyiv in February 2022, the Russia–Belarus relationship was given renewed impetus in the West for research. The war highlighted the importance of understanding Russia’s strategic security thinking on Belarus, to determine how Russia perceives its closest military and political ally, unpack the extent of defence coordination between them, and identify what the frictions in this relationship could mean for the West. This paper ultimately seeks to determine whether the Belarusian armed forces are a strategic asset to the Russian armed forces, a key vulnerability, or perhaps both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address this issue, the paper seeks to answer two key questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How does Russia conceive of its security relationship with Belarus, and how has this shifted in the light of major events such as Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the start of the Ukraine war in 2022?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How coordinated are the two countries’ military forces, and where are the frictions between them?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper is based on a review of public statements from both countries’ senior political leadership, official strategic planning documents produced by Russian and Belarusian government bodies, Russian-language media reports, and articles published by Russian think tanks and military journals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from historical documents required for background notes, this research primarily focused on strategic documents published after the annexation of Crimea in 2014, at which point Belarus was forced into taking a public stance on Russia’s annexation. A closed research event featuring experts on Russian and Belarusian politics and defence was organised by RUSI, which aimed to challenge and discuss some of the hypotheses raised during the course of this research. Access to Russian-language military journals has been provided with the assistance of the Russian Military Studies Centre, a research facility based at the UK Defence Academy in Shrivenham. Due to the fast-moving nature of the conflict, important questions, such as the likelihood that Belarus would enter the Ukraine war more actively, are not fully unpacked here, nor is there a comprehensive analysis of the Belarus–Ukraine dynamic, as this stillevolving relationship is beyond the scope of this paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first section of this paper outlines Russia’s strategic military and political approach to Belarus. It offers some background on how this has evolved since the annexation of Crimea in 2014, identifying key events that have impacted on the relationship. It also examines Russian conceptions of Belarus to understand why the country is of such significance to President Vladimir Putin. The second section discusses the military, defence-industrial and ideological cooperation between the two countries in more detail, including Belarus’s role as the tyl (rear) of the Russian armed forces. Given the importance of the Belarus–Russia relationship, the final section highlights some of the potential challenges on the horizon for NATO Allies, and why understanding the dynamics of this relationship can have an important impact on regional security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-russia-conceives-of-its-political-and-security-relationship-with-belarus&quot;&gt;HOW RUSSIA CONCEIVES OF ITS POLITICAL AND SECURITY RELATIONSHIP WITH BELARUS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia and Belarus (along with Ukraine) have a shared security, historical, cultural and linguistic heritage dating back centuries. Belarus has variously been called Russia’s ‘client state’, part of Russia’s Soviet sphere of influence, and Russia’s strategic security partner. But for contemporary Russia, Belarus is more than that. It is, for Putin at least, conceptually an extension of Russia’s own strategic security space. Given the geo-economic imbalance between the two countries, and this Russian understanding of Belarus, the relationship can never be one of equal partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of Putin’s most recent statements on the triumvirate of Belarus, Ukraine and Russia epitomise this conceptual approach. In July 2021, amid rising tensions with the West, Putin penned an article in which he rehashed – with a dose of revanchism – the historical relationship between the three countries. Some months later and a few days before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, he gave a speech at the Kremlin in which he recognised the independence of the so-called People’s Republics of Luhansk and Donetsk and gave his justification for the coming war. Then, in April 2022, during a meeting with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko in Russia’s Far East, Putin maintained that he did not distinguish between where Belarus ended and Russia began, claiming that Ukraine, Belarus and Russia had always been one people. In each of these examples, there is a common refrain in which Belarus, Ukraine and Russia are the ‘heirs of Ancient Rus’ – historical lands that include the territory of modern-day Belarus and Ukraine, ruled from Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian leadership’s linguistic framing of Belarus is also revealing – the country is often referred to as ‘Byelorussia’, rather than Belarus. Byelorussia is a historical-empirical term for lands that included parts of Belarus (literally ‘White Russia’), and the use of this form suggests a view of Belarus as a district of Russia, rather than a separate country. These linguistic nuances reflect sentiments that have been echoed by important figures sent to Belarus to negotiate on the Kremlin’s behalf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most potentially damaging incidents for the relationship involved Mikhail Babich, Russia’s former ambassador to Belarus. He was recalled in 2019 after openly engaging with Belarus’s political opposition, which Lukashenko viewed as an attempt to promote regime change. Babich was a former KGB officer, and Ukraine had refused to accept him as ambassador two years before. He overstepped his diplomatic boundaries throughout his tenure in Belarus, to Minsk’s increasing concern. In comments to the media, Babich described Belarus as a ‘district’ of Russia, causing a diplomatic incident, and eventually, at Lukashenko’s request, he was recalled.10 This slight concession to Belarus indicated that Russia understood Lukashenko was only to be pushed so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Babich was replaced by Dmitry Mezentsev, who is now secretary of the Union State – a loose bilateral framework agreement formulated in 1999 between Belarus and Russia to deepen their political, economic and military integration, which has become increasingly formalised in recent years. Unlike Babich, Mezentsev is a moderate and a career diplomat, who has described Belarus and Russia as unified not by pressure from the West, but by a desire for deeper economic integration and common historical understandings. But while Russia is Belarus’s closest ally, the relationship is beset by personal tensions, practical problems and conceptual divergences that make it difficult for true integration to take place. These divergences were particularly seen in Russia’s displeasure at Belarus’s attempts to court the West over the past eight years, attempts prompted by its desire to ease the sanctions that had been introduced in response to Belarusian human rights abuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russias-agenda&quot;&gt;RUSSIA’S AGENDA&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belarus and Russia work together across several platforms and agreements, but the most relevant for the security relationship is the Union State. It envisages a single economic, social and legal space, a joint budget, and coordinated foreign and defence policies. But until 2018, when Putin resumed the Russian presidency for a fourth term, it was given only scant public attention, although the defence relationship that it facilitates was ongoing throughout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bilateral security relationship between Belarus and Russia features in numerous official Russian documents including its Military Doctrine (2014), National Security Strategy (NSS 2015, updated in 2021) and Foreign Policy Concept (2016), with the NSS forming the basis around which the most important documents are framed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the updated NSS makes little reference to Belarus. In comparison with the 2015 document, which focused on strategic partnerships with other countries based on a principle of equality, the 2021 NSS removes references to ‘equality’ or interest in cooperation with the West, instead promoting the importance of protecting Russia’s values, politics and sovereignty (although it is unclear what makes these values unique to Russia). Indeed, there is more focus on concerns about Russian traditional values than on the Eurasian Economic Union (of which Belarus is a founding member too), the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), a Russia-led security alliance established formally in 2002, or the Union State, vehicles through which Russia cooperates with Belarus. Belarus is not mentioned as a strategic partner, whereas China and India are specifically. This could suggest that Belarus is not a priority, although it is more likely that Russia considers Belarus to be already so well integrated that plans for a deeper relationship need not be rehashed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there have been disagreements in the bilateral relationship for years, including over the prices of milk and oil, new tax laws, and Lukashenko’s longstanding resistance to the construction of a permanent Russian military base in Belarus. Lukashenko and Putin’s poor personal relationship is well documented, and while they meet frequently, Putin has never considered him a personal confidante. There are also frictions between Lukashenko and former Russian prime minister Dmitry Medvedev – an important figure as deputy leader of Russia’s Security Council. Medvedev has in the past publicly called for the ‘modernisation’ of Belarus’s election processes, much to Lukashenko’s chagrin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of the Union State was only publicly resurrected in 2018, when Putin resumed the presidency. Numerous meetings in 2018 between Putin and Lukashenko manifested little, while conversations in Russia increasingly framed Belarus as a drain on Russia’s financial resources, until then-prime minister Medvedev issued an ultimatum that integration should go ahead in earnest, and that any significant cooperation between Belarus and Western security and economic structures such as the EU, the US and NATO would not be tolerated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin’s intention to rein in Belarus’s forays into the West were clear. At the meeting of the Supreme State Council of the Union State in June 2018, he pointedly remarked that common approaches to foreign policy were to be a priority. These sentiments were echoed and amplified by Medvedev and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who was that same month forced to deny intense media speculation that Putin intended to unify Belarus and Russia, perhaps with the presidency of the Union State as a possible retirement option. But this did not mean that Belarus and Russia’s understandings of security were the same. While the Ukraine war may have temporarily forced Lukashenko into paying lip service to aspects of Putin’s worldview, this is a fickle alignment, predicated on Moscow’s continued economic support for Belarus, and political support for Lukashenko’s leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;divergent-threat-perceptions&quot;&gt;DIVERGENT THREAT PERCEPTIONS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to 2022, Russia’s security doctrines and official statements made it clear that it viewed NATO as its main strategic threat, while Belarus took a more measured view. Belarus’s long-serving minister of foreign affairs Vladimir Makei, who died unexpectedly in late 2022, often stated that he did not view NATO deployments on its eastern flank as threatening Belarus’s security environment. In 2020 the Belarusian military even conducted a small-scale exercise with NATO Allies – a group of UK Marines – although at a strategic and operational level its forces only train with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belarus had taken an ostensibly neutral stance over Crimea, going as far as criticising the annexation as a bad precedent and hosting the Minsk peace agreements, to Russia’s irritation. This diplomatic manoeuvring had the aim (successful at the time) of removing Western sanctions on Belarus, introduced in 2010 following the Belarusian security services’ crackdown on protesters. Russia’s concerns that Belarus might drift closer to Western political structures was a major factor in propelling the Union State forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joint military exercises have increased in frequency and coordination over the past few years, but the Zapad (West) 2017 exercises demonstrated Russia and Belarus’s divergent threat perceptions most clearly. Zapad is their largest joint military exercise, held quadrennially in Russia’s Western Military District since 1999. This alternates with Union Shield (Shchit Soyuza), which also takes place every four years in Russia. One of the Zapad 2017 scenarios was to test how Belarus could host Russia’s military forces, should a foreignsponsored attack require it. At the time, Belarus was keen to maintain cordial relations with NATO, as part of its security and political balancing act with the West, while ensuring its allyship with Russia. Russia’s actions, such as suggesting that the test launch of a tactical ballistic Iskander-M missile was part of the exercises, when they were unconnected, undermined Belarus’s diplomatic efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exercise was beset by problems. Russia attempted to increase the agreed-upon number of soldiers, which Lukashenko refused, mindful of how this would be received in the West. Belarus offered Western media access to the exercises (Russia did not) and invited Western observers, including the OSCE, NATO, the Helsinki Commission and the International Red Cross, to observe parts of Zapad, as well as providing briefings at NATO headquarters, in an attempt at transparency and to assuage Western concerns that the exercises were a foil for a Russian incursion into Belarus. Against this backdrop, such were their differing views of security that Lukashenko and Putin did not undertake a joint tour of the battlefield, as is traditional, and went their separate ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;turning-points&quot;&gt;TURNING POINTS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two events – the domestic turmoil of 2020 in Belarus, and the Ukraine war – did, however, shift Lukashenko’s priorities. The 2020 protests against Lukashenko’s re-election to the presidency – in a vote that had been viewed as a foregone conclusion – and the resultant violent repression, with allegations of torture perpetrated by the Belarusian security services, turned Belarus into an international pariah. Greater security cooperation with Russia followed, including mutual training for the security services to maintain public order, likely aimed at suppressing future demonstrations, particularly against the Ukraine war and Lukashenko personally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the prospects of a political relationship and accompanying economic investment from the West dwindled to nil, Lukashenko recalibrated, and a flurry of meetings with Putin took place throughout 2021, with promises of significant loans from Russia to prop up the ailing Belarusian economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Lukashenko’s resistance crumbled, so too did his political resolve. In a November 2021 Russian television interview, he abruptly recognised Crimea’s annexation for the first time. While in a sense this meant little, as he has yet to visit the peninsula, it was a political manoeuvre, aligning him with Putin’s view of the world. Lukashenko’s signature in that same month on a joint security doctrine with Russia sealed his public commitment to security alignment. Although the full text of the new doctrine was not published until February 2022, its removal of language on Belarus’s neutrality that had prevented Russia from moving nuclear weapons onto its territory sparked concern among NATO Allies. This, and Belarus’s February 2022 constitutional referendum that allowed the country to break its neutrality pledge and non-nuclear status, were viewed as concessions to Putin, in exchange for ongoing support to Belarus amid its international isolation. The new doctrine laid some of the groundwork for Russia to use Belarus as a launchpad for the offensive on Kyiv, with Belarus cast by the West as the ‘co-aggressor’ in the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attempts amid the Ukraine war by Makei to urge the West, in particular the EU, to engage in dialogue, preventing Belarus’s complete diplomatic isolation, and suggesting a foreign policy course for Belarus not entirely aligned with Russia’s, came to naught and his suggestions were rebuffed. The regime is now under wide-ranging international sanctions, cut off from most international supply chains and reliant on Russia for deeper economic cooperation, including significant loans and the restructuring of its existing debt repayments to Moscow, to prevent economic collapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lukashenko’s accompanying rhetoric has also changed. In an apparent about face, in October 2021 he remarked that Belarus should establish a joint military base with Russia in case of attack – in contrast to his years of resistance to hosting Russian military infrastructure. He has also parroted conspiracy theories asserting that NATO was attempting to annex parts of western Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This change of official rhetoric has been accompanied by greater defence cooperation with Russia. However, much of this has been confined to symbolic gestures, rather than investment. Following a request from Lukashenko in November 2021, Russian strategic bombers escorted by Belarusian fighter jets conducted exercises over Belarus for the first time. Here Lukashenko emphasised the importance of joint air patrols to protect Belarus’s borders, indicating that he was framing NATO as a threat to the country – in accordance with Russia’s official views and increasingly hardline approach to the West. By May 2022, Belarus’s defence minister Viktor Khrenin was talking in terms of a possible war against Belarus, and the need to upgrade its special forces to counter NATO reconnaissance planes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while it appeared the transformation of Belarus’s defence community’s rhetoric was complete, as the war has continued, officials such as Khrenin have made clear that alongside their staunch anti-Western rhetoric remains an apparently sincere desire for some engagement with the West, in the interests of Belarus’s own national security. Although Belarus’s role in the Ukraine war has cemented the Western view of Belarus as a co-aggressor whose worldview entirely aligns with Russia’s, it appears that some parts of the Belarusian defence and foreign policy community remain hopeful that Belarus can continue its balancing act between Russia and the West, however unlikely this may be in reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;military-integration-and-the-tyl&quot;&gt;MILITARY INTEGRATION AND THE TYL&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section does not attempt to determine whether Belarusian forces will officially enter the war in Ukraine, as there are many factors that could influence this that are beyond the scope of this paper. It looks at the integration between the Russian and Belarusian armed forces and determines whether this could be a key weakness for Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategically and operationally, the two forces are well integrated; there is a high degree of educational and ideological exchanges, and their special operations and airborne forces are closely linked across all levels. Belarus does not unilaterally conduct large exercises, always operating within the framework of joint exercises. There is a high degree of interoperability between them, supported by longstanding legislation, but underlying frictions mean full integration remains elusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This closeness has led the neighbouring Baltic states and Poland to refer to Belarus as Russia’s ‘Belarus Military District’ – a reference to Russia’s division of its armed forces into geographically focused military districts. But although this framing is consistent with the Russian leadership’s framing of Belarus as a mere Russian backwater, calling Belarus a military district of Russia is something of a misnomer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, for political purposes, this might not matter: since the Ukraine war escalated, Belarus and Russia have been viewed by the West as one and the same militarily. In a practical sense, Belarus has always played and is increasingly playing an important role as the tyl of Russia’s armed forces, providing logistical support, without which some of the Russian military’s key functions would be impeded. Much analysis has focused on Belarus’s political and economic dependence on Russia, but Russia’s own reliance on Belarus for military-grade components and logistical services in both war and peacetime could turn out to be a critical weakness for Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it has made some attempts to improve, and reduce its reliance on Moscow for training, the Belarusian army is small, under-equipped and under-trained. Despite pledges from Lukashenko to conduct joint deployments with Russian soldiers, the Belarusian armed forces also appear to lack any motivation to fight Ukraine, presenting a challenge for Russia, which may not be able to call on them if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;military-cooperation&quot;&gt;MILITARY COOPERATION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belarus and Russia have cooperated militarily in some form since Lukashenko came to power in 1994. This includes field and combat training, regular livefire exercises in Russia, and cooperation through the CSTO. Central to bilateral cooperation are the Unified Regional Air Defence System and the Regional Group of Forces (RGF), an agreement established in the late 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RGF consists mainly of Belarusian armed forces and a few Russian units, such as the 1st Guards Tank Army. The written agreement now appears rather outdated. It emphasises defence coordination without naming a specific adversary and underscores the need for a balanced approach to NATO and Europe, as well as resolution through diplomatic means – much of which appears unthinkable in the current political climate. This document will likely be revised in the coming years to reflect a more unified view of emerging security threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CSTO’s Eastern European Group of Forces also comprises Russian and Belarusian units but, as the May 2022 CSTO summit highlighted, these forces have never been deployed in a unified manner to a combat zone, mostly due to reluctance of other member states to allow Russia-led CSTO forces to be deployed for fighting civil unrest. It was only during the 2022 protests in Kazakhstan that the alliance, fearing regime change, agreed to a limited mobilisation of peacekeepers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially the Russian and Belarusian armies operated separately, but changes to Belarus’s command-and-control structure and the dissolution of the Ground Forces Command in 2011–12, alongside numerous joint exercises, meant that over time, the Belarusian forces were subsumed into the RGF. On paper, both Moscow and Minsk have veto power over ground operations. But it is clear who has ultimate control over the joint operations. Indeed, there is a practical reason for this – the two countries have been conducting joint combat alert duty through their regional air defence systems since 2016, but it is likely that in the event of a conflict, Russia would assume control over Belarus’s air defence systems, as Belarus does not have modern air defence systems of its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the war, the security debate centred around whether Belarus would host a permanent Russian military base, an argument that may now be less pressing. Russia currently leases two military installations in Belarus from the government, a Soviet hangover: a naval communication transmission station near the town of Vileyka, used to link up with submarines, and a long-range radar station near Baranovichi, which Russia leases for free. The installations are mostly symbolic – the radar station is not of particular significance to the Russian military – as the more modern Pionersky earlywarning station constructed in Kaliningrad in 2019 is much closer to NATO borders. Neither government understands these installations as military bases (voennaya baza), instead referring to them as military objects (voenniy obyekt). ‘Objects’ do not have the same status as bases, which offer a military advantage in a conflict through their use or destruction. Russia argues that the objects in Belarus do not offer such an advantage. The legal status of the objects has in the past allowed Belarus, insisting upon its neutrality, to assert that Russia does not have a permanent military presence in its country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Construction of an airbase is far less important than consistent cooperation in defence through the exchange of weapons and infrastructure. As the war in Ukraine since February 2022 has demonstrated, Russia is able to deploy troops to Belarus quickly when required, a smooth relationship facilitated by years of cooperation and Lukashenko’s reduced room for manoeuvre. As Russian military stationing in Belarus has been a fait accompli since the last joint exercises in February, with Russian fighter jets using both military and civilian airfields in Belarus to conduct strikes on Ukraine, the signing of a formal agreement regarding the construction of a physical base may no longer be a necessity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-tyl&quot;&gt;THE TYL&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belarus’s most important function for the Russian armed forces is not as a belligerent – low defence spending has meant that the capabilities of the country’s armed forces have waned over the last 30 years and would make little material difference on the battlefield – but as the ‘tyl’, providing the logistical, operational and technical support that Russian armed forces receive during both peace and wartime. The Russian phrase ‘bez tyla, net pobedi’ (‘there is no victory without the rear’) was commonly used during the Second World War, highlighting the behind-the-scenes importance of the logistical corps. Having a trustworthy logistical base is vital for Russia to ensure its own deterrence, and the tyl, as provided by the Belarusian army in the current Ukraine war, is a fundamental part of Russia’s military logistics to ensure that its forces can deploy to the operational theatre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belarusian territory has been used in the Ukraine war for three key purposes. First, as a stationing point for Russian troops, of which around 30,000 remained in Belarus following joint exercises held in 2021. Second, as a launch for air and missile strikes on Ukraine, and third, as a logistical base, not only using Belarus’s road and rail transport, but also providing important public services for Russian soldiers such as medical facilities, food supplies and morgues. Russia has also been reliant on Belarus’s railway network to launch the assault on Kyiv, and earlier in the war there were several reports of sabotage of these tracks, which caused trains to run slowly, delaying important freight deliveries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Belarusian army’s role has always been to transport Russia’s military formations and provide storage facilities, particularly during exercises in Belarusian territory. In one of the first of its kind between countries, an agreement on joint logistical support was signed in 2004 as part of the RGF, giving the Russian army the right to use Belarus’s infrastructure and resources during a ‘threat’ or war. That agreement is the basis on which joint exercises and Belarus’s support to Russia in the current Ukraine war have been conducted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Union State has a specific budget for military-technological cooperation to upgrade military facilities and infrastructure that the RGF uses, including financing regional railway systems. Just before Zapad 2017 began, exercises on the RGF’s tyl were held to deploy pipelines and fuel to war theatres, as well as establishing rail crossings for Russian units in Belarusian territory. Speed of mobilisation is vital for the Russian military, given the ground forces’ reliance on rail, and the Belarusian and Russian defence ministries have improved Belarus’s rail network to this end: in 2020, around 260 km of track were upgraded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Belarusian Transport Troops (part of the Ministry of Defence) have a tight relationship with the Russian Railway Troops: they transport military units and materiel within Belarus, as well as maintaining facilities and constructing rail lines and crossings within the country. The Railway Troops are a vital part of the Russian armed forces, as road and rail remain the most effective ways of mobilising Russian military units, which facilitated their fast deployment to the front during the initial stages of the Ukraine war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time of the 2021 Zapad exercises, it was clear that the military interdependence between the two countries was approaching its zenith. Zapad 2021 featured around 200,000 personnel, focused on Kaliningrad and the Ukraine border, and involved all Russian military districts. This training scenario, in which NATO states attempted to conduct regime change in Belarus, including strikes against Russia, highlighted the two countries’ political and military alignment and mutual threat perceptions. The size of the exercises, in comparison with previous years, demonstrated Minsk’s abandonment of previous decisions to refuse to host such large exercises. It also showed Russia’s willingness to defend its political interests in Belarus, including assisting Lukashenko in the event of a threat to his authority, which offered him some reassurance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while Belarus’s own low military prowess might suggest that in any given conflict – such as the Ukraine war – it would automatically follow Russia’s lead, this has not proven the case thus far. Indeed, Lukashenko’s reluctance to send Belarusian troops to Ukraine and his public comments indicate a desire to keep a distance from a protracted war. There may be other issues at play – Lukashenko could be intentionally delaying military improvements to his own forces to avoid deeper integration with Russia, which would bring Belarus more actively into the Ukraine war. Thus far, Lukashenko has been able to be evasive on Belarus’s deeper practical involvement, as the Belarusian army’s participation in the war would be of little battlefield use. Low popular support within Belarus for greater involvement in Ukraine could also risk internal destabilisation – and Russia is not prepared to run the risk of a politically unstable Belarus on its borders. Delays of full interoperability between Russia and Belarus could frustrate not only Russia’s goals in the Ukraine war, but also Russia’s more strategic military goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ideology-and-education&quot;&gt;IDEOLOGY AND EDUCATION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shared military training and ideological propaganda with Russia has over the years helped to engender a mutual threat perception, particularly among senior officers, but gauging the Belarusian military’s loyalty is a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia remained the main training destination for senior Belarusian military specialists, particularly for missile, infantry and air defence troops. Many senior Belarusian officers received their military education and training through the Soviet and then Russian system. This is reflected in Belarus’s senior military command: Alexander Volfovich, Chief of General Staff until 2021 and now State Secretary of the Security Council, studied at the Moscow Higher Combined Arms Command School and the Russian General Staff Military Academy. Andrei Burdyko, Deputy Minister of Defence for Logistics since 2017, studied at the Military Academy of Logistics and Transport of the Russian Ministry of Defence. However, it should not be presumed that Belarusian soldiers automatically assume the political positions of Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lukashenko has over the years attempted to improve Belarus’s own military education offer to reduce its reliance on Russia, with more junior officers training domestically, but Russia is still the main destination for specialised training. These links make it challenging to determine the loyalties of the Belarusian forces – although Lukashenko has occasionally deliberately purged them of their most pro-Russian elements in the past. The topdown nature of both militaries, disempowering junior officers from making decisions or taking initiative, means that senior officers continue to dictate the ideological and political culture of the armed forces, as well as key decisions in battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Minsk Suvorov Military School is one of the main military education programmes for cadets, named after Russian General Alexander Suvorov, a renowned military commander. The Suvorov schools were set up in Russia and Belarus in the 1940s to train young cadets across the USSR and were designed to instil ideas among school-age children about the honour of defending the ‘motherland’, modelling Suvorov’s early experiences with battle. Suvorov’s methods and philosophical ideas about patriotism emphasised the importance of education, maintaining that tactics and good morale among soldiers is only part of the picture for victory, and that good training is paramount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is telling that the Minsk school, set up in 1952, retains Suvorov’s name, indicating a common military mindset, even though one of Suvorov’s key achievements was his contribution to Russia’s seizure of Belarusian lands. Many senior Belarusian officers are graduates of the Suvorov institution, including Stanislav Zas, a former secretary of the Security Council and current chair of the CSTO, and Andrey Ravkov, minister for defence from 2014 to 2020, and current secretary of the Security Council. The Suvorov school does not name a specific adversary in its training manuals, but it is evident from the description of its ideologies and guiding ethos that they are pitted against the West. Even where training is localised in Belarus, it remains heavily influenced by Russia’s concept of threat and war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political tensions between Russia and Belarus are reflected in changes to Belarus’s military staff. After the annexation of Crimea and Belarus’s criticism of Russia, the Belarusian Security Council was thought to have held back promotions for Russia-born and Russia-trained officers. Officially, Russia remained Belarus’s key ally, but the fissures in the relationship had a topdown effect. Before, Russia-trained senior officers had been favoured, and played a significant role in military policy. Nevertheless, although Crimea may have had an impact, the most senior positions are still occupied by officers who trained in Russia. In the event of a Russian victory in Ukraine – whatever that may look like – this effect could be inverted, with Belarusian officers who distinguish themselves as part of the tyl being accorded with honours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emphasis on joint military education goes beyond the armed forces into academia. Belarus has a regional branch of Russia’s Academy of Military Science (FAS), a research organisation that teaches on war and strategy, and deepens military research ties and technical expertise with Russia. This is psychologically important, as it contributes to common understandings of concepts of war and the enemy. While its actual impact on the broader psychology of the Belarusian military is difficult to determine, one of the academy’s tasks is to work with all other military institutions in Belarus on research and ideology. No other post-Soviet country has a branch of FAS that functions in this manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;defence-industrial-ties&quot;&gt;DEFENCE-INDUSTRIAL TIES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defence is often cited as the area of deepest coordination between Belarus and Russia, but the Ukraine war could exacerbate existing practical problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Soviet times, Belarus has depended on Russia as a supplier of military hardware and as the main market for Belarusian manufacturing. Its products are cheaper and of better quality than their Russian counterparts, and when ties between Russian and Ukrainian defence-industrial contracts were severed after Russia annexed Crimea, Belarusian manufacturers moved into the vacuum to fulfil these defence contracts. This has further entrenched Belarus’s longstanding role as defence supplier to Russia – Belarus exports around US$250–300 million of military products to Russia each year. While financially beneficial to Belarus, this interdependence between Russia and Belarus’s military-industrial complexes could complicate Russia’s military activities and ability to rearm in Ukraine, as Belarusian plants maintain and repair Soviet- and Russia-made equipment such as tanks and aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Orsha Aircraft Repair Plant (in which Motor Sich, a Ukrainian manufacturer that builds engines for aeroplanes and helicopters, previously held a controlling stake) services Russia’s helicopters, and the 140 Repair Plant in Borisov produces transport and armoured vehicles both for Russia and for internal use in Belarus. The 558 Aircraft Repair Plant in Baranovichi is used to repair Russia’s aircraft and train personnel to operate complex aviation materiel for the war in Ukraine. All these entities are currently on the international sanctions lists. Companies such as KB Radar, which supplies radar systems and electronic warfare equipment, and the 558 Aircraft Repair Plant, also supply parts and offer repairs to aircraft to numerous countries, particularly in Africa (Nigeria and Kenya) and Latin America – clients include Venezuela and Colombia. It remains to be seen whether these countries will prefer to take their business elsewhere out of concern over falling foul of these sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s attempts to ‘de-industrialise’ by reducing the number of Soviet-era heavy industry plants, alongside a series of bankruptcies and corruption scandals in its own defence production companies, have meant that Belarus is one of the few producers of military-grade components still exporting to Russia. The Russian army is reliant on sensors and the wheeled chassis produced by the Minsk Wheeled Tractor Plant (MZKT), which is used as a transport and launching platform for missiles such as the Topol-M. The Minsk Automobile Plant produces trucks and tractor trailers used for towing and installing Russian systems such as the Iskander-M missiles and S-400 air defence systems. Russia has struggled to identify a replacement for these services domestically; there are two factories that can potentially construct the chassis – one in Bryansk and another in Naberezhnye Chelny – but their products are much more expensive and have been criticised for their poor quality, so are rarely used by the military. While some of this low-tech material is unlikely to fundamentally frustrate Russia’s overall military aims, the provision of aviation training, as well as transportation vehicles, could slow down Russia’s efforts in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belarus’s defence-industrial complexes are heavily export-oriented: of the 25 companies that are controlled by the State Committee on Military Industry (Goskomvoenprom), only 10 are designed to fulfil Belarus’s domestic defence procurement. Although there are plans to increase it, Minsk’s own defence spending is around 1% of its GDP: lower than its internal security spend, revealing Lukashenko’s perception of threat sources. The Belarusian army is underfunded, mostly using Russian cast-offs for equipment (a common complaint of Lukashenko’s) that are more than 20 years old. Russia is also frustrated by this outsourcing of manpower and production to Belarus, and has long attempted to persuade Belarus to allow its dual use and key defence factories to be opened to Russian investors, which Minsk has successfully resisted, charging exorbitant prices for controlling stakes. This form of integration does not portray two armies operating seamlessly together, but rather a producer–exporter and client relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belarus’s struggling economy, under pressure from Western sanctions, may cause problems for Russia’s military supply chain down the line. MZKT (a manufacturer of military trucks) and its senior management have been under UK and European sanctions, including asset freezes and travel bans, since December 2020, for their role in supporting the repression of civil society in Belarus by providing equipment to the police and security services, and they were sanctioned by the US in February 2022 for contributing to Russia’s defence and transport sectors. In 2021, MZKT published its financial results, which showed its revenue shrinking from US$152 million in 2019 to US$115 million in 2020, a fall of almost a quarter. Other international sanctions, including from Norway and Japan, are isolating Belarus from the international supply chain, and most major Belarusian banks are also under restrictions, which could put pressure on Belarus’s ability to finance the manufacturing of these products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has adopted a critical approach in examining whether Russia’s framing of its defence relationship with Belarus can be cast as one of its potential vulnerabilities. As the paper has highlighted, the deep integration between the Belarusian and Russian armies and Moscow’s ultimate command of the strategic level firmly casts Belarus as the junior and subservient partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s understanding of Belarus – and the military functions it provides – as an extension of Russian territory, an idea reinforced by analysis that describes Belarus as a mere Russian military district – may mean that the Kremlin does not yet recognise the dependent relationship as a problem. The Russian security community may not view the outsourcing of its provision of important military functions as a fundamental weakness, but it is increasingly clear that without the tyl, Russia may not be able to achieve some of its strategic security goals. It cannot be assumed that the Belarusian military would unquestioningly fight – or supply – the Russian military in pursuit of Russia’s political goals, particularly if attaining those goals would weaken Lukashenko’s personal power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belarus’s deepening involvement in the Ukraine war, and a potentially unfavourable outcome for Russia and Belarus, could seriously impact Lukashenko’s domestic stability. The relationship may be stable for now, but economic issues in Belarus that could delay supplies, or instigate political changes in the country – especially regime change – could impact on Russia’s practical ability to rearm. NATO Allies should not overlook Belarus’s role as an important regional player, whether Lukashenko is disrupting Russia’s actions intentionally or unintentionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that an understanding of the potential frictions between Belarus and Russia should be informing NATO’s defence planning. While the two countries’ close links make it challenging to decouple them, determining where disagreements are would be useful when attempting to plan future scenarios, particularly relating to the outcome of the Ukraine war. Notwithstanding that the Ukraine war may have temporarily aligned their rhetoric, the bilateral relationship is not immune to change, and there are already numerous divergences in their threat perceptions and prioritisation of interests. There are also several risks on the horizon that could impact on the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Russia to ensure a smooth supply chain in future, it would have to apportion finances, domestic training and practical expertise to replace its reliance on Belarus for military-grade components. Economic issues in Belarus will mean that unless Russia continues to prop up the Belarusian economy, reliable supplies of military-grade components could be difficult to acquire. Reluctant to return to heavy manufacturing, Russia will be forced to offer Belarus significant loans, a challenge for a Russia under economic pressure itself. Although it may not be decisive, this could have implications for the course of the Ukraine war, as well as impacting on Russia’s supply chain delivery of its existing contracts as a weapons exporter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although unlikely at this stage, this risk would be exacerbated by any regime change in Belarus in the coming years that may seek to revise those defence contracts. Many of Russia’s defence relationships, such as with India, Latin America and Africa, depend on its ability to fulfil contracts, which it partly outsources to Belarusian maintenance and repair plants. Disruption to these relationships could affect Russia’s status as a global security actor, leaving a vacuum for other countries, such as China, to step in. Russia’s key defence weaknesses may lie not in personnel, weaponry or doctrine, but in third-party outsourcing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The political environment in Belarus could also be uncertain. The Kremlin has made it clear that it would like to see some alternative political groups emerge in Belarus, and perhaps ultimately a controlled transfer of power to another figure, but the closer Belarus’s defence ties with Russia, the less likely it is for democratic forces to influence the domestic environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, while unified doctrines, military interoperability, and ideology place Belarus firmly within Russia’s security orbit for now, prospects for change are not beyond view. The Belarusian tyl as the soft underbelly of the Russian armed forces may have been partially recognised by Russia’s senior leadership, but the few practical steps taken to address it have not yet succeeded in reducing Russia’s reliance on Belarus for machine parts, vehicles and specialist training. The deeper that military integration with Belarus grows, the more pressing this issue will become for Russia in future.&lt;/p&gt;

CSIS developed a wargame for a Chinese amphibious invasion of Taiwan and ran it 24 times.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;In most scenarios, the United States/Taiwan/Japan defeated a conventional amphibious invasion by China and maintained an autonomous Taiwan. However, this defense came at high cost. The United States and its allies lost dozens of ships, hundreds of aircraft, and tens of thousands of servicemembers. Taiwan saw its economy devastated. Further, the high losses damaged the U.S. global position for many years. China also lost heavily, and failure to occupy Taiwan might destabilize Chinese Communist Party rule. Victory is therefore not enough. The United States needs to strengthen deterrence immediately.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-challenge&quot;&gt;The Challenge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s leaders have become increasingly strident about unifying Taiwan with the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Senior U.S. officials and civilian experts alike have expressed concern about Chinese intentions and the possibility of conflict. Although Chinese plans are unclear, a military invasion is not out of the question and would constitute China’s most dangerous solution to its “Taiwan problem”; it has therefore justly become a focus of U.S. national security discourse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because “a Taiwan contingency is the pacing scenario” for the U.S. military, it is critical to have a shared, rigorous, and transparent understanding of the operational dynamics of such an invasion. Just as such an understanding was developed concerning the Cold War’s Fulda Gap, so too must analysts consider the Taiwan invasion scenario. This understanding is important because U.S. policy would be radically different if the defense were hopeless than if successful defense were achievable. If Taiwan can defend itself from China without U.S. assistance, then there is no reason to tailor U.S. strategy to such a contingency. At the other extreme, if no amount of U.S. assistance can save Taiwan from a Chinese invasion, then the United States should not mount a quixotic effort to defend the island. However, if U.S. intervention can thwart an invasion under certain conditions and by relying on certain key capabilities, then U.S. policy should be shaped accordingly. In this way, China would also be more likely to be deterred from an invasion in the first place. However, such shaping of U.S. strategy requires policymakers to have a shared understanding of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, there is no rigorous, open-source analysis of the operational dynamics and outcomes of an invasion despite its critical nature. Previous unclassified analyses either focus on one aspect of an invasion, are not rigorously structured, or do not focus on military operations. Classified wargames are not transparent to the public. Without a suitable analysis, public debate will remain unanchored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, this CSIS project designed a wargame using historical data and operations research to model a Chinese amphibious invasion of Taiwan in 2026. Some rules were designed using analogies with past military operations; for example, the Chinese amphibious lift was based on analysis of Normandy, Okinawa, and the Falklands. Other rules were based on theoretical weapons performance data, such as determining the number of ballistic missiles required to cover an airport. Most rules combined these two methods. In this way, the results of combat in the wargame were determined by analytically based rules instead of by personal judgment. The same set of rules applied to the first iteration and to the last iteration, ensuring consistency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on interviews and a literature review, the project posited a “base scenario” that incorporated the most likely values for key assumptions. The project team ran that base scenario three times. A variety of excursion cases then explored the effects of varying assumptions. The impact of these varying assumptions on the likely outcome is depicted in a Taiwan Invasion Scorecard (see Figure 8). In all, 24 iterations of the game mapped the contours of the conflict and produced a coherent and rigorously derived picture of a major threat facing the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-results&quot;&gt;The Results&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The invasion always starts the same way: an opening bombardment destroys most of Taiwan’s navy and air force in the first hours of hostilities. Augmented by a powerful rocket force, the Chinese navy encircles Taiwan and interdicts any attempts to get ships and aircraft to the besieged island. Tens of thousands of Chinese soldiers cross the strait in a mix of military amphibious craft and civilian roll-on, roll-off ships, while air assault and airborne troops land behind the beachheads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in the most likely “base scenario,” the Chinese invasion quickly founders. Despite massive Chinese bombardment, Taiwanese ground forces stream to the beachhead, where the invaders struggle to build up supplies and move inland. Meanwhile U.S. submarines, bombers, and fighter/attack aircraft, often reinforced by Japan Self-Defense Forces, rapidly cripple the Chinese amphibious fleet. China’s strikes on Japanese bases and U.S. surface ships cannot change the result: Taiwan remains autonomous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one major assumption here: Taiwan must resist and not capitulate. If Taiwan surrenders before U.S. forces can be brought to bear, the rest is futile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This defense comes at a high cost. The United States and Japan lose dozens of ships, hundreds of aircraft, and thousands of servicemembers. Such losses would damage the U.S. global position for many years. While Taiwan’s military is unbroken, it is severely degraded and left to defend a damaged economy on an island without electricity and basic services. China also suffers heavily. Its navy is in shambles, the core of its amphibious forces is broken, and tens of thousands of soldiers are prisoners of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conditions-for-success&quot;&gt;Conditions for Success&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysis of the 24 game iterations showed four necessary conditions to defeat a Chinese invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-taiwanese-forces-must-hold-the-line&quot;&gt;1. Taiwanese forces must hold the line.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: Strengthen Taiwanese ground forces.&lt;/strong&gt; Because some Chinese forces will always land on the island, Taiwanese ground forces must be able to contain any beachhead and then counterattack forcefully as Chinese logistics weaken. However, the Taiwanese ground forces have severe weaknesses. Therefore, Taiwan must fill its ranks and conduct rigorous, combined arms training. Ground forces must become the center of Taiwan’s defense effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-there-is-no-ukraine-model-for-taiwan&quot;&gt;2. There is no “Ukraine model” for Taiwan.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: In peacetime, the United States and Taiwan must work together to provide Taiwan with the weapons it needs; in wartime, if the United States decides to defend Taiwan, U.S. forces must quickly engage in direct combat.&lt;/strong&gt; In the Ukraine war, the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) have not sent troops directly into combat but have sent massive amounts of equipment and supplies to Ukraine. Russia has been unable to interdict this overland flow. However, the “Ukraine model” cannot be replicated in Taiwan because China can isolate the island for weeks or even months. Taiwan must start the war with everything it needs. Further, delays and half measures by the United States would make the defense harder, increase U.S. casualties, allow China to create a stronger lodgment, and raise the risk of escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-the-united-states-must-be-able-to-use-its-bases-in-japan-for-combat-operations&quot;&gt;3. The United States must be able to use its bases in Japan for combat operations.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: Deepen diplomatic and military ties with Japan.&lt;/strong&gt; While other allies (e.g., Australia and South Korea) are important in the broader competition with China and may play some role in the defense of Taiwan, Japan is the linchpin. Without the use of U.S. bases in Japan, U.S. fighter/attack aircraft cannot effectively participate in the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4-the-united-states-must-be-able-to-strike-the-chinese-fleet-rapidly-and-en-masse-from-outside-the-chinese-defensive-zone&quot;&gt;4. The United States must be able to strike the Chinese fleet rapidly and en masse from outside the Chinese defensive zone.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: Increase the arsenal of long-range anti-ship cruise missiles.&lt;/strong&gt; Bombers capable of launching standoff, anti-ship ordnance offer the fastest way to defeat the invasion with the least amount of U.S. losses. Procuring such missiles and upgrading existing missiles with this anti-ship capability needs to be the top procurement priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;avoiding-a-pyrrhic-victory&quot;&gt;Avoiding a Pyrrhic Victory&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Victory is not everything. The United States might win a pyrrhic victory, suffering more in the long run than the “defeated” Chinese. Furthermore, the perception of high costs might undermine deterrence: if China believes that the United States would be unwilling to bear the high costs of defending Taiwan, then China might risk an invasion. The United States should therefore institute policies and programs to make winning less costly in the event of conflict. Such measures would include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;politics-and-strategy&quot;&gt;POLITICS AND STRATEGY&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clarify war plan assumptions. There is a seeming gap between war plans, which assume prewar deployments to Taiwan and neutral countries, and political realities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do not plan on striking the mainland. The National Command Authority might withhold permission because of the grave risks of escalation with a nuclear power.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recognize the need to continue operations in the face of heavy casualties. In three weeks, the United States will suffer about half as many casualties as it did in 20 years of war in Iraq and Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Move Taiwanese air and naval forces toward asymmetry. Despite rhetoric about adopting a “porcupine strategy,” Taiwan still spends most of its defense budget on expensive ships and aircraft that China will quickly destroy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;doctrine-and-posture&quot;&gt;DOCTRINE AND POSTURE&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fortify and expand air bases in Japan and Guam. Dispersion and hardening dilute the effects of missile attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Revise U.S. Air Force doctrine and restructure procurement to increase aircraft survivability on the ground. Ninety percent of aircraft losses occurred on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do not plan on overflying the Chinese mainland. Chinese air defense is too strong, the targets take a long time to produce operational results, and the air missions around Taiwan take priority.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recognize the limitations of Marine Littoral Regiments and Army Multi-Domain Task Forces and cap their numbers. These units are designed to counter China and do provide some value, but political and operational difficulties put limits on their utility.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Avoid crisis deployments that create vulnerabilities. Military doctrine calls for forward deployments to enhance deterrence during a crisis, but these forces make tempting targets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;weapons-and-platforms&quot;&gt;WEAPONS AND PLATFORMS&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shift to smaller, more survivable ships and develop rescue mechanisms to deal with crippled ships and multiple sinkings. Surface ships are extremely vulnerable, with the United States typically losing two carriers and 10 to 20 large surface combatants in game iterations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prioritize submarines and other undersea platforms. Submarines were able to enter the Chinese defensive zone and wreak havoc with the Chinese fleet, but numbers were inadequate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Continue development and fielding of hypersonic weapons but recognize that they are niche weapons. Their high cost limits inventories, so they lack the volume needed to counter the immense numbers of Chinese air and naval platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prioritize sustainment of the bomber fleet over fighters. The range, missile standoff distance, and high carrying capacity of bombers presented the People’s Liberation Army with daunting challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Produce more, cheaper fighters and balance the acquisition of stealth aircraft with production of non-stealth aircraft. With so many aircraft lost early in the conflict, the Air Force risks running out of fighter/attack aircraft and becoming a secondary player in the conflict unless it has a large enough force to sustain the losses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the project and its recommendations need some caveats. Modeling an invasion does not imply that it is inevitable or even probable. The Chinese leadership might adopt a strategy of diplomatic isolation, gray zone pressure, or economic coercion against Taiwan; even if China opts for military force, this might take the form of a blockade rather than an outright invasion. However, the risk of invasion is real enough and potentially so destructive that analysis is worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project does not take a position on whether the benefits of defending Taiwan outweigh the prospective costs, or how to weigh those costs and benefits. Instead, the purpose is to enhance the public debate and thus allow the nation to make better-informed decisions on this critical national security challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-this-project&quot;&gt;Why This Project?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Need for Transparent Analysis of a Taiwan Contingency&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was once unthinkable — direct conflict between the United States and China — has now become a commonplace discussion in the national security community. The rise of China as an economic and military power, Beijing’s coercive policies directed against Taiwan and other U.S. regional partners in Asia, and growing U.S. bipartisan support for balancing Chinese economic and military power have created an intensifying competition. A direct clash would constitute the first between nuclear powers and also the first in which both sides possessed the full spectrum of modern military capabilities, such as stealth aircraft, long-range precision munitions, and space surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the high stakes involved, there is little publicly available material on how such a conflict might play out. Much is classified and unavailable to the public. Unclassified material is either incomplete or too narrow for policymaking. By investigating many scenarios with a wargame based on analysis and running the wargame 24 times, this project fills a critical gap and furthers the public discussion of three key questions: Would a Chinese invasion of Taiwan succeed in 2026? What variables most affect that outcome? What would be the cost to both sides?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinas-economic-and-military-rise&quot;&gt;China’s Economic and Military Rise&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International relations scholars have long highlighted the dangerous dynamics between a rising power and an existing hegemon. In 1958, Abramo Organski first developed the notion that war becomes more likely as the capabilities of weaker, dissatisfied states approach those of the established, advantaged states. This theory provides the basis for a natural cycle of the rise and fall of hegemonic powers as unsatisfied and rising challengers defeat them. Graham Allison’s 2018 book about the “Thucydides trap” popularized this notion. The concern is that this theory applies to today, where a rising China challenges the hegemonic status that the United States has enjoyed since the end of the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The perception that China and the United States are strategic competitors, once debated, has gained widespread currency in both Washington and Beijing. In the United States, the sentiment has become bipartisan as hope has faded that China will become “a responsible member of the international community.” China’s attitude is hardening also. The two highest-grossing movies in Chinese history both featured the Chinese military taking on and defeating Americans (Wolf Warrior II and The Battle of Lake Changjin).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This view has been building over time. Andrew Marshall, the legendary head of the Office of Net Assessment, began warning about China in the late 1980s. Under President Barack Obama, the Pentagon launched the Third Offset Strategy to counter China’s growing capabilities, and in 2016, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter observed a “return to great power competition” in Asia. The Trump administration’s National Defense Strategy continued this view: “China is a strategic competitor using predatory economics to intimidate its neighbors while militarizing features in the South China Sea.” Most recently, the Biden administration’s National Security Strategy identifies China as the primary global competitor to the United States: “The PRC is the only competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to do it. Beijing has ambitions to create an enhanced sphere of influence in the Indo-Pacific and to become the world’s leading power.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has embarked on a concerted, long-term military modernization program. From its inception until the late 1990s, China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) was mainly land-focused, filled with masses of poorly trained conscripts, and unable to exert influence at a distance from its borders. Its poor performance in the 1979 border war with Vietnam underscored its weakness, as did the 1996 transit of the Taiwan Strait by U.S. naval forces. This has changed. As an annual assessment by the Department of Defense (DOD) notes: “The PRC has marshaled the resources, technology, and political will over the past two decades to strengthen and modernize the PLA in nearly every respect.” These capabilities have focused on air, naval, and missile systems that can target China’s periphery in a so-called anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s A2/AD capabilities are now formidable. China’s sizable and sophisticated force of ballistic and cruise missiles challenges the U.S. ability to operate from its few air bases in the Western Pacific, and China’s development of anti-ship ballistic missiles threatens to destroy U.S. surface ships. China began launching series production of fourth-generation fighter aircraft in the 2000s and now has more than 1,000 such aircraft in service. Series production of large modern warships (e.g., destroyers and frigates) did not begin until the mid-2010s, but progress since then has been even more striking. Between 2014 and mid-2020, China launched 25 Luyang III (Type 052Ds) destroyers and 8 Renhai cruisers. It is currently building its third aircraft carrier, which, at 80,000 tons, will be much larger than its first two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China’s A2/AD capabilities are now formidable. China’s sizable and sophisticated force of ballistic and cruise missiles challenges the U.S. ability to operate from its few air bases in the Western Pacific, and China’s development of anti-ship ballistic missiles threatens to destroy U.S. surface ships.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission’s 2021 annual report to Congress found that decades of improvements by China’s armed forces “have fundamentally transformed the strategic environment,” weakening military deterrence across the Taiwan Strait and diminishing the position of the United States. The commission concluded, “Today, the [PLA] either has or is close to achieving an initial capability to invade Taiwan — one that remains under development but that China’s leaders may employ at high risk — while deterring, delaying, or defeating U.S. military intervention.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite impressive gains, China’s air and naval capabilities still lag behind aggregate U.S. capabilities in quality and breadth of capability. The fifth-generation aircraft of the PLA Air Force (PLAAF) suffer from the lack of a suitable domestically produced engine and have, therefore, only been produced in limited numbers. The PLA Navy (PLAN) lacks an adequate fighter for its carriers, and its submarine quieting technology remains immature. Despite recent growth, the sustainability and support capabilities of air-to-air refueling aircraft and amphibious warfare ships are limited. Perhaps most importantly, the PLA’s “software” (e.g., training, joint operations, and other human elements) is only beginning to adapt to the requirements of modern high-intensity warfare. PLA leaders are aware of and addressing all the organization’s weaknesses, and China watchers expect improvement in virtually all areas over time. Indeed, President Xi Jinping called for improving military readiness in his speech to the National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in October 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, wars are not decided solely by aggregate or abstract capabilities. Geography generally favors China in the relevant scenarios. Taiwan’s coast is about 160 km (100 miles) from the Chinese mainland but more than 8,000 km from Honolulu and 11,000 km from San Diego. Flowing forces into the immediate theater would take far longer for the United States than for China. China also enjoys continental scale and strategic depth across which it can deploy or protect aircraft as battlefield needs dictate. The United States would be limited to a handful of air bases in the Western Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the United States benefits from maritime strategic depth, with the ability to operate from the more open spaces of the Western Pacific. Chinese naval forces would be more susceptible to detection in the confined seas adjacent to its territory. Perhaps most important, conducting an opposed amphibious assault is a hazardous and unforgiving undertaking under even the best of circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;taiwan-is-the-most-dangerous-us-china-flashpoint&quot;&gt;Taiwan Is the Most Dangerous U.S.-China Flashpoint&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan is widely regarded as the most dangerous potential flashpoint for conflict between the United States and China. In 1949, the nationalist government of China (under the Kuomintang party, or KMT) established an autonomous government on the island after being pushed off the mainland. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) thus regards Taiwan as a breakaway province with no legitimate claim to autonomy or independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognizing Beijing as the sole legitimate government of China and severing diplomatic relations with Taipei is a precondition for any country to establish diplomatic relations with China. As leaders and officials in Beijing are fond of repeating, China has never foresworn the use of force against Taiwan. To make the point, China’s 2005 Anti-Secession Law outlines the circumstances under which China might employ force. A recent white paper by the Chinese Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council laid out the policy: “We are one China, and Taiwan is part of China. . . . We will work with the greatest sincerity and exert our utmost efforts to achieve peaceful reunification. But we will not renounce the use of force, and we reserve the option of taking all necessary measures.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi Jinping’s report to the 20th Party Congress reiterated this policy: “Taiwan is China’s Taiwan. Resolving the Taiwan question is a matter that must be resolved by the Chinese. We will continue to strive for peaceful reunification with the greatest sincerity and the utmost effort, but we will never promise to renounce the use of force, and we reserve the option of taking all measures necessary.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underlining this increasingly assertive attitude has been a practice of provocative military exercises. China increasingly flies masses of aircraft into the Taiwanese air defense identification zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Chinese leaders have said they will not allow reunification to be postponed indefinitely, it is unclear what that means in practice. Much clearer is China’s commitment to demonstrating resolve when unwelcome events appear to move Taiwan further from unification — as China did with missile tests off Taiwan after President Lee Teng-hui visited the United States in June 1995 and recently with the military demonstrations during House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan in the summer of 2022. The linkage of both events to the United States indicates the degree of U.S. involvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Taiwan is China’s Taiwan. Resolving the Taiwan question is a matter that must be resolved by the Chinese. . . . we reserve the option of taking all measures necessary. — Xi Jingping&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has maintained a policy of strategic ambiguity to discourage China from attacking Taiwan while also discouraging Taipei from taking actions that might incentivize such an attack. This is also called dual deterrence, as it aims to deter China from invading Taiwan and deter Taiwan from declaring independence. In accordance with the Three Communiqués with China, in 1972, 1979, and 1982, and the U.S. “One China” policy, the United States maintains formal diplomatic relations with Beijing, not Taipei. Nevertheless, it nurtures historically deep cultural and economic ties with Taipei. Under the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, the United States provides weapons that Taiwan needs to defend itself, although the United States has no formal obligation to defend Taiwan directly. A variety of additional agreements, laws, and documents link the countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The historical relationship with Taiwan (now formally limited to economic and cultural engagement) creates a perception of obligation among many, a perception enhanced by Taiwan’s transition to vibrant democracy during the 1990s. Recently, President Joe Biden has sent clear deterrence signals to China without formally changing policy. When asked whether the United States was “willing to get involved militarily to defend Taiwan if it comes to that,” President Biden replied, “Yes, that’s the commitment we made.” President Biden has made such statements repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some members of Congress, wanting to strengthen U.S. support of Taiwan, have proposed the Taiwan Policy Act, which would provide direct military aid and enhance Taiwan’s diplomatic status. Although the act did not pass, it did show strong congressional support for Taiwan. As evidence of a closer military relationship, reports have emerged that the United States has military planning cells on Taiwan. Although these appear to be limited, they constitute a direct military relationship that has not existed since 1973.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Balancing these leanings are official statements that U.S. policy has not changed. Indeed, the National Security Strategy reiterated the “One China” policy, as did a State Department statement. Further, there is a range of opinions within the United States on the wisdom of defending Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project does not take a position about whether the United States would or should become involved militarily in a conflict over Taiwan. It is enough to believe that, under certain conditions, the United States might intervene. An assessment of the outcomes of such an intervention is therefore valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;increasing-worries-about-an-imminent-chinese-attack&quot;&gt;Increasing Worries about an Imminent Chinese Attack&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Senior military officials have expressed concerns that China’s military might be preparing a military solution to the “breakaway province” problem — or preparing that capability in case called upon to act. Admiral Philip S. Davidson, commander of Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) until April 2021, testified that the Chinese threat to invade Taiwan “is manifest . . . in the next six years.” Current INDOPACOM commander Admiral John C. Aquilino, when asked for his opinion, stated that “this problem is much closer to us than most think.” Other military and civilian officials — for example, Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, Admiral Michael M. Gilday, chief of naval operations, and Admiral Charles Richard, head of Strategic Command — have expressed similar concerns. This is a broad narrative in the national security community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Senior military officials have expressed concerns that China’s military might be preparing a military solution to the “breakaway province” problem. . . . Others are more cautious . . . The project does not take a position on the likelihood of conflict but recognizes the possibility of conflict.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Civilian writers echo these concerns. Recent articles in the New York Times, Foreign Affairs, and the defense trade press have highlighted Chinese assertiveness about Taiwan and the risks of a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oriana Skylar Mastro, a Chinese specialist at Stanford University, observed, “In recent months there have been disturbing signs that Beijing is reconsidering its peaceful approach [to Taiwan] and contemplating armed unification. . . . Whereas Chinese leaders used to view a military campaign to take the island as a fantasy, now they consider it a real possibility.” Lonnie Henley, a retired defense intelligence officer for East Asia at the Defense Intelligence Agency, stated before Congress that, “if the political leadership turned to the [PLA] today and said, can you invade right now, it’s my assessment that the answer would be a firm yes.” Robert Blackwill and Philip Zelikow go further: “China is now in a prewar tempo of political and military preparations. We do not mean that we know that China is about to embark on a war. We simply observe that the Chinese government is taking actions that a country would do if it were moving into a prewar mode.” Taiwan itself has entered the debate, with its defense minister saying that China would be able to launch a “full-scale invasion” by 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others are more cautious and stress that it is difficult to impute intentions from improving capabilities. General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, addressed the statements made by other military leaders: “What Davidson and Aquilino and others have said is that Chinese capability to invade and seize the island of Taiwan is being accelerated to 2027, six years from now. I don’t dismiss that at all. . . but I don’t see it happening right out of the blue.” Christopher Johnson, a China scholar at CSIS, was more emphatic, saying that at the 2022 party congress Xi “held fast to the judgment that stability and economic growth continued to be dominant global trends” and that portrayals of Xi as “itching for war” were “overhyped.” Lonnie Henley qualified his own congressional testimony, writing separately:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I do not think they [the Chinese] will attack Taiwan as long as they believe unification without war remains a viable course of action. They will attack, however, despite the enormous cost and despite any doubts about their own military capabilities, if they judge that peaceful unification is no longer possible, that military force is the only remaining option. That in turn is driven by their assessment of political developments in Taipei and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Timothy Heath similarly argues that “There is no evidence that the [Chinese] government is seriously contemplating abandoning its peaceful unification strategy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project does not take a position on the likelihood of conflict but recognizes the possibility of conflict. A CSIS study on surprise in war concluded that “wars happen” despite the dangers, uncertainty, and potential economic ruin. Nations miscalculate the military balance, get swept along in a crisis, feel that the balance of power is moving against them, or make national security choices based on domestic politics. As Colin Kahl, DOD undersecretary for policy, said: “I don’t think in the next couple of years that they’re likely to invade Taiwan, but you never know.” Although there is an ongoing debate about both Chinese capabilities and intentions, China’s determination to develop military options for use against Taiwan is widely accepted. A war over Taiwan is not certain, but it is not unimaginable either; for that reason, wargaming such a conflict is important for developing U.S. policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;parallels-and-differences-with-the-war-in-ukraine&quot;&gt;Parallels and Differences with the War in Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has sparked a renewed interest in international conflict. The focus for the last generation has been on gray zone conflict and insurgency. The possibility of one country invading another to acquire territory seemed antiquated. Russia’s attack on Ukraine has reminded the world that cross-border invasions are possible. Speculation about a Chinese invasion of Taiwan was inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A war over Taiwan is not certain, but it is not unimaginable either; for that reason, wargaming such a conflict is important for developing U.S. policy.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are clear parallels between the Russian invasion of Ukraine and a possible Chinese attack on Taiwan. Russia and China believe that the target is not a sovereign state but a part of their country and should be reunited. Both are authoritarian (though of very different forms), and the target is democratic. In both cases, the United States and many global partners would support the potential victim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also significant differences, including two that pertain directly to military deterrence. First, the United States has a longer and deeper history with Taiwan. It seems more committed to Taiwan’s defense than to that of Ukraine and, as discussed earlier, more likely to intervene directly. Second, the challenge to the Chinese military is much greater. It is harder to cross 160 km of water than to cross a land border, as Russia has done. Moreover, once a landing has begun, there is no going back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Views about how China sees the war in Ukraine have been highly speculative since China’s decisionmaking process is so opaque. Early on, the concern was that Russia’s success in Ukraine would embolden China. More recently, Russia’s military failure and the strong diplomatic reaction may discourage China. Regardless, the invasion has reminded everyone that irredentist policies are dangerous, that U.S. deterrence might fail, and that countries might do what they say they reserve the right to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;limitations-of-currently-available-models-assessments-and-wargames&quot;&gt;Limitations of Currently Available Models, Assessments, and Wargames&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although there is a building sense of crisis about the Taiwan Strait, the ability of Chinese forces to achieve operational objectives has not been adequately studied in the public domain. Previous analyses largely include unclassified models focusing on one aspect of an invasion, seminar-type games that educate players but do not provide an adequate analytic foundation for policy recommendations, political-military games that primarily investigate diplomatic and political issues, or classified wargames whose assumptions and even results are not transparent to the public. All of these analytical efforts have value, but none can answer the central question of this project: can China conquer Taiwan in a military invasion?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Views about how China sees the war in Ukraine have been highly speculative since China’s decisionmaking process is so opaque. . . . Regardless, the invasion has reminded everyone that irredentist policies are dangerous, that U.S. deterrence might fail, and that countries might do what they say they reserve the right to do.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;existing-unclassified-analyses-and-assessments&quot;&gt;Existing Unclassified Analyses and Assessments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scholars of military affairs and China have conducted several analyses and assessments that have contributed to understanding the military balance. These efforts have been invaluable resources for developing the project’s wargame. However, they do not purport to convert the data or insights into a wargame that would provide operational insights in a dynamic environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Michael O’Hanlon of the Brookings Institution and a long-time military analyst produced an assessment of China’s prospects for invasion in 2000. The assessment was detailed and analytical, concluding that an invasion was not possible at that time. However, as detailed above, much has changed in recent decades.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ian Easton’s 2019 book on the subject, The Chinese Invasion Threat, contains detailed information about geography and orders of battle but does not convert those into a model or wargame.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Michael A. Glosny (2004), Bradley Martin et al. (2022), and O’Hanlon (2022) looked at a Chinese blockade of Taiwan rather than an amphibious invasion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stephen Biddle and Ivan Oelrich (2016) argue that surface ships will not be able to survive within 400 to 600 km of hostile coasts due to advances in A2/AD, but they do not go on to model an invasion of Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The U.S.-China Military Scorecard (2015), published by RAND, assessed many elements of a potential invasion over time and in depth, though without aggregating them into a unified analysis. One of its conclusions was the need for a wargame: “Perhaps the most direct follow-on to this study would be the creation of a unified model to assess the interrelationships between the different scorecards.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;wargames&quot;&gt;WARGAMES&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several organizations have conducted wargames that examine a possible U.S.-China conflict over Taiwan. However, their focus has been on escalation dynamics and politics rather than analysis of military operational outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2022, the Center for a New American Security (CNAS) worked with NBC’s Meet the Press to broadcast a wargame on a notational 2027 Chinese invasion of Taiwan and, in June, published a corresponding report, Dangerous Straits. These provided compelling and insightful examinations of the political and military issues related to such a conflict, especially prewar deterrence, alliance management, nuclear signaling, political messaging, and escalation management. However, these games were not focused on operational outcomes. Furthermore, the structure of the CNAS game restricted the exercise to a single iteration with a single set of assumptions and a single set of players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CNAS conducted another game, described in a report, entitled The Poison Frog Strategy, developed from an earlier game exploring a Chinese seizure of Pratas Island/Dongsha Atoll and its international fallout. A game sponsored by Germany’s Körber Foundation, in cooperation with the United Kingdom’s Chatham House, examined the potential European response to a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. The two games — CNAS and Körber — were similar in that they were single-instance seminar games that focused heavily on political issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reuters published an investigative report that was termed a wargame. The report presented several policy and governmental scenarios to describe possible escalatory paths for China and Taiwan. While this report was not a game in the customary sense, it did present several plausible scenarios based on expert opinions and illustrated its findings with excellent graphics. The report was also a good example of how broadly the term “wargame” is used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these games provided useful policy insights. However, wargames specifically about military operational outcomes are needed as a complement. Unfortunately, all such wargames hitherto have been in the classified realm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lack-of-transparency-from-classified-wargames&quot;&gt;Lack of Transparency from Classified Wargames&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD has done much internal wargaming on a U.S.-China conflict, but the results are classified, with only a few details leaking out. These details hint at heavy casualties and unfavorable outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, in a widely cited commentary, David Ochmanek, a senior RAND analyst, noted, “In our games, when we fight Russia and China, [the United States] gets its ass handed to it.” Michele Flournoy, former undersecretary of defense for policy, similarly stated, “The Pentagon’s own war games reportedly show that current force plans would leave the military unable to deter and defeat Chinese aggression in the future.” Another report noted that a “secret wargame” showed that the United States could prevail in the conflict with China, but at the risk of causing nuclear escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding another wargame, General John E. Hyten, then-vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said, “[The U.S. warfighting concept] failed miserably. An aggressive China team that had been studying the United States for the last 20 years just ran rings around us.” This happened, at least in part, because “the blue team lost access to its networks almost immediately.” Unclear was what sort of cyberattack caused this loss of capability or what the China team did to “run circles” around the U.S. team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2021, Lieutenant General S. Clinton Hinote, the deputy chief of staff, strategy, integration, and requirements, headquarters, said that for over a decade, U.S. Air Force wargames had indicated that the Chinese were investing in military capabilities that would make the Air Force’s preferred model of expeditionary warfare “increasingly difficult.” “The trend in our wargames was not just that we were losing, but we were losing faster,” he said. He told reporters, “The definitive answer if the U.S. military doesn’t change course is that we’re going to lose fast. In that case, an American president would likely be presented with almost a fait accompli.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As these examples indicate, these hints from the classified world do not specify the parameters of the games, including basic information such as when the war occurs, or the conditions and assumptions incorporated into the game. Many DOD wargames are set far in the future — not infrequently 20 years in the future — to grapple with future acquisition questions that often play out over decades. References to losses or challenges may not refer to operational outcomes, such as which side achieved its objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not surprising since those wargames are classified, and the restrictions are intended to keep sensitive data from potential adversaries. However, restrictions on describing game parameters make it impossible for outsiders to judge why the outcomes occurred, whether the game assumptions were reasonable, and whether alternative assumptions might produce different outcomes. Further, many of the reported results appear self-serving, as they support programs favored by the wargaming agency. Classified wargames also often focus on challenging cases, even if those cases are not particularly likely, to test the limits of the U.S. military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without transparency and independent assessment of the assumptions, it is impossible to judge a game’s credibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-need-for-a-wargame-examining-operational-outcomes&quot;&gt;The Need for a Wargame Examining Operational Outcomes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project fills a void in the literature by providing an unclassified analysis of operational outcomes if China attempted to invade Taiwan. This is important for three reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, there is disagreement about whether a defense of Taiwan could be successful. Any policy discussion must begin with baseline assumptions and resulting outcomes against which to measure change. The nature of the policy discussion depends heavily on the baseline. If China can take Taiwan in a day, that produces a different discussion than if Taiwan can hold out for weeks while the United States and its partners deploy forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, by examining a wide variety of scenarios, the project can provide insights into the most important conditions for success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the project provides the necessary descriptions and data for the broader national security community to discuss these critical issues of war and peace, deterrence, and national commitment. The Pentagon’s classified wargames do not help this broader discussion. Decisions relating to the defense of Taiwan are not just technical but involve judgments about values, priorities, and trade-offs. This project facilitates that discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;This project fills a void in the literature by providing an unclassified analysis of operational outcomes if China attempted to invade Taiwan.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-the-project-does-not-do&quot;&gt;What the Project Does Not Do&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the project assesses the prospects of a Chinese military invasion of Taiwan, it does not investigate other strategies that might be attractive. For example, China might blockade Taiwan and try to achieve its goals without an amphibious assault and all the attendant risks. Similarly, the United States might avoid a direct military confrontation but instead blockade China, intending the long-term pain to force the Chinese government to relinquish its gains. In some instances, the players might want to use nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China might bombard Taiwan for an extended period before launching an attack. This would allow China to isolate Taiwan, grind down Taiwan’s air and naval forces, and assemble a fleet of merchant ships to act as decoys and “missile sponges” in an attack. The historical analogy would be German air attacks on Great Britain in the summer of 1940. Even though the ocean barrier was narrow, Germany recognized that risks were great if opposing air and naval assets still operated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each alternative approach has strengths and weaknesses. All entail less military risk and might be more attractive to a cautious Chinese leadership. The project does not take a position on what action is most likely. Indeed, there is no certainty that China will undertake any military action at all. However, invasion is the most dangerous threat to Taiwan and is thus the first course of action that needs to be analyzed, hence the relevance and importance of the current project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The teams play as military command authorities rather than civilian commanders in chief. Thus, there is no political and nuclear decisionmaking within each game iteration by the teams. However, varying the structure of scenarios allows analysis of some alternative approaches in these areas. (The variables are discussed in detail in Chapter 5). For example, in some scenarios, concerns about nuclear escalation led to rules of engagement prohibiting the United States from attacking the Chinese mainland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the project does not make recommendations about U.S. Taiwan policy. This project assessed the potential costs of maintaining Taiwan’s autonomy but does not examine the benefits. Many commentators note the moral value of preserving a democracy of 23 million people and that a China-controlled Taiwan would complicate the defense of regional allies, including Japan and South Korea. An evaluation of U.S. policy requires an assessment of benefits and costs that is beyond the scope of this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The graphic below shows how the current analysis fits into a broader assessment of U.S.-Chinese relations. It is an important element but only one aspect of such an assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The project does not make recommendations about U.S. Taiwan policy. . . . [Such an] evaluation of U.S. policy requires an assessment of benefits and costs that is beyond the scope of this project.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wargaming-as-a-method&quot;&gt;Wargaming as a Method&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project sought to produce a wargame that was transparent and analytically sound, such that decisionmakers and the public could use it to make decisions about policy. This chapter discusses the design decisions intended to produce such a game. A list of relevant terms and their definitions is in Appendix B, which details relevant wargaming lexicon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When analyzing military affairs, there has been a historical tension between quantitative modeling and qualitative judgments. Wargaming offers one tool to combine these two approaches. For a wargame aimed at analysis (instead of participant education or other purposes), quantitative models provide the best tools to base adjudications on because of their transparency and rigor. The decisionmaking of players adds human judgment to the interaction of these quantitative models, allowing for plausible sequences of events to be explored. To aggregate models and human decisionmaking in a structured way that addresses uncertain assumptions, analytic wargames should be varied and iterated. The results of a series of wargames thus constructed offer insights into the distribution of outcomes for a future conflict and how key variables impact this distribution. While it is not predictive, it provides data on plausible outcomes and facilitates informed analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;quantitative-models-vs-qualitative-judgments&quot;&gt;Quantitative Models vs. Qualitative Judgments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first decision in beginning an assessment of a hypothetical future conflict is whether to use quantitative models, qualitative judgments, or some combination of the two. To assess the complex set of operations that would constitute an invasion of Taiwan, wargaming offers a good mix of rigor and transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any attempt to analyze the future relies on judgments about uncertainty. This is especially true for warfare, which is chaotic and contingent on chance. For example, although there have been amphibious landings before, they are too few to generate quantitative models allowing for statistical confidence. Even issues of weapon performance, which should be the most amenable to analysis based on testing and modeling, require some judgment because such testing is conducted under peacetime conditions; there is, for example, no real-world data on the performance of a Chinese YJ-12 anti-ship cruise missile against an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer. This uncertainty is only magnified when trying to appraise key factors such as the relative morale and training of forces. Every analysis of future war must therefore approach the problem with humility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uncertainty aside, there are more basic analytic faults or pitfalls to be avoided. First are physically impossible faults: a prediction about a U.S.-China war that has 30 Ford-class carriers in the 2026 U.S. order of battle (OOB) is not factual. Second are faults that are physically possible but that overlook operational history, such as by having all 11 Ford-class carriers show up in a U.S.-China war without factoring some of them being in deep maintenance. While it is physically possible for the United States to have all 11 Ford-class carriers ready, such an analysis is less plausible than an analysis that accounts for historical factors, such as maintenance cycles and operational readiness. Most reasonable analytic disagreements occur in this space. Third is inflexibility about variation in assumptions: for example, ignoring the amount of warning available to the United States would miss important variation in how many carriers show up, where, and when. Any analysis based on one model or wargame would have difficulty addressing this problem. Fourth, analysis might restrict variables to quantifiable factors without exploring human decisionmaking: a model that has all carriers charge into the fight without concern for losses or changing tactics would ignore the human decisionmaking critical in warfare. Finally, analysis that is not transparent is impossible to dissect and debate. When considering methods of analysis and comparing them, all these factors must be considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most basic ways in which future conflicts are analyzed involves unstructured or loosely structured judgments. Unstructured judgments usually refer to sources about the relative strength of the concerned militaries and postulate a course of events, possibly based on analogy to an episode from military history. Loosely structured judgments may follow from simple quantitative comparisons (e.g., the total size of the contending militaries or the number of combat aircraft) that lack a structured assessment of how forces might interact dynamically over relevant time and space. While such judgments are easy to make, they allow little basis for discussion and lack replicability. When one person’s judgment conflicts with another’s, there is little ground for resolution. This leads to the requirement for methods of structured judgment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Methods of structured judgment, such as net assessment or the mission planning process, are helpful because they ensure that critical variables are not overlooked, and they allow for debate and scrutiny. For mission planning, junior officers in the U.S. Army and Marine Corps are taught the METT-TC mnemonic (Mission, Enemy, Terrain, Troops, Time, Civilians) to avoid forgetting critical factors. There are many similar and more complicated planning processes across the services that all aim to structure judgment about a military situation. Net assessment, although usually used for strategic and longer-term evaluations, represents another methodology that is less rigid than military mission planning but still structured. For example, Eliot Cohen describes net assessment as “the appraisal of military balances” that operates through examining five critical questions. Cohen contrasts net assessment with quantitatively oriented methods of analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military forces can also be analyzed with quantitative models. A model is “a mathematical or otherwise logically rigorous representation of a system or a system’s behavior.” While even loosely structured judgments may use numbers to support their argument, modeling adds rigor and transparency to these numbers and their interactions. Former secretary of defense Robert McNamara formalized the use of systems analysis in the DOD, principally to better inform the acquisitions process. During the Cold War, unified models (e.g., TACWAR and CEM) were developed to assess entire theater campaigns. These employed representations of ground attrition and movement, supplemented by simple calculations about the support provided by airpower. Some current campaign models (for example, JICM and STORM) incorporate sophisticated interactions and can employ imposing wills. However, all their results are classified and only run once, thus rendering them unsuitable for public discussion and sensitivity analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While modeling of future conflicts can be done under the umbrella of systems analysis, in the scholarly community it is usually conducted in the framework of campaign analysis. Campaign analysis is “a method that involves the use of a model and techniques for managing uncertainty to answer questions about military operations.” While campaign analysis has been practiced by many scholars over the last several decades, it has recently been formalized by Rachel Tecott and Andrew Halterman. The essence of campaign analysis is specifying a scenario, building a model based on historical data, running that model, and analyzing the model for sensitivity to variation. Campaign analysis is particularly suited to studying questions of sufficiency, such as the adequacy of certain force postures to succeed in a particular military operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, this difficulty contributed to debate between Cohen, who supported a broader framework of net assessment to address these and other uncertainties, and John Mearsheimer and Barry Posen, who supported using campaign analysis to evaluate specific operations analysis. Ideally, conflict analysis would combine the rigor and transparency of campaign analysis with human decisionmaking. One way to do this is with wargaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;different-wargames-for-different-purposes&quot;&gt;Different Wargames for Different Purposes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While wargaming has a long history, its relationship to analysis and military decisionmaking is still unsettled. Wargames are increasingly used as pedagogic and research tools at universities, think tanks, and government agencies to examine security questions from crisis stability to regional conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite calls to increase the use of wargaming in policy analysis, it is often unclear what such usage should look like and how it best aids the national security debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current debate on the utility of wargames centers around their purpose. Experimental wargames aim to better understand human decisionmaking in a specific context. Educational wargames aim to foster decisionmaking simulations for military and political elites. Finally, analytic wargaming aims to analyze a military problem to better inform policy. Each of these represents a path that this project might have followed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experimental wargaming aims to aid political scientists in the study of decisionmaking processes, particularly in international relations. Political science’s emphasis on experimentation and the desire to understand the micro-level processes of international wargames have led to the exploration of experimental wargaming. For example, Erik Lin-Greenberg conducted a series of wargames while varying whether a drone or a manned aircraft were shot down and, if a manned aircraft were shot down, what happened to the pilot. By manipulating a key variable and recording the discussions that ensued, the experimental wargame shed light on the ways that losses of drones might affect escalation risk differently than the losses of manned aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Educational wargaming aims to prepare leaders for decisionmaking in war. In the words of Peter Perla, “The choice of the best weapons and the men who will skillfully employ them is a major concern for the military and the nation. Wargames and wargaming are important tools for helping to sort through such choices.” In another formulation, Perla and McGrady write that wargaming’s strength is “its ability to enable individual participants to transform themselves by making them more open to internalizing their experiences in a game.” Francis J. McHugh argued for a subdivision between wargames that provide military commanders with decisionmaking experience and those that provide decisionmaking information. For example, playing a game about Napoleonic warfare might give contemporary military commanders decisionmaking experience, without giving them decisionmaking information about the war that they might have to fight in the future. Educational wargaming might therefore be subdivided into “experiential,” focusing on providing decisionmaking experience, and “current operations-oriented” games that focus on decisionmaking information. Regardless, educational wargames broadly favor the development of players over the use of wargames as analytic tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, analytic wargames exist to provide data about a specific problem that can be analyzed. Jon Compton has been the main proponent of this approach, calling for wargamers to take analytical ownership of national security problems. To do this, he argues for an analytic architecture that builds models based on evidence, which then feed into a wargame design that is vetted by subject matter experts; this game is then played iteratively by a small group of people to facilitate analysis. The use of quantitative models (in the sense of those used in campaign analysis) in wargames has not been a feature of many DOD wargames, causing some debate within the DOD wargaming community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crux of contemporary debate on wargaming centers on whether educational wargames are more helpful than analytic wargames for the national security enterprise. While both sides decry wargames that are a “bunch of guys sitting around a table,” they disagree on how to move forward. Perla advanced the idea of a “cycle of research” that integrates wargaming, analysis, and military exercises to illuminate the decisions, data, and actions relevant to contemporary warfighting. That is, wargames raise questions which are then to be explored through military exercises and mathematical analysis. Perla and co-authors reiterated the belief that wargaming could not take analytical ownership of a problem but that it should be mutually constitutive with exercises and analysis in informing policymakers, who would themselves own the problem. In line with Perla, McGrady argues that wargames function best as a storytelling device and not as a method of analysis. In riposte, Compton has written a fictional juxtaposition of his method with seminar-style educational wargaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the view of this report’s authors, different wargame purposes are not better or worse than others; the problem arises when a wargame is designed for one purpose but employed for another. When a wargame is designed to educate participants but is used as a basis of analysis, it results in wasted effort and faulty conclusions. The debate is not entirely a matter of misperception; some wargamers believe that wargames cannot serve certain purposes. Despite these disagreements, all agree that aligning the structure of a wargame to the purpose of a project is a key step in any wargaming effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;principles-of-analytic-wargaming&quot;&gt;Principles of Analytic Wargaming&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this project — to analyze the dynamics of a conventional invasion of Taiwan by China — led CSIS’s efforts to follow Compton’s analytical wargaming approach. The project does not purport to predict the future with certainty. However, the large number of game iterations, the variation of scenarios, and the adjudication based on evidence-based rules mean that policymakers and the public can reasonably use the range of outputs for making judgments about warfighting dynamics and policy choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Integrating methods of campaign analysis with Compton’s suggestions for analytic wargaming, this wargame:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Used a variety of methods to create evidence-based models that determined adjudication;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Integrated several models across domains to examine a campaign;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conducted many iterations with varied strategies by both sides;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Varied key assumptions to examine their impacts on the outcome;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Used players to account for human decisionmaking, explore many plausible pathways, and to inject variation into scenario outcomes; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nested the wargame in broader analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;using-the-method-of-history-and-the-method-of-pks-to-create-evidence-based-rules&quot;&gt;Using the Method of History and the Method of Pks to Create Evidence-based Rules&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important factor in making an analytic wargame generate plausible outcomes is for the rules to be based on empirical data. The rules of educational wargames do not have to conform to reality in order to teach students about strategy. However, rules are how analytic wargames model reality. As mentioned above, it is impossible for the rules to be entirely certain because of the paucity of real-life cases of twenty-first century warfare. However, wargames based on rigorous modeling that recognizes physical constraints and operational realities will generate analytically valid insights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two broad approaches to creating models: the method of history and the method of Pks. This project used both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The method of history models the results of future military operations by making analogies with past military operations at the appropriate level of analysis. For example, this may include using the sorties per day of aircraft from Desert Storm to project the sortie rate per day of aircraft in a future conflict or allowing players to move land forces based on historical advance rates. This approach is popular both in campaign analysis and in commercial wargaming. Dunnigan, in a foreword to Perla, argues: “Basically, you obtain good games by paying attention to past experience (history) and letting the chips fall where they may.” However, history is not self-explanatory, and analogies can be misleading. A key question is one posed by Barry Posen: “What is this a case of?” For example, modeling the rate of advance for an infantry unit in urban terrain during heavy combat on a historical breakthrough operation by a mechanized force across plains would be inappropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pks method models the results of future military operations by assigning probabilities and values to the weapons systems and aggregating these capabilities up to the appropriate level. “Pks” means the probability of kill, a common measure of theoretical weapon efficacy. Every military operation is the result of an infinite number of micro-level interactions, such as the detection of enemies, the employment of weapons, and the result of a hit. While every interaction cannot be modeled, the method of Pks tries to model the likely effects of major weapons and their effects. This is more suited for air, naval, and missile combat than for ground combat. Data about the probabilities of detection, weapon hits, and weapons effects can be taken from historical data or weapons testing data. In the absence of better evidence, values can be taken from subject matter experts. These probabilities can be calculated separately or aggregated into a cumulative “probability of kill,” or Pk. With these values in hand, researchers model individual interactions, then aggregate the results of these interactions to the appropriate level for the analysis (e.g., individual dogfights, meetings between two aircraft flights, or even squadron-on-squadron engagements). Games conducted during the interwar period at the Naval War College addressed this problem by modeling “hit probabilities,” derived from real-world tests with bomber aircraft and warship guns, and then embedding those models into the larger operational wargames.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The method of history and the method of Pks both have strengths and weaknesses. The method of history does a good job of ensuring that models account for operational realities: allowing a tank battalion to advance according to the maximum speed of a tank, for example, ignores the operational reality that it is much harder to organize and direct an armored force. The method of history deals with problems of aggregation and unknown factors by getting plausible values at the appropriate level of analysis. In contrast, the method of Pks struggles to deal with these operational factors and cannot account for unquantifiable factors such as morale and friction. However, the method of history is not as good at accounting for changes in weaponry and technology or situations that lack good analogies; in contrast, the method of Pks excels here. For example, there is no historical precedent for mass precision-guided tactical ballistic missile attacks against defended targets that would allow the method of history to work. The method of Pks can be used to extrapolate upward from historical cases of single ballistic missile launches and from testing data on interceptors. The mixed virtues and vices of these methods means that researchers must be aware of and use each as appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;anti-ship-missile-interception&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Anti-ship Missile Interception&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;How frequently do anti-ship cruise missiles hit their targets? This project combines the methods of history and Pks to generate rules that are rigorous and evidence based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;First, based on missile attacks in Desert Storm, the project team estimates that 15 percent of missiles either fail to launch or otherwise malfunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The project team assumes that defenders will have sufficient warning to launch interceptors. The curvature of the earth restricts a radar on a 15-meter mast from seeing a missile skimming 5 meters above the sea until the missile is 20 kilometers from the ship. Depending on the tactical situation, the defending ships might also have airborne early warning (AEW) or organic helicopters to aid in initial detection. This project judges that this initial detection is sufficient to alert the crew, but that the defenders only have one engagement opportunity against a supersonic cruise missile traveling at approximately 2,400 km/hr. They would launch two interceptors in a salvo against each incoming missile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The project team further estimates that each interceptor launched by the defender has a 70 percent chance of hitting an incoming anti-ship cruise missile. While this number is supported in a variety of sources, it does strike the authors as optimistic. One excursion case explores what would happen if missile interception were not as effective. With two interceptors launched at each supersonic anti-ship cruise missile, there is therefore a 91 percent chance that at least one interceptor will work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Next, the project estimates that 10 percent of anti-ship missiles will experience terminal guidance failures. This 10 percent miss rate is taken from the historical record showing that 8.7 percent of anti-ship cruise missiles have missed undefended civilian targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Finally, terminal interception and electronic warfare will have a combined 70 percent effectiveness, based on historic attacks against military ships without interceptors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The project aggregates these probabilities into a table for game play. This combines the 15 percent failure to launch, 91 percent chance of success with interceptors, 70 percent effectiveness of terminal defense and electronic warfare, and 10 percent miss rate. The team further adds on two “fat-tails”: a 5 percent chance that the attacker has made a catastrophic error (e.g., gross target location error) and a 5 percent chance that the defender has made a catastrophic error (e.g., no AEW is overhead, or the crew does not react in time). This generates the table below. For each salvo of 25 incoming supersonic cruise missiles, a 20-sided dice is rolled against the table to determine the number of “leakers,” or missiles that hit ships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/IIvm8gk.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1: Interception of Supersonic Anti-ship Cruise Missiles.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In a simple demonstration, 24 Chinese H-6 bombers launch a total of 96 YJ-12 supersonic anti-ship cruise missiles (grouped into four missile “salvoes” of 25 missiles each) at a U.S. surface action group of two Arleigh Burke-class destroyers and a Ticonderoga-class cruiser. Rolling four 20-sided dice (one for each salvo) shows: 13, 3, 15, and 2. Referencing the table, three missiles leak through and hit U.S. ships. The project team assigns the hits randomly, this time getting that one missile hits each ship. This U.S. surface action group is now combat ineffective with all its ships either sunk or not mission capable. This serves as a good illustration how, even using optimistic assumptions, it is very hard to defend surface ships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether the method of Pks or history is used, these models can provide a grounding for plausible rules about combat. For example, a model of the result of two squadrons of aircraft can be used to generate a table of possible outcomes for such a combat in the game. A table of probable outcomes is preferable to a deterministic result because of the fat-tailed nature of combat results throughout history. Throughout this paper are examples of models and how they determined rules in the wargame. Most models for campaign analysis need only be aggregated (or disaggregated) to a level appropriate for a wargame. In that form, the wargame can serve to interact these models in an appropriate way for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;model-interactions&quot;&gt;MODEL INTERACTIONS&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transparency of modeling enables observers to review and vet models but requires a certain degree of simplification. This is easier to achieve when modeling a single domain (e.g., a ground campaign or air campaign) or when the variety of engagement types is limited (e.g., a submarine campaign involving passage through an acoustic barrier followed by ship hunting). As the variety of engagement types increases, the complexity of models may increase geometrically, and the difficulty of clear exposition and vetting will grow proportionately. This is true even when strategy, or the allocation of assets to particular tasks, is held constant throughout the model “run.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only does the number of sub-routines increase when modeling a menu of operations within a single campaign, but decision rules also increase. When modeling a single type of interaction, there may be no need for the model to reallocate resources to new tasks. When modeling an air superiority campaign, for example, combat aircraft will remain allocated to the air superiority task (e.g., through offensive counter-air) for the duration of the model “run.” In cases where two tasks might be possible, a model can apply simple algorithms. So, in the preceding example, a model might assume that when a greater than 2:1 superiority is achieved in the number of aircraft “on station” in the air superiority fight, any additional aircraft will be dedicated to another task, such as ground support. However, such algorithms can quickly add complexity when they become numerous, which may ultimately undermine transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given these issues, most campaign analyses have addressed the critical portions of larger campaigns. While it is possible to model operations down to the size of boots worn by each soldier, such a level of complication would be unlikely to shed light on the course of the wider campaign. However, precision is not the same as accuracy. The modeler relies on their judgment and the literature to identify which areas demand precision, and which can be treated abstractly. With these areas identified, they can be modeled in turn. RAND’s U.S.-China Military Scorecard, for example, contains chapters that address 10 critical aspects of the larger U.S. China competition, but it does not attempt to knit them together into an overarching whole. In the academic domain, too, there have been several attempts to model individual aspects of conflict in Asia but no attempts to model an entire conflict, despite the fact that China is the so-called “pacing threat” for the United States. Wargaming can help with this holistic modeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, wargames do not inherently require different models. A basic wargame might have players control only one type of force, such as aircraft. All aircraft need not be similar, but they need to operate within the framework of the same model, which would specify an attrition rate that occurs when different types of aircraft meet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, such a basic wargame is appropriate only if the chosen pieces are the only significant parts of a conflict. Surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) are a critical element of contemporary air combat; a wargame or model of air combat that failed to account for SAMs would be incomplete. The same is true of major surface combatants, which largely function as floating SAMs. But if surface combatants are included, then the major ways in which they can be attrited must also be included: other surface ships, submarines, and anti-ship missiles. This produces a complex system wherein dozens of models must interact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analytic wargaming allows models to interact in an intelligent way. The models-based rules create grounds for adjudicating the results of various interactions, from what happens when an aircraft squadron flies into an SAM to the likelihood that a submarine sinks a surface ship. The specific events that generate scenarios for adjudication come from intelligent decisionmaking from human players. An attempt to simulate an entire war as an ensemble of models would likely see extreme results from actions that humans would recognize as blunders. For example, one could model aircraft attacking ships with the longest-range munition they have, while ships defend themselves with their longest-range munition. At some point, the aircraft run out of their longest-range missiles, while a significant inventory of the ship’s longest-range missiles remains. The merciless logic of the model drives the aircraft into the ships to be completely annihilated; an intelligent player on a wargame would redirect the aircraft to a different target. A wargame allows for some check on these interactions. Furthermore, analytic wargaming allows for flexibility with an inherently modular approach to modeling conflict. Depending on the operations research that shapes the game rules, more models can be created for elements that the literature finds to be important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of these interactions between models provide data for analysts to form qualitative judgments. For example, the air-to-air fight impacts anti-submarine warfare (ASW) by determining what level of risk maritime patrol aircraft (MPA) face in various geographic areas. If the air-to-air fight is going poorly for one side, their ASW efforts might suffer accordingly because of less MPA coverage. The quantitative results provide the basis for qualitative judgments about the effects of one domain on another. By providing a way for rigorous and transparent models to interact in an intelligent way, wargames provide a valuable aid to analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iteration-to-examine-a-variety-of-strategies&quot;&gt;Iteration to Examine a Variety of Strategies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite often being overlooked in modeling, no discussion of combat outcomes can ignore the strategies of the respective commanders. For example, in 1939–40, the French outnumbered the Germans in troops and equipment, including tanks. However, the best Anglo-French formations moved north as Germany struck through the Ardennes to the south. The result was an encirclement of the French army and ultimately French defeat. Generalship matters. Months after the fall of France, Germany’s own plans fell short during the Battle of Britain. Although the Luftwaffe outnumbered the Royal Air Force, Luftwaffe leaders failed to appreciate the significance of British radar stations and aerial command and control. As a result, they were unable to translate their superiority in matériel into air superiority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nor are recent examples lacking. In the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, Russia enjoyed many initial advantages, including larger and more modernized forces. Nevertheless, Russia’s initial plan for the invasion, to include the occupation of Kiev, greatly exceeded the capacity of its forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While developing a comprehensive set of possible results is impossible, focusing on the most likely and plausible interactions can produce an analytically sound and useful set of outcomes. With so many models interacting, there is no way to exhaustively explore all the possible decision points short of a massive computing effort. Even chess has a lower bound of 10120 possible games, despite only having 32 pieces and 64 legal positions. The ability to exhaustively analyze a series of models by exploring all possible decisions to see the distribution of possible outcomes likely lies in the distant future. Similarly, there are promising efforts to train computers to play games through millions of iterations, such as AlphaStar. While more plausible in the near term, these efforts still require large teams of expert programmers. Short of a focused government effort, this is not feasible for research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, iteration allows some of the most plausible lines of play to be explored. The project generated these plausible lines of play by having many different players participate in game iterations. To continue with the example of chess, there may be 10120 possible games, but most of those follow nonsensical decisions, such as allowing a queen to be taken by a pawn. Moreover, while there are many possible openings, almost all competitive openings follow the movement of the d- or e-pawn and efforts to control the center. The goal of iterative wargaming should not be seen as an effort to exhaustively explore all possible outcomes but rather as a way to assess the major lines of play that result from intelligent decisionmaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Varying strategies over multiple iterations of a wargame generates data on the likely interactions between plausible strategies. One wargame may not be illustrative of the overall contours of the problem due to an a priori reasonable strategy being chosen that turns out to be suboptimal. For example, in one iteration of this project’s wargame, the Chinese invasion fleet was destroyed in one turn after the Chinese player chose a strategy of defending their coastline while simultaneously invading Taiwan. If that was the first and only wargame that was played, a highly erroneous conclusion would be reached. Repeated play of the scenario using different Chinese strategies showed that the Chinese invasion fleet being destroyed on the first turn is an outlier. Many other strategies that China could choose would lead to outcomes much more favorable to China. This case illustrated the importance of iteration to try multiple strategies, lest the insights from a single scenario are misguidedly based on a particular strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another benefit of having outside players participate is that they will try novel strategies that did not occur to the principal investigators. It is easy for the wargame creators to try a few strategies and then settle into a local optimum that they believe represents best play of the scenario. Outside players inject mutation into the play of the game with their own ideas about how to play. Like genetic mutation, most of these new ideas are maladaptive. However, some are successful and represent advances on best play. Some required additional research and the design of new scenarios to test (in a way suggested by J. Peter Scoblic and Philip E. Tetlock). This process of mutation, iteration, and refinement helps to explore the seams of the possible and plausible outcomes of the wargame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;variation-of-key-assumptions-to-explore-uncertainty&quot;&gt;Variation of Key Assumptions to Explore Uncertainty&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analyses of the future must explore how sensitive results are to variations in assumptions. For example, wars begin in different ways. While most wars are preceded by a state of crisis, if a defender is surprised and has not mobilized their forces, this will have a dramatic effect on the subsequent campaign. Political factors are often unclear before the clash of forces and could lead in multiple directions, such as whether the British would intervene when the Germans invaded Belgium in World War I. Weapon systems might perform far differently in combat than expected, such as the Mark 14 torpedo in World War II. An analysis that does not explore key uncertainties risks building a detailed argument on a foundation of sand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iterating wargames in different scenarios with different assumptions for key variables allows for sensitivity analysis. A variable is a condition likely to have an impact on the analysis about which the analysis must make an informed assumption. In the same way that campaign analysis begins by specifying a scenario, this study refers to each bundle of assumptions for each variable as a scenario. For example, an invasion of Taiwan where China achieves operational surprise is one scenario; an invasion wherein operational surprise is not achieved is another. A new scenario is created when any assumption about a variable is changed: operational surprise with missile defense working is a different scenario than operational surprise without missile defense working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The selection of variables should reflect the purpose of the game. For example, in the services’ “Futures Wargame,” designed to test alternative force structures against one another, two iterations of the same scenario, one incorporating force structure from the so-called DOD program of record and one reflecting an alternative set of forces, were selected by experts and officers over a period of months. Thus, in the “Futures Wargame,” all elements of the game that are not related to order of battle should, to the extent possible, be kept equal. However, analytic wargames exploring other research questions require varying other assumptions between scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By running several iterations of the wargame with one scenario, then changing the scenario, it is possible to draw inferences about the importance and impacts of each variable change. The project team does not claim that this leads to a causally identified finding, which is the goal of experimental wargamers. However, it is possible to observe the impact of changing the assumptions about certain variables: for example, if Japan allows U.S. basing, then the outcome is likely to be more favorable for the United States than if basing is denied. More importantly, it allows for researchers to develop better judgments about the relative importance of these uncertainties: is Japanese basing more or less impactful on the outcome than Philippine basing? (Yes, as discussed in Chapter 8.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;By running several iterations of the wargame with one scenario, then changing the scenario, it is possible to draw inferences about the importance and impacts of each variable change.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to model all potential values of all variations. With 25 variables eventually identified by the project team that could take on binary values, that leads to 225 possible combinations, or approximately 33.5 million scenarios. Obviously, this is beyond the capability of human analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The selection of variables can be informed by previous literature or from insights generated during play. The question of which variables to include is the same problem that confronts efforts to make historical analogies. While no historical case is ever 100 percent analogous to another, it is possible to make inferences as long as they are similar enough in the most relevant variables.107 The variables of study must therefore both be uncertain and likely to have a high impact on the outcome. For example, in this project it became clear that the effectiveness of the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) against moving ships was a critical factor in the outcome of the game after playing several iterations. A close review of the literature showed that this effectiveness was unclear. The project team therefore decided that the effectiveness of the JASSM was an important variable to test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional variables came from players who participated in game iterations. They surfaced some of former secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld’s “unknown unknowns,” factors that the game designers had not anticipated. Wargaming can help explore these “unknown unknowns” by facilitating brainstorming about key variables among players who then help to shape future scenarios by including important variables that the researchers did not think of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;human-participants-make-intelligent-decisions-generate-mutation-and-shape-assumptions&quot;&gt;Human Participants Make Intelligent Decisions, Generate Mutation, and Shape Assumptions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary benefit of having human participants is to focus on the most plausible lines of play. As discussed above, the number of models, variables, and decisions in play make it impossible even for the most powerful computers to examine all possible lines of play for a game. Players of a game must choose the most promising courses of action. They can choose these lines based on knowledge of the actual countries’ doctrines, historically similar campaigns, and their own strategic intuition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One approach is to have a core group of players who have been involved in the game design. First, they are most familiar with the weapons systems and capabilities that go into the wargame, helping them to avoid blunders. The actual participants in a real-life conflict would be similarly familiar with their capabilities, so this allows for more plausible play. Second, the core group of players will know what broad courses of action have been used before and how they interact. This allows iterations to focus on lines of play that have been found to be more promising, rather than redoing earlier attempts at lines that have been found lacking. Finally, a core group of players can cycle through iterations much quicker than outside players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, outside participants are helpful in two ways. First, as discussed above, new players can inject mutation into strategies used by the core team. After several iterations, it is common for the core team to settle into a local optimum of strategies that they believe is best for both sides. New players can try new strategies that the core team finds unintuitive, shaking the game from its local optimum toward a global optimum. To integrate their intent with the game mechanics, the project provided each team with an “operations officer” from the staff. Second, outside participants can bring their knowledge into the game to refine the models underlying the rules. This is particularly the case when the number of outside participants in each game iteration is low (two to four). That allows each player to give in- depth feedback on any subject in which they have expertise. Several participants with experience in Pacific operations pointed out that current policy is to keep a continuous submarine presence in the Philippine Sea. The project, therefore, adjusted its order of battle to reflect this insight. This feedback means that there are slight changes that occur to the rules throughout the life of the project; however, this is compensated for by the increased fidelity of the project’s models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;nesting-wargame-results-into-analysis&quot;&gt;Nesting Wargame Results into Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The numbers of missiles fired and aircraft destroyed in any iteration are descriptive data, not analytic outcomes. The results of any of these runs are contingent on a multitude of factors beyond the underlying models, including the makeup of players and previous decisions in that game. For example, take two iterations whose scenarios were the same except for the assumption about Taiwanese ground force competence. The players in one iteration decided to use their missile inventory as quickly as possible, but the players in the other iteration decided to conserve their inventory. This difference had nothing to do with the changing assumption about the variable of Taiwanese ground force competence: the difference was produced solely by differences in the participants, or it could even have been the same participants wanting to try something different. It would be a mistake to conclude that the variable of Taiwanese ground force competence has a significant effect on the rate of missile expenditures. Thus, the quantitative data out of each iteration should not be seen as statistically significant projections about the future but as illustrative of the corpus of wargames that a project creates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analytic wargames produce qualitative insights among the investigators, which must then be situated in an analytic framework. This framework should focus on not only the ebb and flow of events generally but also a description of how differing assumptions about variables impact the likely outcome of a conflict. Two factors make variables relatively more or less important: their impact on the outcome and the degree of confidence in their values. The analysis thus comments on the general impact of variables rather than the specific outcomes of games. To paraphrase President Dwight D. Eisenhower, “Wargames are worthless, but wargaming is indispensable” — the specific outcome of each iteration is not predictive of the future, but the process of wargaming is indispensable to analyzing the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, analytic wargames must be careful not to make assertions outside of their scopes or to confuse the insights of the wargame with the insights of their modelling. A wargame about the outcome of an invasion of Taiwan cannot claim to grant insights about the operational impacts that Chinese control over Taiwan would have on the defense of Japan; such speculation is outside of the scope of analysis. Separately, an insight such as that China likely has enough ballistic missiles to cover the tarmac of all the military airfields in Japan does not come from the wargame: it comes from the modeling and the assumptions that went into the modelling. While the analytic insights of wargames are valuable, they must be appropriately scoped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;building-the-taiwan-operational-wargame&quot;&gt;Building the Taiwan Operational Wargame&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the methodological principles developed in Chapter 2 in mind, the project set out to develop a wargame to answer the questions: Would a Chinese invasion of Taiwan succeed in 2026? What variables most affect that outcome? What would be the cost to both sides?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first decision was whether to adapt an existing system for this project. As mentioned earlier, CNAS and the Körber Foundation have run similar wargames. Both games featured adversarial play between two teams of experts in conflicts with China. However, their focus on escalation dynamics and political decisionmaking made them unsuited for adaptation to this project’s methodology, which deals with political decisionmaking by varying scenarios across iterations. The different purposes of the projects meant that this study could not adapt their systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several commercial wargames are more operationally focused and have either a Taiwan invasion at the center of the game (Next War: Taiwan) or a Taiwan scenario as part of a larger conflict (Breaking the Chains). Although designed primarily for entertainment, these games are often the product of deep research and thoughtful mechanics. As a result, they have been used in professional military education (PME).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, several elements inherent to commercial games rendered them unsuitable for this project. First, commercial games, as a rule, balance playability and analytic rigor. This means that an important part of commercial wargame design is ensuring that both sides of the game have a path to victory, even if the balance of forces means that one side realistically does not have a way to win if both players are equally skilled (and lucky). The purpose of this project was to test outcomes of a notational invasion of Taiwan by China using the project team’s best estimate of forces available, national policies, equipment capabilities, and combat results. That may or may not produce a balanced result (in fact, it did not). For players, it can be deeply unsatisfactory to participate in a game if the prospects for victory are remote. However, that might be the correct analytic outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, commercial wargames do not reveal the assumptions and calculations for their force lay down and combat interactions. Although these are often sophisticated, the lack of transparency makes relying on them problematic. Is a particular outcome the result of analysis or a desire to balance play? Are calculations based on historical data, test data, or the developer’s judgment? At the same time, the project team’s review of the available commercial games suggested that important elements, especially air combat and attacks on air bases, were not represented rigorously. Next War: Taiwan focuses primarily on the ground campaign on the island, and Breaking the Chains focuses primarily on naval combat, generally between relatively small forces. Because of these issues, the project team needed a game where it understood and could stand behind every one of the game elements and assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar difficulties exist with adapting semi-official wargames, such as Assassin’s Mace, an operational-level wargame designed to simulate future war in the Western Pacific between 2025 and 2050. It uses the sophisticated Operational Wargame System developed by Tim Barrick and Mark Gelston. An invasion of Taiwan is one of the several scenarios available. The game integrates multiple warfare domains, including those outside of traditional military operations such as cyber and satellite intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR). Assassin’s Mace is intended to provide PME to field-grade officers and, to this end, requires a significant amount of professional knowledge in participants. Given the audience and purpose, this game is granular in design. It is very well designed for its purpose, and it has entered wide use in U.S. War Colleges as a tool for teaching joint operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, like commercial board games, Assassin’s Mace was unsuited to this project’s purposes because of discrepancies between its rules and the project team’s modelling. For example, within the Assassin’s Mace game rules, the F-35 and J-20 both attack at 12 and defend at 7, meaning that both aircraft roll a 12-sided die to attack and must score a 7 or greater to destroy the other. This means that there is a 50 percent chance that an attack will destroy the other, or a 50 percent attrition rate. Given that the historical attrition rate per sortie in most conflicts is less than 1 percent, and only 2 percent for the particularly intense Battle of Britain, the project team would use a lower attrition rate. This is not to disparage the Operational Wargame System but to demonstrate how its rules produce different operational outcomes than the project team’s research would suggest. However, given the official nature of the Operational Wargame System, it might be reasonable to wonder if it (or any government wargame) is inherently superior to civilian wargames due to the possession of non-public information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-question-of-classified-data&quot;&gt;The Question of Classified Data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project used only unclassified data so that its results can inform public debate. Some observers, particularly within the government, might argue that accurate modeling is impossible without access to classified data. However, classified data is not necessary for the construction of a credible wargame. Although classified data might help tweak certain parameters (e.g., missile ranges, intercept probabilities, and submarine detection capabilities), they would not change the fundamental structure of the game or the outcomes. The reasons are threefold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, much information that was previously classified is now available from open sources. For example, The Military Balance by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) provides detailed equipment numbers, while Jane’s databases provide detailed information about equipment capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Earth provides information about facilities that required U-2 flights during the Cold War. The team used Google Earth to determine the number and location of Chinese underground airfields, the size of parking ramps, and other parameters of air bases. Although classified imagery might refine this information, unclassified information is more detailed and accurate than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, classified data is not necessarily correct data. It is vulnerable to a lack of probing and testing because of restricted access. Indeed, bureaucratic and political forces may require government actors to accept weapons testing data that does not account for the friction that can greatly diminish weapons effectiveness in the real world. For example, classified Air Force testing projected a 92 percent hit rate for the AIM-9J missile before its fielding in Vietnam; analysis after the war found that its actual hit rate was 13 percent. A similar result was obtained in the infamous U.S. torpedo scandal of World War II. These mistakes were possible because projections of future conflicts require making assumptions about events that have never happened and classification prevented the usual vetting of these projections. No squadron of F-35s has ever engaged a squadron of J-20s; predicting the result of such an engagement relies on assumptions, regardless of classification level. Most of the parameters in the project’s wargame are based on historical data; classified information might help refine these assumptions but would not replace the importance of historical data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the appropriate use of historical data can sometimes be more accurate in modeling future conflicts than classified information about specific weapons systems. Before Desert Storm, classified models using accurate weapons performance data predicted 20,000 to 30,000 casualties. However, private commentators predicted fewer casualties, based on data from Israel’s Six-Day War. Although the classified models had more accurate weapons capability data, they modeled the Iraqis as fighting as competently as the Soviets. The open-source models accounted for the poorer operational competence of Arab militaries, which more than made up for their deficiencies in classified weapons performance data. Thus, open-source models have value beyond their intrinsic transparency and public accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;philosophy-of-the-base-model&quot;&gt;Philosophy of the Base Model&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section lays out the key design choices that the project made and explains the reasons for the choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use rules rather than judgment.&lt;/strong&gt; As discussed in Chapter 2, models for analytic wargaming must be built in a rigorous manner on the best available open-source information. These models can be based either on the method of history or the method of Pks (see previous chapter). However, they must create a comprehensive set of rules that minimizes the influence of judgment. Of course, sometimes players will create situations that are plausible but unanticipated. In these cases, some judgment by the umpires is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incorporate only demonstrated capabilities.&lt;/strong&gt; The game is based on capabilities that the countries involved have demonstrated or have concrete plans to field. Players often had imaginative initiatives for cyber, special operations, and new systems, but the game did not include these unless the relevant country had demonstrated those capabilities. The relatively near time horizon of the game (2026) limits how many new capabilities might be fielded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are classified programs that might produce relevant capabilities. Some details about these programs have leaked out and have been incorporated into the game. Most elements would be fielded and operationally significant numbers after 2026, if fielded it all. However, this uncertainty is present in all discussions of national security issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assume China has decided to invade.&lt;/strong&gt; Because the purpose of the game is to assess the outcome of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, the game assumes that the CCP has made the decision to launch such an attack. The Chinese government could reach such a decision for a variety of reasons related to domestic politics, faulty intelligence, inaccurate military assessments, and international pressure that would not align with an outsider’s military or political assessment. External factors might also drive the decision. For example, Taiwan could move toward a declaration of independence, or the United States might begin permanently stationing troops on the island. The premise that China decides to invade is not a prediction but rather a tool that sets up the research question about whether such an invasion might succeed. However, the scenario is plausible given the concerns about such a Chinese course of action, as described in Chapter 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use base and excursion scenarios.&lt;/strong&gt; The project developed a base scenario wherein all variables took their most likely values. Excursion scenarios explored key parameters about which there were plausible alternative assumptions. For example, the base case for Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Extended Range (JASSM-ER) employability was that it could target ships at sea. An excursion scenario restricted JASSM-ER employability to stationary land targets. This approach allowed the project to explore the sensitivity of wargame results to changes in assumptions. (The next chapter discusses the base scenario and excursion cases in detail.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explore diplomatic and political conditions with excursion scenarios.&lt;/strong&gt; Because the game play was primarily concerned with operational factors that affect military outcomes, the project accounted for political inputs as variables that were manipulated by control between iterations. It is possible to either model the political behavior of states through expert discussions during game play or to employ stochastic models (e.g., rolling a die to determine if a neutral country joins the conflict). However, such modeling is problematic. More important from the perspective of the project was the need to maintain a degree of control over game inputs so that a range of conditions could be examined. Rather than integrating these factors into the rules, this project explores them with excursion scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each of these political factors, the project identifies the most plausible outcomes, binned into a few meaningful categories. For example, consider the Japanese decision to enter the war. Discussions with experts led the project team to believe that the base case was that Japan would most likely enter the war only if Japanese bases or U.S. bases in Japan were attacked. This base case assumption was therefore used for most games. Certain excursion scenarios explored what would happen if Japan joined the United States from the first day of China’s invasion or if Japan never joined the war. Although there are in reality an infinite number of permutations on this critical factor, creating a few meaningfully different categories for assumptions and playing iterations with different assumptions allows the project to explore the effects of these highly uncertain yet important factors. Additionally, there are some plausible political decisions — such as the decision to surrender — that are possible but that cannot be usefully wargamed; those lie outside the scope of this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on Taiwan.&lt;/strong&gt; The game focuses on combat around Taiwan and in the Western Pacific region that could affect such combat on the island. It abstracted operations in the South China Sea to maintain focus on Taiwan. These battles would unfold as the East Coast units of the U.S. Navy arrived in the region, having traveled via the Suez Canal. Chinese forces would attempt to block these U.S. forces from approaching Taiwan. Some Chinese forces are not available for the invasion of Taiwan, being stationed in the south to guard against such actions. As U.S. forces arrive, China must withdraw forces from other regions, including those attacking Taiwan, to maintain defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-taiwan-operational-wargame&quot;&gt;The Taiwan Operational Wargame&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section explains specific design parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;time-scale&quot;&gt;TIME SCALE&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each turn in the game is 3.5 days — the time increment needed to simulate enough real-world time to produce an estimate of the result of the battle and be playable in a single day. Multi-day games would take too long to run 24 iterations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering that the invasion of Okinawa, a much smaller island than Taiwan, took two months and three weeks, the time scale had to allow exploration of several weeks of combat. This also gave insights into how depleting munition stockpiles affected the conflict: both sides had enough high-end missiles to launch continuously for several days, but what happens when those are gone? The 3.5-day turns allowed the project to get further into the battle than games with smaller time increments, which was critical for the study’s purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time scale required trade-offs to get through weeks of combat in a timely manner. First, it required some amount of aggregation: instead of modeling every aircraft, the game modeled aircraft squadrons. Second, it does not allow for as granular decisionmaking: players have to give general instructions for half of a week and cannot adjust their orders for day two based on the results of day one. Third, it required a specific sequencing in resolution for accuracy: for example, a surface ship traveling 30 knots could cover the entire game board in 3.5 days, but an enemy would almost certainly detect and react to such a charge within that time period. Sequencing combat resolution in a specific way allowed such interactions. However, weighed against the analytic benefits of the longer time scale, these disadvantages were judged to be acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;operational-map&quot;&gt;OPERATIONAL MAP&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/RVU1fWI.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: Taiwan Operational Wargame ― Operational Map.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air and naval combat in the Taiwan Operational Wargame (TOW) unfolds on an operational map of the Western Pacific. Hexes on the map are approximately 600 km (roughly 370 miles) from side to side. Each hex is colored according to its distance from Taiwan and numbered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each map hex lists the following information:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The number of aircraft squadrons that can park on military and dual-use airport tarmac;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The number of aircraft squadrons that can be housed in underground hangars and hardened aircraft shelters (HASs); and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The number of SAM battalions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Placed on the map are counters representing the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aircraft squadrons (representing 24 tactical aircraft and 12 large aircraft);&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ground forces that have been moved between hexes;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Surface ship task forces; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Squadrons of four submarines.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ground-launched-missiles&quot;&gt;Ground-Launched Missiles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) is a formidable force. Thus, each game turn begins with ground-based missile attacks. These missiles primarily target U.S. and Japanese surface ships and air bases. To speed up play, China’s war-opening joint fires strike on Taiwan was modeled and pre-adjudicated in every iteration. This strike employs much of China’s short-range ballistic missile inventory and would largely destroy Taiwan’s navy and cripple its air force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s ground-launched anti-ship missiles are also a key element in the fight. Besides indigenous Hsiung Feng II and III missiles, Taiwan is procuring 100 Harpoon launchers and 400 Harpoons. These have the potential to inflict significant attrition on China’s amphibious force. Rather than having players specify an attack for these, the project models their likely use and effects on China’s fleet in each turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinese-amphibious-lift&quot;&gt;Chinese Amphibious Lift&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One key output of the operational fight is the number of units that China can place on Taiwan in a 3.5-day turn. Rather than modeling specific waves of landings, the project models lift as the thousands of tons that China can transport across the strait over 3.5 days. Each battalion requires a certain number of tons, depending on whether it is leg infantry, mechanized infantry, armor, artillery, or engineer. Once China moves troops onto Taiwan, it must also keep them supplied, which progressively reduces the number of new formations that can be transported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are four ways China moves troops onto Taiwan: amphibious landing, air assault, airborne, and via captured facilities. Amphibious landing over suitable beaches constitutes the primary way that China moves forces in an initial assault. The amount of amphibious lift decreases as major ships are sunk. Air assault with helicopters is limited to the extreme west of Taiwan due to range considerations, while airborne landings with paratroopers can occur anywhere on the island. Both methods are slowly attrited by anti-air artillery and man-portable SAMs, but attrition increases greatly if China’s air superiority is degraded. Ports and airfields enable the use of more varied ships and aircraft to accelerate the transport of troops ashore. The United States may attack these facilities to deny their use after Chinese capture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;air-and-naval-combat&quot;&gt;Air and Naval Combat&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Players issue orders for their air and naval forces. These orders unfold over the course of the 3.5-day turn. These orders therefore must allow aircraft and ships to execute missions not only once but as frequently as they can over the course of the turn. For example, orders to fly combat air patrol (CAP) result in coverage as frequently as aircraft can sortie, ASW sweeps reflect the coverage of a hex that can be achieved through constant searching over 3.5 days, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;air-forces&quot;&gt;AIR FORCES&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aircraft are represented by counters. For fighter/attack aircraft, there are three categories: fourth generation (non-stealthy, no Active Electronically Scanned Array [AESA] radar), 4.5 generation (non-stealthy, AESA radar), and fifth generation (stealthy, AESA radar). Fighter/attack counters represent standardized squadrons of 24 aircraft. Most of Taiwan’s aircraft would be destroyed in the initial bombardment by China, but some would survive in their underground hangars on the eastern side of the island. Bombers are grouped into legacy and stealth bombers, and counters represent a standardized 12-aircraft squadron. Tankers and airlift are also tracked in squadrons of 12. Testing showed that categorizing aircraft by generation greatly facilitated game play at only slight cost in terms of fidelity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fighter/attack aircraft and bombers perform four missions in the game. First, they can try to establish air superiority with CAP, patrolling over the battlefield 24/7. Proximity to the battlefield is critical to establishing continuous CAP, as an hour spent flying to and from the battle area is an hour when an aircraft is not on station conducting the mission. Therefore, the distance between a squadron’s base and its target hex (usually Taiwan) and the amount of tanking available are key determinants in the time on station for fighter/attack squadrons performing CAP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, aircraft can perform strike missions by attacking air bases, surface ships, ground units, and critical infrastructure. If there is adversary CAP over the target, then escorts are needed to defend the attackers. The choice of munitions for aircraft conducting these missions is critical. In the early stages of the war, sophisticated and long-distance cruise missiles are available, but as these inventories are depleted, aircraft must use shorter-range munitions and accept more risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, aircraft can perform ground support. This is divided between close air support near the front line of troops and interdiction at a distance from the front line to slow enemy movement. Both missions require flying over enemy ground troops and therefore involve risk from SAMs. They also require longer loiter times over the ground than strike missions, meaning that they can only be conducted when there is friendly air superiority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, aircraft can rebase to different hexes. All reinforcements arriving in theater must initially rebase. Units in theater can also rebase. Based on peacetime exercise reports, the game assumed that it takes approximately a game turn to set up operations and maintenance facilities at new bases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;naval-surface-forces&quot;&gt;NAVAL SURFACE FORCES&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naval surface forces are represented in surface action groups (SAGs), carrier strike groups (CSGs), lightning carrier groups (LCGs), and amphibious groups. The size and composition of these forces vary by nation, as the United States, China, and Japan all have different fleet compositions (as mentioned above, the Taiwanese surface fleet would be largely destroyed in the initial phases of a conflict).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAGs can launch anti-ship missiles at enemy surface ships, launch cruise missiles at ground targets, or conduct ASW; however, their primary value is in intercepting enemy missiles and aircraft. (China’s large surface fleet has several potent SAMs, which pose a threat to U.S. and Japanese aircraft. U.S. and Japanese SAGs can similarly threaten Chinese aircraft while also potentially intercepting some of China’s tactical ballistic missiles, or TBMs.) However, after their missiles are depleted, ships must return to port and rearm, during which time they are vulnerable. All SAGs can also conduct ASW, which is a particular specialty of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Forces (JMSDF).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;submarines&quot;&gt;SUBMARINES&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Submarines are grouped into squadrons of four submarines. Diesel submarines, due to their shorter endurance compared with nuclear submarines, generally 30 to 45 days, must constantly rotate back to port for refueling and resupplying. Both Chinese and Japanese diesel submarine squadrons on the board therefore represent four submarines actively hunting and four submarines transiting back and forth from the hunting ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Submarines can hunt other submarines. The United States and Japan begin with some submarines forming a barrier on the first island chain, intercepting Chinese submarines and inflicting attrition on them. They are aided by U.S. and Japanese MPA. Conversely, China can assign some submarines to intercept U.S. nuclear-powered submarines (SSNs) approaching the Taiwan Strait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Submarines are potent threats to surface ships and can engage them with torpedoes and anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCMs). The speed of SSNs makes them much more effective at searching the open ocean. U.S. SSNs can hunt Chinese amphibious shipping in the Taiwan Strait (JMSDF submarines would not be able to concurrently hunt in the strait due to battlespace management issues). Their effectiveness there is diminished by Chinese corvettes and MPA actively conducting ASW, as well as a barrier at the entrance/exits to the strait comprised of Chinese submarines and minefields that China plants over the course of the opening weeks. Chinese submarines would not enter the strait itself in order to make it a free fire zone for these ASW forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;cyber&quot;&gt;CYBER&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game included cyber at the operational level. Both sides have cyber exploits they can use against the other. These exploits are modeled as system penetrations that passively grant intelligence while they are undetected. However, teams can activate these exploits to conduct cyberattacks, thereby generating one-time effects. Once these active effects are used, the exploit is assumed to be identified and patched. The previously discussed restriction of the game to proven capabilities means that these effects, while potent, are not magic wands. For example, power can be shut down at some ports to degrade Chinese amphibious lift, but there is no ability to destroy all of China’s electrical grid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game did not include strategic cyber affects that might affect the U.S. homeland or military command and control systems. These effects might have operational impact in the Western Pacific but lie beyond the scope of this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ground-combat-map&quot;&gt;Ground Combat Map&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ground combat occurs on a different scale than the air and missile combat that dominates the operational map. While missiles fly at the speed of sound over thousands of kilometers, ground combat unfolds at the speed of a tired infantryman crawling forward under enemy fire. Thus, the ground map of Taiwan uses hexes measuring 30 kilometers (19 miles) across and uses the same 3.5-day turns. Within each hex, there is movement of the forward edge of the battle area. Ground forces include leg infantry, mechanized infantry, armor, artillery, engineers, and attack helicopters, each of which have different movement speeds and combat values. These combat values can be enhanced by combat air support provided by friendly aircraft. A key element of ground combat is the interdiction provided by Chinese aircraft, which slows Taiwanese movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While missiles fly at the speed of sound over thousands of kilometers, ground combat unfolds at the speed of a tired infantryman crawling forward under enemy fire.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Players alternated between the operational map and the ground map, moving forces and initiating combat on each map during a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sensitivity-analysis&quot;&gt;Sensitivity Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each iteration (run of the game) was set in a specific scenario with plausible assumptions about each variable. A scenario refers to the specific combination of assumptions used for one iteration. The scenario where all variables are set to their most plausible values is called the base scenario. As discussed earlier, varying the assumptions from iteration to iteration allowed the investigators to develop judgments about the effects of those variables on the likely outcome. The next chapter explains these most likely base case assumptions and the excursion cases that the project tested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;assumptions--base-cases-and-excursion-cases&quot;&gt;Assumptions — Base Cases and Excursion Cases&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every wargame requires assumptions about dozens of variables, from the grand strategic and political context, through the strategic military situation, down to minute details about operations and weapons. This chapter describes the assumptions underpinning the wargame’s base scenario and the alternative assumptions (called “excursion cases”) that the project explored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A “base case” in the project’s terminology is the most likely value of a given variable. “Most likely” does not mean certain but simply more likely than other possibilities. The base scenario is a game iteration wherein all the variables are set to their base case (so that no variables take on a less likely value). The project ran three iterations of this base scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An “excursion case” is a less likely but plausible value of a given variable. Given the limitations of time and resources, the project selected excursion cases based on two criteria: (1) those variables that might have the greatest impact on the outcome of a scenario, and (2) those base case elements that were most uncertain. The project ran a total of 24 game iterations: three base scenarios and 21 scenarios with alternative assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By playing iterations of the game with excursion cases, the project team was able to assess the sensitivity of the findings to alternative assumptions. An “excursion scenario” is a game iteration that used one or more excursion cases. Some excursion scenarios varied a single assumption. Most varied several assumptions; as noted above, varying assumptions one by one would have required playing over 33.5 million games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The table below summarizes the major assumptions, their base case, and the excursion cases explored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;grand-strategic-assumptions-political-context-and-decision&quot;&gt;Grand Strategic Assumptions: Political Context and Decision&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the base case assumptions about the grand strategic context of the conflict, particularly the conditions under which each state decides to join the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;the-principal-combatants-china-taiwan-the-united-states-and-japan&quot;&gt;THE PRINCIPAL COMBATANTS: CHINA, TAIWAN, THE UNITED STATES, AND JAPAN&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China:&lt;/strong&gt; As discussed earlier, the project assumes that China has decided to launch an invasion. They have the advantage of deciding when the war starts and use that flexibility to attack preemptively taking advantage of tactical surprise. They will have created uncertainty about the timing of the attack by gradually expanding military exercises in the preceding years, making it difficult for other countries to know that this time is the real attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taiwan:&lt;/strong&gt; The project assumes that Taiwan resists vigorously. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, Taiwan’s military spending as a percentage of GDP is 4.4 percent, China’s is 1.7 percent, and U.S. spending is 2.3 percent. Taiwan’s relatively high level of peacetime spending represents serious social commitment. Further, Taiwanese officials have repeatedly stated their intention to defend the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, morale is hard to predict. While many countries have fought fiercely despite long odds (e.g., Finland in the Winter War and contemporary Ukraine), others have surrendered soon after invasions (e.g., Thailand and Denmark in World War II). When faced with a Chinese assault, Taiwan might capitulate rather than fight. There have been worrying reports about CCP penetration of the Taiwanese military. The base case assumes that Taiwan resists to the maximum extent of its capabilities. However, the project recognizes that this is an assumption. As immediate Taiwanese capitulation would mean that there is no war, it is impossible to analytically wargame. Taiwanese morale is therefore outside the scope conditions of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. Entry into the War:&lt;/strong&gt; The base case assumes immediate U.S. intervention. For reasons discussed at the outset of this report, such intervention seems more likely than not despite the lack of a formal treaty. The United States has deep historical ties to Taiwan, and U.S. policy opposes unilateral changes to the status quo across the Taiwan Strait. The United States defended Kuwait’s autonomy in 1991 and defended Ukraine in 2022, albeit with weapons only in Ukraine’s case. The United States has never foresworn the possibility of using force to defend Taiwan, and the Taiwan Relations Act stipulates that the United States will “consider any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means . . . a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of grave concern to the United States.” This language has been regularly echoed by administrations from both parties, including the present one, for decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: Taiwan stands alone.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Although the base case assumes immediate U.S. intervention, there may be circumstances under which the United States does not engage. Each time President Biden states that the United States would respond to Chinese attack, other administration stipulate that U.S. policy has not changed. Moreover, Biden may not be president in 2026. Actual decisions would depend heavily on the personality of the president and on the domestic and international circumstances of the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Important international circumstances would include whether actions by Taiwan were seen as contributing to crisis (e.g., passing a referendum on formal independence); the reaction of other important actors (not least Japan); and the existence (or absence) of concurrent crises or events. Domestic circumstances in the United States (e.g., war weariness or economic downturn) might also act against U.S. involvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The “Taiwan stands alone” excursion case assumes no direct U.S. intervention. The United States commits no U.S. combat units of any kind to the conflict. Furthermore, without the direct involvement of the United States, Tokyo and other regional governments would view their own intervention as excessively risky and would therefore remain neutral. The United States and possibly other partners might allow weapons and ammunition resupply. However, unlike the situation in Ukraine, the Chinese defensive zone makes this essentially impossible (described below in Chapter 6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: The United States delays authorization for combat operations one or two days.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This excursion case assumes the possibility of a minor delay of one or two days before the commencement of U.S. combat operations. Even when attacked, nations sometimes hesitate to respond militarily as they seek to understand what has happened. Sometimes this produces devastating results (for example, Clark Airfield in the Philippines at the beginning of World War II). Given that the initial Chinese landing force unloads over several days, such a delay would affect the conflict by precluding U.S. bomber strikes (originating from Alaska and Hawaii) on the first turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: The United States delays combat operations for 14 days.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There might be a more substantial, two-week delay. In this excursion case, the U.S. national command authority attempts to preserve Taiwanese autonomy without paying the price of direct conflict by engaging Beijing through diplomacy to halt the invasion. This effort lasts for a week while the invasion unfolds. When diplomacy fails, the United States declares a no-fly zone over Taiwan, which China vigorously opposes. The United States gets drawn into direct conflict when this “low-cost” approach fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. Troops on Taiwan:&lt;/strong&gt; The base case has no substantial U.S. presence on Taiwan when the conflict begins. The United States has not stationed significant forces on Taiwan since the 1970s. A recent increase in 2021 raised the U.S. troop level on the island from 20 to 39; however, this force could do little beyond liaise. Although stationing more U.S. troops would be military advantageous, it would provide a clear cassus belli for China. If the United States deployed troops to Taiwan in response to every Chinese exercise that could be serving as cover for an invasion, then the United States would quickly shut down many roads to peaceful resolution. Even if the United States knew when the invasion was coming and deployed troops to Taiwan only then, China could still seize on that deployment to justify their already planned invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: U.S. forces deploy to Taiwan before conflict begins.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Although unlikely, it is theoretically possible that the United States would station forces on Taiwan before conflict begins. This could happen in two ways. First, concerns about Taiwanese security might drive the United States to position some forces there in peacetime despite vehement Chinese opposition. Second, Chinese mobilization might generate enough U.S. concern that it is willing to risk provocation by putting U.S. forces on Taiwan. In this excursion case, a Marine Littoral Regiment (MLR) deploys from Okinawa to Taiwan with its load of missiles and one reload, augmenting the shore-based fires of Taiwanese ASCMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Japan:&lt;/strong&gt; Japan can influence the conflict in two major ways: (1) by allowing the United States to operate its forces from bases in Japan, and (2) with the direct intervention of the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF). Japan hosts more U.S. bases and servicemembers than any other state in the world. The United States operates these bases despite their being on sovereign Japanese territory. The proximity of these bases to Taiwan and the lack of nearby alternatives means that a major part of the U.S. response to a Chinese invasion operates out of Japanese bases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Japan and China are not on friendly diplomatic terms and the United States and Japan are allied, Japanese intervention against China is not assured. The Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between Japan and the United States binds the two countries in a limited defensive alliance. Article V states that, “Each Party recognizes that an armed attack against either Party in the territories under the administration of Japan would be dangerous to its own peace and safety and declares that it would act to meet the common danger in accordance with its constitutional provisions and processes.” As Japan analyst Jeffrey Hornung observes, none of the critical decisions about Japanese assistance to U.S. operations are “legally automatic. . . . All these decisions are political, resting with the prime minister at any given moment.” Despite these caveats, recent activities point to mutually coordinated action in the event of a war with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are recent suggestions that Japan would participate to some degree in the defense of Taiwan. Japan has built a formidable military. Japanese military spending is significantly greater than that of any other Asian state other than China or South Korea. The JSDF began deploying overseas for disaster relief and humanitarian relief early in the Heisei era. Japan’s new Defense White Paper warns that China’s growing military muscle, overflights, and naval incursions “have become a matter of grave concern to the region including Japan and the international community.” A commission from Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party proposed increasing Japan’s “counterattack capability.” The 2015 update to the “Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation” outlined an expanded set of roles for Japan in the event of “an armed attack against a country other than Japan” that “threatens Japan’s survival.” However, it would be a mistake to read these movements as definitive proof of whole-hearted and immediate Japanese participation in the defense of Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the U.S.-Japanese treaty and these recent (admittedly non-definitive) political developments in Japan, the base case assumes that Tokyo: (1) allows the United States access to U.S. bases in Japan freely from the outset; (2) directs the JSDF to engage Chinese forces only in response to a Chinese attack on Japanese territory (to include U.S. military bases in Japan); and (3) allows the JSDF, after entering the war, to conduct offensive operations away from Japanese territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also Japan’s path of least resistance because it avoids a difficult internal decision and a potential confrontation with the United States. Furthermore, refusing the United States use of the bases would risk undoing the long-standing U.S.-Japanese alliance, which has underpinned Japanese security policy for 70 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: Japan participates from the beginning.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One excursion case assumes that Japanese forces participated actively from the beginning of the conflict. The events leading up to war could involve explicit threats to Japan or some other form of sharply exacerbated tensions between Beijing and Tokyo. Japanese officials have stipulated that preemptive attacks on adversary systems are constitutionally permissible if it appears that preparations are under way for attacks against Japan. A brewing Taiwan war might provide the circumstances that would justify preemptive action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While obtaining the approval to enter the war could be cumbersome, the specific nature of the evidence of a triggering attack is not stipulated by law. It is plausible that a government might, under emergency conditions and with the advantage of a majority in the Diet, obtain such a declaration and begin to operate against Chinese forces. Having obtained a Diet declaration, the JSDF or civilian defense officials would likely be empowered to determine what adversary assets constituted a threat to Japan. This might result in Japan joining the war at the outset alongside the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: Japan is completely neutral.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Japan might seek to prevent all U.S. military activities from its soil. Although mutual defense treaties give the United States the right to use its bases, the Japanese might balk. There is often a disconnect between peacetime expectations of military access and what is given in a crisis. In a study of historical patterns in the granting or withholding of access during U.S. military operations, Stacie Pettyjohn and Jennifer Kavanagh write, “peacetime and contingency access decisions are driven by fundamentally different dynamics.” And despite strong public support for the U.S.-Japan alliance, public discussions of concrete issues, such as a Taiwan conflict, often lack clear or realistic appraisals of potential consequences — topics that would become acute when facing large-scale violence by China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: The JSDF is limited to defensive operations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Finally, the JSDF might be limited to defensive operations over Japanese territory even after entering the war. In this scenario, legal or political constraints prevent the JSDF from conducting operations away from Japanese territory. The only extraterritorial operation this excursion case allows Japan to conduct is ASW on its eastern approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;other-allies-partners-and-adversaries&quot;&gt;Other Allies, Partners, and Adversaries&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A U.S.-China conflict would not happen in a vacuum. The stakes involved would be so great and the economic disruption so widespread that every country on the planet would react. This section lays out the base case and excursion cases for other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regional Allies and Partners:&lt;/strong&gt; A Chinese invasion of Taiwan would put all countries in the region in a dilemma. On the one hand, they are more likely to fear the close power of Beijing than the distant power of Washington. All have reasons to be wary of the strengthening of China’s position that might result from a conquest of Taiwan; furthermore, all have reasons to be friendly to the United States, which would be clamoring for access, basing, and overflight rights. On the other hand are the dangers that would result from participation, either active (e.g., directing forces against China) or passive (e.g., granting the United States basing rights). The safest course of action for most countries would be to remain neutral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asian scholars are relatively unified in assessing that most countries would remain neutral. In congressional testimony, Bonny Lin, an Asia scholar at CSIS, argued that “India, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, and Vietnam . . . may try to stay neutral or provide limited, less conspicuous forms of assistance.” John Culver was more forthright:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I think you’d get a chilling set of answers if you approached authoritative people in our treaty allies — Australia, Japan, Thailand, the Philippines, South Korea and our partners like Singapore and important other countries in the region like Vietnam — and ask them in the event that China attacks Taiwan, will you back our military alliance? Will you assist in preventing Chinese conquest? With maybe one or two exceptions, I think the answer we would get is no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more optimistic assessment by Zack Cooper and Sheena Chestnut Greitens posits some basing access granted by the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, and Thailand, although this would only happen under “certain circumstances” and “would likely come with severe limitations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on these analyses, the project decided on the following as the base case for particular countries:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;India, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam:&lt;/strong&gt; All would be concerned about Chinese encroachment but also fear Chinese power. They would be sympathetic to the United States and Taiwan but reluctant to expose themselves to Chinese attack. Thus, they would take a passive approach, allowing U.S. overflight and transit but not participating themselves or allowing operations from their territory.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;South Korea:&lt;/strong&gt; South Korea would not only fear Chinese power but would also worry about hostile actions by North Korea, whether driven by the North Korean leadership or incentivized by China to distract the United States and Japan. Indeed, South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol has said that in the event of a conflict over Taiwan, North Korea would likely stage a provocation that would draw South Korea’s focus. The project assumed that because of the pressing nature of the conflict with China the United States would release two of its four squadrons in South Korea. However, because of the continuing threat from North Korea, the other two squadrons would remain in South Korea for deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Australia:&lt;/strong&gt; Because of its close relationship with the United States and the stationing of U.S. forces there in peacetime, Australia would give access, basing, and overflight. Australian forces would participate in the South China Sea fight but be unavailable as a result for operations around Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Philippines:&lt;/strong&gt; The base case assumes that the Philippines remains neutral. This assumption was driven first by the relative weakness of the Philippine military compared with the Chinese military. For example, whereas China has a large and modern navy, the Philippines has a small coastal navy with only four ships over 1,000 tons. Its air force focuses on counterinsurgency, with only a small number of modern jet aircraft. This imbalance in relative strength was illustrated by the Philippines reaction when a Chinese vessel rammed and sank a Filipino fishing vessel in the vicinity of Recto Bank in the West Philippine Sea. President Rodrigo Duterte refused to take a strong stand against the Chinese incursion, later stating in public “I am powerless there.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assumption of Philippine neutrality was also based on Duterte’s general diplomatic shift away from being a close partner of the United States and attempting to balance between U.S. and Chinese interests in the region. This move was driven by both personal animus toward the United States and the promise of Chinese investment into the Philippines. As part of this shift, there was a move away from security cooperation with the United States, with the notice of cancellation of the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA), which allows the United States to temporarily station forces on Philippine bases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: The Philippines allows U.S. basing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An excursion case allows the United States to base aircraft out of Philippine military airports. What seemed like a sharp rupture with the United States during the Duterte era is now less clear. Between the failure of Chinese investment to materialize and Chinese actions in the South China Sea, the Philippines have had a partial reproachment with the United States. The Philippines withdrawal from the VFA was postponed, then replaced by a recommitment to the VFA and other defense pacts. Further, there is no clear assessment of what Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s position is, despite the overall favorability of the United States in the Philippines. Since being elected, Marcos Jr. has made statements strongly affirming Philippine rights in disputed areas of the South China Sea while simultaneously insisting that Philippine-China relations are “set to shift into higher gear,” indicating a continued desire for closer ties with China. With these mixed signals, it is possible that the Philippines would allow U.S. basing and overflight during a war against China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and Europe:&lt;/strong&gt; Europe has been wary about becoming involved in the U.S.-China competition. China’s immense economic power and the Europeans’ lack of territory in the Pacific drives Europe to maintain good relations with China. None of these countries are so closely involved in Pacific affairs that they regard China as a direct threat that would warrant automatic participation in what could be World War III with potential nuclear consequences. However, Europe is also wary of Chinese authoritarianism and desires to maintain the liberal international order. The United States has engaged NATO and the European Union in its efforts to contain China and has had some success. Despite these engagements, it is likely that most European countries would limit themselves to economic sanctions on China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United Kingdom and France might be exceptions since they have sent military forces to the Pacific in the past and possess expeditionary forces. However, those forces are not permanently stationed in the Pacific and would take a long time to arrive. The governments would likely take longer than the United States to decide about intervention, and the forces would not have used the warning time to increase readiness for deployment. When they do get there, the arrival of one or two small aircraft carriers and nuclear attack submarines would be useful but not decisive. The ability of other European countries to provide military aid to the United States in the Pacific is extremely limited even if these countries wanted to help. Therefore, the project assumed that Europe would not be a factor in the initial stages of the conflict that the wargame simulates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opportunistic Aggressors:&lt;/strong&gt; Russia, North Korea, Iran, or others might take advantage of U.S. distraction to launch aggressive action in their own spheres and attempt to settle long-standing territorial claims. Opportunistic aggression would still be risky for the aggressor if its local opponents are powerful. For example, if North Korea stages a provocation, that might bring other combatants into the conflict against China, such as South Korea, NATO, or the Gulf states, if it looked like the military operations were connected. To have an effect during the short timelines of the game, opportunist aggression would require close coordination between China and the other state before the conflict breaks out so that the opportunistic aggression takes place simultaneously or nearly simultaneously with the Chinese attack. These preparations would likely be detected ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, there is historical experience. During the 2000s, when the United States was deeply involved in conflicts in the Middle East, other nations did not take advantage of U.S. distraction, nor was there opportunistic aggression during the period of the Korean or Vietnam Wars. Thus, the base case assumes that other adversaries would not launch their own military operations and that the United States could focus on the conflict in the Western Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: There are simultaneous crises.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, China itself might launch the invasion in response to U.S. distraction by a crisis elsewhere or might itself instigate others, particularly North Korea, to take advantage of the situation despite the risks. Therefore, an excursion case considers what might happen if the United States faced simultaneous crises. This excursion case reduces the U.S. order of battle and delays the reinforcement schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategic-assumptions-orders-of-battle-mobilization-and-rules-of-engagement&quot;&gt;Strategic Assumptions: Orders of Battle, Mobilization, and Rules of Engagement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next set of assumptions covers the strategic context, namely the force structure, mobilization, and doctrine of combatants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;order-of-battle&quot;&gt;ORDER OF BATTLE&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orders of battle (OOBs) are “the identification, strength, command structure, and disposition of the personnel, units, and equipment of any military force.” OOBs are critical for designing wargames because they specify what units participate, their location, and their strength. However, OOBs are often not published in detail for security reasons, and the project therefore had to deduce them from publicly available documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China:&lt;/strong&gt; The Chinese OOB is derived from best estimates in open-source intelligence, principally from IISS, Jane’s weapons descriptions, and the annual report by DOD to Congress about the Chinese military. The lack of documents corresponding to the U.S. Future Years Defense Program and reports on Programs of Record means that some educated guesswork about Chinese aircraft and ship production is required. However, there is less uncertainty in projecting a 2026 scenario than one in the 2030s or later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese missile inventory is particularly important. In the base case, all Chinese conventional ballistic missiles are available within the timescale of the game (generally three to four weeks) and have warheads that are appropriately matched to whatever land-attack mission they are tasked to perform. For example, warheads used against aircraft parked on U.S. and Japanese air bases are optimized for such attacks by using 3-pound bomblet submunitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Chinese missile inventories, their warhead types, and their availability are highly uncertain because of the lack of Chinese published material. Because missiles account for so many of the U.S. air and naval losses across all scenarios, the project explored two Chinese missile-related excursion cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: China has increased TBM inventory.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This excursion case explores the effect of additional TBMs (beyond the base case) in China’s inventory by 2026. China has stopped adding short-range ballistic missiles to its ballistic missile inventory (and may be reducing such inventories) in favor of other forms of firepower for short-range missions (particularly strike aircraft and long-range Multiple Launch Rocket Systems) and longer-range missile systems, particularly the DF-26. China could shift additional force structure toward longer-range TBMs, particularly those with boost-glide hypersonic missiles. In this excursion case, the Chinese inventory of intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBMs) and boost-glide missiles is 50 percent larger than that stipulated in the base case, both for land-attack and anti-ship missiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: China has reduced TBM inventory.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Conversely, China’s TBM inventory might be reduced if more TBMs are withheld for nuclear missions or as a hedge against other conflicts. Despite the PLA’s new emphasis on joint operations and jointness, PLARF assets have only partially been integrated into the Theater Command (TC) structures, which are designed to facilitate joint operations. Unlike the other services, there is, for example, no PLARF deputy commander within the TC staffs. The PLA or its political overseers might opt to withhold some DF-26 launchers, with their interchangeable nuclear and conventional warheads, for an enhanced nuclear deterrent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, China’s TBMs may not have an optimal warhead to target match. The base case assumes that China has analyzed and built the ratio of unitary to submunition warheads that maximizes their impact in each iteration played. However, it is possible that China’s targeting plans are either wrong or that they are forced to change them in the war. This would force China to use less-efficient unitary warheads against aircraft in the open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Given possible missile holdouts and a less than ideal mix of warhead types, an excursion case reduces the number of Chinese medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs) and IRBMs by 25 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taiwan:&lt;/strong&gt; As mentioned above, the sheer volume of Chinese missiles makes Taiwan’s air and naval forces almost irrelevant; besides a few squadrons that are isolated in Taiwan’s underground shelter until they are dug out, these forces are destroyed in the first few days of an invasion. However, the same is not true of Taiwan’s ground forces, which become critical to the outcome of the operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The OOB for active units of the Taiwanese military comes from Ian Easton and the IISS 2022 Military Balance. For the ground forces, two tweaks were required. First, Easton provides very specific brigade and battalion numbers for the whole force, and the ostensible force structure has remained relatively stable since his book was published. However, the botched transition to an all-volunteer force has caused personnel numbers to drop significantly and units to be undermanned. To an extent, this could be offset by having reservists backfill into active units, but Easton’s numbers are still inflated. The base scenario therefore reduced the number of maneuver battalions in each brigade by one. These resulting notional battalions are still small by U.S. standards but comparable to their Chinese counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the division between heavy and light mechanized infantry in the table is somewhat arbitrary. On the one hand, Taiwan’s M-60 tanks (and M-1 tanks, if they arrive by 2026) are much heavier than the light armored vehicles associated with Chinese marine and airborne units. On the other hand, Taiwan’s mechanized infantry is mounted in old M-113s with 20-mm guns, and Taiwan still has many M-41 and M-48 tanks, which date from the 1950s and early 1960s. Furthermore, China’s ZTL-05 amphibious assault gun is a derivative of the British 105-mm L7 gun that is likely able to penetrate Taiwan’s M-60s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major sources for the Taiwanese reserves were Easton et al., IISS’s 2021 Military Balance, and GlobalSecurity.org. Information on Taiwan’s reserve brigades is thin, but a few things are known. They are large but not well prepared. There is, however, some variation in quality and readiness. There are several levels. A-level brigades are the best prepared and reportedly include one battalion of active cadre per brigade as well as an artillery battalion. Other levels are less well defined. Some sources suggest a second level includes military personnel affiliated with military educational institutions and that the brigades include artillery. Beyond 21 or 24 “first-line” reserve brigades, there are coastal defense units and a very large but even less well-equipped force of local reserves or militia. The project models the “first-line” reserve battalion as having half the lethality of an active-duty battalion. For artillery, IISS lists 2,093 artillery pieces in the inventory. Most are probably old, and many may not be serviceable but could be used to field 60 artillery battalions in the active and reserve forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: Taiwan has not received ground-launched Harpoons.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Because the PLA must come to Taiwan and land on one of a few suitable beaches, the invasion is vulnerable to short-range ASCMs. Indeed, the original article prescribing a “porcupine strategy” for Taiwan described mobile coastal-defense cruise missiles as “at the top of this list” of systems for Taiwan to acquire. There is currently a deal for the United States to sell 100 ground-based Harpoon launchers and 400 missiles to Taiwan. If that sale goes through, those missiles would have a large impact on a Chinese invasion. However, there have been reports of a possible delay. Furthermore, the United States sent some Harpoons to Ukraine, which may delay the Harpoon delivery to Taiwan. Therefore, an excursion case assumes that these Harpoons are not on Taiwan at the start of the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The United States:&lt;/strong&gt; Many budget documents and official statements fed into the U.S. OOB, with some extrapolations to 2026 required. These included the Department of Defense’s FY 2023 budget overview, the service budget highlight books, the Navy’s 30-year shipbuilding plan, and, for the Army and Air Force, force structure projections contained in their operations and maintenance budget justification books. Location of individual units, where needed, came from the websites of individual military bases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reinforcement schedule assumes global sourcing: U.S. forces from around the world would be sent to the Pacific. Some U.S. forces head to Taiwan from the north and east. These appear on the game’s operational map. Other forces would head there via the Indian Ocean. As noted in Chapter 3, these latter forces engage the Chinese in abstracted battles around the South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As has been seen during the conflict in Ukraine, modern militaries expend munitions at a high rate. The game, therefore, tracks the most important munitions, especially those with limited inventories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. munitions inventories were estimated from budget documents and allowed for production lead times, generally two years. Some munitions, such as the Army’s Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) and the Navy’s JASSM, are not expected to be available in large numbers in 2026 and were therefore not included. Other munitions not specifically tracked, such as air-to-air, were assumed to be available in sufficient numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This inventory is distributed globally. Although large elements are in the Pacific already and in the United States, available for shipment overseas, other elements are in Europe and the Middle East. The base case assumes that all these munitions would be available for the conflict against China. The OOB has a decrement to strategic airlift to redistribute these munitions and other supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach accepts risk in other theaters, particularly in Europe and the Middle East. However, this would likely be the U.S. approach, given the immediacy of the conflict against China. Other regions would still have access to alternative munitions such as the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) or the Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) I and II, which are available in large numbers. Using these short-range munitions would increase risk to U.S. forces if conflict occurred, but given the lower capability of regional air defenses, this risk would likely be judged acceptable. Further, allies and partners could provide some standoff capabilities in these other theaters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: Submarines are withheld for other missions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Although they would likely be effective hunters of a Chinese amphibious force, U.S. SSNs have several other missions with which they are tasked. Most notably, they trail adversary ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) to hold at risk the nuclear capability of hostile countries. The base case assumed that all available SSNs are reassigned to either defeating the invasion of Taiwan or clearing the South China Sea since a conflict with China is an immediate and grave demand. However, some SSNs might be withheld for these other missions and therefore not be available for operations near Taiwan. Therefore, an excursion case assumes that two fewer submarine squadrons (eight SSNs total) are available to the U.S. player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Japan:&lt;/strong&gt; As in the U.S. case, Japanese defense holdings and deployments are relatively transparent, allowing the game OOB to be built from a variety of documents. The baseline for 2022 was established using IISS’s Military Balance and cross-checked with information in Japan’s annual Defense of Japan white paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Medium-Term Defense Program outlines broad future plans every five years. For production and acquisition rates and other specifics, the OOB used data from annual military budgets, published in English in abbreviated detail and in full detail in Japanese. Japanese defense spending has been trending upward since 2013, increasing 26 percent through 2021, with the declared intention of increasing spending further in the future. Within Japan’s proposed 2023 budget, the acquisition of additional standoff strike capability is listed as the number one priority for strengthening defense capability, and this project assumes that it will have acquired a small inventory of Joint Strike Missiles (JSMs), among others, by 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;warning-and-mobilization&quot;&gt;WARNING AND MOBILIZATION&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although in all scenarios conflict was assumed to occur after a period of crisis, China’s attack was still able to achieve tactical surprise. (See next section for discussion of mobilization.) The reason is the precedent of Ukraine, where adversary forces freely relocated without triggering conflict, though the other side made precautionary moves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the base case, China takes measures to minimize warning time by, for example, using a large exercise to mask its preparation and delaying measures that would provide unambiguous warning, such as requisitioning large numbers of civilian lift ships, until late in the process. The project team postulates that these unambiguous signals would begin at D minus 30. Although the United States and Taiwan would see these preparations, there would likely be considerable uncertainty about Chinese motivation and intentions. Thus, the base case assumes that Taiwan and the United States would have unambiguous warning at D minus 14.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this warning, the United States alerts its forces and moves some forward in an effort to deter China. The United States frequently moves forces forward to signal its resolve during periods of crisis in accordance with doctrine about “Phase 0.” If deterrence fails, then under this concept forward-based forces would strengthen the US military response. In the base case, these deployments consist of a CSG sent to the Ryukyus (in addition to the CSG in Japan) and two bomber squadrons sent to Guam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: There is no U.S. “show of force.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Although forward deployed forces might strengthen deterrence, they become highly vulnerable when inside the Chinese defensive bubble. Thus, if the United States were reasonably certain that China could not be deterred, it would be prudent to keep forces far from the Chinese mainland before D-Day. In this excursion case, the CSG stays outside of the second island chain, while the bomber squadrons stay in the contiguous United States until D-day. The effect is that China cannot destroy them in a surprise attack with TBMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, even after unambiguous strategic warning from the intelligence community, there would be some hesitation. Residual uncertainty about Chinese intentions, fears of escalating the crisis, and concerns about alarming the public would mitigate against aggressive action. Thus, the base case assumes that the United States surges some but not all its forces. However, the alert allows forces to move more quickly once the conflict begins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Culver, a former national intelligence officer for East Asia and now an Asia expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, argues that Chinese preparations to invade Taiwan would be seen months or even years ahead of time. It is certainly true that China would need to prepare, and many of these actions would be visible. However, it is not clear how quickly these preparations would be interpreted as signaling an invasion and how quickly military action would be taken in response. Leaders in target or allied states may also fear that defensive preparations would prompt or provoke attacks that might not otherwise occur or, alternatively, might cause self-inflicted harm from damage to economic markets or panic buying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: The United States mobilizes late.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In a Taiwan crisis, U.S. leaders might misinterpret Chinese preparations, wish to avoid exacerbating tensions, or be ambivalent about accepting the risks of direct conflict with a nuclear-armed power. The “late U.S. reaction” excursion case eliminates the two-week reaction period prior to hostilities and delays the arrival of U.S. forces by two weeks relative to the base case. Thus, no U.S. air elements reinforce peacetime presence in Japan or Guam, and U.S. naval forces arrive later than in the base case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The base case assumes that Taiwan responds quickly to invasion. This means that there is no hesitation or delay caused by political indecision or Chinese actions such as propaganda, sabotage, or special forces attacks. Furthermore, Taiwanese command and control has dispersed or taken cover, so they are not vulnerable to a decapitating Chinese first strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: Taiwan has a delayed reaction.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An excursion case examines what might happen if the Taiwanese response were delayed because of Chinese action or Taiwanese political hesitation. In this excursion case, military forces in the threatened zone an operate, but other forces are frozen for one turn (one half week).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;rules-of-engagement&quot;&gt;RULES OF ENGAGEMENT&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rules of engagement are “directives issued by competent military authority that delineate the circumstances and limitations under which United States forces will initiate and/or continue combat engagement with other forces encountered.” They are important for wargames because they govern the actions that players can take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chinese Strikes against the United States:&lt;/strong&gt; Because the United States will be striking the Chinese homeland, the base case assumes that the U.S. homeland is not a sanctuary. However, the ability of the Chinese to conduct strikes against the U.S. homeland and thereby affect operations in the Western Pacific is extremely limited. A few special forces might infiltrate and attack a small number of high-value targets but not enough to materially affect military operations in the Western Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In theory, the Chinese might send a submarine to the U.S. West Coast to attack cities and maritime facilities. In the play of the game, the Chinese submarine fleet was fully occupied fending off U.S. and Japanese warships in the Western Pacific. Even if the Chinese decided to divert a few submarines to such attacks, their effect on military operations would be small. Their psychological effect on the U.S. population might be large, but this would take time to affect military operations. Some game participants hypothesized that the Chinese would mine U.S. ports, thereby preventing the exit of Navy ships. Such an attack might, in theory, be done stealthily. However, prewar surveillance during a time of heightened crisis would identify any Chinese military forces operating near the West Coast, and the Chinese have not demonstrated an ability to do such operations from merchant ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese might launch economic, information, and diplomatic initiatives to isolate the United States and undermine popular support for the conflict. However, the effects of such efforts would not be manifest in the short time duration of this game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. Strikes against Mainland China:&lt;/strong&gt; There is ongoing debate about whether the United States would strike targets on mainland China during a conflict. On the one hand, striking a nuclear power’s territory threatens nuclear escalation. State adversaries have been extremely careful about attacking the homeland of a nuclear power. In providing HIMARS to Ukraine, for example, the United States reportedly attached the condition that no attacks on undisputed Russian territory be conducted with them. Similarly, the United States has refused to supply Ukraine with ATACMS because it could strike deep into Russian territory. In the case of the Korean War, which occurred before China had acquired nuclear weapons but after the Soviet Union had, the United States refrained from striking bases in both China and the Soviet Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, military advantage would come from attacks on the Chinese mainland. U.S. airpower could attack Chinese aircraft on the ground when they are most vulnerable and sink Chinese amphibious ships in port. The United States has built a large inventory of JASSM-ERs for this purpose. Additionally, there will be a desire for revenge against China: China will have killed thousands of Americans and, if it strikes Guam, attacked U.S. territory. In World War II, the United States struck the Japanese homeland through the Doolittle raid as soon as it was able, not for military advantage but to achieve propaganda value for striking back at an aggressor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some experts have speculated about the United States striking the first blow and attacking the Chinese fleet in port when unambiguous warning has been received. This would inhibit or even prevent the Chinese from establishing a beachhead in the first place. However, it would initiate a war with the United States as the aggressor, provoking all the adverse political consequences related to such an action. Further, arguments for striking on unambiguous warning would run into the memories of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction in 2003, when unambiguous strategic warning turned out to be erroneous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The base case assumes limited, non-preemptive attacks on the Chinese mainland. The United States can attack Chinese air bases and ports that are directly involved in Chinese strikes on Taiwanese and U.S. forces. It rules out a broader air campaign aimed at destroying Chinese infrastructure, industry, leadership, and command and control as being too provocative. This appears to be a middle course between a preemptive strike or broad attack on Chinese society and a prohibition against any homeland strikes at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: U.S. National Command Authority rules out strikes on mainland China.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Regardless of what U.S. military planners may assume during peacetime about the most efficient application of U.S. military force in a Taiwan scenario, major rules of engagement and especially questions related to mainland strikes will ultimately be decided by the president, who will weigh a wide variety of military, political, and diplomatic considerations. The president may judge that the risk of escalation is too high given the potential benefits. The president might also believe that the United States could prevail without strikes against the mainland. Thus, this excursion case assumes a presidential prohibition against any mainland strikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;operational-and-tactical-assumptions-competence-weapons-and-infrastructure&quot;&gt;Operational and Tactical Assumptions: Competence, Weapons, and Infrastructure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The base case assumes that U.S., Chinese, and Taiwanese forces have equivalent levels of operational competence. Unless there was strong evidence to the contrary, the project assumed that they would maintain operational competence. For capabilities where some doubt existed, excursion scenarios investigated what would happen if forces were not able to match their announced capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of conflicts between the United States and potential opponents (including China), this assumption tends to bias against the United States since its training standards are higher than most. Taking all sides’ capabilities at face value may give a modest boost to China since it has more unproven capabilities than the United States — from the ability to execute an anti-ship ballistic missile strike to simply moving troops from ship to shore in an amphibious landing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision to assess capabilities at face value also recognizes the great uncertainty in such judgments, given the dynamic condition of China’s military capabilities. Chris Dougherty, a wargaming expert at CNAS, made this argument in cautioning against downgrading estimates about the PLA because of overestimates about the Russian military. He noted that “Chinese military reforms over the last 20 years, combined with President Xi Jinping’s counter-corruption policies, had created a more professional and accountable force” and “built advanced weaponry at a scale far exceeding that of Russia.” Equivalency also incorporates continued Chinese advances in operational competence over the next four years, particularly as they conduct exercises of increasing size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;operational-competence&quot;&gt;OPERATIONAL COMPETENCE&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As highlighted by the recent Russo-Ukrainian war, different militaries conduct operations with varying degrees of competence. These variations are often unclear a priori.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLA Amphibious Competence:&lt;/strong&gt; The base case assumes a high level of Chinese amphibious competence. This requires that the Chinese military increases the scale, intensity, and realism of landing exercises between now and 2026, that they are astute in evaluating and codifying lessons learned and in formulating and diffusing doctrine, and that they can execute doctrine in combat. In calculating the ability of a Chinese amphibious fleet to get troops and materials ashore, the base case employs offload rates similar to those associated with late-World War II U.S. operations, including Operation Neptune (for the D-Day landings) and Operation Iceberg (the invasion of Okinawa). These rates reflect hard won wartime experience that the Chinese do not have. On the other hand, modern technologies like helicopters and widely available amphibious infantry fighting vehicles facilitate more rapid offload.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: China has reduced amphibious offload rates.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While high competence is possible and useful to assume as the base case, it is entirely plausible that China’s actual performance may be less skillful. Even if China continues to expand its amphibious training and exercises, it will lack the practical combat experience of the United States in World War II. The U.S. Marine Corps focused on amphibious attack prior to the war, conducting annual landing exercises of increasing scale between 1932 and 1941 and systematically developing procedures. Many of the operations conducted earlier in the war, such as Operation Watchtower (Guadalcanal) and the Torch landings in North Africa, were less smooth but provided valuable experience. Only after addressing those issues were the high offload rates (from D-Day and Okinawa) achieved. Although China may benefit from and build upon the documented lessons learned by the historical experiences of others, only large-scale experimentation and the codification of lessons learned from exercises can create practical capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the Falklands War of 1982, for example, the lack of recent experience with amphibious operations and the impact of Argentine air and missile attack produced lower British offload rates than those achieved by Allied forces almost four decades earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This excursion case reduces Chinese amphibious lift by 30 percent to match the offload rate of the British in the Falklands instead of the Americans in World War II.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taiwanese Army Training:&lt;/strong&gt; The project assumed the Taiwanese units were as effective as similarly sized and equipped Chinese units. The project team recognizes that there is a vigorous debate about the quality of the Taiwanese armed forces. Some argue that its training is stylized and unimaginative, the readiness of units is poor, and conscripts acquire few useful military skills. On the other hand, the Taiwanese would be defending their homeland and might show the tenacity and ingenuity that the Ukrainians have shown in their struggle against Russia. Nevertheless, even with high morale, the lack of training and top-tier equipment means that Taiwanese reserve forces operate at half strength in the base case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: Taiwanese ground units are understrength.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s ground forces may not be as ready and competent, unit-for-unit and type-for-type, as China’s. Taiwan’s military, and especially its army, was identified with the authoritarian politics of KMT rule, and the transition to democracy during the late 1980s and early 1990s brought suspicion of the institution. The attempted transition to an all-volunteer force, which originally aimed to phase out all conscription by 2013, has failed to produce the intended results. Recruiting shortfalls have required the continued use of conscription but with terms of service reduced from one year to four months. Moreover, even with continued conscription, the army has been unable to fill its ranks, with just 81 percent of its positions filled in 2020 (and personnel levels of between 60 and 80 percent in many combat arms units). Potentially disruptive reductions in force structure have also been undertaken, and the combination of those reductions and the failure to fully staff units has reduced the army’s size from 200,000 in 2011 to 94,000 in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Reserve personnel may fill vacancies in active-duty units during wartime, and Taiwan is exploring a variety of ways to increase numbers and improve the realism of its training. Nevertheless, 2026 is just a few years away, so Taiwan is running out of time to overcome these shortfalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This excursion case sets the combat power of Taiwan’s active-duty army units at 75 percent that of similar Chinese units (i.e., the combat power of a Taiwanese light mechanized battalion is set at 75 percent that of a Chinese light mechanized unit).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s reserve forces, already set at 50 percent of the combat power of corresponding active-duty units, are reduced to 75 percent of that strength, giving them combat power equal to 38 percent (0.5 x 0.75 = 0.38) of a corresponding Chinese active-duty unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLAAF Parity:&lt;/strong&gt; The base case assumes that each “generation” of aircraft has equal capability, regardless of nationality. While the U.S. Air Force has hitherto undoubtedly been superior to the PLAAF, Air Force leaders and defense scholars warn that this superiority is eroding. The Air Force’s greater experience with large air campaigns and stealth aircraft is counterbalanced by Chinese superiority in air-to-air missiles and their geographic advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While U.S. air planners have run large air campaigns in recent decades, their Chinese counterparts lack such experience. The last wartime employment of large formations of Chinese aircraft was during the Korean War, and the last time that a Chinese combat aircraft shot down a manned aircraft of any type was in 1967, when a U.S. Navy F-4 was downed in southern China. During China’s incursion into Vietnam in 1979, Central Military Commission directives prevented PLAAF combat missions beyond the border, and air units operating within Chinese airspace achieved sortie rates averaging only one flight every five days. Doctrinally, Chinese air practice has historically placed heavy emphasis on centralized control in both planning and execution and a heavy degree of ground control over flying units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has been working to address this shortfall in aerial planning and execution. In recent years, as new airframes have been brought into service, the PLAAF and People’s Liberation Army Naval Air Force (PLANAF) have sought to adopt more flexible Western methods, such as giving authority to flight leaders, conducting unscripted and competitive exercises, and holding “golden helmet” competitions in air-to-air combat. However, given the magnitude of the cultural adjustments required, doctrinal change is very much a work in progress. Moreover, flight training continues to have stovepiped career progression with little movement of pilots between training and combat billets. Perhaps most importantly, there is no Chinese equivalent of the U.S. Air Force Air Weapons School (“Red Flag”) or U.S. Navy’s Strike Fighter Tactics Instructor program (“Top Gun”), schools designed to train selected pilots who then return to line units to become training planners and instructors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Balancing the United States’ superiority in doctrine and training are the advantages brought by China’s long-range air-to-air missiles and geographic advantage. The Chinese PL-15 air-to-air missile outranges most Air Force Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) variants, meaning that the Chinese will often get the first shot in combat beyond visual range. Furthermore, the proximity of Taiwan to Chinese bases on the mainland will give China several advantages. First, Chinese pilots will be fresher during air combat than U.S. pilots, who will often have had to fly long distances from bases in Japan. Second, although Chinese SAMs could not effectively target U.S. fighter/attack aircraft over Taiwan, these SAMs give Chinese pilots a sanctuary from U.S. pursuit while ensuring that U.S. pilots must keep one eye on the ground during air combat. U.S. pilots will also need to watch for Chinese surface ships that push east of Taiwan. Third, Chinese AEW platforms will be more survivable because they can quickly retreat under the SAM umbrella of the mainland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: The U.S. Air Force is more competent than the PLAAF.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is possible that the United States’ superiority in training and planning outweighs the technology and basing advantages that China has. As Baron von Richthofen, the World War I ace, observed, “the quality of the box matters little. Success depends upon the man who sits in it.” Therefore, an excursion case explores the impact of U.S. air-to-air lethality that is 30 percent greater than that of the Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the general strengths and weaknesses of the PLAAF and Air Force is the specific question about the relative quality of both sides’ fifth-generation fighters. As a result of the U.S. aviation industry’s more established and competitive position, the United States has operated stealth aircraft for longer and has more mature fifth-generation designs. U.S. combat experience with stealth dates back to 1989 when two stealthy F-117As delivered ordinance against an airfield in Panama. Desert Storm in 1991 saw widespread stealth use. After thorough vetting, the F-22 achieved initial operational capability as the world’s first fifth-generation aircraft in December 2005. It remains the only aircraft to have supercruise capability (i.e., the ability to maintain flight at supersonic speeds without the use of afterburners). The Air Force declared the F-35A combat capable in 2016 after prolonged development problems. It was designed without supercruise but has an extremely low radar cross-section and unparalleled sensor fusion, providing pilots with excellent situational awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Far less is known about the Chinese J-20 than U.S. stealth aircraft. However, although the J-20 first flew in 2011, China’s defense industry has not yet been able to produce the WS-15 engines that were intended to provide the J-20 with supercruise. It is equipped with canards and, with the latest WS-10C engines, thrust vectoring, which will give it high maneuverability, perhaps similar to the F-22. However, most analysts believe that it will also have a higher radar cross-section (i.e., less stealth) than either the F-22 or F-35. Little is known of the J-20’s electronics. While the sensors will certainly have range and electronic warfare capability, the system is unlikely to incorporate the same degree of sensor fusion as the F-35.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: U.S. fifth-generation aircraft are superior to Chinese counterparts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An excursion case explores the possibility that U.S. fifth-generation aircraft are more capable than Chinese fifth-generation aircraft. Although the J-20 will likely evolve into a fully capable fifth-generation fighter, it may not reach that stage within the 2026 timeframe of the game and thus may not be equal to the F-22 or F-35 in direct combat. This excursion case reduces the lethality of the J-20 to 4.5-generation standards while maintaining benefits that accrue to stealthy aircraft (e.g., reduced vulnerability to naval or ground-based SAMs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;weapons-effectiveness&quot;&gt;WEAPONS EFFECTIVENESS&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted above, the project generally accepted weapons effectiveness at face value. However, two particularly consequential cases vary this assumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JASSM-ER vs. Ships:&lt;/strong&gt; The JASSM, a conventional, stealthy, air-launched ground-attack cruise missile, is a special case. Its long-range precision guidance and stealthy characteristics make it an important munition for the United States. The basic version is designed for ground attack. A critical judgment is whether the extended-range version, the JASSM-ER can strike naval targets. Although there is an anti-ship variant, the Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM), relatively few of the latter will be available in 2026 (roughly 450 LRASMs vs. 3,650 JASSM-ERs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Publicly available information about the capabilities of the JASSM-ER is unclear. There are hints that it could have some anti-ship capability. In its FY 2022 budget request, the Navy introduced the AGM-158B JASSM-ER to “enhance long range strike and existing OASuW [offensive anti-surface warfare] capability.” The document suggests that it will be possible to “convert JASSM-ER software to a C++ software baseline, similar to LRASM, and focus on combining JASSM-ER strike capability and LRASM OASuW capability into a merged Navy JASSM baseline. Future efforts will expand both Navy strike and OASuW capabilities within Navy JASSM.” The Air Force also continues to upgrade variants of the JASSM-ER. Depending on the adjustments required to make the missile capable of anti-ship operations, it is possible that the capability could be retrofitted onto existing systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the JASSM-ER’s infrared target recognition seeker has even modest capability against moving ships at sea, the impact would be enormous. By mixing JASSM-ERs with salvos of LRASMs, Chinese ships would have to expend interceptors engaging incoming salvos of JASSM-ERs, allowing more LRASMs to survive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The base case assumes that the JASSM-ER has some limited capability to strike ships at sea. High numbers of these munitions allows a much greater volume of fire against the Chinese fleet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: No Maritime Strike JASSM.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is a high degree of uncertainty about whether the JASSM-ER will have anti-ship capability by 2026. Because the United States will have many JASSM-ERs, and the ability of the Chinese amphibious ships to survive is central to the success of an invasion, this assumption would make a large difference in the game outcome. Hence, this excursion case assumes that the JASSM-ER does not have anti-ship capability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ship Defenses:&lt;/strong&gt; The base case assumes that the missile defenses of both sides work as described in publicly available documents. This produces a single-shot probability of intercept of 0.70 and, with a shot doctrine of two interceptors per incoming missile, a combined intercept probability of 0.91.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are few publicly available Pk figures for interceptors against missiles, but the 0.70 figure is roughly consistent with modeling work in the public domain. A 2017 thesis for the Naval War College, for example, cites a Pk of between 0.60 and 0.80 for the Standard Missile-2. The author of that study stipulates that the values given are not “actual figures” but “are within reasonable magnitude of the actual to produce valid and applicable results.” In the context of national missile defense, longtime analyst Dean Wilkening writes that “BMD designers apparently expect interceptor SSPKs around 0.80 to 0.85,” though he suggests that such probabilities “may be difficult to achieve in the presence of countermeasures.” The Missile Defense Advisory Alliance reports that 79 of 97 hit-to-kill intercept attempts have been successful across all programs since 2001, a rate of 0.81. Similar figures recur throughout the literature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: Chinese and U.S. ship defenses do not work as well as expected.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The history of modern warfare is replete with examples of systems, particularly missile systems, that underperform in combat. Missile tests are frequently conducted under ideal conditions that begin with checks to ensure that all systems are in working order. There are many points where the fog and friction of combat could dramatically degrade a weapon’s effectiveness. Even after combat, the effectiveness of systems is unclear. There was a lengthy (and still unresolved) debate about the effectiveness of missile defense against Scud missiles in Desert Storm. This difference between peacetime testing and wartime employment could mean that ship-based cruise missile defense is much less effective than assumed in the project’s base case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By how much could ship-based cruise missile defense be degraded? A 2020 study of all cruise missile attacks on warships since 1967 concluded that 60 of the 162 missiles launched (or 37 percent) struck the target. Of the 63 percent that did not, some fell victim to missile failures or soft kill, which are handled separately within this project’s model. Against ships that were on high alert and defended against the attack, 124 missiles scored 34 hits (or 27 percent). This contrasts with the base case, wherein multiple independently adjudicated intercept attempts result in an average of only 5.6 percent of subsonic and 7.4 percent of supersonic cruise missiles hitting their target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The excursion case increases the effectiveness of anti-ship missiles by postulating that 25 percent of missiles fired hit their target. Although this higher Pk is applied against both sides’ ships, this change affects the Chinese more because they have far more ships exposed to missile attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyber and ASAT:&lt;/strong&gt; Given the lack of historical evidence on the effectiveness of cyber and ASAT tools in operational warfare, the project credited each with being moderately effective. As discussed in Chapter 3, each side possesses cyber exploits that give passive benefits and could be used for one-time active effects. These effects are significant but not magical. For example, the United States can shut down power to some Chinese ports and reduce their lift by 20 percent that turn but cannot shut down all power in eastern China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For ASAT warfare, the project assumes (1) that both sides possess moderately effective dazzling and electronic warfare capabilities, (2) that they use these immediately and consistently to degrade each other’s ISR, (3) that co-orbital interference will take longer than the length of a game iteration (i.e., a month), (4) that both China and the United States possess some direct-ascent capabilities, and (5) that the United States is politically constrained from being the first to use direct-ascent weapons, but also (6) that if China uses its direct-ascent ASAT weapons, the United States can respond in kind, and (7) that ASAT use would greatly degrade adversary ISR capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;infrastructure&quot;&gt;INFRASTRUCTURE&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hardened Aircraft Shelters:&lt;/strong&gt; The base case assumes that neither the United States nor Japan builds additional HASs prior to war. During the 1980s, the United States and its allies constructed roughly 1,000 HASs in Europe, South Korea, and northern Japan. Against Chinese ballistic missiles, HASs would reduce aircraft losses by forcing China to target individual shelters with unitary warheads and deny it the ability to destroy multiple aircraft with a single missile equipped with submunitions (cluster munitions). Analysts have, therefore, long encouraged the construction of additional shelters in areas under Chinese missile threat today, though little has happened since the end of the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: Japan has more HASs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There are signs that both the United States and Japan are recommitting to hardening as part of an effort to improve operational resilience. This excursion case assumes that the United States and Japan build 400 additional shelters, for an estimated cost of $2.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Access to Civilian Airfields:&lt;/strong&gt; Attacks against aircraft parked in the open is effectively a density problem, with the probability of kill for each aircraft in target areas being determined by total missile coverage (the numerator) divided by the total potential parking area (the denominator). The base case assumes minimal dispersion to civilian airfields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excursion: Japan grants increased access to civilian airports.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Dispersing Air Force aircraft to civilian airports could greatly expand the parking area that China must attack and thereby reduce US and Japanese losses. There is likely a decrease in operational efficiency that comes from stretching maintenance and support personnel across multiple sites. However, with the alternative being operating from damaged military fields, this efficiency loss is probably acceptable. Each Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) base seems to be paired with a regional civilian airfield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An excursion case therefore expands access to civilian airports. If the United States and Japan can space aircraft on the ground farther apart than the submunitions of a Chinese missile can cover, then China would have to expend one missile per aircraft. This would quickly deplete China’s inventory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter describes the results of the iterations. They are grouped in five categories of scenarios: base, pessimistic, optimistic, “Taiwan stands alone,” and “Ragnarok” (highly pessimistic).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall finding is that China is unlikely to succeed in an invasion of Taiwan in 2026 if four conditions hold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taiwan must vigorously resist. If it does not, the rest is futile.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States must join hostilities within days and with the full range of its capabilities. Delays and half measures make the defense harder, increase U.S. casualties, and raise the risk of the Chinese creating an irreducible lodgment on Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States must have use of its bases in Japan. Without them, the United States cannot use its numerous fighter/attack aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, the United States must possess enough air-launched, long-range ASCMs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, even a successful defense of Taiwan comes at great cost. The United States and its allies lose dozens of ships, hundreds of aircraft, and thousands of personnel. The high losses would damage the United States’ global position for many years. While Taiwan’s military is unbroken, it is severely degraded and left to defend a badly damaged economy on an island without electricity and basic services. China’s navy is in shambles, the core of its amphibious forces is broken, and thousands of soldiers are taken as prisoners or war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-outcome-taiwanese-autonomy&quot;&gt;Key Outcome: Taiwanese Autonomy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key condition for judging outcomes was the continued autonomy of Taiwan as a political entity. This condition excludes consideration of damage to the Taiwanese economy or the extent of U.S. losses. While these factors remain relevant and the concluding chapter of this report considers them in the context of the military outcome, the stated U.S. and Taiwanese policy goal is autonomy, without a discussion of cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most iterations lasted around six turns, representing three weeks of combat, though some iterations went longer. If results were uncertain when game play ended for outside players, the project staff would sometimes play a few more turns to clarify the outcome. The project staff made a judgment at the end about how to score the outcome. It is important to note that the full campaign, taken to its conclusion, would generally take months. The game investigates the first three or four weeks, which are the most intense for air and maritime operations. The most intense ground operations would happen later, as ground forces sought a conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese amphibious, airborne, and air assault capabilities gradually deteriorate under U.S., Japanese, and Taiwanese attack, so China cannot rely on them indefinitely. If China can secure ports and airfields and keep them operational, they will ultimately win. If they cannot, Chinese forces will eventually crumble. In optimistic scenarios, Chinese amphibious capabilities would be destroyed in a week. In pessimistic scenarios, the Chinese amphibious fleet might survive to the end of a month. The status of Chinese-held ports and airfields on Taiwan was therefore the critical factor in determining the outcome of the operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outcome of each iteration was scored as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chinese Victory:&lt;/strong&gt; Chinese ground forces outnumber Taiwanese forces on the island. Once that happens, and the Chinese control enough airports and ports to bring the bulk of their ground forces over, they will eventually prevail, though the complete conquest of an island the size of Taiwan would take many months, barring a capitulation. Two iterations continued until total conquest; most iterations were ended when Chinese victory appeared inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stalemate:&lt;/strong&gt; Chinese forces have a significant lodgment ashore, and neither side can make rapid gains. Chinese forces have captured a handful of ports and airports. The United States is striking those facilities to make or keep them fully unusable, while China is attempting to repair them and make them fully functional. This outcome typically occurred when China was able to secure the southern part of the island and the facilities there.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a. &lt;strong&gt;Stalemate, trending toward China:&lt;/strong&gt; China has a solid beachhead that is not in danger of being eliminated. They have more than three ports or airports on Taiwan, although these may be damaged. To defeat the invasion, the United States and its allies would have to keep these ports and airports suppressed, resupply Taiwan, and, possibly, commit ground forces to rescue the Taiwanese position. China would have to clear ports or airports with the engineers landed, possibly while under attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b. &lt;strong&gt;Stalemate, indeterminate:&lt;/strong&gt; An ambiguous situation, often involving the loss of the entire Chinese amphibious fleet, but with Chinese forces securely ashore and having occupied several damaged port or airport facilities. Resolution depends on whether China can restore the captured facilities to supply and expand its forces before Taiwanese forces counterattack in strength. The campaign would take an extended period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;c. &lt;strong&gt;Stalemate, trending against China:&lt;/strong&gt; Although the Chinese have a significant beachhead, they do not possess a favorable enough force ratio to make quick gains against opposing Taiwanese ground forces. The Chinese amphibious fleet has suffered high attrition, and they have no working ports and airports on Taiwan. China is trying to substitute small civilian craft for the large amphibious carriers that it has lost, but as the British found at Gallipoli, this results in a dramatically lower supply throughput. An important question on the Taiwan side would include the state of its ammunition stocks and the ability to resupply. Whatever the eventual outcome, it is not where the Chinese would want to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chinese Defeat:&lt;/strong&gt; The Chinese amphibious fleet is mostly destroyed, and the Chinese have not taken sufficient ports or airports such that major landing operations can continue. Relatively small Chinese forces are confined to a small landing area, and they are only receiving small amounts of supplies from airdrops and small civilian boats. At this point, it would be a matter of time for the Taiwanese forces to mop up Chinese survivors. The main challenge for the United States would not be in eliminating the remaining invaders but finding an acceptable off-ramp for hostilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teams played five types of scenarios: base scenarios, pessimistic scenarios, optimistic scenarios, the “Taiwan stands alone” scenario, and “Ragnarok” scenarios. The latter four examined the impact of adjusting critical assumptions from their most likely base case to less likely excursion cases (discussed above in Chapter 4). This section summarizes the design of the scenarios run, the operational outcomes, the losses incurred, and which variables appeared to be critical. The discussion provides specific numbers and detailed descriptions. However, these are not intended to imply that these are precise predictions but rather to share the raw data on which the authors formed their judgments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;base-scenario&quot;&gt;BASE SCENARIO&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design:&lt;/strong&gt; The project team conducted three iterations of the base scenario (using only base case assumptions without any of the excursion cases described in Chapter 4).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operational Outcomes:&lt;/strong&gt; Two out of three of these iterations were decided quickly, with the Chinese forces ashore unable to capture major cities and out of supplies within 10 days. In one iteration, PLA forces landed in the south and captured the port at Tainan. However, U.S. air strikes prevented its use, and the Chinese position was untenable by D plus 21. This was the only iteration of the base scenario that was not judged to be a decisive Chinese defeat, instead scoring as “Stalemate, trending against China.” In all cases, at least 90 percent of the Chinese amphibious fleet was destroyed, leaving the forces ashore supported only by air drops and heliborne supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5c286Cg.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4: Operational Results: Base Case Scenario, Range, and Average.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS tabulation of iteration results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese teams attempted different strategies that affected outcomes in all scenarios, including the base scenario. However, even with a sound Chinese strategy, the combination of challenges facing PLA invasion forces was too great to overcome. Despite the base cases assumption about a large but plausible number of civilian ships incorporated into the Chinese amphibious fleet, the buildup of PLA forces ashore is slow. Throughout the duration of the buildup and until ports and airports are captured and repaired, amphibious ships will be anchored off the invasion beaches, with ships shuttling between Taiwan and the Chinese ports as they empty. This is particularly true after the initial supply of amphibious assault vehicles is expended. In every iteration of the base scenario, U.S., allied, and partner forces were able to destroy shipping before the forces ashore were large enough to conduct sustained offensive action against defending forces flowing toward the beachhead. Anti-ship missiles delivered by Taiwanese shore batteries, U.S. aircraft, and U.S. and Japanese submarines all took a heavy and rapid toll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sound Chinese strategy could mitigate, but not stop, this attrition of the amphibious fleet. China has a substantial fleet of modern warships, and most Chinese teams placed SAGs, comprised of cruisers, destroyers, and frigates, to the east of Taiwan to serve as air and missile defense pickets. They also dispatched submarines further into the Western Pacific to keep U.S. surface forces at bay. These slowed attrition to the amphibious fleet while making the surface combatants themselves more vulnerable to attack. At the same time, Chinese missile forces were capable of suppressing Taiwanese air power and severely limiting (and attriting) the buildup of U.S. land-based tactical air capabilities in Japan. During the initial stage of the conflict, China’s air forces enjoyed substantial air superiority over Taiwan and were able to employ ground-attack aircraft and bombers to obstruct the movement of Taiwanese reinforcements to the battle area. These strengths, however, were unable to offset the challenges of getting Chinese ground forces ashore in Taiwan and keeping them supplied once there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the base case iterations, China was able to land a total of 37 battalions. With losses deducted, China’s strength at the end of the iteration averaged 30 battalions, or 30,000 personnel (including non-combat elements). On average, the size of the Chinese beachhead ashore measured roughly 2,600 km2 (or 7 percent) of the total Taiwanese territory of roughly 36,000 km2 by the end of game play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 3: PLA Situation Ashore at End of Iteration, Base Case Average.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS tabulation of iteration results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Losses:&lt;/strong&gt; Balanced against Chinese failure to achieve operational objectives in the base scenario were the large losses suffered by all the combatants. Considering the short period of time, U.S. air losses were greater than any witnessed since the Vietnam War. Naval losses were greater than anything experienced since World War II. Japan also suffered heavily: two out of the three base iterations saw strikes against airfields across the length of the archipelago. Taiwanese losses in personnel and infrastructural damage were great. China’s losses were also staggering and included large numbers of aircraft, virtually its entire fleet, and thousands of personnel. Although losses were high for both sides, the speed with which the base scenario ends (often decided by the sinking of China’s amphibious fleet after 10 days) limits losses in the ground campaign for both sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/RP8lkmA.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 4: U.S., Japanese, and Chinese Air and Naval Losses, Base Scenario.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS tabulation of iteration results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relative strength of U.S. and Chinese air-to-air capability was unimportant because most aircraft were destroyed on the ground. The lack of U.S. and allied air bases within practical range of Taiwan led to crowding at the few bases available. Furthermore, most of those bases lack any HASs to mitigate damage. Thus, Chinese missiles destroyed many aircraft — about 90 percent of total U.S., Japanese, and Taiwanese losses — on the ground, despite the large number of U.S. and Japanese air and missile defenses on Okinawa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States lost between 168 and 372 aircraft in the three base scenario iterations. Subtracting the 96 Navy fighter/attack aircraft lost on U.S. aircraft carriers in all base scenario iterations, the Air Force suffered losses between 70 and 274 aircraft, mostly on the ground. In one of the base scenario iterations, the Chinese team did not attack bases in Japan, but China did strike Andersen Air Force Base in Guam in every iteration, producing losses there. Japanese air losses were also high in two out of three iterations, averaging 122 aircraft, and were also largely incurred on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all iterations of the base scenario, U.S. Navy losses included two U.S. aircraft carriers as well as between 7 and 20 other major surface warships (e.g., destroyers and cruisers). These losses were partly an artifact of U.S. forward deployment aimed at deterring China, as the scenario begins with two carriers and an additional SAG positioned in vulnerable positions off Okinawa. It also reflects the vulnerability of surface ships to large salvos of modern anti-ship missiles. These salvos exhausted the ships’ magazines of interceptors; even with the base case assumption that shipborne missile defense works very well, there are simply too many attacking missiles to intercept. The JMSDF suffered even more heavily, as all its assets fall within the range of Chinese anti-ship missile systems, which include anti-ship ballistic missiles and long-range ASCMs as well as submarines and shorter-range munitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In all iterations of the base scenario, U.S. Navy losses included two U.S. aircraft carriers as well as between 7 and 20 other major surface warships (e.g., destroyers and cruisers).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s air losses included roughly half of its operational air force, the majority lost on the ground to missile strikes. Even within the scope of the these relatively short iterations, the 26 ships of Taiwan’s navy (22 frigates and 4 destroyers) were destroyed by a combination of China’s joint fire strikes and aggressive hunting by China’s second-tier naval ships. The land battles were fierce but limited in scale, with Taiwanese army casualties averaging about 3,500, with about a third of those killed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s losses in the base scenario were also high. In all iterations, PLAN ships around Taiwan were the primary focus of attack, and China’s naval losses averaged 138 major ships in the three iterations of the base scenario. On average, these included 86 amphibious ships (90 percent of the total) and 52 other major surface warships. Chinese aircraft losses, averaging 161 fixed-wing combat aircraft per iteration, were smaller than those for the United States. But in the base iterations, the United States never attacked Chinese bases (though they were permitted to do so according to the scenario assumptions), so all of China’s air losses were suffered in the air. Therefore, China would have lost many aircrews but had no losses to ground crews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s overall personnel losses were high. In ground combat, China suffered an average of 7 battalion-equivalents destroyed, equal to Taiwan’s ground losses. This would translate to about 7,000 casualties, roughly a third of whom are assumed killed. Another roughly 15,000 soldiers were lost at sea, with half assumed killed. Finally, many (and probably an overwhelming majority) of the 30,000-plus Chinese survivors on Taiwan would likely become prisoners at the end of combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critical Variables:&lt;/strong&gt; The LRASM was particularly useful because of its ability to strike Chinese naval forces and directly reduce Chinese invasion capabilities. In every iteration, the United States expended its entire global inventory of LRASMs (about 450 missiles) within the first week of the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because LRASM inventories were so limited, the base case assumption about the effectiveness of the JASSM-ER against ships played a critical role in the speed and effectiveness of that attrition campaign. In the base scenario, the inventory of several hundred LRASMs, with a range of 600 km, combined with thousands of JASSM-ERs, with even greater range and modest anti-ship capability, allowing U.S. bombers and tactical aircraft to rapidly attrite the Chinese fleet from beyond the range of its anti-aircraft defenses. Thus, the large inventory of JASSM-ERs provided the numbers necessary to conduct the anti-ship campaign quickly and at standoff distances (the implications of this are discussed in Chapter 6).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the large JASSM-ER inventory and the uncertainty of its ability to strike ships, varying that assumption became a critical part of the research agenda. Long-range missiles were critical because Chinese air defenses were initially so formidable that no aircraft could get close enough to drop short-range munitions. Even stealth aircraft were at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pessimistic-scenarios&quot;&gt;Pessimistic Scenarios&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nineteen iterations were run with pessimistic scenarios that incorporated excursion cases more favorable to China. The extreme “Taiwan stands alone” or “Ragnarok” scenarios are discussed separately. The large number of pessimistic iterations was driven by the operational results of the base scenario and the desire to examine how robust the base scenario outcomes would be in the face of plausible changes to assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design:&lt;/strong&gt; All 19 pessimistic iterations included the assumption that the JASSM-ER missile possesses no capability against ships at sea. As noted in the discussion of the base scenario, the JASSM had a decisive impact on outcomes, but its actual anti-ship capabilities are not well established. The first four pessimistic iterations used only the “No maritime strike JASSM” excursion case. The remaining 15 iterations included at least three additional pessimistic excursion case assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twelve of the iterations included delayed U.S. mobilization, late engagement, or larger U.S. holdouts for other ongoing contingencies. Twelve of the iterations included pessimistic assumptions about Taiwanese operational competence or ability to react to the invasion quickly. Three included U.S. rules of engagement that prohibited strikes on mainland China. One iteration included an increased number of Chinese IRBMs, and one included Japanese prohibition of JSDF offensive action outside of Japanese water or airspace, even after attacks on Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operational Outcomes:&lt;/strong&gt; The results of the pessimistic scenarios were significantly better for China than the base scenarios. Nevertheless, none resulted in a clear Chinese success (i.e., a Chinese occupation of Taipei or even more than a quarter of the island). Three of the 18 iterations resulted in a clear and decisive Chinese defeat, and the remainder had not produced decisive results at end of play, some 14 to 35 days into the campaign. Of those 13 cases of stalemate, 3 were judged to end “stalemate, trending toward China,” 7 were judged to end “stalemate, trending against China,” and 2 were “stalemate, indeterminate.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jd77msD.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5: Operational Results: Average and Range by Scenario Type.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS tabulation of iteration results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In stalemates judged to be trending toward China, the PLA controlled (or were soon to complete occupation of) Kaoshiung, Tainan, and much of the southern third of the island. In those cases, areas under Chinese control included several ports and airports; the United States had to devote many airstrikes against these facilities, while the Chinese raced to repair them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had the stalemated iterations been continued, the result would have been decided by the relative ability of the two sides to supply themselves from existing stocks or from new shipments to the island. For Taiwan, the United States, and its partners, this would have required running convoys to the island under air and missile attack. In China’s case, it would have required repairing logistical infrastructure while under air and missile attack. The United States was attempting to flow whatever tactical aircraft remained into the theater, while the PLA had used all of its ground-launched conventional ballistic missiles and had only a third of the long-range cruise missile inventory remaining to counter these final U.S. squadrons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more pessimistic assumptions used in a scenario, the worse the outcome for the United States The three iterations run with only one pessimistic assumption (the “no maritime strike JASSM” excursion case) produced one decisive Chinese defeat and two that were trending against China. Those scenarios with additional pessimistic assumptions produced a wider range of results — with an average result significantly worse for the United States and its partners than the three more moderately pessimistic scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all the pessimistic iterations, the PLA was able to land an average of 60 battalions. The final strength of PLA forces ashore, after losses, averaged 43 battalions, or 43,000 combat soldiers and accompanying support personnel. At the end of game play, the PLA controlled an average of 6,240 km2 (or 17 percent) of Taiwan’s 36,000 km2, though, as noted, there was considerable variation between games. Finally, it should be noted that the games lasted an average of six turns (or 21 days of campaign time). Although the result was often clear at that point, getting to final resolution would require many additional weeks of combat. In the case of stalemate, the war might have continued for many months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Losses:&lt;/strong&gt; Losses in the pessimistic scenarios (i.e., those more favorable to China) were again heavy, with average air and ground force losses higher for the United States, Japan, and China than in the base scenario and ship losses that were roughly comparable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6A4MQfC.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 6: U.S., Japanese, and Chinese Air and Naval Losses, Pessimistic Case Scenario.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS tabulation of iteration results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States lost an average of 484 aircraft, roughly 70 percent higher than in the base iterations, with the Air Force losing almost twice as many as it did in the base iterations. Greater U.S. air losses were primarily a function of campaigns that were generally longer than the relatively quick Chinese defeats experienced in the base scenario iterations. The longer time horizons allowed the United States to bring more aircraft into theater — and to lose a significant portion of them on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, with the “no maritime strike JASSM” assumption in effect, the United States relied relatively more on tactical aircraft to launch shorter-range munitions (JSMs and Joint Standoff Weapons, or JSOWs) against the Chinese fleet. This resulted in additional losses in the air as well as higher incentives for the Chinese to seek their destruction on the ground — often entirely exhausting the Chinese inventory of air- and ground-launched standoff missiles in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. air losses varied greatly from game to game, from a low of 90 to a high of 774 in these iterations. Variation was primarily a function of U.S. strategy, with some particularly aggressive teams bringing in reinforcements as quickly as possible, basing them close to Taiwan, and losing them in enormous numbers; other teams took a more cautious approach. Japanese losses averaged a third higher than in the base scenario iterations and were relatively consistent across iterations. China struck bases in Japan in every one of the pessimistic iterations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China lost an average of 327 aircraft per iteration, ranging from a low of 48 to a high of 826. These air losses were roughly twice as high as in the base scenario. In half of the iterations, the U.S. team attacked Chinese air bases with JASSM-ERs. These attacks destroyed between 66 and 748 aircraft, depending on the extent, scale, and target of attacks. Losses in the air were fewer than ground losses but similarly varied according to whether the U.S. team challenged the Chinese CAP over Taiwan and how aggressively the Chinese team sought to extend air operations beyond Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ship losses for the United States and Japan were similar to the base scenario. The pessimistic scenarios often provided fewer naval reinforcements during the first several weeks of the conflict. The greater surviving Chinese capabilities tended to make the U.S./Japanese player more cautious with the use of surface forces. Any surface ship that approached Taiwan was destroyed in both scenarios, and the remainder were often not a high priority for China since they posed only a limited threat to the Chinese operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese naval losses (120 ships) were 14 percent lower than in the base scenario, despite iterations that often lasted more than twice as long. Several of the assumptions in these scenarios, particularly the lack of open-ocean maritime capability for the JASSM-ER and slower or reduced U.S. reinforcements, pushed the U.S. teams to concepts of operation that required more time to bring to fruition. Nevertheless, Chinese ship losses were severe. In most of those cases where the amphibious fleet had not been destroyed outright by the end of the iteration, picket ships east of Taiwan were sufficiently attrited that the final destruction of the amphibious fleet would have occurred within days or a week thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Losses from ground combat — an average of 17,000 PLA casualties and 22,000 Taiwanese — were significantly higher in pessimistic scenarios than in the base scenario because more Chinese units got onto Taiwan and could fight more intensively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critical Variables: Some variables had greater impacts than others. As mentioned above, the “no maritime strike JASSM” excursion case was especially difficult for the United States. In all scenarios, the clearest, fastest, and most direct way to defeat the invasion is to attack the amphibious fleet off Taiwan using standoff munitions. Without JASSM-ER’s anti-ship capability, the ability of the United States to pursue this strategy is limited by a shortage of appropriate missiles. However, even without the ability to attack ships at sea, the JASSM-ER can contribute to defeating invasion. In the pessimistic scenarios, U.S. teams used the JASSM-ER to attack Chinese air bases and ports. The former can attrite Chinese combat aircraft and disrupt Chinese air support for operations on Taiwan, while the latter can disrupt the loading of amphibious ships or destroy them at the pier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when the U.S. rules of engagement prohibit strikes on China’s mainland, perhaps because of concerns over escalation, the assumption about the JASSM’s lack of open-ocean anti-ship capability becomes more consequential. The missile still has a role, but a much-circumscribed role. The JASSM can be used to attack captured ports and air bases on Taiwan to prevent their use by the PLA. It can also be used for strikes against Chinese ground forces on Taiwan, though it is not well suited for that role because of its unitary warhead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another impactful excursion case was delayed U.S. mobilization until D-Day. In scenarios wherein the United States only begins mobilization after the start of the war and does not engage in combat operations until after the first week, China’s amphibious fleet suffered less early attrition and was, therefore, able to get far more forces ashore, putting China in a better position to make rapid gains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second condition with a large impact was diminished Taiwanese ground force effectiveness and, especially, diminished reaction speed. Under conditions in which Taiwan was delayed in transferring forces from one army area to another, China was better able to make gains on the ground and consolidate its position. That was especially significant when China made its primary landing in the southern Taiwan, where the defending forces are relatively sparse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, two conditions produced a larger impact when incorporated into the scenario together than they did separately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;optimistic-scenarios&quot;&gt;Optimistic Scenarios&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The base case assumptions could just as plausibly prove incorrect in ways that might advantage the United States and its coalition. Running iterations with optimistic assumptions illustrated under what circumstances U.S., Japanese, and Taiwanese losses might be lower than the base scenario. Two such iterations were conducted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design:&lt;/strong&gt; One of the iterations run with optimistic assumptions incorporated four optimistic assumptions, including expanded U.S. access to dual-use facilities in Japan, Chinese missile holdbacks, reduced ship defense effectiveness, and a resilient force posture on Turn 1 (i.e., no bombers on Guam or aircraft carriers forward of Guam). The second iteration incorporated seven optimistic assumptions, including: additional HASs, expanded access to Japanese dual-use facilities, Japanese authorization to use force from Turn 1, lower Chinese amphibious operational competence, superior U.S. fifth-generation aircraft, superior U.S. pilot training, and less effective ship defenses for all combatants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operational Outcomes:&lt;/strong&gt; Both optimistic iterations produced decisive Chinese defeats (or U.S., Taiwanese, and Japanese victories). The Chinese fleet was heavily damaged in the first three days and was unable to land more than three amphibious brigades ashore during the critical first three days, supplemented by one to two brigades of airborne and air assault forces. Follow-on waves consisted of individual battalions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/2LYJv0P.png&quot; alt=&quot;image12&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 6: Operational Results: Average and Range by Scenario Type.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS tabulation of iteration results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On average, the PLA was able to land a total of 25 battalions, with a final strength of 22 battalions after losses. The force was unable to gain more than a small foothold ashore, amounting to less than a single game hex (780 km2). With the amphibious fleet effectively destroyed after the first two turns, the game was declared finished, though some combat might have sputtered along for a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although escalation decisions were not part of the game, participants in the optimistic scenarios suggested that escalation might have been least likely in these scenarios since defeat was quick and there were relatively few forces ashore to rescue or support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/qGecbMA.png&quot; alt=&quot;image13&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 7: PLA Situation Ashore at End of Game Play, Optimistic Case Average.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS tabulation of iteration results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Losses:&lt;/strong&gt; Due to the brevity of combat operations, the optimistic scenarios produced lower losses for all combatants than other scenarios. Nevertheless, losses to the Chinese fleet were crippling, and China was still able to inflict significant losses on coalition air and naval forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/QKViIt9.png&quot; alt=&quot;image14&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 8: U.S., Japanese, and Chinese Air and Naval Losses, Optimistic Case Scenarios.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS tabulation of iteration results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All Chinese amphibious ships at sea and most of the picket force were sunk. Missiles from shore batteries on Taiwan, U.S. submarines, bombers, and tactical aircraft all contributed to these sinkings. The excursion case of reduced ship-based defenses greatly accelerated the rate at which Chinese ships were sunk. With Chinese forces ashore not posing a pressing threat to Taiwanese cities or ports, the United States did not feel pressured to attack Chinese aircraft on the mainland: the relatively light Chinese aircraft losses were therefore mostly due to ground fire over Taiwan itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The China team, confronted with the prospect of extremely high and rapid losses to its amphibious fleet, sought to mitigate those losses by attacking air bases in Japan and Guam from the first days of the conflict. Despite the brevity of the campaign, China exhausted all of its long-range missile inventories against those targets, destroying many of the aircraft in Japan. However, because the United States did not have the time to flow as many aircraft into theater as in other scenarios, there were fewer aircraft for China to destroy. US air losses were only 74 percent of what they were in the base scenario and 54 percent what they were in the pessimistic scenarios. Japanese air losses were 80 percent and 70 percent of the base and pessimistic cases, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With limited ground combat, casualties to ground forces on Taiwan were similarly light. On the Chinese side, these amounted to 3 battalions rendered combat ineffective, with perhaps 3,000 Chinese casualties (including 1,000 fatalities). Casualties on the Taiwanese side were roughly twice as high, many of which were caused by Chinese aircraft conducting ground support operations. Barring a ceasefire to allow the evacuation of stranded Chinese soldiers, roughly 24,000 Chinese soldiers associated with units ashore would have been taken prisoner, in addition to the survivors from sunken ships who might have been taken prisoner after swimming to shore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critical Variables:&lt;/strong&gt; To the extent that Chinese losses were lighter in this set of scenarios than in others, the outcome was a function of the shorter scenario combined with U.S. and partner priorities that were affected by the conditions of the scenario, as described above. If no off-ramp to peace were found, Chinese naval and air losses would continue to climb (in the former case limited by the size of the fleet and in the latter probably more dramatically as the United States turned its attention to attacking aircraft).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three factors significantly reduced U.S. losses in both iterations: dispersion across more locations (including civilian airports), reduced missile coverage on the part of China (due to missile holdouts and less-well-optimized warheads), and early attacks on Japanese air bases. The latter was motivated by the increased danger to the Chinese fleet posed by tactical aircraft and resulted in fewer aircraft being at the bases when attacked since fewer reinforcements had flowed in from other U.S. bases around the world. Additionally, the building of new HASs reduced aircraft losses in one of the iterations, while not placing bombers in Guam or aircraft carriers forward deployed reduced aircraft losses in the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two optimistic assumptions had little impact: superior U.S. pilot training and superior fifth-generation aircraft. There was little air-to-air combat in the optimistic scenarios, largely because of the employment of long-range standoff munitions. Had a mix of pessimistic and optimistic assumptions been in play, it is possible that superiority of U.S. air-to-air combat capability might have been more significant. However, it probably would not have factored among the most important variables due to most U.S. air losses occurring on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;taiwan-stands-alone&quot;&gt;Taiwan Stands Alone&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design:&lt;/strong&gt; The “Taiwan stands alone” scenario was designed to examine how Taiwan might fare with no direct material assistance from the United States. This provides a baseline against which to measure the U.S. and partner contribution to the defense of Taiwan. The project team conducted one iteration of this scenario. Because the United States remained on the sidelines, the assumption was that no other country would intervene because the risks would be too high for any second-tier power. None of the excursion cases run in the other scenarios were incorporated into this scenario, but this scenario did have two unique assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Taiwan’s operations would be weakened by a long-term shortage in ammunition. The scenario assumed that after two months of operations, ammunition shortages would force Taiwan to fire half as frequently, with a corresponding reduction in effectiveness. After three months, ammunition exhaustion forces artillery crews to be reformed into infantry units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, China would need to withhold some aircraft to deter U.S. and Japanese intervention, even if that intervention was ultimately not forthcoming. This had the effect of limiting the number of aircraft supporting Chinese ground forces on Taiwan. After withholding squadrons for deterrence, China was left with 14 squadrons for ground support, with 6 additional squadrons to replace losses as they occurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Xi3bdw0.png&quot; alt=&quot;image15&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 7: Operational Results: Average and Range by Scenario Type.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS tabulation of iteration results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operational Outcomes:&lt;/strong&gt; The “Taiwan stands alone” scenario resulted in a PLA victory. The outcome was never in doubt, with the PLA making slow but steady progress throughout the operation. PLA commanders landed forces in the south, took Tainan and Gaoshiung after three weeks, and occupied Taichung (halfway up the coast) by the end of the sixth week. Frustrated with slow progress up the west side of the island and with ground forces to spare, PLA commanders then opened a second front at Hualian. PLA armor occupied the president’s palace in Taipei after 10 weeks. In the actual event of a Chinese invasion without third-party intervention, the Taiwanese government might capitulate before the bitter end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the iteration, Taiwan’s commander flowed forces to meet the attack and defended successive river lines. To dislodge those positions, China brought up heavy armor, engineering support, and artillery. However, transporting these units to the island required substantial time. To dislodge particularly stubborn positions, the PLA also dispatched light infantry forces to work around the flanks in the foothills of Taiwan’s steep mountains. Once defenses were broken or flanks were turned, Taiwanese forces retreated to the next river line and continued the fight. A close parallel to the scenario is the Allied campaign in Italy in World War II, where the Germans withdrew slowly, defending each river and mountain ridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the two-and-a-half-month campaign, the PLA landed a total of 230 battalions on Taiwan. Despite Taiwanese shore-based ASCMs, the amphibious fleet remained viable throughout the campaign. PLA commanders were able to transport the engineers necessary to repair damage to ports and airports as they were captured. When Taipei fell, 165 Chinese battalions were on the island (another 65 battalions having been rendered combat ineffective). This force was more than four times the number present at the end of the base scenario iterations involving U.S. intervention. Including personnel not associated with combat battalions, this force might number 300,000, a number comparable to the invasion force considered for Operation Causeway, the planned U.S. 1945 invasion of Taiwan that was never launched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/MDPEkTV.png&quot; alt=&quot;image16&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 9: PLA Situation Ashore at End of Game Play, “Taiwan Stands Alone”.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS tabulation of iteration results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the results are sobering, the campaign was also enlightening in other ways. If Taiwanese forces are willing to fight, Chinese forces would require a prolonged period of combat before occupying Taiwan’s major cities. This buys time for a delayed U.S. intervention or international diplomacy. Regardless, the results show how much damage resilient Taiwanese armed forces can inflict. Increasing their lethality and survivability would also likely enhance deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Losses:&lt;/strong&gt; Casualties were high in this campaign because of the protracted and intensive nature of ground combat. However, the composition of losses was very different from other scenarios. PLA ground forces suffered roughly 70,000 casualties in ground combat, including 23,100 killed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the first 10 days of combat, Taiwanese anti-ship shore batteries sank 17 amphibious ships and the same number of escort ships (roughly 16 percent of PLA totals in both categories) before being destroyed or running out of missiles. With Taiwan’s navy having been defeated by missile, air, submarine, and surface attack, and the surviving elements of Taiwan’s air force struggling to survive, no additional losses were inflicted on China’s fleet. However, the PLAAF suffered attrition from ground fire and SAMs throughout the campaign, losing a total of 240 aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with every scenario, Taiwan lost its entire navy. The Taiwanese air force squadrons that survived China’s joint fires strike were eventually destroyed in air-to-air combat. Its army suffered 85,000 casualties, with perhaps 28,000 killed. Casualties amounted to roughly half of its total mobilized army strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ragnarok&quot;&gt;Ragnarok&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design:&lt;/strong&gt; The “Ragnarok” scenario was designed to ascertain what conditions would be necessary for China to be victorious in the face of Taiwanese resistance and U.S. intervention. The need for a special scenario became clear after China failed to secure a total victory in a range of pessimistic scenarios. This scenario should therefore not be taken as a likely future but rather as a tool to illustrate what would be necessary to invalidate the project’s main result (that China is unlikely to succeed if Taiwan resists and the United States intervenes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be victorious, China must negate U.S. airpower, both fighter attack and bombers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. fighter/attack aircraft could not effectively participate in operations if Tokyo remained strictly neutral and did not allow the United States to operate from its bases in Japan. While it is possible to use tankers with aircraft based on Guam, this would (1) be vulnerable on the ground to Chinese ballistic missiles, (2) be vulnerable in the air if tankers were intercepted, and (3) be unable to generate enough sorties over Taiwan to significantly affect the battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, China would need to negate U.S. bombers. This is hard to do because bombers can be based beyond the range of most Chinese ground-attack missiles, approach the theater from several angles, and launch standoff missiles beyond the range of defending SAMs. If China attempted to interdict U.S. bombers with its surface ships, then the United States could attrite these ships down until it had created a path to the amphibious fleet (not unlike most other scenarios, wherein the United States must attrite the pickets east of Taiwan). An extreme-range SAM would be limited by the curvature of the Earth and therefore be unable to intercept U.S. bombers before they fired their missiles. However, without U.S. fighters based in Japan for escorts, U.S. bombers would be vulnerable to Chinese fighters armed with extreme-range air-to-air missiles. Alternatively, if China either did not have these missiles or could not complete a kill chain with them, the United States could negate its own bombers by failing to procure sufficient long-range, air-launched ASCMs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operational Outcomes:&lt;/strong&gt; As expected, Ragnarok ended in a PLA victory. Without having to worry about U.S. forces in Japan, the PLA was able to focus its land-attack missiles on Guam, negating it as a base. Despite the absence of U.S. bombers, the Chinese amphibious fleet still took a large number of casualties from ASCMs on Taiwan and U.S. SSNs infiltrating into the straits. By the time these attackers were out of ammunition or attrited, they had reduced the amphibious fleet to one-third of its beginning strength. However, the absence of U.S. fighter/attack aircraft allowed the Chinese to focus their aircraft on supporting the ground invasion. This allowed the PLA to make steady progress ashore and eventually compensate for destroyed amphibious ships with captured ports and airports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last serious challenge to the invasion came from an unsuccessful attack by the massed U.S. fleet. After three weeks of conflict, a U.S. fleet of 29 cruisers and destroyers, two carriers, and 10 SSNs approached Taiwan. Under withering fire from Chinese submarines, air-launched ASCMs, and surface ships, the US fleet was largely destroyed without relieving Taiwan. At this point, the game was called.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Losses:&lt;/strong&gt; Casualties in this scenario were very different from other scenarios. The only U.S. aircraft that were destroyed were either on Guam initially or flew from carriers. The reliance on SSNs meant that 10 SSNs were lost even before the climactic naval showdown. In total, the United States lost four carriers, 43 cruisers and destroyers, and 15 SSNs. If Taiwan continued to fight to the end, their casualties would be similar to those in the “Taiwan stands alone” scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critical Variables:&lt;/strong&gt; This scenario demonstrated the centrality of two variables: basing in Japan and the ability of the United States to deliver ASCMs en masse. Without the ability of U.S. aircraft to operate out of Japan, the PLAAF can concentrate against targets in Taiwan while the PLA delivers more troops ashore. While U.S. bombers could hypothetically still deliver a decisive amount of ordnance, the outcome would rest on their effectiveness. This could be neutralized either by PLA advances in anti-air missiles or by insufficient stockpiles of standoff anti-ship missiles. Without U.S. airpower, Taiwanese ground-launched ASCMs and U.S. SSNs are insufficient to defeat a Chinese invasion; furthermore, the vulnerability of surface ships prevents the U.S. surface fleet from being effective. While it must be emphasized that this was an unlikely scenario, it is analytically helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the excursion assumptions noted in Chapter 4 (“Assumptions and Excursions”) were included in some subset of the scenarios. Based on outcomes and analysis of game play, it is apparent that some of these had a larger impact than others (see Figure 8 below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among those that worked to China’s advantage, two had a particularly pronounced impact. First was “Taiwan stands alone,” in which Taiwan had no support from the United States or other allies and fell to China’s inexorable advance. Second was “Japan neutral,” in which Japan does not permit U.S. basing, limiting U.S. operations to those that could be sustained from Guam, Hawaii, Alaska, or at-sea naval forces. Three others had significant and notable effects. The “U.S. combat starts D plus 14” excursion case saw late intervention by the United States and allowed China to establish more forces ashore before suffering major attrition to its amphibious fleet. The “no maritime strike JASSM” excursion case slowed attrition of the Chinese fleet. The “Taiwanese forces paralyzed to D plus 4” excursion case prevented Taiwan from rapidly reinforcing the beachhead and enabled Chinese forces ashore to expand the beachhead during the first days after landing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among those excursion assumptions that favored the United States and its partners, two were particularly important in affecting operational outcomes. First, the “ship defenses poor” excursion case resulted in the rapid sinking of amphibious ships and their escorts and further diminished China’s prospects. Second, the “reduced PLA amphibious competence” excursion case similarly diminished the already limited number of troops that China can land on beaches during a given period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two excursion cases diminished U.S. losses during the campaign while maintaining Taiwanese autonomy. The “U.S., Japan can use large Japanese airports” excursion case permits the dispersion of U.S. and Japanese aircraft over more facilities and reduces the impact of Chinese missile attacks against allied airpower. The “no U.S. show of force” excursion case allows the U.S. team to start its carriers, bombers, and tankers outside of China’s primary threat rings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 8 summarizes in graphic form the impact of changing assumptions. The direction of arrows indicates whether the change benefits the Chinese invasion (to the left) or the Taiwanese defense (to the right). The significance of the assumption is denoted by the length of the arrow and its color.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The base scenario produced relatively rapid and clear Chinese defeat, a result produced largely by the ability of U.S., Taiwanese, and Japanese anti-ship missiles to destroy the Chinese amphibius fleet before the PLA forces ashore can capture ports and airports to increase the force flow across the strait. Optimistic scenarios (favoring the United States and its partners) produced the same results but more quickly and with lower casualties. Pessimistic scenarios (favoring China) produced more protracted fighting and a wider range of operational outcomes, ranging from decisive Chinese defeat to stalemates in which China controlled damaged ports and airports. The “Taiwan stands alone” scenario produced inexorable Chinese advance, concluding with the Chinese occupation of the entire island — an unambiguous PLA victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Losses in all iterations were high and sobering for both sides. In all but the “Taiwan stands alone” scenario, China lost the large preponderance of its surface fleet, including amphibious ships, surface combatants, and carriers as well as a portion of its submarine fleet. In most iterations, the U.S. Navy lost two carriers and more than a dozen surface ships as well as four submarines. It was only able to avoid that outcome in optimistic scenarios because the United States did not push its fleet forward as a deterrent signal prior to the start of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air losses varied greatly for both sides. On the U.S. side, they numbered in the hundreds under all scenarios and averaged 283 in the base scenario, 484 in pessimistic scenarios, and 200 in optimistic scenarios. Across all iterations, U.S. aircraft losses ranged from a low of 90 to a high of 774. Japan also lost more than 100 aircraft in most iterations, and Taiwan lost its entire air force. Chinese aircraft losses varied greatly, as the United States only attacked Chinese air bases in iterations run under pessimistic assumptions — and in only half of those. Chinese air losses averaged 161 under the base scenario, 327 under pessimistic assumptions, and 290 under optimistic scenarios. Chinese air losses varied from a low of dozens to a high of 748.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ground losses varied primarily according to the duration of the campaign and the number of forces landed on Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-are-these-results-different-from-classified-dod-games&quot;&gt;Why Are These Results Different from Classified DOD Games?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does this project find that a Chinese invasion of Taiwan would be difficult and fail under most conditions when the purported results of classified wargames indicate much higher chances of Chinese success, as do the intuitive views of many commentators who see the large disparity of forces in the Western Pacific between China and Taiwan?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted in Chapter 2, publicly available information on the results of classified wargames indicates high U.S. casualties and unfavorable outcomes. The amount of information is limited, however, because of the restrictions regarding classified information. Nevertheless, examination of public descriptions of classified wargames and what is known about the conduct of wargames in general allows the project to make informed guesses about why results differ between the classified games and this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Invasions Are Difficult to Model with the Method of Pks:&lt;/strong&gt; Classified models tend to prioritize the method of Pks over the method of history because of the richness of data on individual systems that is available at the classified level. However, this might lead classified wargames to overestimate the quickness at which amphibious invasions would proceed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The task of loading and transporting troops, landing on a hostile shore, building up forces, and then moving inland is inherently difficult. In 1944, the United States considered an invasion of Taiwan as the next step in the Pacific campaign. The move was rejected because of the difficulty. As Ben Jensen, a CSIS expert on wargaming, noted: “Crossing a contested sea only to fight on complex, canalized terrain against a deliberate defense-in-depth makes amphibious assault in Taiwan a more complex operation than even the famed 1944 Operation Overlord — the D-Day landings. Taiwan is a particularly difficult target because it has only about a dozen suitable landing beaches and the terrain inland is highly defensible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another insight comes from the naval author and historian C.S. Forrester in his thought piece “If Hitler Had Invaded England.” In it, he considered how a German invasion of Britain in the summer of 1940 might have played out. Germany faced a problem like that of China — a powerful army facing a contested air and naval environment that made crossing even a narrow strip of water difficult. There was an invasion plan, called Operation Sealion, which the Germans prepared for but ultimately did not execute because it lacked the air and naval supremacy needed. In his counterfactual history, Forrester gives the Germans every advantage. The Germans can land successfully with paratroopers and amphibious forces, but the British response in the air and on the sea throttled sustainment and reinforcement. British army counterattacks defeated the now isolated German troops on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The many successful Allied amphibious operations of World War II made opposed landings look easy. They are not. The allies were successful because of many years spent refining doctrine and building specialized capabilities. Learning steps such as the catastrophic raid on Dieppe in 1943 were part of that learning process. The Chinese will not have those opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Different Purposes:&lt;/strong&gt; As noted in Chapter 2, wargames have different purposes, not all of which are intended to simulate the most likely course of events. For example, some games test concepts and are not intended to represent likely futures. Such a game might assume that Chinese forces land in the Philippines to see whether U.S. forces could use mobility, anti-air capabilities, and anti-ship missiles to contest the invasion. Other games might hypothesize U.S. forces being on islands in the South China Sea or the Philippines and attempting to prevent the breakout of Chinese naval forces from the first island chain. (These are actual scenarios for the game, Littoral Commander: The Indo-Pacific.) These games are useful to test concepts about weapons capabilities and force structure. Because the scenarios are improbable, however, they are not particularly helpful in trying to ascertain the course of future events. To use the Philippines example, it is hard to imagine a set of circumstances where Chinese amphibious forces would land on the main islands of the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many U.S.-China wargames have short time increments, which allows detailed assessment of forces and weapons but means that game play covers only the first few days of a conflict. This is the time of greatest U.S. and partner weakness, after initial Chinese attacks but before substantial reinforcements begin to flow. Thus, results can give a skewed sense of what the whole campaign might look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Related to the notion of testing concepts is the notion that wargames can be designed to “stress test” for potential weaknesses in new operational concepts. David Ochmanek, a senior analyst at RAND and experienced wargamer, noted this purpose: “Even the games that the United States loses are not necessarily reflective of how a war would unfold in real life; the main purpose is to evaluate American vulnerabilities. We learn a lot from these.” This is a reasonable approach when evaluating risk or exploring policy boundaries. However, the results of particularly pessimistic scenarios do not constitute the most likely results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many games are intended primarily to educate the players. Game designers often want to challenge the players and counteract complacency. This is a reasonable approach for educating an officer corps about what future conflict might entail, especially since the officer corps has been accustomed to having military superiority for generations. However, the outcomes of these games do not necessarily represent a full spectrum of possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adjudication by Judgment vs. Analysis:&lt;/strong&gt; Another difference might be the adjudication mechanism. Many classified wargames are conducted as seminars, where two sides discuss a scenario and a “white team” adjudicates the results of moves by the two teams. Results, therefore, are heavily dependent on the personal perspectives of the white team members. To combat this source of possible bias, the project developed explicit adjudication mechanisms based on historical experience. (This is described in detail in Chapter 2.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asymmetric Assumptions about Capabilities:&lt;/strong&gt; Another possibility is attributing a high level of capabilities and abilities to the Chinese while decrementing U.S. capabilities because of known limitations. This might be done as a hedging mechanism to avoid underestimating a potential adversary. Some analyses, reflected in the fictional speculation of 2034 and Ghost Fleet, hypothesize powerful and previously unknown Chinese capabilities, such as cyber in one case and space weapons in the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attribution of high capabilities to adversaries has a long history. A classic example occurred before the Persian Gulf War of 1991. There was an intensive period of wargaming prior to the war, with the gaming of scenarios related to an attack on Kuwait occurring more than a year before the actual attack and the first planning scenarios for the counterattack commencing the same day as the Iraqi invasion. Gaming was also used to develop several aspects of the final operations plan. However, results depended heavily on whether Iraq’s military was viewed as “war hardened” or “war weary” as a result of its recently concluded eight-year war with Iran. A war-hardened military would fight fiercely and skillfully. Comparison was often made to the North Vietnamese. A war-weary military might collapse quickly. Modeling took Iraqi forces at face value. This was a reasonable hedge, but models produced predictions for U.S. casualties several orders of magnitude higher than the actual casualty figures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 provides a more recent example. At the beginning of the conflict, many commentators suggested that the campaign would result in a decisive Russian victory. This analysis was founded on the perceived increase in military effectiveness following what was purported to be an extensive modernization of the Russian military. However, this modernization did not translate to battlefield effectiveness, with warfighting shortcomings becoming apparent following the invasion, new systems not performing as assessed, and forces not fighting as expected. There was an expectation of technical and tactical competency built into assessments that have not been in evidence following the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deception:&lt;/strong&gt; During the Soviet period, the United States routinely overestimated Soviet strategic nuclear capabilities. This occurred in part because the Soviets were actively trying to deceive Western intelligence agencies and in part because of Western concerns about avoiding complacency and surprise. Thus, the United States hypothesized a “bomber gap” when the Soviets flew the same bombers repeatedly over reviewing stands during a May Day celebration, thus giving the impression of having more long-range strike aircraft than they in fact had. Looking back on this incident, John Pardos concluded in his study of U.S. intelligence estimates of the Soviet strategic forces, “where organizational interests impinge or turn upon certain conclusions, objective analysis of intelligence is likely to suffer.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-does-the-war-play-out&quot;&gt;How Does the War Play Out?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter lays out the broad features of the conflict, as it played out over the 24 game iterations. It also discusses some of the strategies pursued before moving, in Chapter 7, to the conclusions and recommendations derived from the course of these games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-situation-on-taiwan&quot;&gt;The Situation on Taiwan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the conflict starts, Chinese air and naval units surrounded the island. The resulting Chinese defensive zone was so dense that no cargo ships could get through, and the danger to airlift aircraft was extreme. In one iteration, an attempt to insert a U.S. Army brigade onto Taiwan by air resulted in two of the three battalions (roughly 2,000 soldiers) being destroyed in the air. The U.S. Maritime Prepositioning Ships (MPS) squadron, which is designed to rapidly deploy large ground formations, could not get through. Taiwan as isolated. The United States could not move any significant forces onto Taiwan within the month that the game covers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese were always able to get troops onto Taiwan. The Taiwan Strait is so narrow, the Chinese forces so numerous, and Taiwanese defenses so limited that defeating the invasion at sea was not possible. The Chinese challenge is sustaining the forces landed on the island while bringing in new forces before the Taiwanese can contain the beachhead and counterattack in strength. The steady attrition inflicted by U.S. attacks on China’s amphibious shipping imposes a time constraint on the Chinese invasion. However, once China captures an operational port or airfield, it can use civilian merchant ships and cargo planes to supply its invasion, easing demands on the amphibious fleet. The central question is whether Chinese forces can capture airfields and ports — and keep them operating — before U.S., Japanese, and Taiwanese attacks sink their amphibious ships. In the base scenario and most others, this was not achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese supplemented the beach assault with airborne forces. When these attempted to seize airfields, they generally failed because of the weak combat power that airborne forces possess. This record is consistent with the mixed results of German attempts to employ airborne troops in seizing airfields during the invasion of Crete and Russians in Hostomel. When airborne forces attempted to isolate the battle area, they were more successful and assisted Chinese amphibious forces in establishing a significant beachhead ashore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With limited ability to land substantial firepower during the early days of conflict, China’s ability to advance off the beaches and establish a larger lodgment depended heavily on airpower. One role was to provide close air support to attacking forces. More important was the interdiction role, destroying bridges and overpasses that might be used by Taiwanese reinforcements moving to reinforce defenses around the beachhead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The central question is whether Chinese forces can capture airfields and ports — and keep them operating — before U.S., Japanese, and Taiwanese attacks sink their amphibious ships. In the base scenario and most others, this was not achieved.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. airpower, for its part, had a limited ability to influence ground combat directly. China’s naval and air forces restricted U.S. strikes to standoff weapons, such as the JASSM-ER. Their unitary warheads were effective against ports and airfields but not against troops in the field because of their dispersion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese players considered attacking the northern part of the island where Taipei, the capital, is located. In this, they sought to replay Germany’s amphibious and airborne assault on Norway’s capital of Oslo in 1940 or Russia’s attack on Kyiv in 2022. However, the Chinese players were generally dissuaded by the strength of defending Taiwanese forces deployed in the north around Taipei. About 46 percent of Taiwan’s total battalions are in the northern third of the island, including half of Taiwan’s mechanized forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, in 21 of 24 iterations, the Chinese invasion force landed in the south, where Taiwanese defenses were lighter. This made it easier to get ashore and establish a beachhead or airhead but meant that the Chinese forces had to fight their way up the entire island to capture the capital and achieve a decisive result. The nature of the terrain is not, however, propitious for such an advance. The central parts of Taiwan are mountainous and difficult to traverse. The coastal plains are narrow, with rivers and cities that provide good defensive positions. Even capturing the large southern city of Kaohsiung was often a difficult and time-consuming task. Nevertheless, the southern landings met with greater success than did the few attempts at direct attack on the north. Interestingly, when U.S. planners considered invading Taiwan in 1944, they also planned to land in the south.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In 21 of 24 iterations, the Chinese invasion force landed in the south, where Taiwanese defenses were lighter.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, this campaign would not be a close parallel to that confronting German commanders at Normandy on the so-called “longest day.” Then, Field Marshal Erwin Rommel believed that the coming Allied invasion of France had to be defeated on the beaches during the first 24 hours. If the invasion became established ashore, Allied air and naval power could sustain it. In 1944, that proved correct, but it does not apply to the challenge facing Taiwan today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Chinese invasion of Taiwan would be different because the Chinese invasion fleet, though numerous, is not nearly as large as the fleet that supported the D-Day invasion. For that operation, the Allies had 229 amphibious ships (LSTs) and 345 troop ships and cargo ships for a total of 547 ships, serviced by more than 3,000 smaller landing craft (LCIs, LCMs, LCTs, and LCVs). The anticipated Chinese amphibious fleet of 2026 includes 28 LSTs, 18 LHD/LPDs, 20 LSMs, and 30 large civilian RO-ROs, for a total of 96 ships, serviced by 305 landing craft. At Normandy, the Allies put 90,000 troops ashore on the first day, whereas the Chinese can put about 8,000 ashore on D-day/Taiwan (or 16,000 in 3.5 days). Thus, Chinese capabilities are much less than Allied capabilities on D-Day, and a successful initial lodgment does not guarantee eventual success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, Allied forces had a virtual air and naval monopoly in 1944. The Luftwaffe had been diverted to operations over the homeland and in the east. The U-boat fleet, the only significant remaining German naval force, could not penetrate Allied screens. The Allies could build up forces ashore without serious opposition. If Taiwan faced China alone, the Chinese would have the same air and naval dominance. U.S. participation means that the airspace and seas around Taiwan would be vigorously contested, and the proliferation of long-range precision strike assets means that U.S. airpower could inflict steady losses on the Chinese fleet from long distances. Thus, establishing a beachhead is not enough to ensure a Chinese victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In World War II, the Japanese faced this same choice: defend on the beach or inland. Initially, they tried to defeat amphibious assaults on the beaches but found that impossible. They then shifted to a defense in depth, forcing the invader to take heavy casualties by attacking prepared fortifications inland. Thus, the capture of Iwo Jima and Okinawa involved prolonged and bloody campaigns ashore. For Taiwan, a prolonged campaign would allow time for U.S. intervention or a diplomatic solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In three iterations, the Chinese captured the island of Penghu off the west coast of Taiwan, planning to use the island as a staging base for an attack on the main island. Although they defeated Taiwanese forces there, their dwindling amphibious capabilities prevented a successful invasion of the main island. Thus, occupying Penghu during a campaign to invade Taiwan proper was an operational dead end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project did not examine whether capturing Penghu would succeed as a limited attack for intimidation and bargaining or as part of a longer-term strategy in which Penghu was used as a base of operations to stage forces for an attack on mainland Taiwan several years later. Penghu is politically important because, unlike the other offshore islands closer to the Chinese coast, it was explicitly included in the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty between the United States and Republic of China (Taiwan). The islands were also included in the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979. Thus, the fallout from a limited Chinese operation to seize Penghu bears separate investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. and Taiwanese success in frustrating the Chinese invasion is tempered by the extensive damage done to the Taiwanese infrastructure and economy. Almost all Chinese players launched massive interdiction strikes against transportation infrastructure to prevent Taiwanese forces from moving to the beachhead invasion sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/3hV1PgV.png&quot; alt=&quot;image18&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 9: Penghu Province.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another element was the major battles in port cities and around airfields as the Chinese sought to capture a facility to increase the flow of forces and supplies. The Taiwanese player sometimes sabotaged civilian airfields and ports to prevent them from falling into Chinese hands. Indeed, a few players employed a “scorched earth” strategy that preemptively destroyed the most vulnerable ports and airfields. In these cases, the Taiwanese player judged that the existential threat to Taiwan justified such destruction. As a military tactic, it was highly successful. However, because a port or airfield that is unusable for military purposes is also unusable for civilian purposes, this strategy did immense damage to the transportation hubs on which the Taiwanese economy depends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The U.S. and Taiwanese success in frustrating the Chinese invasion is tempered by the extensive damage done to the Taiwanese infrastructure and economy.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The battles for cities near invasion beaches would inevitably cause heavy damage and loss of life in residential or commercial areas. Several players also argued that destroying Taiwanese industry and infrastructure would disrupt global supply chains and have effects far beyond the region. Taiwanese manufacturers account for 61 percent of global revenue in semiconductor manufacturing for 16-nm or smaller chips, and it is even more dominant in the manufacturing of the most advanced semiconductors. As a result, every nation on the planet would feel the effects of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;the-bloody-air-and-maritime-battle&quot;&gt;THE BLOODY AIR AND MARITIME BATTLE&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the wargame’s larger operational map, air and sea missions are plotted over hundreds and often thousands of kilometers. Despite the distances involved, proximity matters, especially when persistence around the battle area is required. For example, U.S. bases on Okinawa are the closest U.S. bases to Taiwan, and air units flying air superiority missions from Okinawa can remain “on station” around Taiwan for longer periods of time than aircraft flying from more distant bases. However, proximity puts assets deep inside adversary threat rings and increases vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reduce exposure, players often exploited the full range of their systems. They launched air strikes, which require less persistence than air superiority missions, from extreme ranges. U.S. aircraft sortied from bases in northern Japan or even Guam and, with the assistance of tankers, struck targets in the Taiwan Strait or on mainland China. China, for its part, husbanded bombers in its inland bases and launched strikes from those deep bastions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the geographic scope of the “outer” air and naval battle, these operations nevertheless had a strategic center, revolving around the centrality of tasks on or near Taiwan. The focus of most teams remained squarely on the primary tasks at hand. For U.S. teams, this was the destruction of China’s amphibious fleet, without which China cannot achieve victory. For China, this involved protecting the amphibious fleet, landing as many troops ashore as possible and supporting them, to the maximum extent possible, with airpower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opposing Strategies to Attack and Defend the Invasion Fleet:&lt;/strong&gt; China’s success or failure hinges largely on its ability to defend the amphibious fleet long enough to achieve its objectives ashore. Much of the maritime and air battle therefore revolves around the U.S. effort to sink that fleet, and China’s effort to defend it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. and partner forces have many potent assets they can bring to bear in this fight. Taiwan’s ground-based anti-ship missiles can engage from the outset and impose modest attrition on the fleet until those that are not destroyed by Chinese air and missile strikes are expended, which generally occurs in the second week of the conflict. Submarines are inherently stealthy and can also reliably inflict attrition on the Chinese fleet. However, submarines carry a limited number of munitions, so while they can impose steady attrition, submarines must periodically return to port to rearm, and their effect therefore plays out over an extended period of time. Given the high carrying capacity and rapid rearm times of aircraft, bombers and fighters equipped with long-range anti-ship missiles provide the most potent threat to Chinese shipping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, Chinese players adopted a two-pronged strategy to blunt these attacks. Defensively, the Chinese teams established a layered presence between the amphibious fleet and threats to it. They deployed some SAGs around the immediate perimeter of the amphibious fleet. Most sent SAGs to serve as air- and missile-defense pickets east of Taiwan and, beyond that, dispatched submarines into the Philippine Sea and Western Pacific to intercept and attack U.S. surface fleets. At the same time, Chinese teams employed offensive operations to strike U.S. (and often Japanese) naval forces whenever they could be located, and most teams attacked U.S. air bases throughout Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s more strictly defensive activities followed a predictable path. The Chinese picket forces, when deployed, successfully blunted U.S. attacks on the amphibious fleet for a while. However, in most iterations, the United States eventually overwhelmed the picket force with massive air and missile strikes of their own because the Chinese did not have enough combat aircraft and tankers both to provide CAP for these ships and conduct other high-priority operations (strikes and ground support over Taiwan). The use of the PLAN as a kind of “ablative” armor for the amphibious ships, while effective, resulted in heavy Chinese casualties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the approach outlined above represents a sound Chinese approach, the results were mixed. Chinese submarines inflicted some attrition on U.S. naval forces, though the large expanse to be patrolled, the prevalence of diesel boats in the Chinese fleet, and anti-submarine operations by the United States and Japan generally limited damage. More potent were Chinese long-range missile strikes and massed missiles strikes, which almost always succeeded in overcoming U.S. naval defenses. Typically, the United States lost both forward-deployed carriers within the first turn or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, China’s high-end anti-ship missiles were often exhausted relatively early. If the games had continued for additional weeks, it is likely that subsequent attacks (if they had taken place) would have been less lethal. By then, however, the battle on Taiwan might have been largely decided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China Devastates U.S. Air Bases:&lt;/strong&gt; As noted in previous chapters, the base case assumes that Japan remains neutral but allows U.S. forces to conduct combat operations from U.S. bases in Japan, including from Kadena, Iwakuni, Yokota, and Misawa. These bases are of tremendous value for the United States. Aircraft based in Japan can strike Chinese ships around Taiwan and escort bombers coming from Alaska or Hawaii. Aircraft flying from Kadena or southern Japan can also spend more time over Taiwan conducting air superiority operations and do not need as much aerial refueling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the PLARF has many TBMs and ground-launched cruise missiles (GLCMs) that can range Japan. These highly accurate missiles, many of whose warheads are equipped with submunitions, could blanket all of the military air bases in Japan. The PLAAF’s air-launched cruise missiles (ALCMs) supplement these ground-launched systems. Thus, China can conduct devastating attacks on air bases in Japan, sometimes including the element of surprise, despite the risk that such an attack would draw the JSDF into the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether to attack Japan was a critical decision for the Chinese player. As the chart below shows, the Chinese player usually did so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/tjv0hlF.png&quot; alt=&quot;image19&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 10: Chinese Attacks against Japan.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frequently, the Chinese player did not attack immediately, being cautious about bringing Japan into the conflict and wanting to conserve the large but still finite inventory of missiles until they might have maximum effect. However, as the United States built up forces on Japanese bases and used these as sanctuaries to attack Chinese air and naval forces, the Chinese player then decided to attack. This delayed attack was highly effective, destroying hundreds of massed U.S. and Japanese aircraft on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Chinese players attacked U.S. forces in Japan, they attacked Japanese forces also, destroying many Japanese aircraft and surface ships. Surviving JSDF fought back, despite the initial losses caused by Chinese TBMs. Most valuable were the Japanese submarines, which could strike Chinese amphibious ships and the Chinese picket line around Taiwan. Also valuable were surviving Japanese aircraft and the country’s significant ASW capabilities. JASDF aircraft added to the CAP over Taiwan and strikes on the Chinese amphibious fleet. Japan’s extensive fleet of MPA and its network of undersea sensors played an important role in attriting China’s fleet of submarines. Like the U.S. surface fleet, the Japanese surface fleet had to maintain a cautious distance from Taiwan until the Chinese missile threat eased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In those situations where Japan entered the war, its submarines stayed east or north of Taiwan to avoid fratricide with U.S. submarines. East of Taiwan, JMSDF submarines attacked the Chinese picket line to allow U.S. and Japanese airpower to strike more easily at the amphibious ships; north of Taiwan, they attacked Chinese amphibious ships departing ports outside of the Taiwan Strait. One caution in assessing these results is that these Japanese actions reflect the preferences of U.S. players. They may not reflect the actions of the Japanese government, which might hold substantial forces back for defense of the homeland or put other restrictions on the use of forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategy of attacking Japan worked for China in an operational sense. The benefit of eliminating air bases near Taiwan exceeded the negative effects of having the JSDF join the United States. The results of those games in which China did not attack were poorer for China than those in which it did. This judgment, however, does not consider long-term political and diplomatic costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategies-for-resource-constraints-priorities-and-risk&quot;&gt;Strategies for Resource Constraints, Priorities, and Risk&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final observation about the course of conflict was that both sides often had to make trade-offs and balance risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major area of trade-offs was that both sides wanted to undertake more activities than they had the forces to execute. For example, many China teams discussed placing air patrols east of Taiwan to protect the fleet or even over the Ryukyu Islands to disrupt U.S. and Japanese air strikes. However, the distances involved and the lack of Chinese tankers would have made the missions unwise in view of the other heavy demands on airpower. Most China teams therefore focused the air effort on maintaining air superiority over Taiwan itself and providing air support to ground forces ashore on Taiwan. Chinese players who tried to pursue multiple goals, such as protecting the homeland while invading Taiwan, quickly failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. and Japanese teams were confronted with similar dilemmas. While most saw value in contesting China’s air presence over Taiwan with fighter sweeps and CAP, the top priority was conducting strikes against the amphibious fleet. Periodic Chinese missile against U.S. and Japanese air bases often left the U.S.-Japan alliance with insufficient aircraft to conduct both air superiority operations and strikes simultaneously. In cases where Chinese ground forces took ports and airports, the need to strike and damage those facilities lest they be used to facilitate additional lift heightened the U.S. dilemma. Similar choices confronted players on those infrequent occasions when U.S. players sought to escort transport aircraft into Taiwan, as forming escort groups would reduce commitments to other forms of missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to dilemmas driven by having more tasks than resources, the teams confronted choices about how to balance the risk of suffering unsustainable casualties against the risk of applying insufficient force to achieve objectives. This was especially true of the U.S. team, which begins the conflict on its back foot and in possession of a brittle force posture. Initial Chinese missile strikes destroy much of the U.S. forward-deployed aircraft and naval strength. Although the United States receives a steady stream of air and naval reinforcements, it takes time to build up powerful capabilities in theater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the United States takes a defensive stance until these reinforcements arrive, China can seize ports and airports and establish a secure position on the island. Delay cedes the opportunity to attack Chinese forces before they can build forces ashore on Taiwan. On the other hand, massing forward too aggressively to maximize striking power leads to crippling losses from Chinese missile attacks. The game records suggest that extreme answers to this dilemma are punished. The two iterations in which airpower was thrust forward most aggressively (#12 and #13) resulted in very high U.S. air losses (774 and 750 aircraft, respectively) and stalemated outcomes, while the most cautious strategy (#18) produced lower aircraft losses (392 aircraft) but also failed to produce a favorable operational outcome. Iterations in which players adopted more mixed strategies (#4 and #16) appeared to fare relatively better. This dilemma was most severe in pessimistic scenarios, and all the examples mentioned here are drawn from those cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The teams confronted choices about how to balance the risk of suffering unsustainable casualties against the risk of applying insufficient force to achieve objectives.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Domains Are Important but not Decisive:&lt;/strong&gt; No players used direct-ascent weapons against adversary satellite constellations because of concerns about losing their own capabilities. It was a classic case of mutual deterrence. In counterspace operations, both sides contented themselves with electronic warfare and dazzling. They also launched co-orbital attacks that would only unfold beyond the time scale of a Taiwan operation. While space is a critical warfighting domain, it was relatively static in these scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both sides employed offensive cyber actions, but again without decisive effect. One excursion case explored a delayed Taiwanese reaction to invasion, partially based on posited cyber disruptions. This delay had a serious impact on Taiwan’s ability to contain Chinese forces on their initial beachhead. However, while cyber operations were useful for gaining temporary advantage, they were not by themselves war-winning tools. This is consistent with recent experience in the Ukraine war but not with the more imaginative effects proposed by some advocates and futurists. An important caution is that the game did not explore either of these domains with classified information. These are two domains where classified information might have an impact. A broader and more nuanced set of capabilities in both domains might produce different results, at least at the strategic or national level if not at the operational level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter lays out recommendations arising from analysis of the results and the picture of the war developed above. The purpose is to help policymakers as they consider how the United States should respond to China’s increasing ability to invade Taiwan. Whether the decision is made to defend Taiwan or not, following these recommendations would provide flexibility to decisionmakers. Although these recommendations do not address every aspect of U.S.-China competition (which involves many other factors), these recommendations are worth pursuing because invasion is the most dangerous scenario. Further, many of the recommendations would apply to other scenarios, for example, a blockade of Taiwan or a conflict in the South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These recommendations are organized in three categories: (1) politics and strategy, (2) doctrine and posture, and (3) weapons and platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;politics-and-strategy-1&quot;&gt;Politics and Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the game revolves around military operations, several political and strategic insights emerged with clear policy implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Prioritize deepening diplomatic and military ties with Japan.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to operate from U.S. bases in Japan is so critical to U.S. success that it should be considered a sine qua non for intervention. Without Japanese basing, U.S. fighter/attack aircraft had to come from Andersen Air Force Base on Guam, which was then generally crippled by Chinese missile strikes. This enables China to mass its airpower forward and concentrate on support of ground forces on Taiwan. Furthermore, the non-participation of the JSDF improves the balance of forces in China’s favor. The United States in Japan has had close security ties for 70 years. These linkages need to be maintained and enhanced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several game participants who had experience with the Japanese military recommended closer operational coordination between the U.S. and Japanese military establishments. Although the two militaries conduct many peacetime exercises together, the current interpretation of Japan’s constitution prohibits the establishment of a combined (or joint) command with the United States. Moreover, the lack of a standing joint command within the JSDF and the existence of inconsistent geographic command boundaries among the different Japanese services inhibit effective alliance coordination at the operational level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In researching U.S.-Japanese wartime coordination, it became apparent that there may be a disconnect in the interpretation of bilateral treaties. The Status of Forces Agreement between the United States and Japan refers to a requirement for “consultation” between Japan and the United States, but both it and the original defensive alliance are vague about what this requires. Many Japanese officials interpret this as requiring the United States to obtain permission before flying combat missions from Japanese soil for any purpose other than the defense of Japan. However, U.S. officials tended to view “consultation” as notifying Japan of U.S. intentions. This disconnect must be remedied immediately, lest it leads to delays or disruption of war plans during a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Clarify war plan assumptions.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military planning appears to assume that U.S. forces will be able to deploy onto the sovereign territory of other countries during a crisis. In particular, the Army and Marine Corps seem to assume that the MLRs and Army MDTFs will be pre-positioned in the Philippines, Taiwan, or on forward Japanese islands before conflict begins. This is militarily desirable because it allows the units to get close enough to Chinese naval forces to engage with anti-ship missiles. China’s ability to interdict U.S. force movement after D-Day makes prewar deployments critical to the functioning of many U.S. capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nor would a simple one-time crisis deployment be sufficient. Any U.S. forces on the island would need to have all their logistical sustainment in place before conflict begins because it is so hard to get shipments through once China establishes its defensive zone over the island. This sustainment would need to include hundreds of missiles. A single strike by a squadron of 12 bombers launches over 200 missiles. To be a significant factor in a conflict, forward-deployed ground forces would need to provide comparable levels of missile strikes repeatedly over the course of a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, such permissions for forward deployments en masse do not seem likely. As noted in the chapter on assumptions, most countries in the region (with the exceptions of Australia and Japan) are cool to the idea of becoming involved in a U.S.-China war due to the immense destruction it would cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Taiwan would welcome forward deployments, they would be politically fraught. The base case of this project did not allow such deployments because of current U.S. Taiwan policy, which follows from agreements made with China under the Three Communiqués and has historically prohibited the presence of uniformed U.S. military personnel on Taiwan. As noted in Chapter 4, stationing forces on Taiwan either in peacetime or during a crisis would elicit a strong, possibly even violent reaction from China. Many experts argue that such moves would trigger the conflict it was intended to deter. In 2020, Taiwanese authorities revealed the presence of elements of a rotational training detachment from the Marine Raider Regiment on Taiwan, but the stationing of combat elements would constitute a significant change to established U.S. policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is therefore the potential for a fundamental disconnect between U.S. war plans and political realities. The Army and Marine Corps could assume they can move forward in a crisis to threaten the Chinese fleet, while the State Department might oppose the moves as provocative, and the White House prohibits deployment. The U.S. government needs to reach a clear internal consensus before a crisis occurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is therefore imperative to clarify assumptions about war plans during peacetime and not as the crisis unfolds. The National Security Council would be the natural place to work the issue out because it can integrate perspectives from across the government. Senior civilian decisionmakers do not want to be in the position of Bethmann Hollweg, German chancellor who had to justify Germany violating Belgian neutrality in 1914 because that is what the war plans (over which he had no control) called for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;There is therefore the potential for a fundamental disconnect between U.S. war plans and political realities.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if stationing ground forces on Taiwan is not politically practical, it is important to improve inter-military coordination. This might include creating liaison groups to develop joint procedures, practicing procedures in joint tabletop exercises, expanding Taiwanese participation in U.S. military PME programs, and forming cross-national planning groups to develop concepts for joint defensive operations. All these peacetime activities would smooth wartime operations. Such activities are particularly urgent in the case of Taiwan if the United States believes that conflict is possible in the near or medium term. The United States might also consider pre-positioning equipment and munitions on Taiwan without stationing troops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the United States cannot take too long deciding what to do in a crisis. The longer the United States delays entering the war, the more difficult the fight. Although the United States has enough advantages that it can still prevail in most scenarios, delay means more Chinese forces ashore on Taiwan, higher casualties, and more infrastructure destruction for all parties. Hence, it not only makes the U.S. task more difficult, it may also make off-ramps more difficult to find at the end of conflict. War plans for a Taiwan contingency will have to envision a quick U.S. response; civilian leaders must recognize this need for speed when the time for decision comes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Furthermore, the United States cannot take too long deciding what to do in a crisis. The longer the United States delays entering the war, the more difficult the fight.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recognize the need to continue operations in the face of heavy casualties.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Civilian decisionmakers must recognize that the decision to defend Taiwan during an invasion would result in heavy casualties. If civilian leaders decided to begin the defense, then change their mind after initial casualties, it would incur the worst consequences of intervention and non-intervention: the United States would effectively be at war with China without the benefit of having maintained Taiwan’s autonomy. Again, this project does not argue whether these costs are worth the benefits, but that such an evaluation must be made with open eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A conflict with China would be fundamentally unlike the regional conflicts and counterinsurgencies that the United States has experienced since World War II, with casualties exceeding anything in recent memory. Further, the casualty calculations shown in this report, as high as they are, do not encompass the full scope of the war. They cover only the first three or four weeks of the conflict and exclude casualties arising from the battles in the South China Sea, which the wargame abstracted. Thus, numbers presented here represent a floor, not a ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the game mechanics did not track personnel losses directly, these could be estimated from equipment losses (e.g., ships and aircraft). The level of personnel losses is fortunately relatively low relative to the losses in equipment. Nevertheless, personnel casualties averaged 6,960, of which about 3,200 would be killed in action, in the base case even without adding losses from combat in the South China Sea, which the project did not model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/52Vnd4r.png&quot; alt=&quot;image20&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 11: Total U.S. Personnel Casualties, Killed, and Total (killed, wounded, or missing).&lt;/strong&gt; Note: Calculations of losses excluded two iterations (#5 and #6) because they were so short. Source: CSIS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the United States sustained about three killed per day. At the height of the Vietnam War, in 1968, the United States lost 30 killed per day. The loss rate here, about 140 per day in the base case, approaches that of World War II, 300 killed per day. Deaths (vs. casualties, which includes wounded) in three weeks of combat around Taiwan (about 3,200) are about half the total from 20 years of combat in Iraq and Afghanistan (5,474).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to shocking the U.S. public, the scale of casualties and equipment loss would stagger a U.S. military that has dominated battlefields for a generation. These losses would be particularly difficult for the Air Force and Navy, which have essentially operated in sanctuary since the end of World War II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give an Air Force illustration, late-deploying units to Kadena Air Force Base on Okinawa will land at a base that has entire squadrons of wrecked U.S. and Japanese aircraft bulldozed to the side of the runway, hundreds of wounded in the base hospital, and temporary cemeteries to handle the many dead. Missile attacks and air combat will have wiped out squadrons that arrived only a few days earlier. Newly arriving personnel will be required to immediately conduct operations against the powerful Chinese forces that have caused so many casualties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Air Force understands this at an abstract level. The Air Force chief of staff, General Charles Brown, noted this challenge explicitly in his initial guidance: “Tomorrow’s Airmen are more likely to fight in highly contested environments and must be prepared to fight through combat attrition rates and risks to the Nation that are more akin to the World War II era than the uncontested environment to which we have since become accustomed.” However, the challenge will be incorporating this into training and culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/YQ5xTl2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image21&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 12: Depiction of Japanese Attack on Henderson Field on Guadalcanal, 1942.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: “Fogerty’s Fate” by LtCol A. Michael Leahy, USMCR available at the National Museum of the Marine Corps, Triangle, Virginia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Navy and Air Force will need to reject the notion that the next war will be long distance and “push-button,” not requiring personnel to face personal danger or operate under conditions of extreme hardship. Although such notions have been attractive since the end of World War II, they do not describe a twenty-first century conflict between great powers. The Air Force’s recent “multi-capable airmen” concept is a pragmatic acknowledgment of this grim reality. Under this concept, airmen will learn to do basic tasks outside their usual specialty, thus allowing easier adjustments to combat conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A broader question about leadership arises from the discussion about casualties and operational results: commanders will need to continue operations and move forward despite a high level of casualties not seen in living memory. It is easy to tell modern officers to emulate the tenacity in the face of adversity shown by their predecessors, such as Vice Admiral William Frederick “Bull” Halsey during the naval battles of the Solomon Islands, Major General Alexander Vandegrift on Guadalcanal, Lieutenant Colonel James Doolittle raiding Tokyo, or General George Patton at Kasserine Pass. However, the current generation of military officers has been trained on “force protection,” whereby the minimization of casualties is of paramount importance. That makes sense in a counterinsurgency operation where maintaining long-term political support is vital. It is counterproductive in a conventional conflict with clear geographic and political goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Commanders will need to continue operations and move forward despite a high level of casualties not seen in living memory.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All military services should incorporate the recognition of casualties into their training programs and emphasize that there will be no safe rear areas in a great power conflict. The combat forces already do this, but such expectations need to be expanded. For example, many Army support units such as air defense have not suffered significant casualties since 1945, but now they will be a prime target for Chinese missiles. Similarly, aviation organizations should be restructured to cope with wartime losses to aircraft, maintenance facilities, and support personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Do not plan on striking the mainland.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strikes on the Chinese mainland create grave risks of escalation. These risks are discussed in depth above in the justification for the “U.S. National Command Authority rules out strikes on Chinese mainland” excursion case. Even if the war plan developed in peacetime calls for mainland strikes, the National Command Authority might withhold permission in the actual event of war. It would therefore be wise to hedge planning on the question of striking the Chinese mainland. If permissions are granted, then military leaders should be ready with plans for strikes on high-value targets such as over-the-horizon radar, satellite uplink stations, and high-value aircraft that affect the fight on Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Strengthen Taiwanese ground forces.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States will not be able to insert ground forces onto Taiwan in a timely manner. In some iterations, the U.S. player attrited the PLAN sufficiently that some U.S. ground forces might get through after four or more weeks of conflict, though with some risk from remaining Chinese air and naval power. By that time, however, the battle for Taiwan will likely be decided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once conflict begins, Taiwan’s isolation means that there can be no “Ukraine model.” In the Ukraine war, the United States and NATO have sent massive amounts of equipment and supplies directly to Ukraine during the conflict. Although Russia has made some efforts to interdict this flow by striking railroads with missiles, shutting down or even seriously impeding the flow has been beyond Russia’s military capability. However, China does have that capability. Therefore, all the equipment and munitions must arrive before China begins combat operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Once conflict begins, Taiwan’s isolation means that there can be no “Ukraine model.” . . . Therefore, all the equipment and munitions must arrive before China begins combat operations.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should therefore encourage Taiwan to acquire sufficient munitions and weapons to fight the local battle against invading forces without any direct assistance for a prolonged period. For many munitions, Taiwan may be capable of producing its own stockpiles. For U.S.-supplied systems, foreign military sales provide a mechanism to get weapons to Taiwan before conflict begins. Taiwan has ordered billions of dollars of weapons, but deliveries have been slow. The United States should speed up the Foreign Military Sales process on its side and urge the Taiwanese to speed up on their side. There needs to be a sense of urgency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Taiwanese ground forces must immediately shift toward becoming more effective and survivable. Because defeating Chinese forces before they land is likely impossible, effective resistance ashore is critical. This requires an army that is ready, well-trained, well-led, and highly motivated. Without such a ground force, the rest will be in vain. Yet, it is not clear that the Taiwanese army has the necessary qualities. Taiwan needs to give its army a higher priority than it has received in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The island of Taiwan contains many geographic features such as mountains and rivers that the Taiwanese forces should use to their advantage. This includes cities and urban sprawl. Although the defense of cities would result in severe damage, failing to defend them makes Chinese operations on the island much easier. The longer Taiwan can lengthen the war, the greater the attrition of the Chinese fleet and the possibility of external aid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Move Taiwanese air and naval forces toward asymmetry.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, Taiwan has built a military with broad capabilities, paralleling those of major powers such as the United States. Thus, it has sought large surface ships and advanced aircraft in addition to submarines and ground forces. Currently, it has an air force with 534 combat aircraft (474 fighter/attack, 60 support) and a navy with 38 major vessels (4 submarines, 26 surface combatants, and 8 amphibious ships). Such a structure made sense when Chinese air and naval forces were relatively weak. Taiwan’s ability to contest China in the air and at sea meant it could defeat an invasion before ground forces landed in strength. That minimized damage to Taiwanese infrastructure and its economy. Further, such a structure provided visible reminders of Taiwan’s power and status in peacetime and could counter peacetime Chinese efforts to test Taiwanese sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maintaining a broad set of symmetrical capabilities today is inappropriate given the increasing strength of Chinese rocket, air, and naval forces. The Taiwanese surface navy would be quickly destroyed without inflicting significant damage on the Chinese fleet. Submarines are more survivable than surface ships but still vulnerable if China achieves surprise. Having a continuous at-sea submarine presence would mitigate this problem; however, such a presence is currently infeasible due to lack of numbers. The Taiwanese air force is similarly vulnerable. Chinese short-range ballistic missiles can cover all of Taiwan’s military tarmac and HASs, destroying all Taiwanese aircraft not in underground shelters. The surviving aircraft would contribute only marginally to the air battle over the island before being destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The value of the “porcupine strategy” was demonstrated by the project’s modeling and wargames. Because Taiwan cannot match China ship-for-ship or aircraft-for-aircraft, the “porcupine strategy” proposes that Taiwan invest more heavily in “agile and concealable weapons such as the portable Javelin and Stinger missiles” rather than expensive and vulnerable conventional weapons. The project’s findings are consistent with many other studies of Taiwan and reflect the current debate within Taiwan. These asymmetric capabilities (e.g., coastal defense cruise missiles, mobile SAMs, and mines) could also play a role in counter-blockade strategies if China pursued such a strategy with strikes on Taiwan itself. The Taiwanese navy’s budget would better contribute with coastal defense cruise missiles, missile boats, and mining rather than large surface combatants. Taiwanese ground-based ASCMs can survive a Chinese air and missile strike because of their mobility and were highly effective against Chinese surface ships. Mobile SAMs were more effective for air defense than fighters because of their greater survivability. They are also less expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Because Taiwan cannot match China ship-for-ship or aircraft-for-aircraft, the “porcupine strategy” proposes that Taiwan invest more heavily in “agile and concealable weapons such as the portable Javelin and Stinger missiles” rather than expensive and vulnerable conventional weapons.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Particularly important is the fulfillment of a current deal to supply Taiwan with ground-launched Harpoon missiles. In the game, the 400 missiles already programmed (but not yet delivered) had a large effect on weakening the initial Chinese invasion. Two hundred additional missiles would have as much impact on the naval battle as an MLR or MDTF but without the political risks of basing and the operational challenges of transportation and resupply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwanese progress toward such an asymmetric strategy has been halting. The United States has consistently urged the government of Taiwan to move away from boutique, vulnerable systems. Progress toward a “porcupine strategy” seemed to be made with a 2017 strategy by the then-chief of the Taiwanese military forces, Lee Hsi-Min. However, subsequent military chiefs have vacillated. Determining the correct combination of carrots and sticks to change Taiwanese attitudes is imperative for building an effective deterrent on today’s threat environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;doctrine-and-posture-1&quot;&gt;Doctrine and Posture&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next are recommendations for how the U.S. military plans to operate (doctrine) and how it positions its forces in the theater (posture).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Fortify and expand air base capacity in Japan and Guam.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and Japan lose hundreds of aircraft in every iteration, from an average of 290 in optimistic cases to 646 in pessimistic cases. For the U.S. Air Force, this represents 12 to 32 percent of its operational fighter/attack strength after three to four weeks of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picture below shows U.S., Taiwanese, and Japanese losses (over 900) from one game iteration (#13), a pessimistic and intense encounter that ended in stalemate. The losses represent about 40 percent of the Air Force’s fighter/attack operational inventory. This would degrade U.S. power for decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/CEtysLe.png&quot; alt=&quot;image22&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 13: U.S., Taiwanese, and Japanese Losses from Game Iteration #13.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dilemma for aircraft is that they are vulnerable if based close to Taiwan but less useful if based farther away. The United States must aggressively attack the Chinese amphibious ships to prevent the Chinese from establishing a foothold in Taiwan. However, this means moving many aircraft forward before the Chinese missile threat diminishes. As bases closer to Taiwan can be struck by more Chinese missiles, moving U.S. aircraft closer to Taiwan increases aircrafts’ vulnerability to being destroyed on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andersen Air Force Base on Guam cannot substitute for bases in Japan. The distance from Guam to Taiwan (roughly 2,800 km) makes it impossi-ble to generate many sorties from Andersen Air Force Base. Despite the high casualties suffered by air-craft based in Japan, most U.S. players preferred Japanese basing to Guam. However, in those iterations where Japan was strictly neutral, Andersen Air Force Base became the principal U.S. base. This gave the Chinese powerful reasons to attack it repeatedly. Aircraft on Andersen Air Force Base are particularly vulnerable because, as of 2022, the base has no HASs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because there is no viable substitute for using air bases in Japan, the United States needs to work with Tokyo to harden Japanese bases with shelters and expand their tarmacs for dispersing aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concrete (hardening) lacks influential constituencies within military bureaucracies, but the large benefit justifies a strong effort. Although HASs do not provide complete protection, they require China to expend more missiles to destroy each aircraft. If every aircraft were in a shelter, China would be unable to use missiles with submunitions that destroy several aircraft each. In conjunction with deception and active defenses, the United States could shift the cost-exchange ratio of Chinese attacks on U.S. aircraft in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/PS2JoOL.png&quot; alt=&quot;image23&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 14: U.S. Bases in the Western Pacific.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While active defenses are helpful, they cannot be thought of as the primary means of mitigating Chinese missile attacks. On the one hand, local commanders want active defenses because they offer a tangible counter against adversary aircraft, cruise missiles, and ballistic missiles. Investing in passive defenses such as hardening and dispersion that simply mitigate the effects of enemy attacks represents a tacit acceptance of losses. On the other hand, China’s inventory of missiles means that even if active defenses are highly effective (as assumed in the project’s modeling), then the sheer volume of fire will overwhelm U.S. active defenses. Active defense therefore must be used with a robust system of passive defenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides hardening, the United States and Japan should also work to secure access to civilian international airports. The base case assumed that the Air Force used one civilian regional airfield per military airfield. This could be augmented with access to a broader set of civilian airfields, particularly large international ones. As Chinese missile attacks constitute an area attack problem, increasing the area those missiles must cover is an effective countermeasure. Although local political opposition may obstruct peacetime and possibly wartime access to Japanese civilian airports, the significant payoff justifies a strong effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Restructure U.S. Air Force doctrine and procurement to address vulnerability on the ground.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faced with large losses on the ground, U.S. players often dispersed aircraft to regional civilian airfields in Japan. By spreading aircraft out and thus diluting the effect of any single Chinese missile attack, dispersion effectively reduced losses. Dispersion is a major element in contemporary discussions about operational concepts in the Western Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, unprepared civilian airfields have drawbacks; there will always be a need for well-equipped military airfields. First, there is a logistical cost for dispersing and time lost in making the move top civilian airfields. Second, the United States needs basing for hundreds of aircraft, which is far beyond what regional airfields can handle. Third, as activities on a dispersion airfield expand, the airfield becomes functionally like a main operating base but without the hardened infrastructure, specialized logistics, and air defenses. Large, well-equipped — and fully hardened — bases remain indispensable for sortie generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air Force doctrine is beginning to address this trade-off between preparation and dispersion through the agile combat employment (ACE) concept. ACE allows operations from a network of smaller, dispersed locations through a hub-and-spokes model that can complicate adversary planning while maintaining high sortie generation. These dispersed locations would be “defensible, sustainable, and relocatable.” This doctrinal adjustment will reduce the drawbacks of using civilian airfields. The Air Force is practicing the skills needed for ACE in a variety of exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, these efforts do not go far enough. Rather than attempting to tack dispersion onto a predetermined force structure and doctrine, the Air Force needs to engineer survivability into its structure from the ground up. Sweden’s Flygbassystem 60/90 provides an example of hardening and dispersion to protect forces on the ground. Having observed the vulnerability of aircraft on the ground during World War II and the increasing power of nuclear weapons, the Swedish air force adopted Flygbassystem 60, a system of concrete command bunkers, mobile maintenance teams, and multiple dispersed runways designed to improve aircraft survivability in a potential war against the Soviet Union. This system was updated to Flygbassystem 90 after witnessing the effectiveness of air base attacks and runway cratering munitions in the Arab-Israeli wars. ACE is a sound first step, but it must be expanded into a more holistic doctrine such as with the Flygbassystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Do not plan on overflying the Chinese mainland.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In every iteration, the Air Force was never able to begin operations within Chinese airspace by the end of game play (typically after three to four weeks of conflict). Instead, U.S. Air Force had to focus on the ground, air, and sea battles on and immediately around Taiwan and had little leeway to employ airpower over the mainland. Attrition was high enough without contending with China’s integrated air defense system (IADS) on the mainland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strikes against military and civilian infrastructure on the mainland were counterproductive distractions. They require a massive and sustained air campaign that takes a long time to have operational effects and diverted attention from immediate battlefield needs. Bombers equipped with standoff munitions were effective against the mainland but employed solely against ports and airfields because these targets directly affected the situation on Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Players were reluctant to risk B-2 bombers, the only long-range assets possibly capable of penetrating Chinese airspace, because of their limited numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nor will this problem become better in the 2030s. When the B-21 bomber becomes widely available and the B-2 is retired in the 2030s, China’s IADS will have also progressed. Nevertheless, the B-21 program remains important, as it might be the only bomber capable of launching medium-range munitions (e.g., the JSOW) and surviving in the expanding Chinese air defense bubble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Air Force must therefore avoid force structure and doctrinal decisions that are geared toward overflying China’s robust IADS on the mainland. This does not mean that stealth is unimportant: it is still necessary to destroy targets away from the coast that are protected by long-range air defenses. However, any program that envisions overflight of the Chinese mainland is unrealistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The U.S. Air Force must therefore avoid force structure and doctrinal decisions that are geared toward overflying China’s robust IADS on the mainland.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recognize the limitations of Marine Littoral Regiments and Army Multi-Domain Task Forces and cap their numbers.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Marine Corps is building Marine Littoral Regiments (MLRs) to operate inside the Chinese defensive zone (which the Marine Corps calls the “weapons engagement zone”) and contest Chinese air and naval assets. The Army envisions its Multi-Domain Task Forces (MDTFs) as having a similar function. Although these units could contribute to the fight, neither played heavily in most scenarios. The problems of operating inside the Chinese defensive zone were insurmountable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game assumed that by 2026, the Marine Corps had an MLR on Okinawa and another on Hawaii. The MLR on Okinawa was able to exert local influence, destroying two Chinese ships in one iteration (#19). However, its Naval Strike Missiles (NSMs) have a range of only 100 nautical miles, and Chinese fleets rarely came that close Okinawa, being focused on the waters around Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Although these units [MLRs and MDTFs] could contribute to the fight, neither played heavily in most scenarios. The problems of operating inside the Chinese defensive zone were insurmountable.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In several games, the U.S. player tried to move an MLR onto Taiwan by air or sea, but in all cases the unit and transportation assets were destroyed while trying to transit the extensive Chinese defensive zones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most scenarios, political assumptions prevented any U.S. forces from being pre-positioned on Taiwanese or Philippine territory before the conflict begins. (See Chapter 4 for a description of the base case assumptions and above for a recommendation on verifying war plan assumptions.) However, one scenario assumed that that the United States was willing to risk provocation by putting U.S. forces onto Taiwan, whether because Chinese mobilization generated sufficient concern, or the U.S.-China relationship had changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, before hostilities began, an MLR deployed from Okinawa with its load of missiles and one reload, augmenting the shore-based fires of Taiwanese Harpoons. The NSM’s 100-nautical-mile range could easily enable attacks on Chinese amphibious ships from Taiwan. Assuming that the MLR deployed with a load of 72 NSMs on 18 launchers, modeling showed that the MLRs would sink an average of five major Chinese amphibious ships. Because of the MLR’s ability to conduct distributed operations, it was assumed to be survivable in the face of Chinese counteraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, resupply proved impossible. A resupply mission of C-17s escorted by fighters attempted to break through the Chinese CAP but was shot down. After that, no further attempts were made at resupply. The MLR became a ground infantry battalion, augmenting the 114 combat battalions of the Taiwanese ground forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ground units will not provide a significant volume of fire. A squadron of bombers armed with long-range cruise missiles has a greater volume of fire than an entire MLR but without the challenges of transportation and logistics. Ground-based anti-ship units must either deploy with a large number of missiles before the conflict begins or act as forward sensors for long-range air and naval power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar stories emerged from MLR deployments to the western Ryukyus and Philippines. In one scenario, the MLR was prepositioned in the western Ryukyus. In that location, it could attack Chinese naval forces that moved north of Taiwan, but resupply was deemed too risky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In another scenario, an MLR moved onto the Philippine islands north of Luzon. There, it could attack Chinese forces that moved south of Taiwan, but again resupply was impossible, limiting its value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All game iterations had an MLR and Army MDTF on Hawaii available for deployment by airlift, but no U.S. player called them forward. Instead, the U.S. player gave priority to Patriot battalions, which could add to the air defense of threatened airfields. These were needed because of repeated Chinese air and missile attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the project team recommends continuing to develop land-based forces to counter Chinese air and naval capabilities but also the need to recognize their employment challenges. While these new formations were more useful than traditional ground forces, multiplying these specialized units has limited value because only the first few can be deployed successfully. Others will sit unused. The maximum number is probably two or three.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The acquisition of long-range ground-launched missiles might overcome this limitation. If ground-launched Tomahawks have a similar range to their Vertical Launch System (VLS) counterparts, they could be employed from peacetime bases on Okinawa without moving in the Chinese defensive zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Avoid crisis deployments that create vulnerabilities.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. warfighting doctrine includes a pre-hostility phase designed to strengthen deterrence and enhance U.S. warfighting capabilities should conflict occur. As a result, the United States routinely makes forward deployments in crises. Therefore, in a major confrontation with China, the United States might load up Japan and Guam with aircraft and move CSGs into the region to signal U.S. resolve. Unfortunately, as Thomas Schelling, the great strategist, observed, “A fine deterrent can make a superb target.” In early 1941, the United States transferred the home base of the Pacific Fleet from San Diego to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, to deter Japanese aggression and station the fleet closer to the potential fight. However, this move put the fleet within range of Japanese striking forces, with results as tragic as they are well known. Similarly, U.S. deployments during a confrontation with China might tempt China to attack preemptively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Thomas Schelling, the great strategist, observed, “A fine deterrent can make a superb target.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In theory, the United States might be able to keep air and naval forces forward for deterrence but pull them back or disperse them to less vulnerable sites when deterrence was on the verge of failing. However, this cannot be relied on in practice. First, partners and allies will push hard to keep forces forward as long as possible. They would regard withdrawal as a sign of abandonment, not prudence. Further, it requires precise knowledge about when China intends to strike; however, China decides D-Day. The United States had such knowledge before the war in Ukraine, but warning may not always be as clear. Furthermore, China could plan on one D-Day, then reset it if the U.S. withdraws forward-deployed forces. Finally, it would take several days for all the vulnerable forces to get out of range, so withdrawal must begin with enough lead time before hostilities start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States needs to develop mechanisms to enhance deterrence that do not also create a tempting target. As commentators have noted, the withdrawal of U.S. squadrons from Kadena probably enhances deterrence by reducing the temptation to strike a vulnerable target. Deploying defensive systems within the Chinese defensive zone would increase capabilities without increasing vulnerability. Deploying offensive systems to locations outside Chinese missile ranges, such as sending bombers to Hawaii or Australia, would indicate resolve without increasing vulnerability. Assuming enough warning to withdraw vulnerable assets prior to conflict breaking out is highly risky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;weapons-and-platforms-1&quot;&gt;Weapons and Platforms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, analysis of the game results generated recommendations about the procurement of specific weapons and platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Shift to smaller, more survivable ships.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with aircraft, the United States lost many surface ships in almost every iteration because of forward deployment within the Chinese defensive zone. U.S. losses of large surface ships typically totaled two carriers and 15 to 25 cruisers/destroyers. Although this represented only about 15 to 25 percent of total U.S. Navy surface combatants, losses typically included nearly all large surface ships in the Western Pacific. In the most intense iterations, the U.S. Navy was losing a major ship every day of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until the Chinese ground-launched missile inventory was exhausted, it was too dangerous for U.S. or Japanese surface ships to approach Taiwan. Amphibious ships were particularly vulnerable because of their lack of defensive systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some iterations, surface ships could approach Taiwan in week three or four when the Chinese anti-ship missile inventory had declined. Even then, the ALCMs of the PLAAF and PLANAF, the torpedoes and cruise missiles of PLAN submarines, and the ship-based anti-ship missiles of the PLAN meant that the survivability of U.S. surface ships was low. U.S. ships were rarely able to get within Harpoon or SM-6 range of Chinese ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Until the Chinese ground-launched missile inventory was exhausted, it was too dangerous for U.S. or Japanese surface ships to approach Taiwan.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even after Chinese ASBMs (Anti-Ship Ballistic Missiles) had been expended, the utility of U.S. surface ships had limits. Although the range of the Maritime Strike Tomahawk (MST) allowed U.S. surface ships to attack Chinese ships from a distance, every MST in a ship’s inventory meant one fewer interceptor or anti-submarine missile that the ship had for defense. A ship with enough MSTs to destroy multiple Chinese warships was a glass cannon, very vulnerable in turn to Chinese attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as there will be too many incoming missiles for active defense to adequately protect airfields, there will be too many anti-ship missiles for active defense to adequately protect surface ships. Therefore, active defense with interceptors must be paired with soft kill measures (e.g., reduced radar cross-section and electronic warfare) that complicate enemy targeting. To this end, the budget of the Surface Warfare Division of the Operational Test and Evaluation Force, which tests ship defenses, should be increased. Even with improved electronic warfare, many ships will be lost in a conflict with China because electronic warfare advantages are transitory. Procurement decisions must therefore consider the vulnerability of surface ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This all points to benefits in shifting toward a fleet of smaller, stealthier ships integrated with unmanned decoys. Such ships would be better disposed to the soft kill of incoming missiles. In addition, it will not be as devastating to lose smaller, cheaper, less-capable ships. The Navy should also have expendable or unmanned ships accompany CSGs to act as decoys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Develop rescue mechanisms to deal with crippled ships and multiple sinkings.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just because a ship is sunk does not mean that its problems are over. Hundreds or even thousands of U.S. sailors would be thrown into the water each time a ship sinks. Currently, the U.S. Navy has no way of rescuing these sailors except by diverting a warship, with all the associated risks and opportunity costs. Game participants with a naval background recalled the experience of the USS Juneau in World War II. The ship was torpedoed and sunk on November 13, 1942, leaving 100 sailors in the water. However, the local commander judged it too risky to stop and look for survivors. Only 10 survivors were left when finally picked up eight days later. World War II convoys routinely included a rescue ship to pick up survivors so that warships did not have to be diverted. In addition to their humanitarian function, rescuing 4,200 shipwrecked crew during the war, rescue ships boosted morale by reassuring sailors about their chances of survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9yVUCZ8.png&quot; alt=&quot;image24&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 15: Japanese Shin-Maywa US-2.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, many mission kills would not result in the ship being sunk but rather incapacitated. Without appropriate assets to tow disabled ships to port, they would have to be scuttled, depriving the Navy of an irreplaceable asset. For example, in World War II, all five U.S. fleet carriers lost in action were scuttled to keep them from falling into enemy hands after receiving severe damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Navy needs to develop rescue ships that can accompany CSGs and SAGs. Such ships could both rescue shipwrecked sailors and tow disabled ships. Some version of the existing oceangoing tugs (Navy classification: “ATS”) might be suitable. Although this is a lower-priority requirement in peacetime, the wartime need is clear. The nation would be unforgiving if the Navy left sailors to drown because it was too risky to save them. Unlike in 1943, ubiquitous social media would prevent suppression of information about the event. Further, the tugs might save some damaged ships that would otherwise be lost. The Navy will need every ship it has because of the long time required for new construction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;the-us-navy-needs-to-develop-rescue-ships-that-can-accompany-csgs-and-sags-such-ships-could-both-rescue-shipwrecked-sailors-and-tow-disabled-ships&quot;&gt;The U.S. Navy needs to develop rescue ships that can accompany CSGs and SAGs. Such ships could both rescue shipwrecked sailors and tow disabled ships.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Navy might also consider acquiring an amphibious patrol aircraft that could help rescue sailors from sunken ships and aircrew from downed aircraft. In a situation where the United States and Japan lose dozens of aircrew a week, each of whom requires millions of dollars and many years to train, such rescues make military sense aside from the humanitarian imperative. The picture shows the Japanese Shin-Maywa US-2, an amphibious aircraft designed for maritime rescue missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Prioritize submarines and other undersea platforms.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In every iteration, the U.S. player moved submarines into the Taiwan Strait, where they could attack Chinese amphibious ships directly. Indeed, in the base case, one U.S. submarine squadron begins in the strait because that likely constitutes current deployment practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside the straits, U.S. submarines wreaked havoc on Chinese shipping. Based on the agent-based modeling found in RAND’s U.S.-China Military Scorecard and historical evidence from World War II, each submarine would sink two large amphibious vessels (and an equal number of decoys and escorts) over the course of a 3.5-day turn. Every submarine squadron (four submarines) in the strait sank eight Chinese amphibious ships and eight escorts or decoys, but at a price of roughly 20 percent attrition per 3.5 days. U.S. submarines operated on a “conveyor belt,” whereby they hunted, moved back to port (Guam, Yokosuka, or Wake Island), reloaded, then moved forward again and hunted. Doing this cycle as quickly as possible was important because the number of submarine squadrons was limited during the early phases of the conflict and their contribution was so significant. Submarines were also needed to screen against Chinese submarines exiting the first island chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;U.S. submarines wreaked havoc on Chinese shipping.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the value of submarines, acquiring more is an obvious recommendation. Most analyses of future naval force structure agree that the United States should build more attack submarines than are currently programmed. However, it is unlikely that the United States could build more than the current rate of two a year during the 2020s and early 2030s when it is also building the Columbia-class SSBN. Indeed, even achieving two per year may be a stretch. However, the U.S. Navy should commit to funding those two per year even if shipbuilding funds get tight. The Navy should also consider keeping submarines in service longer, as it has proposed by extending the service life of some 688-class boats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Navy should also ensure that it has reloading facilities in Yokosuka, Guam, and Wake Island. Forcing submarines to go back to Pearl Harbor to reload wastes valuable hunting time. Because China will likely target fixed facilities, mobile reloading from civilian ports should be practiced. The Navy also needs to ensure that it has enough torpedoes. Although the game did not model this munition, there is reason for concern. The historical record is that many torpedoes will miss or malfunction, some will be lost when the submarine carrying them is sunk, and others will be destroyed when shore facilities are attacked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, investment in unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) should be prioritized. There is guaranteed to be some submarine attrition in a fight against China, particularly in the constrained waters of the Taiwan Strait. Each loss would be a painful blow. A Virginia-class submarine has a crew of 135 and costs roughly $3 billion. While UUVs are not as capable as attack submarines, they could be programmed to fulfill some relatively straightforward missions (e.g., minelaying).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Procure sufficient stockpiles of standoff anti-ship weapons.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Munitions usage was high. In the three to four weeks of conflict, U.S. forces usually expended about 5,000 long-range precision missiles, primarily JASSMs and LRASMs. The United States expended its global LRASM inventory within the first few days in all scenarios. JASSM inventories were large enough that they did not run low until the third or fourth week of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In games where the JASSM-ER has maritime strike capabilities, the abundance of U.S. munitions made U.S. strategy an almost uncomplicated exercise. With each squadron of 12 bombers carrying around 200 stealthy, standoff ASCMs, the United States could rapidly cripple the Chinese fleet and leave the invasion force stranded. For this reason, many studies that look at this problem recommend expanding the arsenal of anti-ship weapons. However, as discussed in the assumptions chapter, the JASSM-ER might not have this capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The United States expended its global LRASM inventory within the first few days in all scenarios.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JASSM-ERs were still somewhat useful in excursion scenarios where they could not strike ships at sea. In this case, JASSM-ERs could strike Chinese ports and airfields. However, these attacks against the homeland of a nuclear power raised questions about escalation. Attacks against ships at sea do not raise that concern to the same degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, without a deep magazine of standoff anti-ship weapons, the Air Force had to use shorter-range JSMs and JSOWs to attack Chinese ships once the LRASMs were gone. The limited range of JSMs and JSOWs meant that aircraft had to get within range of Chinese SAMs and CAP for strikes, which resulted in higher attrition and aborted missions. With a deeper magazine of LRASMs instead of JASSM-ERs, this problem would not have arisen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Missile inventories reflect service priorities. The Air Force prefers to strike land targets as part of an air superiority campaign, while naval targets have lower priority. Thus, in 2026, the available Air Force inventory of JASSM (all variants) will number about 6,500, while its LRASM inventory will be only about 100. Although the Navy has more LRASMs, it does not have the ability to launch them en masse in the way that only Air Force bombers can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Air Force needs to embrace and implement the anti-ship mission. The need to attack Chinese amphibious forces makes this mission critical. Maritime strike has a long history with the Air Force, dating from its earliest days, with the sinking of the Ostfreisland in 1921 and the interception of the Rex in 1938. General George C. Kenney’s World War II operations in the Southwest Pacific also constitute a pertinent precedent, as his 5th Air Force supported ground and naval operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to implement such an effort would be to shift JASSM production to the LRASM. The missiles are built on the same production line and are 70 percent common. The LRASM can strike the greatest threat, the Chinese amphibious fleet, with less risk of escalation. Yet the JASSM inventory is far larger than that of LRASMs, and production plans in FY 2023 continue that imbalance, consisting of 581 JASSMs and 88 LRASMs. This is backward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Powered naval mines are another option that might be highly effective. Mines have the advantage of obviating the requirement for precise targeting of the Chinese fleet; once the Chinese select an invasion beach, any mine dropped there will eventually hit a ship. While current extended-range mines require aircraft to get within 40 km of the target, a powered version of these mines could reach farther and reduce attrition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accelerating CLEAVER, a program to put palletized missiles into the cargo bay of a C-17 or C-130 cargo aircraft, would expand the number of launch platforms. This may sound unnecessary, as the United States has bombers that are specifically designed to deliver such payloads. However, there are not enough bombers to sustain attrition and launch all the strikes that are needed. Being able to include some of the 225 C-17s in these long-range strikes would add flexibility to mission planning and hedge against unexpectedly high losses to the bomber force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the project tracked a few key munitions and assumed that the United States had sufficient stockpiles of the rest. This may not be true. The DOD should review the inventories of all relevant munitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Continue development and fielding of hypersonic weapons but recognize that they are a niche capability.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hypersonic weapons, defined as missiles able to travel more than five times the speed of sound, have received considerable attention in recent years. Their high speed makes defense difficult and allows them to strike fleeting targets. The base case includes Chinese DF-17s with hypersonic maneuverable re-entry vehicles. It is logical for China to pursue hypersonic technologies to defeat the well-developed U.S. missile defense system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2026, the United States will have few equivalent hypersonic systems. The game included 50 U.S. hypersonic weapons (the Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon, or ARRW), although this was speculative. In 2022, no U.S. hypersonic weapons are yet programs of record although several systems are emerging from development. Most U.S. hypersonic programs would likely be in testing or initial fielding in 2026 and thus not available in large numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hypersonic weapons would be useful for attacking highly defended and deep targets such as China’s over-the-horizon-backscatter radars or satellite uplink stations. Modeling indicated that Chinese defenses could typical shoot down about 25 percent of U.S. land-attack cruise missiles targeting the mainland. This blunted the effect of U.S. attacks. Hypersonic weapons would not suffer this attrition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, hypersonic weapons are expensive and no substitute for large numbers of long-range cruise missiles. Picking off a few high-value targets does not solve the central problem of countering a massed invasion. That requires sinking enough amphibious ships such that Chinese forces cannot sustain a lodgment on Taiwan. The strategist Hal Brands made this point in an assessment of contemporary arms races, “The United States doesn’t need to emulate every Chinese breakthrough in hypersonic weapons. These weapons can’t provide, at a reasonable cost, the volume of fire power Washington would need in the Western Pacific.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Prioritize sustainment of the bomber fleet over fighters.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both bombers and fighter/attack aircraft played important roles. However, the range and high ordnance throughput of bombers presented the Chinese with a particularly daunting challenge. The range of bombers meant that they could be based beyond the range of Chinese ballistic missiles, while their ordnance throughput meant that they could rapidly attrite Chinese forces. When paired with standoff munitions, even unstealthy “bomb trucks” are extremely useful against targets at the edge of the Chinese air defense zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The range and high ordnance throughput of bombers presented the Chinese with a particularly daunting challenge. The range of bombers meant that they could be based beyond the range of Chinese ballistic missiles, while their ordnance throughput meant that they could rapidly attrite Chinese forces.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This combination of platforms with long-range precision munitions is viable because this air campaign focuses on a few hundred aiming points comprising ships, air bases, and ports and airfields. It is not a strategic bombing campaign involving tens of thousands of aim points on the Chinese mainland and designed to paralyze the economy, military command structure, and political operations. Long-range precision missiles are too expensive to be procured in the numbers necessary to prosecute such a campaign, as the Russians are finding out in Ukraine. Further, as noted earlier, such a campaign raises questions about escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The value of bombers leads to several recommendations for Air Force acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stop retiring bombers. The Air Force has been retiring legacy bombers in expectation of fielding the B-21 and as part of its “divest to invest” strategy. This creates a gap in capability because the B-21s will not be available in large numbers until the 2030s. If the United States believes there is a significant chance of conflict with China in the 2020s, then the size of the bomber force should be maintained. Thus, the Air Force might retain its B-1 and B-52 fleets even as the B-21 enters the inventory.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Re-engine the B-52 fleet. The program, called the Commercial Engine Replacement Program, is already in Air Force plans. The Air Force will need as many bombers as it can get even when the B-21 has been fielded.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ensure that all bombers can carry the full range of munitions. For example, the LRASM is currently certified only for the B-1 bomber and the F/A-18E/F. Given the LRASM’s centrality in destroying Chinese surface forces, it needs to be employable from all aircraft for maximum flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider the implications for aircraft type and mix if most are lost on the ground. Fifth-generation aircraft were just as vulnerable on the ground as 4.5-generation aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think ahead to the next stage of bomber vulnerability. China likely also appreciates the significance of the threat that the U.S. bomber force poses. China might develop longer-range SAMs or deploy long-range air-to-air missiles on fighters that would fly deep into the Philippine Sea. The United States must develop countermeasures in the same way it thinks about disrupting the anti-ship-missile kill chains.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Harden bomber bases in Australia, Hawaii, and Alaska. In this game (set in 2026), China had few options for striking these critical bases. Chinese submarines might theoretically operate that far from port but were generally fully engaged in the Western Pacific. However, future Chinese missiles might have the range to destroy aircraft based there. The DOD should examine the defenses of Alaska and Hawaii since they will increasingly be within the scope of Chinese strikes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Procure more, cheaper fighters.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With so many aircraft lost early in the conflict, the Air Force risks running out of aircraft and becoming irrelevant to the conflict unless it has a large enough force to sustain the losses. Therefore, the Air Force should be cautious about taking its “divest to invest” strategy too far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numbers matter. Throughout the campaign, even fourth-generation fighter/attack aircraft had value. For many missions (such as launching standoff weapons), the stealth of fifth-generation aircraft is not needed. This was particularly true later in the conflict when Chinese air defenses weakened. At the same time, losing all fifth-generation aircraft early was a problem. After the long-range LRASMs were gone, fifth-generation aircraft were particularly valuable because they could press in to deliver shorter-range JSMs or JSOWs. There is therefore a strong argument for keeping a balanced mix throughout by withholding fifth-generation aircraft until the Chinese missile inventory is depleted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ninety percent of aircraft losses occurred on the ground.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability of aircraft on the ground raises questions about U.S. plans to procure relatively small numbers of extremely capable but expensive aircraft. If most are lost on the ground before they can bring their advanced capabilities to bear, then cheaper airframes might be worthwhile. Plans to procure the Next Generation Air Dominance fighter, with a cost per airframe of “‘multiple’ hundreds of millions” of dollars, do not make sense if 90 percent of U.S. and Japanese aircraft losses occurred on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion--victory-is-not-everything&quot;&gt;Conclusion — Victory Is Not Everything&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game results showed that the United States and Taiwan could successfully defend the island even under relatively pessimistic assumptions. This is different from many observers’ impressions and constitutes an important insight. The analysis also indicates that there is no need for the United States to consider highly risky strategies such as preemptive attacks on Chinese amphibious shipping or the early use of nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China would take enormous risks in launching such an operation. Chapter 5 describes the heavy losses to Chinese air and naval forces that even a successful invasion would entail. These losses would take many years to replace. Invasion forces on Taiwan would risk destruction if, as happened in many iterations, the Chinese were unable to sustain these forces in the face of heavy maritime losses. This failure would produce tens of thousands of prisoners of war, a highly visible and emotional symbol of defeat. Although the project did not explore what effects these losses might have on the Chinese political system, the CCP would be risking its hold on power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is no cause for complacency by the United States or Taiwan. First, China could choose other coercive paths, whether it be the seizure of offshore Taiwanese islands, a bombardment without ensuing invasion, or a blockade. These contingencies also warrant consideration. Second, the morale of Taiwan’s military and leadership must be strong enough to resist a Chinese attack in the face of high losses. Without the will to resist, the rest is irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the human, economic, military, and political costs loom over even a successful defense. These would be enormous. The discussion below lays out a few of these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taiwan’s Economy Debilitated:&lt;/strong&gt; Chinese forces, even if defeated, would inflict massive damage on Taiwanese infrastructure and cripple its economy for many years.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyber Damage:&lt;/strong&gt; Although the game included cyber affects at the operational level, it did not examine economic and social impacts. Both Taiwan and the United States might suffer damage to civilian and economic infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lost Military Capabilities:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States would suffer tremendous damage to its military forces. Rebuilding these capabilities would take many years and would occur at a slower rate than China’s rebuild, given the rapid pace of Chinese military modernization. With only two U.S. shipyards currently building large surface combatants, it would take decades to replace the dozen or more such ships lost while continuing the Navy’s build program. Lost carriers could not be replaced because the current shipyard capacity is sufficient only to maintain the current carrier force. Aircraft would be a bit easier to replace. For example, the United States lost an average of 200 to 500 aircraft across the scenarios. At current procurement rates of about 120 such aircraft per year, it would take two to four years to replace those aircraft, assuming no further attrition and no retirement of aging aircraft in the force. Ships and aircraft would take longer to replace if the war went beyond the three or four weeks of game play or if losses from engagements in the South China Sea were calculated and included.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loss of Global Position:&lt;/strong&gt; The world would not be standing still during and after a U.S.-China conflict. Other countries — for example, Russia, North Korea, or Iran — might take advantage of U.S. distraction to pursue their agendas. After the war, a weakened U.S. military might not be able to sustain the balance of power in Europe or the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk of Escalation:&lt;/strong&gt; Although this project focused on conventional conflict, many analyses of an invasion have nuclear play. The recent novel 2034 concludes with nuclear strikes. The CNAS wargame, Dangerous Straits, similarly ends with the use of nuclear weapons. No one knows what those escalation dynamics would be. They depend on an unprecedented event, conventional war between nuclear powers, as well as the opaque decisionmaking process of the CCP. The recommendations above to focus on anti-ship attacks instead of mainland strikes could reduce the risk of escalation, but that risk will never go away.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protracted or Episodic Conflict:&lt;/strong&gt; Finally, the war might not end after this initial phase but drag on for months or even years. Conflict might be episodic, with periodic ceasefires. This project is called The First Battle of the Next War for a reason. Opening battles, even if seemingly decisive, generally do not end a conflict. Cathal Nolan makes this argument in his monumental study, The Allure of Battle. After looking at the long history of wars, he concludes, “How to win decisively in war is the aspiration of all professional military, and a main subject of concern to those who study war. Yet it is the single hardest thing to do, to translate combat into achievement of an important strategic and political goal that the other side is forced to recognize and accept when the war is over.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These losses might cause strategic disillusionment. The United States would sustain as many personnel casualties in a month of such conflict as in 20 years of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The scale and suddenness of such losses would shock a U.S. population unaccustomed to significant military losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effect might be like the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, where the combination of surprise, betrayal, and loss solidified public opinion and created a determination to press the conflict to its conclusion. On the other hand, the effect might be like the 1983 bombing of the U.S. barracks in Beirut, where the U.S. population and political establishment decided that the cost was not worth the foreign policy benefit. The result was withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if the United States prosecuted the war to a successful conclusion, a narrative of disillusionment might emerge. U.S. policymakers and Americans might question whether the sacrifice had been worth preserving Taiwanese independence and democracy. That kind of disillusionment occurred after World War I. Even though the United States was successful, with relatively low casualties (at least compared to the other combatants), there was profound disillusionment after the war. Many argued that “merchants of death” had manipulated the United States into the war. This produced a turn toward isolationism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Even if the United States prosecuted the war to a successful conclusion, a narrative of disillusionment might emerge.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project does not take a position on whether the United States should defend Taiwan. That requires a political and foreign policy assessment of benefits, costs, and values that goes beyond the scope of the current effort. The project does rigorously document the likely outcomes of defending Taiwan in a variety of scenarios and how different assumptions about conditions and capabilities affect those outcomes. The intention is that this analysis will help the public and policy discussion about how the United States should move forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the project recognizes that a succession of Democratic and Republican administrations, a bipartisan consensus in Congress, and a near uniformity of views among strategists identify China as the “pacing” U.S. competitor. U.S. policy needs to be broadly aimed at succeeding in this competition. In the military sphere, it is imperative to deter China from starting any conflict. To be deterred, China must doubt their ability to prevail through force of arms. This requires U.S. military capability to be manifestly sufficient for the task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing that capability will have additional costs but does not require across-the-board increases in U.S. defense spending. The recommendations in the previous chapter target specific capabilities that would be most useful for conflict in the Western Pacific. To offset these investments, less effective capabilities might be cut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;To be deterred, China must doubt their ability to prevail through force of arms. This requires U.S. military capability to be manifestly sufficient for the task.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line from the analysis is that a successful defense is possible, and deterrence is achievable, but it will require planning, some resources, and political will.&lt;/p&gt;

Cancian&lt;/strong&gt; (Colonel, USMCR, ret.) is a senior adviser with the International Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, D.C. He joined CSIS in April 2015 from the Office of Management and Budget, where he spent more than seven years as chief of the Force Structure and Investment Division, working on issues such as Department of Defense budget strategy, war funding, and procurement programs, as well as nuclear weapons development and nonproliferation activities in the Department of Energy. Previously, he worked on force structure and acquisition issues in the Office of the Secretary of Defense and ran research and executive programs at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government. In the military, Colonel Cancian spent over three decades in the U.S. Marine Corps, active and reserve, serving as an infantry, artillery, and civil affairs officer and on overseas tours in Vietnam, Desert Storm, and Iraq (twice). Since 2000, he has been an adjunct faculty member at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, where he teaches a course on the connection between policy and analysis. A prolific author, he has published over 40 articles on military operations, acquisition, budgets, and strategy and received numerous writing awards. He graduated with high honors (magna cum laude) from Harvard College and with highest honors (Baker scholar) from Harvard Business School.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matthew Cancian&lt;/strong&gt; currently conducts classified wargaming at the U.S. Naval War College as a senior researcher for Saalex Solutions. He holds a PhD in political science from MIT, where he concentrated in security studies and comparative politics. His thesis was about the motivations of combatants and the effects of training, based on a survey of 2,301 Kurdish fighters (Peshmerga) during their war against the Islamic State. Before attending MIT, he earned an MA in law and diplomacy from the Fletcher School and a BA in history from the University of Virginia. Between those educational experiences, he served as a captain in the U.S. Marine Corps, deploying to Sangin, Afghanistan, as a forward observer in 2011 in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eric Heginbotham&lt;/strong&gt; is a principal research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Center for International Studies and a specialist in Asian security issues. Before joining MIT, he was a senior political scientist at the RAND Corporation, where he was the lead author of the RAND US-China Military Scorecard and a RAND study on China’s Evolving Nuclear Deterrent. He is the co-author (with George Gilboy) of Chinese and Indian Strategic Behavior: Growing Power and Alarm, published by Cambridge University Press in 2012, and is an editor of China Steps Out: Beijing’s Major Power Engagement with the Developing World (Routledge, 2018).

The heavy toll of the conflict on civilians – 23.4 million people in need of humanitarian assistance and around 4.3 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) – makes a renewal and expansion of the truce in Yemen a priority.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To this end, on 23 November 2022 RUSI hosted an expert-led discussion bringing together analysts, practitioners and humanitarian workers on Yemen. The event included a session held off-record with about 20 participants, and a session which was streamed online on RUSI’s website. Both sessions explored how the end of the truce in Yemen impacted the humanitarian situation on the ground and what the prospects for stability and security in the country are moving forward.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This report summarises the major conclusions and talking points of both events, focusing on the insights that emerged about the humanitarian situation on the ground, the challenges linked to renewing and expanding the truce agreement, and what role international actors, the UK in particular, should play to address both issues.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-humanitarian-situation-on-the-ground&quot;&gt;The Humanitarian Situation on the Ground&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most participants argued that the six-month UN-brokered truce in Yemen led to an improvement of the situation on the ground. As a result, there were no cross-border attacks, no attacks from the Houthis against Saudi Arabia and no attack from Saudi Arabia against Houthi-controlled areas. Violence within Yemen continued, especially on the frontlines, but the overall decrease in hostilities meant there was a significant drop in civilian, including child, casualties. Furthermore, the movement of people, feelings of safety and security, and humanitarian conditions generally improved, including for children. One practitioner explained that during the truce, the internationally recognised government of Yemen could focus on the delivery of services and, even with the challenges it continued to face in terms of limited funding, improvements to overall quality of life could be seen. Furthermore, the re-opening of Sana’a airport facilitated the movement of people and improved the population’s access to healthcare and business opportunities. The increased flow of fuel through the Hodeidah port also positively affected the livelihoods of most Yemenis as, during the truce, three times the total amount of fuel was available, easing shortages at the pump and reducing the cost of transport, food and other commodity prices. The practitioner added that, without the truce, the impact of the war in Ukraine in terms of food security and increase in prices would have been much worse than it has been for Yemen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the truce was mostly perceived as having a positive impact on the humanitarian situation across the country, a couple of humanitarian workers presented views from displaced persons that showed that not everyone saw the dividends. Many IDPs in certain areas of the country felt there was no impact on their lives as access to work, basic goods and services, and aid remained difficult, nor did their perception of safety or security increase as a result. The spikes of insecurity in the south also limited the delivery of humanitarian assistance in these areas despite the truce. One humanitarian worker explained how the continued presence of explosive weapons remains a significant threat to civilians but also a challenge in terms of restricting the freedom of movement in Yemen, including during the truce, given that roads stayed closed due to the risk of landmines and IEDs. Children continue to be disproportionately impacted by landmines and other explosive remnants of war. Another humanitarian worker highlighted how women continued to lack mobility as a result of the mahram (male guardian) requirement, arguing that this is an example of how the Houthis are trying to impose their culture and views across the country, with a negative impact on the population as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While most argued that there is still a de facto truce despite the failure to secure its renewal back in October, this is fragile, with the potential for full conflict to erupt once again and the situation on the ground being difficult in both security and humanitarian terms, with severe implications for civilians. An analyst discussed how the recent attacks conducted by the Houthis, following the collapse of the truce, targeting critical infrastructure in the south, including the Al-Mukalla port, challenged the government’s ability to export oil and affected the stability of the currency, undermining the ability of the population to afford basic goods. A humanitarian worker argued that divisions within the Presidential Leadership Council (PLC) not only create fewer opportunities for a compromise between the parties, but also pose a risk in terms of a return to confrontation. The PLC could see a return to war as the only way to find unity in the face of the same enemy (the Houthis) while also attempting to increase its leverage on the future of the country, particularly with regards to the Saudis. Another analyst explained how, in November, Al-Qa’ida in the Arabian Peninsula has managed to increase its activity in the south of the country, showcasing another potential area of escalation and conflict in the absence of a renewal of the truce or an extended deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;challenges-linked-to-renewing-and-expanding-the-truce&quot;&gt;Challenges Linked to Renewing and Expanding the Truce&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several participants argued that the truce was agreed in the first place because it was in all parties’ interests, with one analyst explaining that there was not even the need for a monitoring mechanism given how much all sides were keen to maintain it. The difference now is that one side (the Houthis) feels that it is in a stronger position and believes it is winning the war, with the war economy benefiting it significantly. Until the benefits of peace outweigh those of war, there will be no incentive for the Houthis to end the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems to be the main reason why the outcome of the talks between the Houthis and Saudi Arabia appears to be still uncertain for most participants. Much of the focus in these talks is currently on revenue sharing compared with power sharing, which used to be the main point of contention between the two sides. One analyst explained that, despite perceiving themselves as the winning side, the Houthis have not managed to gain the control over the resources they aimed for and are thus willing to entertain the idea of a truce if they can get enough control over resources in return. In particular, the Houthis are demanding that the salaries of civil servants in Houthi-controlled areas, including their fighters, are paid through the revenues of crude oil in the areas of the PLC; they also asked for a share of these revenues as a condition for the renewal of the truce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some participants, particularly practitioners and analysts, argued that the shift in focus on to issues of wealth and resource sharing demonstrates the seriousness to reach an agreement by all sides, including the Houthis, who appear ready to consider an option that does not involve fighting, albeit with significant demands in return. It was also described as promising in terms of having the potential to unlock a broader political process – something that other tracks seem less capable of achieving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other participants, particularly from a humanitarian background, criticised the ongoing talks between the Houthis and the Saudis, arguing that even if they manage to reach a deal, this is unlikely to translate into something tangible and positive for the Yemeni population at large. The main reason is that only the Houthis are involved in the talks, with all other Yemeni actors being excluded despite having been affected by the conflict. One former practitioner also argued that there is little leverage or influence international actors can have on the Houthis. Even Iran, while being a key supporter of the Houthis and favouring specific outcomes, is sometimes sidelined as the group decides and acts based on its own calculations and interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that the Houthi-Saudi track is not connected to the UN track was presented as a further reason for scepticism among some participants, who doubted that even a potential deal could lead to a broader, more sustainable and more inclusive political settlement. One humanitarian worker also warned against the approach of the international community, which has so far failed to promote a Yemen-centric process in talks, looking instead at the conflict from the lenses of neighbouring countries, in particular the ones who belong to the Gulf Cooperation Council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-role-for-the-uk&quot;&gt;What Role for the UK?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the participants argued that international actors could and should play a more active role in improving the humanitarian situation on the ground, as well as facilitating a political settlement in Yemen. The UK was highlighted by most participants as a key actor, given its membership of the Quad (together with the US, Saudi Arabia and the UAE), its role as UN Security Council penholder on Yemen, its membership of the Human Rights Council and its strong relations with Oman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the humanitarian front, participants argued that the UK could help in ensuring the response is adequate to the needs of the population by collecting and mapping all efforts currently taking place and identifying potential gaps. While in 2021 the UK announced a significant reduction to its aid budget, several participants argued the UK is likely to continue its commitment to Yemen, including through its funding for humanitarian issues, although the impact of cuts are being felt according to humanitarian experts. Nevertheless, the UK, for instance, has a food security programme run by the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, which is aimed at aiding those identified as most in need in Yemen (including women and marginalised groups). It is also supporting a project which aims to create a more enabling environment for women’s meaningful political participation and inclusion in Yemen. Furthermore, it is continuing to fund a programme in Yemen to clear the ground of landmines and explosive remnants of war, hoping this will reduce the threat posed to civilians. Despite the limited humanitarian funding available, practitioners argued money will continue to be allocated to these projects and priorities – although, according to those with humanitarian expertise, not at the same levels across all areas as in the past, leading to shortfalls in the overall aid response. Some participants with a humanitarian background argued that more should be done by the UK in terms of protection of civilians in Yemen, especially given its membership of the UN Human Rights Council, including by ensuring the UK does not provide UK-built and licensed arms to any of the parties to the conflict, as this would further fuel confrontation and jeopardise the prospects for a political settlement. Humanitarian experts also argued that the UK has a key role to play in supporting the establishment of an independent, international accountability mechanism to hold perpetrators of violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law to account. Currently there is no mechanism in place and grave violations against civilians, including children, continue to take place with impunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK, together with other international players, can also play a role in facilitating a political settlement. While a Saudi-Houthi dialogue should be encouraged as it is the track presenting the greatest chance for a renewal of a truce or, even better, a ceasefire, ultimately the shared view was that only a UN process can guarantee that the various parties to the conflict will have a seat at the table, and that the elements of a political settlement be truly inclusive. Participants from various fields argued that only a UN-led process can guarantee the sustainability of the final agreement and allow the benefits to be perceived tangibly by a broader spectrum of the population. The UK is currently supporting the diplomatic efforts carried out by the UN, including by actively and frequently engaging with the UN Special Envoy on Yemen, Hans Grundberg. However, some participants argued that more could be done to ensure children, young people and women are better included in the process, so their voices and needs are heard, including by ensuring women can gain freedom of movement and work in a future Yemen. One practitioner also suggested that the UK could build on its efforts to address Mahramrelated restrictions and play a leading role in convening donors in the country to call for an end to the continued restrictions facing female aid workers, while at the same time supporting humanitarian access. Besides ensuring that a truce implementation supports sustained, free and unfettered humanitarian access across Yemen, the UK could also push for the inclusion of the needs of IDPs in the truce process. One humanitarian worker argued finally that actors from the south, including journalists and activists, should be included and engaged with as they have so far been marginalised from the process, with the risk they could act as a spoiler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-takeaways&quot;&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the truce had a positive, if uneven, impact for civilians on the ground, and the aim should therefore be for the international community to facilitate its renewal and expansion. The UK has a leading role to play in this sense, including by ensuring meaningful participation and inclusion from different sides of Yemeni society, including children, women and young people; continued engagement with the UN Special Envoy’s Office is key to facilitating that. The UK should build on its efforts to date and play a leading role with parties to the conflict to ensure safe and unimpeded humanitarian access, including through high-level engagement on rolling back Mahram restrictions directly with involved parties, as well as through UN leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future negotiations on the truce should also consider lessons learned from the previous agreement, including addressing the specific needs of IDPs, and better supporting the wider goals of improving humanitarian access across the country. Mining and clearance efforts must also be prioritised to reduce civilian harm, even after hostilities cease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the collapse of the truce, it is crucial for governments such as the UK to support the establishment of an international, independent accountability mechanism to collect, consolidate, preserve and analyse evidence of abuses and violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law to prepare files to facilitate criminal proceedings. Such a mechanism would be a deterrent directed at those perpetrating serious violations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regular consultations between practitioners and analysts as well as humanitarian workers and civil society organisations can ensure a better understanding of the situation on the ground and the collective identification of ways to increase the chances of creating a more stable and secure Yemen.&lt;/p&gt;

Officially established by Congress in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2020, the Space Force garnered bipartisan support.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organized within the Department of the Air Force, the USSF functions at an equal level as the U.S. Air Force, similar to how the Marine Corps is structured within the Department of the Navy. Under Title 10, Section 9081, of the U.S. Code, the Space Force has the responsibility to organize, train, and equip space-focused military forces. Specifically, the Space Force is responsible for space launch, satellite operations, surveillance of the space environment, satellite defense, and some missile defense functions. Previously, space forces and missions were scattered throughout the DoD. With the establishment of the Space Force, the DoD envisions consolidating all or many of these missions, forces, and authorities within the purview of the Space Force. The Space Force will then provide space support to other branches of the Armed Forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fast-facts&quot;&gt;Fast Facts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mission&lt;/strong&gt;: “[T]he USSF is responsible for organizing, training, and equipping Guardians to conduct global space operations that enhance the way our joint and coalition forces fight, while also offering decision-makers military options to achieve national objectives.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leadership&lt;/strong&gt;: Chief of Space Operations, four-star general (General B. Chance Saltzman); Vice Chief of Space Operations, four-star general (General David D. Thompson): and Chief Master Sergeant (CMSSF Roger A. Towberman).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motto&lt;/strong&gt;: Sempra Supra, or Always Above&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Headquarters&lt;/strong&gt;: The Pentagon, Washington D.C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Size&lt;/strong&gt;: The Space Force is the smallest U.S. armed service, consisting of 8,600 military personnel (4,286 enlisted and 4,314 officers), 4,927 civilian personnel, and operating over 100 satellites. Its projected size is 16,000 personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FY 2023 Budget&lt;/strong&gt;: $26.3 billion. The Space Force budget for FY 2023 includes $4 billion for operations and maintenance (O&amp;amp;M); $16.6 billion for research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&amp;amp;E); $4.4 billion for procurement; and $1.1 billion for military personnel costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Base Locations&lt;/strong&gt;: Buckley Space Force Base in Aurora, Colorado; Los Angeles Air Force Base in El Segundo, California; Patrick Space Force Base near Satellite Beach, Florida; Peterson Space Force Base in Colorado Springs, Colorado; Schriever Space Force Base in Colorado Springs, Colorado; and Vandenberg Space Force Base near Lompoc, California.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;history&quot;&gt;History&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although U.S. military space capabilities have advanced remarkably since the 1950s, they were divided amongst the different services, with the Air Force, Army, and Navy all maintaining programs focused on space. Responding to a deepening dependence on space, concerns about this disparate structure began to emerge, inspiring discussions since the 1960s over the creation of a separate space-focused service in the military. Having gained the attention of Congress, the Rumsfeld (1999-2001) and the Allard commissions (2006-2008) were created to address the organizational structure of national security space. However, despite concerning advances made by competitors in developing counterspace technology — culminating in the 2007 Chinese anti-satellite test — neither report brought about any significant reorganization. While the House-passed FY 2018 NDAA introduced the creation of a Space Corps, which was not carried forward in the final bill, it was President Trump’s 2019 directive to establish a separate military service for space that broke nearly twenty years of inaction. That proposal, which directed the standup of a Space Force within the Department of the Air Force, enjoyed bipartisan support and led to Congress passing the proposal as part of the FY 2020 NDAA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-does-the-space-force-do&quot;&gt;What does the Space Force do?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Space Force was designed to create one organization responsible for the training, development, and acquisition of equipment to support the U.S. military’s space capabilities and operations. Fielding over 100 satellites, USSF Guardians operate and maintain command and control of satellites that provide positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT), strategic and tactical communications, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), and weather. Guardians conduct space launches and operate the Nation’s space launch ranges, while also maintaining an extensive network of satellites, ground-based telescopes and radars that provide early warning of missile launches and track spacecraft and orbital debris. They are called upon to provide space superiority, employing broad offensive and defensive capabilities to support U.S. military missions. The responsibilities of the Space Force include the cultivation of space professionals, the maturation of military doctrine, and the organization of combat-ready forces for use by Combatant Commands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;internal-organization&quot;&gt;Internal Organization&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Secretary of the Air Force serves as the civilian leader of the Space Force and oversees both the Air Force and Space Force. For the military, the FY 2020 NDAA specified that a four-star general will serve as Chief of Space Operations (CSO) to lead the Space Force and be a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Chief Master Sergeant is the most senior enlisted advisor of the Space Force. This position “serves as the personal adviser to the Chief of Space Operations and the Secretary of the Air Force on all issues regarding the welfare, readiness, morale, proper utilization and development of the U.S. Space Force.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Space Force was intentionally designed to be a slim, agile, and mission-focused organization, and thus, its Guardian and staff numbers are significantly smaller than other military services in order to remove the traditional layers of bureaucracy. The Space Force relies on the Department of the Air Force to provide everyday support functions such as logistics, base operations and security, civilian personnel HR and hiring, IT support, audits and financial support, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Space Force is supported by three field commands, Space Operations Command (SpOC), Space Systems Command (SSC), and Space Training and Readiness Command (STARCOM), that are further separated into 16 mission Deltas (USSF organizational units) and three Base Deltas that provide mission support functions. Two acquisition organizations, the Space Development Agency (SDA) and the Space Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO), also support the Space Force and report directly to the Chief of Space Operations and the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Space Acquisitions and Integration for acquisition matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A headquarters function, the Office of the Chief of Space Operations, supporting the CSO and SecAF comprises a mix of general officers and senior executive civilians in roles of deputy chiefs of space operations, including human capital; intelligence; operations, cyber, and nuclear; and strategy, plans, programs, and requirements; and technology and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of the three field commands, the SpOC and SSC are led by three-star generals, and STARCOM is led by a two-star general. Each field command is supported by Deltas of around 400 personnel, each focusing on a specific mission area and containing supporting squadrons. Deltas are led by Colonels, while squadrons are led by Lieutenant Colonels.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;space-operations-command-spoc&quot;&gt;Space Operations Command (SpOC)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SpOC is responsible for operating space capabilities and presenting them to commanders for employment. SpOC is the primary force provider of space forces and capabilities for combatant commanders, coalition partners, the joint force, and the nation. Uniquely operating at the nexus of the USSF and U.S. Space Command (USSPACECOM), SpOC functions as both a field command for the USSF and a service command for USSPACECOM. Guiding SpOC are three priorities: preparing (a combat-ready, ISR-led, cyber-secure force), partnering (across the U.S. government, allies, and commercial partners), and projecting (combat power in, from, and to space). Furthermore, SpOC is supported by Space Base Deltas (SBDs) 1 and 2, which provide mission support functions on military installations, such as IT and medical support. SpOC is comprised of the following nine Deltas and two Base Deltas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Space Delta 2 – Space Domain Awareness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mission&lt;/strong&gt;: “Prepare, present and, if necessary, fight to protect and defend the U.S. and our allies from attack in, through and from space.” Guardians operate, command and control ground-based optical and radar systems that surveil objects in orbit and in deep space, including tracking spacecraft and debris, detecting maneuvering objects, and assessing conjunction risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Squadrons&lt;/strong&gt;: The 18th Space Defense Squadron (SDS), the 19th (SDS), the 15th Space Surveillance Squadron (SPSS), the 20th SPSS, and the 21st Operations Support Squadron (OSS)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Headquarters&lt;/strong&gt;: Peterson Space Force Base, Colorado&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;space-systems-command-ssc&quot;&gt;Space Systems Command (SSC)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SSC is responsible for developing, acquiring, and fielding lethal and resilient space capabilities for warfighters. Additionally, SSC is responsible for the launch, developmental testing, on-orbit checkout, sustainment and maintenance of USSF space systems, and oversight of USSF science and technology activities. SSC is organized into five program executive offices: Assured Access to Space; Communications and Positioning, Navigation &amp;amp; Timing (PNT); Space Sensing; Battle Management Command, Control &amp;amp; Communications (BMC3); and Space Domain Awareness and Combat Power. It also includes the Commercial Services Office (COMSO), focused on procuring commercially available space services. SSC is comprised of the following two Deltas and one SBD:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Space Launch Delta 30&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;STARCOM trains and educates space professionals and develops combat-ready space forces to address warfighting challenges in the space domain. As part of this mandate, STARCOM is also responsible for developing space warfighting doctrine, tactics, techniques, and procedures; as well as the testing and evaluation of USSF capabilities. STARCOM is comprised of the following Deltas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Space Delta 1 – Training&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mission&lt;/strong&gt;: Developing Guardians to dominate in competition and conflict through a career-long continuum of innovative basic military, initial skills, and advanced training courses as well as Space Force and joint exercises.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Squadrons&lt;/strong&gt;: The 1st Delta Operations Squadron (DOS), the 319th CTS, the 328th Weapons Squadron (WPS), the 392nd CTS, and 533rd Training Squadron (TRS)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;additional-organizations&quot;&gt;Additional Organizations&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Space Development Agency&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transferred to USSF from the oversight of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering in October 2022, the Space Development Agency (SDA) is responsible for the rapid delivery of space-based capabilities to the joint warfighter to support terrestrial missions. It is building a proliferated low Earth orbit (LEO) constellation, initially focused on missile tracking and SATCOM connectivity to quickly relay data to a range of warfighter platforms. Of note, SDA does not fall under the command of Space Systems Command. Instead, the SDA reports to the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Space Acquisitions and Integration for acquisition matters and to the Chief of Space Operations for all other matters. It retains the authority to set its own policies and decide how to develop and buy its own systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Space Rapid Capabilities Office&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Established in the FY 18 NDAA, with further authorities granted under the FY 19 NDAA, the Space Rapid Capabilities Office (Space RCO) is a direct report to the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Space Acquisitions and Integration for acquisition matters and to the Chief of Space Operations for all other matters, similar to SDA. Forming another component of the USSF’s acquisition capabilities, the Space RCO is tasked with delivering “operationally dominant space capabilities at the speed of warfighting relevance.” Organized in a streamlined manner with agile decision-making authorities, a short chain-of-command, and integrated support functions like contracting, the Space RCO fills a niche within the USSF where it can take “measured risks” in developing and quickly delivering prototypes to the SSC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Service Component Commands&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The USSF has activated three service components assigned to combatant commands to provide “service-specific administration and support functions,” as outlined in Title 10, U.S. Code. Service Component commands are personnel, units, organizations, or other support forces that belong to a distinct military service but are assigned to support a Combatant Commander. SpOC performs the service component function for U.S. Space Command (SPACECOM). As of December 2022, the USSF also supports two regional combatant commands and a sub-unified command, with component commands at U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (USINDOPACOM), U.S. Forces Korea (USFK), and U.S. Central Command (USCENTCOM). These service components will “integrate at the component level and provide combatant commanders a subordinate space commander, organic space planning and employment expertise, and space command and control that is focused on the joint force’s operational warfighting priorities and requirements.” In the future, additional space component commands will likely emerge at many, if not all, of the other combatant commands.&lt;/p&gt;

Then came the Great Frost of 1708–9. Birds were said to have frozen in midflight and dropped dead to the ground. Charles’s army of more than 40,000 men soon lost half its strength from exposure and starvation. In an attempt to escape the cold, the Swedish king led the remnants of his army south into Ukraine to join the Cossack leader, Hetman Ivan Mazepa, and his forces. But the damage was done. The following summer, Peter’s Russian army routed Charles’s weakened forces at the Battle of Poltava, bringing an end to Sweden’s empire and its designs on Russia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Swedes were neither the first nor the last European army to suffer the ravages of “General Winter” on Russia’s frontiers. Exacerbated by the vast expanse of the Eurasian landmass, winter fighting there has often proved to be the downfall of great armies. For centuries, this phenomenon has often worked to Russia’s advantage, as a succession of powerful militaries have succumbed to inadequate equipment, deficient supply lines, and poor preparation. But as Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine enters the harshest months of the year, there are many indications that this time it may be Russia, rather than its adversary, that suffers the worst consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;his-empire-for-a-horse&quot;&gt;His Empire for a Horse&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe’s best-known winter defeat in Russia came in 1812 — just over a century after the Battle of Poltava — when Napoleon’s Grande Armée retreated from Moscow. Russia’s scorched-earth tactics, which left the French with no food or shelter along the line of withdrawal, made the effect even more deadly. Yet the greatest casualties had occurred earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Grande Armée had been almost half a million strong when it crossed the River Neman, the frontier between Prussia and Russia, in June 1812. But it soon lost a third of its strength from summer heat, disease, hunger, and exhaustion as the emperor forced his men on toward Moscow. Although the retreat into Russia’s expanse was unintended at first, Tsar Alexander I’s commanders soon realized the advantage. They kept withdrawing east and did not make a stand until General Mikhail Kutuzov was ordered to halt Napoleon at Borodino, 75 miles west of Moscow. The battle proved a costly victory for the French, even though it enabled them to enter Moscow unopposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it was the approaching winter that proved fatal for the invaders. Napoleon wasted five weeks in Moscow expecting the tsar to come to terms. When the Grande Armée finally started to withdraw to central Europe on October 19, the soldiers were still wearing their summer uniforms. They had also lost their baggage trains and could expect little food along the way. Their greatest deficiency was in cavalry to hold off marauding Cossacks. The shaggy Cossack ponies were accustomed to the winter blizzards, which began a month later, while the last of the chargers and draft horses from western Europe collapsed from the cold and lack of forage. Starving soldiers hacked off their meat even before they were dead. Desertion or surrender was far from a guarantee of survival. Avenging Cossacks waited to skewer enemy soldiers on their long lances; Russian peasants simply slaughtered them with scythes. By early December, Napoleon feared a coup d’état during his absence, and, abandoning his army, headed for Paris before his frozen men could reach safety. By this point, his forces had suffered nearly 400,000 casualties, and he had lost his reputation for invincibility on the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less well known, although perhaps equally significant, was the way Russia won. Despite having lost 200,000 of its own men, Russia’s military leadership was far less concerned about casualties than was Napoleon. Russian officers still treated their peasant soldiers as little better than serfs (and serfdom would not be abolished in Russia for another 50 years). This lack of interest in soldiers’ well-being — and the casual attitude to massive losses through so-called meat-grinder tactics — are apparent in Putin’s army in Ukraine today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;red-terror-white-frost&quot;&gt;Red Terror, White Frost&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another half century later, in World War I, the attitude of Russia’s military authorities had barely changed. Their men were expendable. Trench life for the rank and file along the eastern front that ran through Belorussia, Galicia, and Romania from 1915 to 1917 was an inhuman experience. And many resented that officers retired each night to the warmth and relative comfort of peasant log huts behind the front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Having dug themselves into the ground,” the Russian writer and anti-tsarist Maxim Gorky observed of the enlisted men, “they live in rain and snow, in filth, in cramped conditions; they are being worn out by disease and eaten by vermin; they live like beasts.” Many lacked boots and had to resort to bast shoes made from birch bark. Stations for treating the wounded at the front were almost as primitive as they had been in the Crimean War. This reality was in cruel contrast to the photographs of the tsarina and her grand duchess daughters immaculately dressed as nurses before the February 1917 revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winter conditions in the Russian Civil War (1917–­21) were even worse. The most pitiful victims were the civilian refugees fleeing the Bolshevik onslaught, or what became known as the Red Terror. During the winter of 1919, the collapse of Admiral Kolchak’s White Russian armies in Siberia produced terrible scenes along the jammed Trans-Siberian Railroad. Aristocrats, middle-class families, and anti-Bolsheviks of all backgrounds were trying to escape to Vladivostok in the Russian Far East to avoid capture by the Communist Red Army, which was advancing from the Urals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In World War I, many Russians lacked boots and had to resort to shoes made of birch bark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By mid-December of that year, the Reds caught up with the tail of the line and took the southern Siberian city and industrial hub of Novo-Nikolaevsk (present-day Novosibirsk), along with numerous trains still blocked there. The city itself was in the grip of a typhus epidemic. All horses, carts, and sledges available had already been taken, so the desperate set out on foot, not knowing that farther ahead in Krasnoyarsk cases had reached more than 30,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A mass retreat is one of the saddest and most despairing sights in the world,” Captain Brian Horrocks, a British officer in the Allied intervention in Russia, wrote. “The sick just fell down and died in the snow.” He was horrified by the squalid conditions faced even by those refugees who had managed to find a place in packed cattle wagons. Most wagons lacked any heating as temperatures dropped to as low as minus 22 degrees Fahrenheit. “The thing which impressed me most was the fortitude with which the women, many of them reared in luxury, were facing their hopeless future,” he wrote. “The menfolk were much more given to self-pity.” Kolchak’s staff officers were by then drinking themselves into oblivion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As White Russian, Czech, and Polish commanders argued bitterly over priority for their troop trains, starving and frozen refugees were dying at an alarming rate. One officer wrote that trains at some Siberian stations were unloading hundreds of bodies of people who had died from cold and disease. “These bodies were stacked up at the stations like so much cordwood,” another officer wrote. “Those who remained alive never talked, never thought of anything save how they might escape death and get farther and farther away from the Bolsheviks.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the northern Caucasus, known for its blazing summer heat, winter could sometimes produce drops in temperature of more than 22 degrees Fahrenheit in less than an hour. In February 1920, General Dmitry Pavlov’s cavalry divisions were caught in the open by a sudden blizzard. Pavlov “lost half of his horses which froze in the steppe,” the Red Army high command noted. But the human losses were far worse. “We left behind in the steppe thousands of men frozen to death, and the blizzard buried them,” a Cossack officer recounted. Those who survived did so by huddling against their horses. Pavlov, who had ignored warnings of the possible change in the weather, suffered severe frostbite himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stalins-ice-breakers&quot;&gt;Stalin’s Ice Breakers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the twentieth century, winter conditions on the Eurasian landmass posed a growing threat not just to humans and horses but also to military weaponry. Sometimes this worked to Russia’s detriment. Despite its disproportionate strength and its massive expenditure of ammunition, the Soviet army failed to break Finnish resistance in the Winter War of 1939–40, following Stalin’s invasion of Finland. The Finns, proving themselves even better practitioners of winter tactics than their invaders, terrorized Red Army soldiers by day and night as their white-camouflaged ski troops launched surprise attacks from forests, then disappeared like ghosts. Their bravery and skill persuaded Stalin to accept Finland’s independence. But it also served as a lesson for the war to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the rapid military mechanization between the two world wars, the Soviet Union had created the largest tank force in the world. The Red Army at least learned that guns and engines needed special lubricants in extreme conditions. Such measures proved key in Stalin’s ability to block Hitler’s armies in front of Moscow in December 1941. Both the German army and the Luftwaffe were unprepared. They had to light fires under their vehicles and aircraft engines to defrost them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;German soldiers referred bitterly to winter conditions as “weather for Russians.” They envied the Red Army’s winter uniforms, with white camouflage suits and padded cotton jackets, which were far more effective than German greatcoats. Russian military historians have attributed the comparatively low rate of frostbite and trench foot among Soviet forces to their old military practice of using layered linen foot bandages instead of socks. German soldiers also suffered more rapidly because their jackboots had steel studs that drained any warmth. In February 1943, when the remnants of Field Marshal Paulus’s Sixth Army finally surrendered at Stalingrad — the psychological turning point of World War II — more than 90,000 German prisoners limped out of the city on frost-ravaged feet. Yet their suffering had been caused less by cold than by Hitler’s orders to hold on there and the inability of German panzers with their narrow tracks to counterattack in the snow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;General Winter also played a major role in the Red Army’s final victory in 1945. The great Soviet breakthrough in January, a charge from the River Vistula to the River Oder, depended on the weather. Russian forecasters had predicted “a strange winter,” with “heavy rain and wet snow” after the hard frosts of January. An order went out to repair boots. Stalin and the Red Army’s supreme command set January 12 as the start date for the offensive, so that the Soviets’ tank armies could take advantage of the deep-frozen ground before any thaw set in. Characteristically, Stalin falsely claimed that he had advanced the date from January 20 to take pressure off the Americans in the Ardennes. (U.S. forces had already halted the German offensive there just after Christmas.) In fact, there was another motive: Stalin wanted to control the bulk of Polish territory before he met U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill at Yalta in the first week of February.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;More than 90,000 German prisoners limped out of Stalingrad on frost-ravaged feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stalin’s commanders did not let him down. “Our tanks move faster than the trains to Berlin,” boasted the ebullient Colonel Iosif Gusakovsky. He had not bothered to wait for bridging equipment to reach the frontlines before attempting to cross the River Pilica. He simply ordered his leading tanks to smash the ice with gunfire, then to drive straight across the riverbed. The tanks, acting like icebreakers, pushed the ice aside “with a terrible thundering noise,” a terrifying experience for the poor drivers. The German eastern front in Poland collapsed under the armored onslaught, once again because the Soviet T-34’s broad tracks could cope with the ice and snow far better than any German panzer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 1945, the Red Army’s achievements in winter warfare gave it a fearsome reputation in the West. It was not until the Soviet Union’s ill-planned invasion of Czechoslovakia in the summer of 1968 — the Warsaw Pact forces lacked maps, food supplies, and fuel — that Western analysts first began to suspect that they might have overestimated the Soviets’ warfighting abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, in the 1980s, the collapse of the Soviet empire was marked by its doomed struggle to control Afghanistan, a terrain that made winter warfare impossible for conventional armies. Then, during the economic collapse in the 1990s, Russian President Boris Yeltsin’s government often proved unable to pay officers and soldiers alike and corruption became institutionalized. Conscripts were frequently on the edge of starvation because their rations were sold off; theft, bullying, and ill discipline became rampant. Spare parts from vehicles, as well as anything from fuel to light bulbs, boots, and especially any cold weather kit, disappeared onto the black market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corruption became even worse following Russia’s chaotic invasion of Georgia in 2008. Putin began throwing money at the armed forces. The waste on prestige projects encouraged contractors and generals alike to pad their bank accounts. Little appears to have been done in reassessing military doctrine. The Russian idea of urban warfare had still not evolved from World War II, with their artillery, the “god of war,” smashing everything to rubble. This approach would continue during Russian intervention in the Syrian civil war from 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet Putin’s greatest triumph in Russian eyes was the covert seizure of Crimea the year before by infiltrating it with un-uniformed “little green men” from special forces. This was part of Putin’s angry reaction to the Maidan revolution in Kyiv, which forced his ally President Viktor Yanukovych to flee and led to the start of fighting in the Donbas region of Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;putin-in-denial&quot;&gt;Putin in Denial&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2022, eight years later, Putin launched his “special military operation” in Ukraine. At the time, the vanguard was told to bring their parade uniforms ready to celebrate victory — one of the greatest examples of military hubris in history. Yet seven disastrous months later, when the Kremlin was finally forced to order a “partial mobilization” of the Russian population, it had to warn those called up that uniforms and equipment were in short supply. They would have to provide their own body armor and even ask their mothers and girlfriends for sanitary pads to use instead of field dressings. The lack of bandages is astonishing, especially now as winter intensifies, since they are vital to keep frost from entering open wounds. Adding to the dangers are mortar rounds hitting frozen ground: unlike soft mud, which absorbs most of the blast, frozen ground causes fragments to ricochet, in sometimes lethal ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin’s new commander in chief in the south, General Sergei Surovikin, is determined to clamp down on attempts by some conscripts to avoid combat. Many have been resorting to the sabotage of fuel, weapons, and vehicles, to say nothing of self-inflicted wounds and desertion. Yet the Russian army’s long-standing structural problem — its shortage of experienced noncommissioned officers — has also led to a terrible record of maintaining weapons, equipment, and vehicles. These problems will become especially costly in winter with sensitive technology such as drones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As both sides enter a far more challenging season of fighting, the outcome will largely depend on morale and determination. While Russian troops curse their shortages and lack of hot food, Ukrainian troops are now benefiting from supplies of insulated camouflage suits, tents with stoves, and sleeping bags provided by Canada and the Nordic nations. Putin seems to be in denial about the state of his army and the way that General Winter will favor his opponents. He may also have made another mistake by concentrating his missiles against Ukraine’s energy network and its vulnerable civilian population. They will endure the greatest suffering, but there is little chance that they will break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The increasing wariness of governments in Australia, the US and the UK over potential foreign state interference by countries like Russia and China in their domestic affairs has sparked a greater examination of the tactics and objectives of malign state actors. However, the debate over this challenge is unclear in other parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malign interference can be characterised as activity that takes place through covert means that obfuscate the role of the state directing the activity, not in conformity to national law, is conducted through coercive means, or seeks to create confusion amongst a population through disinformation efforts. The paper also briefly discusses the concept of ‘sharp power’, which best captures the unique nature of the threat of political interference – namely, co-optation of key decision-makers, influencers and thought leaders for the purpose of internalising, advocating for or advancing the interests of foreign authoritarian powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across Southeast Asia, a region of strategic interest to authoritarian and democratic countries alike for its economic dynamism and strategic location, public debate and academic engagement on the question of foreign state interference is limited. This is likely due to political sensitivities over whether governments are seen to be sufficiently addressing the challenge and, where it concerns China, whether they could be seen as taking sides in the wider geopolitical tension between China and the US. Discussion around domestic actor malign interference, for example through disinformation on social media platforms, is somewhat easier, as seen in the case study chapters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the sensitivity of the subject of state interference, this paper primarily relies on open source material, supplemented by interviews with key policymakers and experts in Southeast Asia under rules of non-attribution. The paper analyses the main vectors of malign foreign influence across key Southeast Asian states, as well as the region’s geopolitical relevance to authoritarian foreign states potentially interested in conducting interference for political objectives. The combination of these three factors affects their vulnerability to malign foreign influence. While this paper cannot address the challenge of foreign state interference in its entirety or map each country’s specific experience in depth, it seeks to offer a starting point for further research and discussions. The paper provides brief policy recommendations as a basis for this. It goes without saying that any long-term solution should be anchored in a systematic recognition of the agency of Southeast Asian states in light of their decades-long struggle for autonomy and national development. However, given the international challenge of foreign state interference, this paper highlights a few ways in which partner countries who are seeking to mitigate their own domestic experiences of the challenge can work with Southeast Asian countries to share lessons learned and exchange issues on risk mitigation. These are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Continue support for local media and civil society.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Offer alternatives where investment is needed in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Increase information exchange on malign interference.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Help develop risk mitigation strategies in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intensification of strategic competition among states is increasingly taking place in the ‘grey zone’ between acceptable state activity and interference, with the aim of pursuing national strategic interests without resorting to war. States by nature seek to influence one another to protect their interests; this is entirely legitimate when the state-led activity takes place transparently and within legal means, but it becomes malign interference when the activity takes place through covert means which obfuscate the role of the state directing the activity, is not in conformity with national law, is conducted through coercive means, or seeks to create confusion for a population through disinformation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liberal democracies are increasingly becoming aware of this grey zone threat. The UK and allies such as the US and Australia have increasingly revealed malign interference activity within their borders and have attributed it to Iran, Russia and China, to varying extents. Authoritarian regimes engaged in strategic competition below the threshold of outright war, such as Iran, Russia and China, seek to weaken democratic systems through economic interference, information operations and political influence. While investigative journalism, academic research and institutional checks and balances have exposed a range of activities in these countries and have driven further enquiry, it is not clear to what extent malign interference activity is taking place outside of Europe and specific countries, such as Australia and the US, where the issue of malign interference has been politically and publicly explored as a serious challenge to national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Close allies and partners such as the UK, US and Australia are seeking to engage more strategically in the Indo-Pacific and specifically Southeast Asia, as laid out in their various national strategies, policy documents and official statements. While there are many reasons for this, including economic opportunity, one common security concern is potential growing Chinese influence and interference, through both legitimate and illegitimate means, and the challenge that this presents to their interests. These countries’ engagement in the region includes upholding shared principles such as economic sustainability, free trade based on equal access, and democratic principles of transparency and good governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper is not able to encompass the entirety of types of interference, nor does it purport to comprehensively cover all potential political, economic and informational interference activities. For the purposes of this study, the paper will examine a few case studies in Southeast Asia in terms of the following potential avenues for interference:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Informational: including attempts to use social media or other platforms to advance pro-hostile-state messaging or narratives, as well as hostile states seeking to influence local media communities in order to advance their narratives. It includes, for example, activities of foreign diplomatic missions and their proxies, as well as overseas associations, aimed at manipulating national media outlets and social media platforms through the deliberate propagation of falsehoods.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Political: influential communities, subversive actors. This includes efforts to become involved in local politics or influential communities, or with local communities of any ethnicity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Economic: purchase of or investment in sensitive critical national infrastructure (CNI), defined as infrastructure that is either critical to national GDP or is in a sensitive area such as telecommunications or national defence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the focus of Western liberal states on Southeast Asia as part of their Indo-Pacific strategies, this paper seeks to understand whether malign interference activity by authoritarian states across the 10 ASEAN member states (Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam) is seen as a destabilising threat to national security. It seeks to better understand the current level of debate in Southeast Asia on influence versus interference as a foreign policy tool, and will examine to what extent malign interference activity by authoritarian states is taking place in the region and what the responses have been to any existing or potential malign interference. It will focus primarily on China as the largest actor in Southeast Asia, but will also discuss Iran, Russia and North Korea as authoritarian regimes whose activities are of concern to liberal democracies like the UK, US and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper offers examples of activity of concern, highlights potential vulnerabilities and strengths, and aims to underscore regional responses to and perspectives on this global challenge. One main finding is that the political sensitivity around malign interference activities in this region means that the debate on this topic in Southeast Asia is less prominent publicly than, for example, it is in Australia, the US or Europe. This is a particularly sensitive topic due to the debate over national security and whether governments are responding sufficiently to threats, as well as the fact that debates around China are by their very nature difficult in the region, as countries actively seek not to take sides in what is seen as a geopolitical competition between the US and Southeast Asia’s top trading partner. This limits the willingness of individuals, irrespective of sector, to discuss such topics openly, while academic debate seems likewise limited. Discussion around domestic actor malign interference, particularly with regard to disinformation, remains a serious challenge in the region, as discussed in the case study chapters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The methodology employed in the research for this paper has chiefly consisted of desk-based open source research, as well as semi-structured interviews for the purpose of supplementing research findings and engaging with specific experts on influence and interference activities in the region. For the purposes of the regional overview chapter, 15 interviews on the three types of potential interference activities that this paper examines were conducted with experts from and based in the region. Interviews were conducted under the Chatham House Rule, and as such any information used is non-attributable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter I presents a regional overview of all 10 focus countries. The subsequent three chapters, one on each area vulnerable to malign interference activity, were authored by experts based in Southeast Asia and selected for their expertise in the areas they explore. In Chapter II, Benjamin Ang defines what constitutes information operations and hostile actions and explores the countermeasures put in place by the governments of Malaysia and Singapore. In Chapter III, Richard Javad Heydarian assesses the potential vulnerability to ‘sharp power’ as a form of political interference in the region. In Chapter IV, Ryan Clarke explores the debate around potential economic interference in Southeast Asia by China, focusing specifically on the example of Chinese investment in high-speed rail in Malaysia, Laos and Thailand as part of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in the region. Clarke examines, in particular, the potentially political nature of infrastructure investment. The paper concludes with a summary of the key findings of the regional overview and subsequent thematic chapters, and presents policy recommendations for the UK and partners inside and outside Southeast Asia seeking to support countries in the region to mitigate the challenge of malign interference activities by states. While this study ultimately focuses on China in particular, it is not able to delve into whether other countries are engaged in similar interference activities; there is therefore a need for further research in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;regional-overview&quot;&gt;Regional Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current scholarly and think tank literature on the question of malign interference by state actors in the 10 ASEAN member states is limited, particularly when pertaining to specific analyses of economic interference, political interference and information operations. The limited public engagement on these topics is equally reflected in the number of experts in Southeast Asia specialising in malign interference by states. In some countries, such as Laos, it would appear that there is no in-country expertise on the subject, while in others requests for expert interviews were met with a muted response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lack of academic engagement and public debate seems to negatively impact the baseline understanding of the subject, as seen in a confusion as to what constitutes influence and interference, and what differentiates one from the other. Without a firm understanding of the theoretical concepts involved, explorations of the subject within a national context risk drawing incorrect conclusions. This chapter first defines the concepts of influence versus interference before exploring the extent of academic and expert debate on malign interference by states in each of the 10 focus countries in Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;interference-or-influence&quot;&gt;Interference or Influence?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Influence’ can be understood as legitimate action that involves public, ‘above board’ activities. ‘Interference’ is illegitimate or illicit action, encompassing, for example, activities that are covert, coercive or corrupt, including cyber attacks and disinformation operations. These are malign when they seek to harm or go against the interests of the state they are targeting. Former CIA director John Brennan, rebutting claims by former president Donald Trump that China had attempted to interfere with the 2018 US midterm elections, made such a distinction. In 2017, then-prime minister of Australia Malcolm Turnbull, in a speech introducing new legislative amendments on espionage and foreign interference, specified that activities in support of foreign governments are not illegal unless they are ‘covert, coercive or corrupt’, making the distinction between ‘legitimate influence and unacceptable interference’. However, previously legal means of exerting influence, such as political funding, are now only considered legitimate if they are transparent, as the Australian Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Public Register and associated legislation seeks to ensure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In literature and policy on the topic, the distinction is generally less sharp. Indeed, Adam Henschke, Matthew Sussex and Courteney O’Connor suggest that creating a distinction between foreign influence and foreign interference is ‘unhelpful outside a strict regulatory context’ because both can be used to undermine democratic processes. They note that hostile actors can exploit ‘grey spaces between legal influence and illegal interference’ and adapt in ways that provide them with plausible deniability. For instance, these authors do not categorise disinformation in election campaigns or longer-term propaganda and lobbying efforts as interference, as they are not illegal; instead, they point to activities such as corruption or tampering with election results as examples of interference. Both, however, are damaging. Making a similar point, Alex Joske highlights the risks of disaggregating activity under China’s United Front system, noting the importance of considering the impact of the consolidated effort rather than assessing activities in isolation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This serves to emphasise the lack of common definitions of foreign influence and foreign interference, as well as the challenge of finding a widely accepted distinction between the two terms. Kristine Berzina and Etienne Soula note that such ambiguity ‘can delay or complicate lawmakers’ initiatives and muddy civil society’s efforts to build awareness and rally opposition against incursions into democratic processes’. While acknowledging the risks of creating a definition that is too broad and may thus curb freedom of expression, too narrow so as to exclude certain activities, or too focused on tactics and consequently not flexible enough to adapt to evolving technologies, they propose that the core criteria in determining whether an activity constitutes interference should be intent and transparency. Michael N Schmitt characterises ‘intervention’ as activities that impact matters otherwise left to the sole discretion of the state, such as the ‘choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy’, and distinguishes it from influence by pointing to the involvement of coercion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Australian context, Katherine Mansted argues that given the emerging grey zone between acceptable state-based activity and interference, it may be useful ‘to move policy frameworks and public discourse beyond a binary divide between “influence” and “interference” and instead to think of foreign influence along a continuum of risk’. The measures she proposes include updating legislation to capture influence activities that may be ‘precursors’ to foreign interference, such as data collection, surveillance and media ownership. Writing about Chinese influence and interference in the UK, Charles Parton proposes a spectrum from ‘acceptable influence activities, through unwanted but tolerable interference, to unacceptable interference against which action is required’. Andrew Chubb has written extensively on China’s overseas political activities in the UK and Australia, and explores this in greater detail. Using case studies from both the UK and Australia, Chubb stresses the need to recognise the differences between issues of national security, human rights and academic freedom, and offers recommendations for what targeted responses might look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Australian government clearly outlines the distinction between foreign influence and interference, describing the former as activities ‘conducted in an open and transparent manner’ that ‘contribute positively to public debate’ and the latter as activities that are ‘coercive, corrupting, deceptive, [and] clandestine’ and that are ‘contrary to Australia’s sovereignty, values and national interests’. The Canadian government appears to use the terms interchangeably. The US does not articulate a distinction between foreign influence and foreign interference, but clearly defines the latter in the context of elections in an executive order entitled ‘Imposing Certain Sanctions in the Event of Foreign Interference in a United States Election’, signed by then-president Donald Trump in 2018 and extended by President Joe Biden in September 2021. The order defines foreign interference as ‘covert, fraudulent, deceptive, or unlawful actions … undertaken with the purpose or effect of influencing, undermining confidence in, or altering the result or reported result of, the election, or undermining public confidence in election processes or institutions’. However, the FBI refers to activities that seem to fall under foreign interference according to the above definition as ‘foreign influence’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-findings&quot;&gt;Key Findings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This regional overview focuses specifically on instances of interference by authoritarian state actors. Interviewees and other sources did not always clearly differentiate between influence and interference, and over the course of this review, conflation between the two terms in Southeast Asia was prevalent. Overwhelmingly, China arose most frequently when discussing sources of potential state-led or state-directed interference. Mention of Russia was only made on three occasions, and in two of these instances (from Myanmar and Vietnam) the relationship should be interpreted as benign. Iran is also viewed as a benign actor in at least two countries. As seen in the following country-specific overviews, there is clearly a distinct paucity of research and publications about malign interference activities by states across Southeast Asia, and the only significant work on this subject, with the exception of Singapore, has been undertaken extra-regionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Brunei, there are no publicly avowed examples of disinformation campaigns and no discourse about interference among public intellectuals. There are, however, concerns harboured within the Bruneian establishment over hidden debt, compromise of public health data, and elite capture. Proprietary interviews with regional security specialists reveal growing concerns that China is increasingly aggressively pursuing its elite capture strategy in order to secure exclusive rights to Brunei’s enormous onshore and offshore oil and natural gas reserves. One prominent method consists of offering free shares and other economic interests in Chinese companies that would be involved. These incentives span the entire spectrum of a project, from shares in the drilling equipment company to shares in the company that is involved in retail distribution in China. As these are Chinese corporate entities, their shareholding structures and other relevant data are deemed to be state secrets under China’s relevant law, thereby shielding any Bruneian officials from scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cambodia and Laos, as states close to China and in line with the authoritarian nature of their regimes, are so penetrated by Chinese geopolitical interests that there is no obvious domestic discourse on malign interference activity by the authoritarian states under examination in this paper. Approaches made to public intellectuals were met with a limited response. There are, however, a handful of dissidents and opponents to the regime who have written on the subject of foreign political interference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Cambodia, China has increasingly sought to position itself as a ‘no questions asked’ provider of dual-use infrastructure investment, especially in port/maritime facilities such as the recent Ream Naval Base. Sources in the financial services industry note that China appears to view Cambodia in a similar light as Laos and therefore as readily available for elite capture. China is also actively incentivising key government officials to execute Mekong-origin water-sharing agreements that are not in Cambodia’s long-term interests by (similar to the methods used in Brunei) offering shares and other considerations in Chinese companies that are involved in Mekong water management projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Laos, Chinese law enforcement has significantly increased its presence, extending extra-territorial control, particularly in casino zones on the border with China. Similar to Cambodia, financial industry sources note that China has been able to negotiate Mekong-origin water-sharing terms that disproportionately favour China by actively exerting influence on parties representing the Laotian side. In particular, the construction of new dams in Laos with heavy investment by China has prompted concern over Laos’ debt burden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Indonesia, there appears to be awareness of, and research on, Chinese and Russian cyber operations aimed at interfering in the 2019 Indonesian election. The Chinese digital footprint is so large and pervasive in Indonesia that Jakarta’s exposure to interference in the digital domain is significant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviews with experts and some reporting on the subject reveal an attempt by Chinese state-backed cyber units or Chinese companies to control and/or manipulate telecommunications providers, as well as allegedly censoring material critical of China in acquired Indonesian news aggregator app Baca Berita. Analysis of the methods and technologies used by these Chinese cyber operators suggests some links to China’s People’s Liberation Army Strategic Support Force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equally, in the Philippines, there is a well-documented debate about China’s investment in the country’s CNI, including the power grid and the telecommunications sector. In 2019, media reports cited concerns over the installation of China Telecom infrastructure on Philippines military bases through a deal struck with Filipino-Chinese tycoon Denis Uy. In the run-up to presidential elections in 2022 there appeared to be lively but sensitive debate about the potential for Chinese interference, but no specific allegations have been made since the elections were held.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviews with financial industry executives have noted a strategy of ‘elite capture by proxy’ in the Philippines, whereby Chinese state interests were being furthered without attracting attention. Other notable research on the Philippines includes work on Chinese disinformation on social media and China’s CNI investment there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an awareness of China’s ability to interfere in Malaysia, but there are few well-documented cases of outright interference. There may be concerns over disinformation campaigns concerning vaccine diplomacy and human rights violations against the Uyghur population in China. Elite capture appears to be a favoured approach by Beijing in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the security situation in Myanmar, no public intellectuals in the country are currently contactable. One interview with a Myanmar expert in the region suggests that interference and disinformation operations are active on two fronts: China’s ability to penetrate Myanmar’s digital ecosystem and to leverage its support of ethnic armed groups; and Russia’s efforts to assist the Burmese government in psychological operations and disinformation campaigns. Further literature includes discussion of the Chinese presence in Myanmar and China’s proposed railways through Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singapore is a regional centre of expertise on the methodologies of hostile state actors, interference and disinformation operations, especially following the country’s recently introduced Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act (FICA). There is little discourse on the specifics of how Singapore’s Chinese-speaking community may have been penetrated by China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the large embedded and wealthy ethnic Chinese population in Thailand, Chinese cultural and economic penetration of the country is overt. The Thai establishment may, however, be concerned over encroachment on Thai sovereignty through large Chinese-funded infrastructure projects. Regional security experts also note that there is growing concern over the fact that China is increasingly attempting to acquire controlling equity stakes in leading Thai media outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vietnam takes a robust approach to online disinformation campaigns by China and has a long history of tackling Chinese attempts at interference. There is a concern about hidden debt and closely guarded relationships within the business elites of both countries. As the Vietnamese information environment is not presently conducive to Thai-style information operations, a more coercive, direct influence approach has been observed by one industry executive interviewed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;malign-actor-interference-in-southeast-asia-information-operations-and-what-constitutes-hostile-action&quot;&gt;Malign Actor Interference in Southeast Asia: Information Operations and What Constitutes ‘Hostile Action’&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Benjamin Ang&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a spectrum of information operations in Southeast Asia. At one end there are open and legitimate operations, which are generally acceptable to states, while at the other are hostile, deceptive and illegitimate operations by malign actors, which are generally considered as foreign interference that is not acceptable to the target states. For the purposes of this chapter, ‘malign actors’ refers to entities that carry out the latter operations, and ‘target states’ refers to states where such actions are taking place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These malign actors include both foreign and domestic entities, with different objectives in the target state:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Businesses, which may be seeking to discourage government regulation or attempting to circumvent existing laws.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NGOs, which may be seeking to change the policies of the target state for ideological or political reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Religious groups, which may be seeking to change the society in the target state or to radicalise believers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Loosely organised groups sharing the same ideology, which may be seeking to change society or ways of thinking in the target state.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;States, which may be seeking to disrupt the foreign policy of the target state or to destabilise the target state for strategic reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Domestic malign actors pose a challenge, especially in Southeast Asia, because it can be unclear where to draw the line between hostile action and legitimate political action, especially when viewed from a Western perspective of free speech and human rights.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;definition-information-operations-and-hostile-action&quot;&gt;Definition: Information Operations and ‘Hostile Action’&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To first examine foreign information operations, this research refers to the framework proposed in the 2022 S Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS) policy report, ‘Cases of Foreign Interference in Asia’. This framework is shown in Figure 1. In the figure, the actions encircled in green are generally acceptable to states, while those encircled in red are generally not acceptable to Southeast Asian states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the RSIS framework, ‘influence’ is the ability to shape the preferences of others using ‘information’ and/or ‘interference’. ‘Soft power’ is a well-accepted form of influence through appeal and attraction, which includes non-coercive means like culture, political values, foreign policies, public diplomacy, strategic communications, foreign aid, civic action, economic reconstruction and development, film, TV, books, and other media, economic ties, trade, business, and open ties with educational institutions and think tanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information is another form of influence. Most Southeast Asian states accept information that spreads through open means, including media syndication (for example, foreign TV shows such as Game of Thrones are popular in Southeast Asia), media ownership (for example, foreign-owned TV channels such as CNN, Fox News, CCTV and CGTN are widely watched in Southeast Asia), open advertisement campaigns (for example, advertisements for foreign businesses like McDonalds are common in local Southeast Asian newspapers), op-eds where authorship is transparent (such as commentaries written by foreigners and published in local newspapers), and public statements (for example, by foreign diplomats or business leaders), with ‘hostile intent’ to disrupt their politics and policies deliberately, covertly and deceptively. For example, Singapore has described such actions as a ‘live and serious threat for Singapore’ and refers to them as ‘hostile information campaigns’ (HICs). This term is also used by some European scholars to describe Russian activities in hybrid warfare. There is no official or statutory definition in Singapore, but HICs usually describes covert or coordinated attempts by malign actors to penetrate different segments and levels of society to create and spread information that will manipulate public sentiment and harm national interests. This chapter uses the term ‘HICs’ to refer to information operations that are hostile actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6XiNqYR.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: RSIS Framework for Influence, Information and Interference.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rsis.edu.sg/rsis-publication/cens/cases-of-foreign-interference-in-asia/&quot;&gt;Muhammad Faizal Bin Abdul Rahman et al., ‘Cases of Foreign Interference in Asia’, RSIS Policy Report, 26 March 2020&lt;/a&gt;, p. 8.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Southeast Asian states will not tolerate ‘information operations’ that are undertaken Interference, as defined in the RSIS framework, is the other unacceptable means of influence exerted by malign actors, where the malign actor acts (with or without information operations) with hostile intent to disrupt the politics and policies of the target state deliberately, covertly and deceptively. These actions include covert funding (bribes) or coercion (blackmail) of politicians and political parties, government officials, influential people and business groups, NGOs and activists, academics, and educational institutions. Accusations of foreign interference in elections have been made in Malaysia and the Philippines, but lie beyond the scope of this chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These definitions, particularly the element of covert action to disrupt states, can be applied to several recent reports on China’s growing influence in Southeast Asian media, highlighting that China’s Xinhua News Agency has established content exchange deals with many Southeast Asian news services and that Chinese chambers of commerce have sponsored trips for journalists. These actions would not fall within the RSIS definition of HICs because they are public, not covert, and they seek to create a positive view of China, not to harm the target states. Southeast Asian states do not appear to be raising alarms over these actions and note that Western news agencies and businesses also do the same. However, if any malign actor were to carry out similar actions covertly, the response might be different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;measuring-the-volume-of-hostile-information-campaigns&quot;&gt;Measuring the Volume of Hostile Information Campaigns&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HICs can obscure themselves by employing different media and channels to address different segments of society. Sometimes the target state may detect unusual activity during times of tension between states, which the target state then attributes to HICs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, when Singapore and Malaysia were disputing maritime and airspace issues in 2018, Singapore noticed a ‘curious spike’ in online comments critical of Singapore on social media, using anonymous accounts, and instances where ‘avatar accounts’ (that is, accounts whose profile photos do not show the user’s face) accounted for about 40% of comments on the social media pages of alternative media. While Singapore described this as an HIC, it did not attribute the action to any state. However, the minister for home affairs noted in Parliament in 2019 that when states are in conflict, one can use an HIC to destabilise the other. For the purposes of this chapter, these actions appear to constitute an HIC because they are covert and coordinated actions (anonymous accounts) aimed at manipulating sentiment against the interests of the target state (turning Singaporean public sentiment against the country’s position on maritime and airspace rights).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singapore considers HICs such a ‘live and serious threat’ that it convened a Select Committee on Deliberate Online Falsehoods in 2018, with public oral representations from 65 individuals and organisations. This event culminated in a 176-page report which found that Singapore ‘has been and will continue to be a target of hostile information campaigns’ which attack the country’s national security, racial harmony, democratic processes, social cohesion and trust in public institutions. Singapore has since passed legislation against deliberate online falsehoods (Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act) and foreign interference (FICA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cases-of-hostile-information-campaigns&quot;&gt;Cases of Hostile Information Campaigns&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While various Southeast Asian states have detected, or at least strongly suspected, cases of HICs, there is no published research measuring the impact of these campaigns. There are no published datasets that contain data which is observable, replicable and verifiable. These criteria would be necessary for measuring impact, for example using a model like the Breakout Scale from Brookings, which measures impact based on whether information remains on one platform or travels across multiple platforms, and whether it remains in one community or is spread through many communities. However, this requires data-gathering and analytics capabilities that are either lacking in Southeast Asian states or are only available to state intelligence services and are kept classified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a global issue, as empirical research on the impacts of such operations, such as altering beliefs, changing voting behaviour or inspiring political violence, is still limited and is focused on Western countries and their platforms. However, since some of the known studies show that targeted information operations can lead to increased political violence in settings of conflict or civil unrest, the threat posed by such operations cannot be dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further research is needed, especially in Southeast Asian states, to measure the impact of these operations. This will require funding, access to data, cross-disciplinary cooperation and, above all, the political will to drive these factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Singapore&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leading up to the introduction of legislation against HICs, Singapore has highlighted several instances of information operations conducted by foreign malign actors. Some of these are decades old, and they do not involve China, Russia, Iran or North Korea, but, importantly, they do illustrate that Singapore does not welcome foreign interference from either east or west.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1964, a Singaporean businessman received a substantial loan from high-ranking officials of a communist intelligence service based in Hong Kong to establish the Eastern Sun, an English-language daily newspaper in Singapore, giving these officials access to the press in Singapore. The businessman confessed and the paper closed with the resignation of the editorial staff. This fits the definition of an HIC because it was a covert action (the loan was private) to manipulate sentiment against the target state’s interests (Singapore was fighting communism at the time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1971, Singapore revoked the licence of the Singapore Herald for spreading misinformation to work up feelings against Singapore’s compulsory military service policy, and expelled three foreign journalists working for the newspaper. One of the paper’s primary investors was Donald Stephens, then Malaysian high commissioner to Australia. This also fits the definition of an HIC because it was a coordinated action to manipulate sentiment against the target state’s interests (Singapore was building its defence force at the time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Hoover Institution report, China’s Influence and American Interests: Promoting Constructive Vigilance, has observed that in 2016, when Singapore became ASEAN country coordinator, Chinese diplomats called on Singapore to manage ASEAN’s discussion on South China Sea issues, while messages began to appear on social media that appeared to ‘instil a fatalistic acceptance of the inevitability and desirability of a Chinese identity for multiracial Singapore and to get Singaporeans – and not just Chinese Singaporeans – to pressure the government to align Singapore’s national interests with China’s interests’. These messages have not been attributed to any actor, but the report notes that they ‘resemble arguments made in the Chinese media, in particular the Global Times’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already mentioned is the more recent 2018 spike in social media comments critical of Singapore at a time when neighbouring Malaysia and Singapore were in the midst of maritime and airspace disputes. The comments covered not only maritime and airspace, but also traffic jams at land checkpoints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Malaysia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malaysia has also alleged HICs without using the same terminology, but the circumstances are murky. This section draws on the work of Gulizar Haciyakupoglu to analyse the allegations. In 2018, the government urged foreign press to stop circulating ‘fake news’ that might damage then-prime minister Najib Razak’s campaign for the 14th general election. The news reports alleged that millions of US dollars misappropriated from deposits in 1 Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), a government-owned investment fund, had gone into Najib’s personal account. However, a subsequent post-election criminal investigation of Najib has shown that the reports may have been accurate, and not an HIC. In any event, this does not exactly fit the definition of an HIC because the news stories were public and not covert or coordinated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the 2018 election campaign, leading politicians accused rival party members of inviting foreign interference or receiving foreign funding or support. Without substantiation or evidence, these appear to have been attempts at discrediting rivals and deflecting from real issues, rather than actual instances of foreign interference or HICs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that there is no real threat of foreign HICs in Malaysia. The Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab) found that in the same election, Twitter bots (automated inauthentic accounts used to artificially inflate numbers of engagements online and manipulate public opinion) with Cyrillic names were responsible for two hashtag campaigns, #SayNOtoPH and #KalahkanPakatan (Defeat Pakatan). DFRLab suggested that the bots were generated by Russian-speaking ‘bot herders’ on behalf of the then-ruling National Front (Barisan Nasional) party or its supporters, so it remains in question whether the malign actors ultimately responsible for the campaign were foreign or domestic. In any event, this action could fit the definition of an HIC because it was a covert action (by artificial accounts) to manipulate public sentiment, arguably against the interests of the target state (to keep an allegedly corrupt government in power).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Philippines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020, Facebook announced that it had removed two networks for violating its policy against ‘foreign or government interference’ that consists of ‘coordinated inauthentic behaviour’ (multiple fake accounts sharing similar information to manipulate public opinion). One of these networks originated from individuals in Fujian, China, and the other from the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first network, with 155 accounts, 11 pages, nine groups and six Instagram accounts, originated in China and focused on the Philippines and Southeast Asia. It supported Chinese naval activity in the South China Sea, then-president Rodrigo Duterte, and the potential run of Duterte’s daughter for the 2022 presidential election, and criticised Rappler, a media outlet that is a vocal opponent of the president. Graphika Labs analysed the dataset and noted that its other content reflected Chinese messaging on issues such as the Hong Kong protests, Taiwan’s independence and the Covid-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This campaign is interesting because it only spent $60 on advertising, it could not be conclusively attributed to a state actor and, importantly, it supported the ruling government and criticised its opponents. The target state would not be inclined to label this as an HIC because the action, although covert and coordinated (inauthentic accounts), was arguably not against the interests of the target state (nor the ruling government).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second network of coordinated inauthentic behaviour originated in the Philippines and focused on domestic political issues for domestic audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indonesia and Myanmar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Malaysian and Philippines examples illustrate an inconvenient reality of information operations in Southeast Asia: domestic malign actors account for most of the reported cases, and in some cases governments are accused of being the sources of domestic disinformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allegations of foreign interference or foreign information operations are used as election tactics to discredit rivals, or to suppress criticism of government policies and politicians, or to dismiss opposing views of any sort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Indonesia, observers have reported on ‘cyber troops’ (groups tasked with manipulating public opinion online on behalf of political parties or the government) that overlap with ideologically motivated groups and social media influencers supporting the same causes. The cyber troops’ activities include micro-targeting messages and ‘trolling’ (harassing) opponents and journalists. Both major opposing parties in the recent elections are reported to have employed ‘buzzers’ and ‘micro-celebrities’ to run multiple fake accounts to share political narratives for their respective parties. One information campaign in 2016 targeted the then governor of Jakarta, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama (known as Ahok), and resulted in hundreds of thousands protesting on the streets of Jakarta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 2020 Myanmar elections, politicians and the military are alleged to have spread rumours, misinformation and disinformation through social media, print media and word of mouth to target political opponents and minority groups. The extremist Ma Ba Tha movement is alleged to have used disinformation campaigns targeting the then-ruling National League for Democracy party, then-state counsellor of Myanmar Aung San Suu Kyi, and Rohingya/Muslims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This came after the tragic inter-ethnic conflict in Myanmar in 2017, where the UN recognised that elements of the Myanmar army had committed genocide and ethnic cleansing against the Muslim Rohingya minority, fuelled in large part by hate speech and disinformation that had been spreading from at least 2014 to 2017 on Facebook, often through accounts and pages controlled by the Myanmar army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Indonesia and Myanmar cases could be described as HICs because they were covert actions (fake accounts) or coordinated actions (pages controlled by the Myanmar army) aimed at manipulating sentiment against the interests of the target state (inciting unrest or violence against certain groups), even though the malign actor may have been the ruling government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ideological-groups&quot;&gt;Ideological Groups&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Southeast Asian states also face information operations from malign actors who are loosely organised but share a common ideology or belief that can be dangerous when it morphs into extremism. This includes Hindu extremists, Muslim extremists and Buddhist extremists, who spread hate speech through social media, leading to lynching and other forms of violence. It also includes ‘anti-vaxxers’ spreading Covid-19 misinformation during the pandemic, which is seriously undermining public health efforts in Southeast Asian states. The prominent anti-vaxxer groups in Southeast Asia appear to be domestic and not controlled by foreign malign actors, although they draw much of their material from foreign sources. Are these groups malign actors, victims of deception, ‘useful idiots’ or some combination thereof? Did they seek out the foreign information, or was it pushed to them? If a foreign state is responsible for creating or promoting Covid-19 misinformation in the first place (as Russia and China have both been accused of), does this make the foreign state ultimately responsible as the malign actor, even if the affected state was not a direct target? All these questions merit investigation and further research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;government-countermeasures-and-reactions&quot;&gt;Government Countermeasures and Reactions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The countermeasures that governments in Southeast Asia have taken against information operations include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Promoting public education, digital literacy and critical thinking: Singapore has launched initiatives for students, young adults and senior citizens, such as the Better Internet Campaign (which aims to help students become responsible and ethical users of the internet) and the National Library Board’s SURE (Source, Understand, Research, Evaluate) programme (which trains individuals to identify fake news).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Passing legislation against spreading misinformation or disinformation: Singapore has passed the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act 2019 (POFMA), and Malaysia passed the Anti-Fake News Act, though the latter was subsequently repealed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working with social media platforms: YouTube has taken down videos containing false claims about vaccination by an anti-vaccination group based in Singapore called Healing the Divide. This action was praised by Singapore’s Ministry of Health.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Providing clear communications, especially to counter falsehoods: Singapore health authorities use a multi-channel communication strategy to share Covid-19 information and policies, including press conferences by the Multi-Ministry Taskforce, print media, TV, and dedicated Telegram channels and WhatsApp groups.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fact-checking: The Singaporean and Malaysian governments do this with their Factually and Sebenarnya websites, respectively. The weakness of this approach is that people who believe in conspiracy theories are unlikely to believe government fact checks, and people generally may not trust fact checks that appear to be partisan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;focus-on-legislation-as-a-countermeasure&quot;&gt;Focus on Legislation as a Countermeasure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under POFMA, the government can issue ‘correction directions’ that require social media platforms to display correction notices to their users in Singapore, next to the information or post that is labelled as an online falsehood. Since the start of the global pandemic, Singapore has issued several correction directions under POFMA against Facebook, Twitter and media company SPH magazines over false claims about Covid-19. These corrections were generally welcomed by the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, during the 2020 general election, the authorities issued correction directions about certain comments made by opposition politicians, some of which were critical of the government. This raised fears that POFMA was being used to silence criticism of the government. One scholar suggests that POFMA could diminish public trust in this way, citing the ruling government’s diminished performance in the 2020 general election as an indication of a fall in public trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singapore also passed FICA in 2021, to prevent foreign entities from using HICs and local proxies (called ‘politically significant persons’ in the Act) to interfere in Singapore’s politics, including acts of foreign interference ‘by covert means using electronic communications’. The minister for law clarified in Parliament that FICA did not apply to Singaporeans acting of their own accord, foreigners who made open, attributable comments, or foreign political observers and commentators. Rather, it would cover instances where a foreign state (or its proxies) covertly offers a local politician or journalist incentives to influence what they say in public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been suggested that some other Southeast Asian governments are less likely to use legislation against disinformation campaigns since Malaysia repealed its Anti-Fake News Act in 2018 and the Philippines did not pass its proposed law against fake news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, laws against disinformation or fake news are clearly being used by other Southeast Asian governments, such as Vietnam’s Cyber Security Law (which covers false information on social media) and Indonesia’s Information and Electronic Transactions Act. Prosecutions have been made in Thailand and Indonesia for allegedly spreading false information about Covid-19, and even in Malaysia, a journalist has been arrested for her social media posts on the subject. The speed of these actions and gaps in government accountability have raised fears from local critics and Western observers that Southeast Asian governments might use the pandemic as an excuse to suppress unfavourable content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;government-as-the-threat-actor&quot;&gt;Government as the Threat Actor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments in Southeast Asia have a special dilemma in responding to information operations, because they are often accused of being perpetrators in the first place, as discussed above. Existing legislation is seen as already infringing on freedom of expression, and government actions are seen as another way to suppress dissent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this environment, the burden has fallen on non-governmental fact-checking efforts instead, such as the Thai News Agency’s Sure and Share Center and Indonesia’s Fakta atau Hoax (Fact or Hoax) and Mafindo projects. In Myanmar, civil society organisations such Panzagar, Myanmar ICT for Development Organisation, the Myanmar Tech Accountability Network and Phandeeyar work to mitigate social media risks, running anti-hate speech campaigns and fact-checking propaganda emails. In the Philippines, the Rappler media organisation reports on the spread of government propaganda on social media, as well as misogyny, human rights violations, and corruption in government. In response, the government has accused Rappler and its editor, Nobel Prize laureate Maria Ressa, of spreading disinformation and has levied criminal charges, including a conviction for cyber libel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this brief survey of information operations in Southeast Asia, it can be seen that hostile actions can be carried out by domestic entities, including political parties and even the ruling government, with no discernible support from overseas. While the impact on the public is no less negative – polarisation, mutual distrust, spread of dangerous false information – the domestic source makes countermeasures difficult, especially where the government is suspected of using such measures to stifle legitimate free speech, or where trust in government is already low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A comprehensive set of countermeasures must then come from a whole-of-society effort, since Southeast Asian governments cannot provide them alone. Journalists, fact-checkers, NGOs, educators, governments, social media platforms, influential persons and ordinary citizens all have different parts to play. At the same time, however, these entities may be contesting each other for the information space or may have opposing ideas of what information is acceptable or not. It remains to be seen whether they will be able to put aside their differences and cooperate enough to counter the hostile information operations coming from malign actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;asias-soft-underbelly-co-optation-corrosive-interference-and-chaotic-governance-in-southeast-asia&quot;&gt;Asia’s Soft Underbelly: Co-optation, Corrosive Interference and Chaotic Governance in Southeast Asia&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Richard Javad Heydarian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Canberra announced the scrapping of its conventional submarine deal with France upon the announcement of the AUKUS (Australia–UK–US) security partnership, there was predictable outrage in Paris and, by extension, across the EU. However, arguably the most bizarre response to the AUKUS deal came from the least expected quarters. In theory, Southeast Asian countries should have welcomed the enhancement of a US-led ‘integrated deterrence’ strategy against China. ASEAN has proven largely ineffectual in constraining Chinese coercion in the South China Sea, for example, where Beijing has rapidly expanded its military and paramilitary footprint. Southeast Asian states would be beneficiaries of a more proactive Australian defence role across the Indo-Pacific, and any Australian nuclear-powered submarine would almost certainly be deployed to the South China Sea under the auspices of AUKUS in the coming decades. Yet, shortly after the AUKUS announcement, key ASEAN members turned into vocal naysayers, largely echoing Beijing’s narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The region’s largest country, Indonesia, quickly stated that it was ‘deeply concerned over the continuing arms race and power projection in the region’ without mentioning China’s rapidly expanding naval presence in the area, well into Indonesia’s waters in the North Natuna Sea. Malaysia, recently at the receiving end of Chinese harassment within its exclusive economic zones in the southern portions of the South China Sea, turned the whole affair into a test of loyalty to Beijing. Kuala Lumpur accused the AUKUS alliance of stoking tensions by ‘openly regard[ing] China as a possible enemy’. Malaysia’s defence minister, Hishammuddin Hussein, during a parliamentary inquiry, announced a surprise short working trip to Beijing in order to understand Beijing’s views on AUKUS. Vietnam and Singapore made largely oblique statements, falling short of an open endorsement. Responses from US treaty allies in the region were far from reassuring; having tilted closer to China in recent years, Thailand, for example, proved unreliable, and in the Philippines, there were contradicting messages from then-president Rodrigo Duterte and his foreign secretary, Teodoro Locsin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acrimony over AUKUS has revealed three important characteristics of Southeast Asian states. First, the episode laid bare long-simmering geopolitical fault lines in Southeast Asia amid continuing Sino-American rivalry. Regional states have very divergent threat perceptions, including what represents a ‘hostile’ foreign state actor. Most Southeast Asian countries, with the possible exceptions of Vietnam and the Philippines, do not openly describe China’s expanding military capabilities as a national security threat. Neither is Russia seen as a national security threat – in fact, Russia has become the largest arms supplier to the region amid burgeoning strategic and defence ties with not only traditional partners such as Vietnam and Myanmar, but also Indonesia, Malaysia and potentially even the Philippines. In response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Singapore was the only regional state to impose sanctions on Moscow; the key regional states of Vietnam and the Philippines even expressed their commitment to maintaining robust defence ties with Moscow amid a new barrage of Western sanctions on Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite frequent warnings by regional commentators, hardly a single Southeast Asian country has officially identified Russia or China as a potential source of foreign interference, including during regular elections across the region. In fact, democratic countries such as the Philippines have witnessed a rapid increase in the number of local journalists, especially those from state-affiliated media and non-mainstream outlets, as well as influencers, especially those accused of buttressing pro-government ‘troll farms’, receiving ‘training’ during official visits to Beijing or Moscow. In 2017, party-to-party cooperation also took place between the then-ruling party in the Philippines (Partido Demokratiko Pilipino – Lakas ng Bayan (PDP-Laban)) and its counterparts in Russia and China. The party has also signed a cooperation agreement with North Korea’s Workers’ Party of Korea. Southeast Asian countries, notwithstanding their compliance with relevant UN-backed sanctions against Pyongyang, have continued engagement with North Korea despite the assassination of Kim Jong-nam in Malaysia in February 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Southeast Asian countries where religious extremism is a major concern, security experts and military officials appear to be preoccupied with the influence of US partners such as Saudi Arabia. Notwithstanding outbursts of sectarianism in neighbouring (Sunni-majority) Malaysia and Indonesia, especially against Muslim minority groups, both Southeast Asian countries have maintained largely constructive relations with Shia-majority Iran throughout the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AUKUS has revealed the reluctance of regional states to directly criticise China. No ASEAN member has dared to criticise Beijing for its recent alleged hypersonic missile tests, expanding stockpile of nuclear warheads, and growing fleet of nuclear submarines. Furthermore, AUKUS has exposed deficiencies in coherent strategic thinking, institutional strength and political conviction among key Southeast Asian states. In the Philippines, the Duterte administration struggled to form a single position, as multiple top officials adopted radically divergent positions on AUKUS. It is precisely the brittleness of governance structures across the region, with the notable exceptions of Singapore and Vietnam, that has made Southeast Asia particularly vulnerable to foreign corrosive influence and political co-optation. Winston Churchill once described Italy as the ‘soft underbelly’ of the axis powers. The same can be said about key US partners across Southeast Asia, which have openly courted warmer relations with authoritarian powers, namely China and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;varieties-of-vulnerabilities&quot;&gt;Varieties of Vulnerabilities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of vulnerabilities to malign interference from external actors, Southeast Asia falls across a relatively wide spectrum. After all, regional states have differential agency in terms of insulating their core political institutions from predatory interference. Southeast Asia is a region of immense geopolitical potential and economic dynamism; it is also arguably the world’s most diverse region in terms of levels of economic development and types of government and political regimes, as well as population size and territorial expanse. The core Southeast Asian states – the ‘ASEAN-6’ countries – have consistently enjoyed relatively high rankings in various international competitiveness indices. In the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report 2014–2015, for instance, Singapore ranked second in the world, with Malaysia (20th), Thailand (31st), Indonesia (34th), the Philippines (52nd) and Vietnam (68th) performing relatively well among 144 countries. The ASEAN-6 were also among the more competitive nations in the Global Innovation Index 2020, where Singapore ranked eighth among 131 countries, followed by Malaysia (33rd), Vietnam (42nd), Thailand (44th) and the Philippines (50th).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This economic dynamism, however, obfuscates institutional vulnerabilities across much of the region. A cursory look at key indicators of governance reveals unaccountable governance, corruption, weak institutional checks and balances, and democratic deficit. Southeast Asian states universally rank poorly in various indices such as the Press Freedom Index, Freedom House’s Freedom in the World reports, the Democracy Index and, with the notable exception of Singapore, Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index. Not one ASEAN country is considered to be a ‘fully deepened’ democracy by experts, with Indonesia, which enjoys the region’s freest political regime, classified as a ‘flawed democracy’ in the Democracy Index and as ‘partly free’ by Freedom House.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arguably, only Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines can be classified as ‘minimalist-procedural’ democracies, given their record of relatively competitive elections in recent years. But even when a more relativistic ‘varieties of democracy’ approach is adopted, all three countries rank poorly in terms of press freedom, corruption and robustness of institutional checks and balances. In both the Philippines and Indonesia, meanwhile, patterns of authoritarian populism and patronage politics have persisted in recent years, further eroding the institutional foundations of ASEAN’s fledgling democracies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conceptually and politically, the line between (legitimate) influence and malign interference is often unclear and hard to pin down. In practice, vectors of influence comprise grey-zone tactics providing plausible deniability to malign actors as well as their overseas clients. Thus, this chapter focuses in particular on what political scientist Christopher Walker has described as ‘sharp power’: a unique attribute of authoritarian superpowers, which seek to project their influence internationally, with the objectives of limiting free expression, spreading confusion and distorting the political environment within democracies. Beyond targeting fledgling and established democracies, authoritarian superpowers can deploy a variety of means – from bribery to intimidation and disinformation – to co-opt and corrode vectors of power and decision-making in target countries, including spheres of mainstream as well as social media, civil society, and the broader business community, in addition to state institutions, political figures and political parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/oycOfMW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: Vulnerability to Sharp Power in ASEAN Countries.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Joseph Nye argues, ‘Beijing and Moscow have spent tens of billions of dollars to shape public perceptions and behaviour around the world’ through the systematic deployment of ‘tools new and old that exploit the asymmetry of openness between their own restrictive systems and democratic societies’. In particular, sharp power can come in the form of ‘the deceptive use of information for hostile purposes’, harking back to the Cold War era of ‘manipulation of ideas, political perceptions, and electoral processes’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To assess vulnerability to sharp power as a form of foreign interference by overseas actors, Southeast Asian countries can be divided along two axes: vulnerability based on the level of strategic autonomy and institutional checks and balances (against corruption and co-optation); and geopolitical relevance (to foreign actors). Thus, Southeast Asian nations can be roughly classified into four types: low-to-medium geopolitical relevance with high vulnerability (Laos, Myanmar and Cambodia); high geopolitical relevance with low vulnerability (Vietnam and Singapore); medium geopolitical relevance and medium vulnerability (Thailand and Brunei); and high geopolitical relevance and medium-to-high vulnerability (Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines) (see Figure 2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;asean-vulnerability-to-sharp-power-and-foreign-state-actors&quot;&gt;ASEAN Vulnerability to Sharp Power and Foreign State Actors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to vulnerability to malign foreign interference, some countries are more equal than others. Regionally, Singapore has proactively pushed back against suspected interference operations by China. One big area of concern for Singapore, which has developed robust defence cooperation with the US and other major Western powers in recent years, is the potential emergence of a pro-Beijing ‘fifth column’ in the Chinese-majority city state. China set off alarm bells when its Overseas Chinese Affairs Office was incorporated into the United Front Work Department, thus raising concerns over more active efforts by Beijing to co-opt communities of Chinese descent overseas. As veteran Singaporean diplomat Bilahari Kausikan openly warned at a public conference in 2018, ‘[the] very point of [the ongoing] United Front work is to blur the distinction between the domestic and international and promote the [Chinese Communist Party (CCP)]’s interests wherever it may be, domestic or international’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Officially, China maintains a policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of its neighbouring countries. However, President Xi Jinping effectively contradicted that position when he began blurring the distinction between huaren (ethnic Chinese of all nationalities) and huaqiao (overseas Chinese citizens) by declaring that the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation requires the joint efforts of the Chinese sons and daughters at home and abroad. In effect, Xi has embraced 60 million huaqiao, many of whom are spread across the Southeast Asian countries of Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines, as demographic extensions of a greater China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a study by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, Singaporean universities have had the highest level of research and academic collaboration with Chinese counterparts affiliated with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) compared to any other country in the region. Meanwhile, a study by the Jamestown Foundation has found that China has used seemingly innocuous front organisations, including business groups, for disinformation campaigns, including the narrative of a ‘greater China’, which is extremely sensitive in a city state where three-quarters of the population is of Chinese ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singapore has responded to sharp power and foreign interference threats in a variety of ways. Intent on reiterating its ‘Chinese’ identity distinct from that of China, the country went as far as to build the $110-million Singapore Chinese Cultural Centre, which serves as a clear rejection of Xi’s vision. It has also crafted strict regulations for social media platforms. In a national statement at the adoption of its third Universal Periodic Review in 2021, Singapore’s permanent representative to the UN Office in Geneva described such measures as a matter of national security: ‘Our concern lies with the use of coordinated, deceptive methods by hostile foreign actors to manipulate our political discourse and disrupt our society.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vietnam has staked its legitimacy on resisting Chinese influence in addition to providing stability and economic growth, and has had a proactive approach to mitigating interference by hostile foreign actors. Vietnam has consciously tried to minimise its institutional linkages and webs of interdependence with China, including in the realm of higher education. Vietnam’s national security doctrine and its trade–industrial policy are primarily shaped by an abiding commitment to reducing dependence on and vulnerability to China. The same cannot be said about three other, highly geopolitically relevant Southeast Asian countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia may find the stricter measures adopted by Singapore and Vietnam problematic for their own political systems. Even the historically authoritarian Malaysia, which adopted a more liberal direction following the game-changing 2018 elections, had to amend its notorious Internal Security Act in 2012. Former Malaysian prime minister Muhyiddin Yassin also promised to amend the successor Prevention of Crime Act 1959 and the Security Offences (Special Measures) Act 2012 to further reduce abuses by security officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although far from champions of democracy and press freedom, contemporary governments in the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia are bound to face both institutional and public resistance should they adopt strict regulation of the media landscape as do Singapore or Vietnam. All three countries also lack the nimble state security apparatus and surveillance regimes that undergird public governance in proactive Southeast Asian states such as Singapore and Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia are vulnerable to manipulation and corrosive influence from hostile foreign actors on multiple levels. Specifically, sharp power operations in these key Southeast Asian countries function along three vectors: social media, influencers and disinformation; corrosive capital; and leadership targeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;social-media-influencers-and-disinformation&quot;&gt;Social Media, Influencers and Disinformation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all three countries, but especially in the Philippines, social media platforms have increasingly transmogrified into vast pools of disinformation. As Ressa warned years ago, Facebook, in particular, has rapidly turned into the unwitting enabler of authoritarian populists, far-right revisionists and conspiracy theorists, with devastating impacts on public discourse and democratic politics. Over the past five years, certain ‘bloggers’ and social media influencers, some with millions of followers, have emerged as the primary arbiters of political discourse in places such as the Philippines. Indeed, the Philippines has become a global ‘troll farm’ hub, as elements within the country’s massive business process outsourcing industry as well as advertising agencies join the lucrative trade in political disinformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to political co-optation and influence operations, two particularly troubling patterns have emerged. First, major influencers have become a conduit for state-backed propaganda, both domestic and foreign. During the Covid-19 pandemic, for instance, multiple high-profile influencers and bloggers began spreading and reinforcing the Chinese embassy’s talking points in the Philippines. A similar pattern has emerged with respect to other contentious issues, including China’s claims in the South China Sea and the insurrection in Hong Kong. At times, it has become difficult to distinguish between the key arguments of political bloggers, who have a very limited grasp of international law, and the narratives of senior diplomats and officials from overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, social media platforms, especially Facebook, publicly flagged up to 150 China-based accounts in 2020, which were allegedly engaged in ‘coordinated inauthentic behaviour’, including hosting fake accounts that pushed for the victory of a specific China-leaning ticket in the 2022 presidential elections in the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corrosive Capital&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second vector of sharp power is corrosive capital, which has a significant impact on already fragile government institutions in host countries. Unlike legitimate business, corrosive capital serves the specific geopolitical ends of hostile foreign actors. One potential conduit for foreign interference activities, therefore, is through ostensibly ‘private’ investments, especially in sectors that are highly prone to illicit activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the Philippines’ Beijing-friendly former president Rodrigo Duterte, for instance, there was a boom in online Chinese-run casinos, officially known as Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators (POGOs). Despite Duterte’s supposed opposition to the gambling industry, the Philippines’ licensing fees topped $150 million in 2019, with total revenues reaching $4 billion. The industry, however, is plagued by reports of institutionalised bribery, widespread tax evasion, human and drug trafficking, money laundering and even kidnapping in recent years. On multiple occasions, Duterte has rejected calls by Chinese authorities to ban the POGOs due to their association with the criminal underworld and their negative effect on anti-gambling regulations in mainland China. Since the Philippine authorities themselves admit that POGOs are notorious perpetrators of tax evasion, critics claim that top government officials are likely the personal beneficiaries of illicit transactions with the Chinese operators. The problem is even more severe in places such as Cambodia, northern regions of Laos, and Myanmar’s porous borders with China, where mainlander criminal gangs effectively run whole towns, if not sub-regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Philippines, concern over online casinos also has direct and serious national security implications. For instance, Senator Panfilo Lacson, a former general and head of the Philippine Senate Committee on National Defense and Security, has warned that, drawing on military intelligence sources, up to 3,000 members of the PLA could be embedded among Chinese POGOs as part of a large-scale ‘immersion mission’. During a shootout incident between two Chinese citizens suspected of involvement in POGOs, a PLA military ID was reportedly discovered by Philippine authorities. Senator Richard Gordon, meanwhile, has warned of ‘infiltration’ by Chinese security agencies, claiming that POGOs have been involved in suspicious transactions valuing up to $150 million, part of which may have been used to fund ‘fifth column’ operations in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even former national security adviser Hermogenes Esperon and former defence secretary Delfin Lorenzana have warned of potential interference activities among Chinese POGO workers clustered around sensitive locations such as military installations, including Camp Aguinaldo, which hosts Department of National Defense offices and the Philippine Army; the Philippine National Police headquarters at Camp Crame; and the Philippine Air Force and Navy headquarters. As Lorenzana put it, ‘When you already see many people [at the POGOs], who are always there … it’s very easy for all these [Chinese] people to perhaps shift their activities to spying’, since ‘[the POGOs] are near [military facilities]’. The seamless expansion of POGOs, and their clustering around key military bases in Metro Manila, has raised concerns over either lack of proper oversight or, worse, co-optation of key agencies in charge of ensuring that the Chinese online casinos do not pose a national security threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leadership Targeting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third, and potentially most problematic, vector of sharp power is interference operations targeting top decision-makers, either directly or via their proxies. Traditionally, co-optation can take place through large-scale bribery, especially during elections, or kompromat (extortion through compromising material). Less well-resourced hostile foreign actors may adopt more surgical measures which directly target key decision-makers, but for wealthier hostile foreign actors, co-optation can take place through seemingly legitimate and mutually beneficial agreements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to China’s BRI, much has been written about the potential for ‘debt trap’ – drowning host countries in unsustainable debt amid corrupt infrastructure deals. But the potentially corrosive impact of big-ticket infrastructure projects is far more subtle and multifarious, especially in larger and more advanced Southeast Asian economies. In places such as Laos or Cambodia, for instance, China has managed to achieve decisive influence by becoming the dominant source of investments and aid by far, thus consolidating Beijing’s ability to shape the strategic policies of these smaller Southeast Asian states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Philippines and Indonesia, the picture is far more complicated. On the one hand, there is the risk of ‘pledge trap’ – luring elected leaders in key Southeast Asian countries through pledges of (rather than realised) large-scale investments, which tend to generate positive headlines at home. In the Philippines, Duterte adopted a largely obsequious position on the South China Sea disputes in exchange for (still unrealised) Chinese investment pledges. Until recently, in Indonesia, President Joko Widodo adopted strategic patience regarding maritime disputes with China and, crucially, tried to water down good governance regulations and de-fang anti-corruption agencies to expedite infrastructure development. Even more dramatic is the case of Malaysia, where former prime minister Najib Razak largely relied on large-scale Chinese capital and investments to boost the country’s finances and his flailing political career amid the massive 1MDB corruption scandal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hostile foreign powers can also influence host countries by cultivating strong relations with key interlocutors or officials in charge of important state agencies. Over the past few years, China has backed large economic projects in Indonesia. Some experts have noted the potential role played by key officials in facilitating these projects and greater bilateral economic ties, although others point towards greater agency and directives of government in attracting, in the case of Indonesia, foreign direct investment from a range of countries, including China. Similar questions have been raised with regard to the sudden mushrooming of Chinese private and public investment initiatives across strategic locations such as Subic, Clark, Sangley and Palawan in the Philippines – areas that are close to key naval and air-force facilities that face the contested South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alarm bells were also raised when a former top Filipino general, who would later move to Duterte’s cabinet, allowed a China Telecom-backed and equipped company, Dito Telecommunity, which is owned by Uy, to install communications infrastructure within Philippine bases. The US had earlier warned that such activities could jeopardise bilateral intelligence and defence cooperation. Ultimately, however, one of the biggest concerns in fragile democracies such as the Philippines and Indonesia is the emergence of ‘Manchurian candidates’ during vital elections, including for the presidency, thanks to the high cost of election campaigns, minimal supervision over election financing, and limited ability to monitor and deter disinformation efforts by hostile foreign powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-1&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, Southeast Asian countries fall along a wide spectrum of vulnerabilities, depending on their institutional coherence, geopolitical relevance and political regimes. While all have equally been targets of malign foreign interference, some have exercised more agency and institutional resilience than others. Regional states tend to also have diverse, and at times divergent, threat perceptions regarding authoritarian superpowers. What is clear is that hostile foreign actors can and have deployed a variety of tools to exploit a wide range of vulnerabilities across key Southeast Asian countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, any nuanced policy response, either by targeted nations or in tandem with like-minded allies and external powers, should balance comprehensiveness in addressing a full range of vulnerabilities with targeted measures. Targeted responses include timely interventions and policy countermeasures against the most nefarious vectors of malign interference by hostile foreign actors. This is an indispensable step towards enhancing the overall resilience of pivotal Southeast Asian countries, especially amid the intensified assertiveness of authoritarian powers in the Indo-Pacific. Ultimately, any long-term solution should be anchored in a systematic recognition of the agency of Southeast Asian states given their decades-long struggle for autonomy and national development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, the threat of hostile interference should be addressed on four important fronts. The first is to spotlight the issue through raising public awareness, mobilising civil society groups and enhancing multilateral information sharing on malign foreign influence. In extreme cases, independent international inquiry, if not sanctions, against compromised political figures can also be considered. Second, states should pursue capacity-building efforts through providing technical assistance to and enhancing the mandate of key government agencies tasked with countering interference operations. Third, regulation plays an important role in countering political interference and should focus on tightening legislation against and lawful surveillance of foreign-backed disinformation campaigns. Finally, alternative approaches could include the establishment of bilateral, minilateral and multilateral cooperative mechanisms by like-minded international partners to reduce Southeast Asian countries’ dependence on critical infrastructure investment from malign foreign actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;malign-economic-activity-chinese-high-speed-rail-projects-in-laos-thailand-and-malaysia&quot;&gt;Malign Economic Activity: Chinese High-Speed Rail Projects in Laos, Thailand and Malaysia&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ryan Clarke&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malign economic activity is distinct from traditional forms of commerce, investment and capital market activity in that commercial considerations, such as project viability or investment return schedules, represent only secondary considerations. Malign economic activity often still seeks profit, but simultaneously can meet broader strategic goals or geopolitical intent to the detriment of the targeted country or organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is a significant economic actor in Southeast Asia through its BRI, with the high-speed rail projects in Laos, Thailand and Malaysia highly visible examples. While not problematic in and of themselves, these three case studies provide rich examples of how such economic investments can carry unanticipated consequences to varying extents, such as elite capture, debt structures and the opportunity to exert influence over key national transportation infrastructure or leverage it for other strategic and political ends, as well as engage in corrupt activities that weaken good governance. In very extreme cases foreign states could acquire infrastructure assets, although this has proven so far to rarely occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nature of Chinese infrastructure investment is complicated by the complexity of the Chinese system, in which BRI investments can be directed from the central government by provincial governments, state-owned banks, state-owned enterprises (SOEs) or even private companies. The almost ubiquitous presence of the CCP across industries and sectors in China, as well as questions of the Chinese government’s ultimate ambition for regional influence and power, means that commercial projects may carry strategic opportunities for the Chinese government or may indirectly be guided by it. Chinese SOEs are subject to the vagaries of global market competition but can ultimately serve as tools of the CCP with regard to geo-economic gambits such as the BRI or where the party deems that its geopolitical core interests are being challenged. The management of Chinese SOEs since 2012 has seen a transformation towards a ‘modern state-owned enterprise system with Chinese characteristics’, in which Party leadership is institutionalised through Party groups and Party committees who to varying extents can appoint senior management and participate in setting the company’s strategic direction. This morphing of the Party with the business also counts to a certain extent for joint ventures, particularly if it employs three or more Party members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bri-infrastructure-projects-with-strategic-intent&quot;&gt;BRI Infrastructure: Projects with Strategic Intent?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A substantial number of BRI projects are concentrated around China’s Asian periphery, especially in Southeast Asia. As a 2021 AidData study of over 13,000 BRI projects shows, some include loan structures that exceed a country’s financial ability for repayment, leading to unforeseen debt or the prospect of commercial non-viability. A March 2018 Centre for Global Development policy paper asserted that eight BRI signatory countries were at high risk of debt distress due to BRI loans and were facing debt-to-GDP ratios beyond 50%, with 40% of external debt owed to China. This is not necessarily due to Chinese government-instructed deception or ‘obfuscation traps’. Nevertheless, what appears to be a strategy of co-optation of elites through opaque means is problematic in that it carries the potential to create a politically favourable environment in which potential Chinese government interests can be more easily pursued. A further consideration to bear in mind when considering Chinese infrastructure investment is that in smaller, less developed countries, Chinese investments and aid can surpass those of other actors, affording it a more visible presence and greater political influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BRI is unique in its size (roughly $47 billion allocated, based on the most recent available data of 2020), its geographic scope (covering 138 countries) and its strategic ambition. A 2020 Council on Foreign Relations report quoted investment bank Morgan Stanley’s prediction that China’s overall BRI spending could reach $1.2–$1.3 trillion by 2027. While the exact figures remain contested, the BRI likely exceeds any competing efforts by other non-democratic states such as North Korea, Iran, Saudi Arabia or Russia, either in the Asia-Pacific or globally, in terms of human and material resources, capital, and market access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connectivity Versus Indebtedness: The New Laos–China High-Speed Railway and Hambantota Port&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early December 2021, Laos launched a 414-km electrified high-speed railway running between the capital Vientiane and the town of Boten on the Laos–China border. Travelling to the Chinese border now takes less than four hours, compared to 15 hours by car, and costs $33 for a second-class seat. The line heads 600 km north to the capital of China’s Yunnan province, Kunming, linking the landlocked mountainous country of Laos to China’s key southwestern BRI hub. This $6-billion project (equivalent to one-third of Laos’ GDP) is backed by China as part of its BRI and is described as a lynchpin of deepening ties between the two countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project was marketed as a transformative opportunity for Laos to gain access to the Chinese market for agricultural and other exports while also developing a domestic tourism sector to accommodate Chinese travellers. Key details of the deal have not been made public, and no substantial degree of transparency is likely to be witnessed in the future. There have also been no open source discussions within Laos, in English or Laotian, regarding the overall cost-benefit ratio of this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the China–Laos high-speed rail project is not a Chinese equity investment, grant or any other structure that would generate high-value jobs or the positive diffusion of benefits that are traditionally associated with CNI projects. This project’s loan structure suggests that it is deliberately designed to extract maximum financial benefit from Laos while also simultaneously undermining Vientiane’s already fragile sovereignty. While there are some differences, the China–Laos railway includes key elements from China’s now-infamous Hambantota Port project in Sri Lanka, which ultimately saw China take control after the Sri Lankan government defaulted on high-interest loans. Various studies and commentaries have debated the Sri Lankan case. Some have shown that the Sri Lankan government bears a great degree of responsibility for the loans it agreed with China and that domestic agency should be given greater consideration in the assessment of whether China is at fault for the state of Sri Lanka’s economic collapse. Ultimately, both sides likely played a part – indeed, interviews with experts in the financial sector have highlighted some problematic aspects of China’s engagement on negotiating these deals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One interviewee indicated that the Chinese SOEs and funders may view the Hambantota Port as a successful deal, of which elements could be replicated in other key countries, such as in Southeast Asia. Chinese lending banks have demonstrated a high level of investment in developing least-developed countries that have found it challenging to access funding from other sources such as other governments and international capital markets, and have high structural unemployment rates. For countries like Sri Lanka and Laos, China thus offers a source of funding for infrastructure when financing cannot be accessed elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to one report, the average loan from an official Chinese creditor carries an interest rate of over 4% with an average repayment period of less than 10 years, while the average of an OECD creditor carries an interest rate of on average 1% and an average repayment period of 28 years. According to one interviewee in the financial sector, the high interest rates are positioned as the ‘price’ for the Chinese developer deploying its end-to-end capabilities to the country in question, while other experts note that China is successful in demanding higher interest rates due to its willingness to take on risks that other lenders will not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond high interest loans, there are also concerns around corruption and bribery in BRI projects, owing not least to a lack of transparency in the infrastructure project agreements. Two financial industry executives interviewed made reference to seemingly corrupt business practices involving obfuscated financial incentivisation in some BRI projects, while a third financial industry executive noted preferential treatment in the formation of holding companies and other corporate vehicles. However, publicly available information remains scarce and requires further investigation. If true, such practices would be deeply problematic and further add to the concerns over the lack of transparency of BRI projects and impact on good governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are concerns that these problematic practices have been replicated in other BRI projects since, including for example in the case of Laos. According to a financial industry executive based in the region, specific state-owned banking executives were brought back in to structure and execute the railway deal. These bank personnel were advised to replicate their previously successful deal elements while also ‘learning from previous mistakes’. The concern is therefore that, given the opacity of these deals, China may have the option to exert sovereign control over the Laos–China railway and any other land- or rail-related facilities included in the final agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thailand: Failure to Replicate and Strategic Pushback&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thailand was offered similar high interest rates as Laos had in 2016 for the extension of its high-speed railway from Laos to Bangkok. The Chinese terms of high interest rates, development rights along and on either side of the railway, as well as the right to work for Chinese engineers in Thailand were rejected by the State Railway of Thailand and Ministry of Finance and caused widespread offence across Thai leadership and corporate circles as they were interpreted as China viewing Thailand and Laos as undifferentiated and subservient countries to China, with then Thai Transport Minister Arkhom Termpittayapaisth remarking in 2016 that ‘Thailand is not the same as Laos’. While the Thai government still maintains an interest in developing high-speed rail within Thailand and regionally, one interviewee suggested that the Thai government has begun to multi-source for potential alternative partners to avoid being too dependent on China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to one regionally based investigative journalist, Thailand’s search for balance could have further downstream impacts on Chinese investment projects, such as the Chinese-proposed arms manufacturing facility in Udon Thani, of which there have been few updates since its announcement in 2017, and a naval shipyard in Sattahip, both of which would be co-located with facilities that are used by US forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, while Thailand is seeking to strike a balance, and choosing sides between the two major powers is not an appealing policy option, as is the case for other Southeast Asian states, Thailand has its own complicated history with the US following the 2014 coup and concerns over democratic backsliding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The China–Laos high-speed rail project has also further accelerated awareness and concerns regarding a range of activities by the CCP’s United Front in Thailand. The CCP’s United Front Work Department (UFWD), an organ directly subordinate to the CCP Central Committee, focuses its work on targeting governments, including in Southeast Asia, to exert political and economic influence and sometimes malign interference. In particular, there is now an enhanced focus on and investigation into United Front-funded Confucius Institutes in Thailand, specifically regarding why there are more of these institutes in Thailand than in the rest of Southeast Asia combined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sources have noted that Thailand’s US treaty ally status is what is likely driving the CCP’s strong focus and multifaceted approach in both the economic and information domains. Indeed, this could be seen as a part of a wider attempt to weaken the US hub-and-spoke alliance system in Asia, which Beijing views with suspicion as part of a US attempt to exert ‘all-round containment’ of China, as foreign minister Wang Yi has termed it, notwithstanding Thailand’s own objectives in its relationship with China and the US. Thailand could therefore present an opportunity for undue influence and interference through, for example, elite capture within a key American ally in Asia by using high-speed rail under the BRI front. 169 However, the problematic nature of China’s dealings in both Laos and Sri Lanka, combined with Beijing’s offensive offer to Thailand, appears to have undermined these efforts, at least temporarily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Malaysia’s East Coast Rail Link Project: BRI-Driven Strategic Envelopment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese funds were a core component of the 1MBD scandal, as has been demonstrated over the course of the multiple investigations and successful prosecutions of a range of individuals who were involved. Former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak and a select group of individuals around him had effectively bankrupted the publicly financed 1MBD national development fund through a range of corrupt activities, most of which occurred outside Malaysia. As the scale and scope of these activities expanded to a level where they could no longer be hidden, particularly when in 2015 1MDb missed a loan repayment of around US $550 million, the government of Malaysia was pressured to set up a special taskforce to investigate why and the United States Department of Justice files a civil suit in 2016. Some sources note that Najib received an offer from China to recapitalise the drained 1MDB account to cover up his previous activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In exchange for this, Najib allegedly granted Chinese SOEs privileged rights and access to a range of existing Malaysian port, energy and other infrastructure assets. Leading real-estate industry analysts noted that Chinese property developers were also given prime real estate at highly discounted rates in the southernmost Malaysian state of Johor, directly across from Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given Malaysia’s parliamentary form of government and reasonably open press, information regarding these events became widespread and prompted outrage across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When confronted with these developments, Najib claimed he was misled by financial advisers. While some analysts have attributed this to his lack of perceptiveness, others question whether he felt bolstered by the alleged Chinese backing. It is noteworthy that one of the key conspirators in the 1MBD corruption scandal, Malaysian citizen Jho Low, continues to reside in China despite being wanted by the Malaysian government for questioning while also being subject to an Interpol Red Notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Najib had not counted on was former Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad coming out of a long retirement to run for the post again. According to one executive interviewed, this development also represented an intelligence failure on the Chinese investors’ side, as Mahathir was assessed to be a senior adviser and retired statesman but not someone who would actively seek office again. Sources note that Mahathir’s re-election in 2018 caused distress among Malaysian and Chinese investors involved in the infrastructure deals and 1MDB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-2&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese BRI-driven activity in Laos, Thailand and Malaysia indicates that Chinese actors, ranging from state-owned companies to state-owned banks, and by association the Chinese government, have leveraged BRI high-speed rail projects for economic gain through a range of corrupt and predatory activities. To a certain extent, strategic leverage appears to have been sought through elite capture in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese government and affiliated SOEs are likely to pursue further BRI engagements in Malaysia, Thailand, Laos and other key Southeast Asian countries through continued pursuit of BRI projects and positive incentives, with potential negative consequences for good governance at the national level if transparency and scrutiny are lacking. However, there is also the potential for resistance, especially in countries that have electoral politics and somewhat free media and information environments. Malaysia presents a clear case in point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further investigation should be conducted on whether cyber operations have increased in existing target countries that have proven resistant, such as Malaysia and Thailand. This would help shine a light on whether a range of both incentives and coercive measures are used in target countries, and could indicate a more concerted state-led effort on the part of the Chinese state, and lend greater credit to the idea that some BRI projects are not simply commercial engagements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;key-findings-and-policy-recommendations&quot;&gt;Key Findings and Policy Recommendations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has examined the debate on influence versus malign interference in Southeast Asia and has outlined some case study examples of interference in the region that highlight the modus operandi of authoritarian regimes, particularly China, in the economic, political and information domains. It has also explored the question of whether governments in the region have implemented or strengthened risk mitigation strategies as a result of interference within their borders. This chapter highlights four broad trends that can be seen throughout the case studies and the regional overview, and offers concluding policy recommendations for the UK and its partners with regard to strengthening national resilience in Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Interpretations of Malign States and Hostile Activity Differ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As seen throughout the various case studies, countries in Southeast Asia differ in their interpretation of what constitutes a hostile action. There is overarching agreement that interference is different from influence, which is defined as soft power. More menacing is covert interference in a state’s sovereignty and decision-making, although the extent to which actions are viewed as interference versus influence is not aligned across the region. The case studies have shown that deep links between political elites, ethnic demographics and vulnerabilities in institutional resilience through, for example, corruption, complicate how states respond to foreign actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So too are there differences on the question of which states are considered to be engaging in ‘malign’ behaviour. The geographic and demographic particularities and close bilateral partnerships of specific Southeast Asian states shape the prism through which foreign countries are viewed. This is not unsurprising or unreasonable – for European countries and close liberal democratic partners more generally, the staunch differences in foreign and domestic policy of countries like Russia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, North Korea and China pose direct and indirect challenges to European perspectives of the rules-based international order and the principles upon which it is built. The geographical proximity of Russia and Iran, for example, poses a direct danger to European security in the continent’s own territory or its periphery. This distinction is not as stark in Southeast Asia. Moreover, the concept of a state with ‘malign intent’ is viewed somewhat differently, with examples focusing more on challenging behaviour than intent, due to political sensitivity around risking being seen as choosing sides in what is ultimately considered a geopolitical competition between the US and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The geopolitical pressures that Southeast Asian states face are not identical and thus shape each country’s view of which states are viewed as malign actors in the region. While there are some concerns around Saudi Arabia and Iran, these are limited to relevant states such as Indonesia and Malaysia. As Richard Javad Heydarian notes, Russia’s status as the largest source of defence sales for certain countries may play a role in how this actor is viewed in Southeast Asia. While Chinese examples of interference exist across the region, the geopolitical and economic realities that Southeast Asian states must contend with hamper public discussion of the challenges that Beijing presents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. The Current Level of Analysis of Malign Interference is Low Across the Region&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the regional overview and case studies show, Southeast Asian open source information on interference in the economic, political and information domains is limited where foreign state activity is concerned. Often, these themes are addressed by investigative journalists, but few public studies by experts in the region itself have examined them in detail. This is despite the much stronger focus on overt interference in the region, such as in the maritime domain, around the South China Sea issue. However, even the South China Sea disputes and regional security developments, such as the announcement of AUKUS, have elicited ambivalent responses that seek to avoid directly criticising Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The literature review and associated interviews as summarised in the regional overview showed four particular trends across the region: elite capture and hidden debt in Southeast Asia; online interference in election campaigns; investment in digital CNI; and Covid-19 vaccine diplomacy in selected states. However, issues of potential covert interference, such as through economic investment, elite capture or information operations, appear too sensitive to discuss publicly. This could be because of the difficulty in confirming state attribution of interference, or because of the political sensitivities of the offending and target states in question. Indeed, interviewees for this paper who have offered details on potential interference by foreign states have only spoken on the condition of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are, however, some specific hubs of analysis in the region, which include the RSIS Centre of Excellence for National Security in Singapore, and in the private sector, Mandiant and Recorded Future, which have established regional centres of expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Chinese Interference is Seen Across the Region in the Three Themes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this paper has sought to explore case studies of foreign interference in Southeast Asia by four distinct authoritarian regimes, the case studies have overwhelmingly featured China. This could be for a variety of reasons. One is the comparatively weaker and smaller presence of Iran, Russia and North Korea in seeking influence through interference in domestic affairs in Southeast Asia, and their priority of focusing on other regions and national security interests. It could also be, as noted earlier, that actors like Russia are not necessarily seen as nefarious actors in the region. China’s extensive engagement in Southeast Asia and desire for influence in its surrounding environment is well appreciated by countries in the region, and prominent case studies thus tend to more naturally revolve around China. Indeed, interference connected to Chinese state-linked actors was seen across the three themes under examination in this paper (information operations, political interference and economic interference).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is particularly prominent in discussions around Chinese economic investment and elite capture, which appear to go hand in hand in the case study chapters. These investments are being made along the BRI, but also in states where China may be seeking to achieve additional objectives, such as diminishing the influence of the US in treaty allies Thailand and the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also some evidence of Chinese and Russian cyber operations targeting Indonesia’s presidential elections in 2019. Indeed, China’s investment in CNI such as telecommunications in the region has created a particular vulnerability, with several countries in the region facing cyber attacks and media interference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Greater Countermeasures to Mitigate Risks are Required&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK, Europe, the US and other like-minded partners have strengthened their risk mitigation regimes to protect critical industries, heighten investment screening regimes, and prevent foreign interference in politics and the media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has not occurred to a similar extent in Southeast Asia, despite obvious strategic interests in the region from actors like China and activity taking place in the economic, political and information domains. There are notable exceptions, however – as seen in the chapter case studies, some countries in the region have responded with some mitigation efforts. These include Singapore, which introduced FICA in 2021, and Malaysia, through its focus on cyber security and various national security laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As they look for opportunities for deeper engagement in and with countries in the Indo-Pacific, the UK and partners could increase engagement in the region in several ways. This paper offers the following four recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 1: Continue Support for Local Media and Civil Society&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One immediate area for engagement that has emerged from this paper, although not entirely new, is the importance of supporting local media and civil society, and the fundamental role that investigative journalism and local engagement have played in exposing elite capture and corruption, as well as covert interference in the economic and information domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the worrying trend of democratic backsliding in Southeast Asian countries like the Philippines, the limits placed on the press in other Southeast Asian countries, and China’s offer of media training to journalists in the region, this should be a continued policy priority for the UK and partners. It should include media training to aspiring journalists in the region, but as has been pointed out, any such assistance must be made transparently and should be understood to be highly sensitive in certain countries in Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 2: Offer Alternatives Where Investment is Needed in the Region&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another area in which the UK and other partners have already highlighted the need for increased engagement is infrastructure initiatives. While this is not purported to be in response to China specifically, the language around principles of sustainable infrastructure based on high environmental standards, fair financial arrangements and transparency in project contracting underscores the concerns around Chinese investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, infrastructure investment can be a slow and complex process. Given the heightened interest in Southeast Asia, the UK and like-minded liberal democratic partners would do well to engage in joint needs assessments in consultation with governments in the region, particularly around the area of CNI. Further investment and engagement through groupings like the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, the G20 (through standard-setting), the Blue Dot Network and the EU Global Gateway should be pursued. The unwitting exposure of Western financial institutions to liabilities associated with the BRI in Southeast Asia should also be examined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 3: Increase Information Exchange on Malign Interference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK and partners inside and outside Southeast Asia should consider exchanging information with one another on malign interference to help build a better threat picture of specific vulnerabilities and trends in targeting. As this information is likely highly sensitive and to various extents classified, the UK, for example, might consider, in trusted government-to-government settings, sharing information on observable trends, rather than specific detailed accounts or attribution to specific actors. This would help reinforce the global response to the challenge of malign interference and help shed light on whether observable trends are replicated in different geographical locations and specific contexts. Given that governments are understandably reactive and malign actors are more easily able to change tactics, this would also help governments shorten response times and address vulnerabilities in a timelier manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 4: Help Develop Risk Mitigation Strategies in the Region&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK, Europe and other partners have strengthened existing legislative regimes and crafted new ones to counter malign interference within their borders. These may not be best practice, but they represent examples that could be tailored to meet the specificities of Southeast Asian countries when it comes to legislation on cyber security, disinformation, investment screening and foreign interference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specific areas that are underdeveloped in Southeast Asia include cyber security and investment screening. On the latter, Southeast Asian countries have been liberalising foreign direct investment regimes since the 1990s as part of their development models. However, given increasing awareness of risk, investment screening mechanisms that protect national security (for example, on CNI, data and resources) may be required. Other reports have recommended that these be along the lines of OECD standards, even if not identical to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States regime or other regimes of developed countries. Foreign interference laws are another area that could be strengthened, with Singapore having strengthened its legislation in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK and partners in the transatlantic community, as well as the Indo-Pacific, should consider sharing experiences and legislative countermeasures in Track 1 and Track 2 settings. However, the unique and distinct environments of all 10 ASEAN member states should be taken into consideration here, with an understanding that there will not be a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to countermeasures. Furthermore, as has been discussed in this paper, there is the added complexity of criticisms in Southeast Asian countries that legislation which is meant to protect national security has also been used for domestic political ends by ruling governments. Given the UK’s new Dialogue Partnership with ASEAN announced in early August 2021, and the launch of the ASEAN–UK Digital Innovation Partnership the following month, there may be an opportunity for the UK and other ASEAN partners to launch a programme of engagement focusing on best practice in mitigating malign activity and specifically hostile information campaigns in the digital space across Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK in particular could also sponsor fellowships for higher-level and executive-level training on hybrid warfare and hybrid threats or courses at institutions like the Oxford Changing Character of War Centre, the European Centre for Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats, think tanks, or private sector institutions working on cyber security, whether in Europe or the Indo-Pacific. Ultimately, none of these recommendations can be employed individually; rather, they should form the arms of a multifaceted strategy of regional engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
