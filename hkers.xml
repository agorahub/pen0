However, no formal, comprehensive plan for Ukraine’s agricultural recovery exists today after more than three years of protracted conflict.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Black Sea port infrastructure to farmland soils, Russia’s war has negatively impacted all aspects of Ukraine’s agricultural system. Russia has gained significant economic and geopolitical benefits by doing so, including the diminishment of Ukraine’s wartime economy, disruption to EU agricultural markets, and opening of opportunity for Russia to expand its agricultural market share—and influence—in strategic regions. The Kyiv School of Economics and the World Bank’s latest Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment estimates total direct damages to Ukraine’s agriculture sector at $11.2 billion, leading to $72.7 billion in losses since 2022. Reconstruction and recovery will be costly, estimated at $55.5 billion over the next 10 years, but the benefits are numerous: bolstering Ukraine’s economy, strengthening global food security, and countering Russia’s expanding influence in global agriculture markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSIS’s white paper, “Blueprint for an Agricultural Recovery Plan for Ukraine,” presents the essential elements of an agricultural recovery plan that would position Ukraine’s agriculture sector for a sustainable and economically competitive future in line with EU integration. When a ceasefire is reached, this blueprint could serve as the basis for a formal plan for Ukraine’s agricultural recovery, endorsed by the Ukrainian government and its partners. Absent a ceasefire plan, the blueprint could still help guide investments from Ukraine’s partners in Ukraine’s agriculture sector. The agricultural recovery priorities are organized temporally into urgent (0–1 years), short-term (1–3 years), medium-term (3–5 years), and long-term (5+ years) actions, with the integration of long-term strategic planning into short-term efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/FV8lHWN.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Framework for an Agricultural Recovery Plan for Ukraine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Urgent&lt;/strong&gt; measures are recommended for immediate implementation in the next year to restore the basic functioning of Ukraine’s agriculture sector and ensure Ukrainian food exports flow freely to global markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Restore production, transportation, storage, and irrigation infrastructure, with considerations for EU standards, predicted climate change impacts, and the war’s effects on Ukraine’s agricultural trade flows.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recultivate farmland and develop the land market to attract foreign investment and ensure that farming activities can be resumed safely and profitably.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provide and expand financial support for farmers to support the continued function of Ukraine’s agriculture sector and its role in safeguarding global food security.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short-term&lt;/strong&gt; recommendations emphasize the stabilization and expansion of economic opportunities for both producers and foreign investors in Ukraine’s agriculture sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Diversify Ukraine’s export structure and increase the competitiveness of Ukrainian agricultural goods on global markets through an integrated approach to agricultural and international trade, improving upon prewar export infrastructure and trade regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Develop Ukraine’s agricultural labor force and education programs to preserve the productivity of existing personnel, incentivize employment in agriculture, and prepare new agricultural workers—including veterans, women, and young people—for long-term contributions to the sector’s development.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medium-term&lt;/strong&gt; measures center around the development of an agriculture sector that is sustainable, modernized, and competitive in global markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strengthen rural agricultural communities through financial support, infrastructure development, and rural entrepreneurship incentives to support Ukraine’s postwar recovery and economic resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Develop Ukraine’s livestock production to strengthen self-sufficiency in livestock products, better integrate Ukraine’s crop–livestock–food processing value chain, and increase Ukraine’s high-value agricultural exports.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-term&lt;/strong&gt; recovery measures aim to culminate in the integration of a climate-resilient, modernized agriculture sector into the global agricultural economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Integrate Ukraine’s agricultural sector into the European Union in line with requirements for strengthened quality control and regulations, modernized trade infrastructure at EU borders, advanced certification processes for improved market access, and deepened economic and agricultural cooperation with the bloc.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adapt Ukraine’s agriculture sector to climate change, as climate risks elevate the need for efficient irrigation and water use systems, a skilled agricultural labor force, and educational and advisory services to integrate practices into Ukraine’s farming system.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Develop Ukraine’s food processing industry to strengthen the country’s capacity to export finished, high-value food products to increase national budget revenue, improve food self-sufficiency, and further strengthen Ukraine’s role as a major global food supplier.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s agricultural recovery is a complex and long-term process requiring multidisciplinary and coordinated approaches. A phased recovery framework should distinguish the four interconnected stages—urgent, short-term, medium-term, and long-term measures—with one cross-cutting priority remaining central: incentivizing foreign investment in Ukraine’s agriculture sector. Despite wartime risks, Ukraine’s agriculture sector continues to demonstrate resilience, reflecting the confidence investors have in its long-term potential. In coordinating recovery efforts around this staged and interconnected framework, Ukraine’s agriculture sector can leverage foreign investment not only to address the war’s consequences but to further Ukrainian agribusiness as one of the most attractive destinations for international investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 significantly disrupted Ukraine’s agriculture sector, which is a pillar of its national economy and a key player in global food trade. It could take years or even decades for Ukraine’s farmland, agricultural infrastructure, logistics routes, agricultural labor force, and agribusiness environment to recover from the destruction suffered throughout the war. This report aims to provide the government of Ukraine and its partners with a sequenced road map for Ukraine’s agricultural recovery that positions the sector for a sustainable and economically competitive future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 2014 to 2022, agriculture contributed, on average, 10 percent of Ukraine’s GDP. In 2021, agricultural exports accounted for $27.7 billion, or 41 percent, of Ukraine’s export earnings. Agricultural exports increased as a proportion of total export revenue in 2024—representing over 59 percent—although their actual value decreased to $24.7 billion. Despite damages and losses from the war, Ukraine’s agriculture sector continued to produce and export food products to domestic and foreign markets. In fact, in 2024, Ukraine was the top exporter of sunflower oil and sunflower meal, the third-largest exporter of rapeseed, fourth-largest exporter of corn and walnuts, fifth-largest exporter of barley, and sixth-largest exporter of wheat, soybeans, and poultry to global markets. The restoration of Ukraine’s agriculture sector is not only the foundation for the country’s economic recovery, but also critical for global food security and a promising direction for international cooperation and investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, several agencies and organizations have developed strategic plans for Ukraine’s reconstruction, recovery, and transformation. In July 2022, the National Recovery Council’s New Agrarian Policy working group released a Draft Ukraine Recovery Plan. This document proposes a three-stage recovery approach: The first phase (2022) is focused on meeting urgent agricultural needs, the second (2023–25) on structural rebuilding, and the third (2026–32) on growth and modernization. A medium-term perspective is outlined in the Food Security Strategy of Ukraine Until 2030, developed by the Ministry of Economy. The strategy identifies tasks such as ensuring stable access to quality food, increasing domestic production, reducing import dependency, and enhancing the food system’s resilience to crises and external shocks. More wide-ranging road maps like the Ukraine Facility Plan 2024–2027, developed in cooperation with the European Union, outline long-term planning for rural development, EU integration, agricultural demining, the green transition, land governance reform, and digitalization. Other plans, such as the Emergency and Early Recovery Response Plan 2025–2026 from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), focus on meeting the urgent needs of small- and medium-scale producers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several sector-specific initiatives also deserve attention, such as the 2024 Action Plans for the Green Recovery and Transformation of the Ukrainian Food Industries, developed with support from the UN Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO). This initiative focuses on energy-efficient technologies, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and modernizing the food industry. Additional resources include a white paper from the European Business Association on economic recovery and EU market integration; the CEPA report Resilience, Reconstruction, Recovery: The Path Ahead for Ukraine; the FAO’s 2023 Ukraine: Response Programme; the Centre for Economic Policy Research’s 2022 publication A Blueprint for the Reconstruction of Ukraine; and the National Recovery Council’s 2022 Ukraine’s National Recovery Plan. Together, these documents have suggested comprehensive policy frameworks for rebuilding Ukraine’s agricultural potential that have been taken into consideration by the government of Ukraine. In November 2024, the Cabinet of Ministers approved Ukraine’s Strategy for the Development of Agriculture and Rural Areas through 2030. The comprehensive blueprint put forward in this report aligns with and supports this strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since early 2022, the situation in Ukraine has significantly changed, particularly in the agriculture sector. The scale of destruction has intensified due to ongoing hostilities, drastically impacting rural infrastructure, farmland, and production facilities. Logistics chains have been restructured, especially following the blockade of the Black Sea, which disrupted grain exports and access to global markets. At the same time, climate and environmental challenges have become more acute, with growing issues related to droughts, soil degradation, and water scarcity in many regions. These factors have compounded the urgency of Ukraine’s European integration, as aligning with EU standards and mechanisms offers long-term support for agricultural resilience and sustainability. In light of these evolving conditions, the existing recovery and development plans require revisions to better reflect current risks and to ensure the effective reconstruction and modernization of Ukraine’s agri-food system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report builds on recovery and reconstruction plans developed throughout the full-scale war and presents the elements of a comprehensive plan for Ukraine’s agricultural recovery. When a ceasefire is reached, this blueprint could serve as the basis for a formal plan for Ukraine’s agricultural recovery, endorsed by the Ukrainian government and its partners. Absent a ceasefire plan, the blueprint could still help guide investments from Ukraine’s partners in the country’s agriculture sector. Priorities for agricultural investment are organized into four stages: urgent (0–1 years), short term (1–3 years), medium term (3–5 years), and long term (5+ years). Cross-cutting measures are put forward to optimize Ukraine’s agricultural recovery within the country’s overall reconstruction efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;urgent-measures-01-year&quot;&gt;Urgent Measures (0–1 Year)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Urgent measures for immediate implementation should focus on restoring the basic functions of Ukraine’s agriculture sector and ensuring Ukraine’s food exports reach global markets. The three priority areas outlined below are (1) restoration of production infrastructure, storage, and logistics, (2) recultivation and security measures for agricultural areas and development of the land market, and (3) financial support for agricultural producers and access to soft loans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;restoration-of-production-infrastructure-storage-and-logistics&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Restoration of Production Infrastructure, Storage, and Logistics&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Restoring production and transport infrastructure is the most immediately effective measure to increase productivity, provide continuous supply to domestic and foreign markets, reduce production costs, and increase profitability. Constructing new elevators in regions of growing agricultural production and near land borders and ports will increase storage volumes and product quality, reduce losses, and ensure sufficient ending stocks. Restoring irrigation systems will increase yields and help producers adapt agriculture to climate change. According to some forecasts, after restoring this key infrastructure, production volumes in territories currently under Ukrainian control could increase by 20–30 percent within the first five years following the end of the war. In the long term, agricultural production could return to prewar levels and even exceed them with the implementation of innovative irrigation recovery efforts.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/RUockpA.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Output and GDP from Agriculture in Ukraine (2021 constant UAH)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The value of total agricultural production as well as agriculture’s contribution to Ukraine’s GDP decreased by nearly 17 percent from 2021 to 2023 (see Figure 1). A primary driver of this decline is damage to production facilities, infrastructure, and logistics. The World Bank and Kyiv School of Economics’ Fourth Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment (RDNA4) estimated that as of December 31, 2024, total direct damage to the agriculture sector amounted to $11.2 billion, with machinery and equipment damage accounting for the largest share of total damage (58 percent), followed by storage facility damage (17 percent) and stolen agricultural inputs and outputs (17 percent). As of 2021, 1,355 grain elevators with over 57 million metric tons of storage capacity were available in Ukraine. Approximately 11.4 million metric tons of grain storage capacity were fully destroyed and another 3.3 million metric tons were partially damaged due to the invasion, reducing farmers’ ability to store their crops in proper conditions. Alongside numerous other complications to the sector brought on by the war, damaged facilities, infrastructure, and logistics have contributed approximately $72.7 billion in indirect losses. Indirect losses include the loss to farm income due to foregone or reduced production, lower farm gate prices due to export logistic disruptions, higher farm production costs due to higher input prices, and costs of land recultivation due to contamination from explosives and debris from damaged infrastructure. Ukraine’s irrigation and drainage infrastructure have suffered extensive damages throughout the war, including the Kakhovka Dam collapse and damage to canals, pumps, and reservoirs across the country, severely affecting farmers’ use of irrigation resources. Frequent power outages at pumping stations and high energy prices limiting farmers’ budgets for water resources compound the deterioration of Ukraine’s irrigation and water governance capacity. From 2021 to 2023, operational irrigation fell drastically from 600,000 to 134,000 hectares (ha), weakening agricultural productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Damage to transport infrastructure significantly complicates the logistics of internal and external supply of agricultural products and inputs. Approximately 30 percent of Ukraine’s railway infrastructure remains in a damage-repair cycle, according to the RDNA4, and more than 26,000 kilometers of roads and 344 bridges of state, local, or municipal importance have been destroyed. The widespread scale of destruction to transportation infrastructure makes logistics more difficult and expensive, thus reducing farmers’ income and limiting their ability to increase agricultural production. Of the utmost importance for agricultural export logistics is preserving port infrastructure and ensuring uninterrupted port operations. Before the war, as many as 8 million metric tons of agricultural products passed through Ukraine’s Black Sea ports in a given month, with a 2021 monthly average of 5 million metric tons. In 2022, this figure was halved, averaging 2.5 million metric tons per month, following the complete blockade at the beginning of the war and the later resumption of operations of three greater Odesa ports as part of the Black Sea Grain Initiative. The lost Black Sea port capacity was partially compensated for by the Danube River ports, which increased their transshipment from 0.2 million metric tons in 2021 to 1.2 million metric tons in 2022 and a record 2.2 million metric tons after termination of the grain initiative in August 2023, but Ukraine still has not reached prewar export levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the RDNA4, the total recovery and reconstruction needs in the agriculture sector are estimated at $55.5 billion over 10 years (2025–35), including $2.3 million for restoring destroyed grain storage facilities. This estimate includes the reconstruction or replacement of damaged assets as well as debris removal and demolition of damaged property—while accommodating the “build back better” principle, which integrates improvements in energy efficiency, modernization, and sustainability into reconstruction efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recent Initiatives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Restoring transportation and logistics infrastructure has remained a national priority throughout the war. The government of Ukraine and its EU partners have established Solidarity Lanes—road, river, and rail export routes that function as alternatives to maritime export routes, which remain a primary target of Russian attacks—and Ukraine has restored the flow of trade through its Black Sea ports with the Ukrainian Corridor. Together, the Ukrainian Corridor and Danube River cluster shipped 97.2 million metric tons of cargo in 2024, including 60.3 million metric tons of grain. Compared to 2023, general cargo exports increased by 56.8 percent and grain exports increased by 32.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, from 2022 to 2024, over 2,000 kilometers of roads underwent emergency repairs, roughly 326 kilometers of railway tracks were rebuilt, and 115 road bridges were restored using temporary structures. Progress to repair and restore this infrastructure remains fragile, however, as continuous Russian attacks frequently damage and destroy infrastructure across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To improve irrigation infrastructure, the Ukrainian government introduced new legislation regarding water users’ organizations (WUOs) and the stimulation of hydrotechnical land reclamation. The legislation’s main tasks are aimed at creating a legal framework for the formation and operation of organizations or associations of farmers who use water for land reclamation. The legislation transfers management functions for part of the land reclamation infrastructure facilities to these organizations and creates legal mechanisms for making investments in the existing land reclamation infrastructure. As of January 2025, 54 WUOs were registered, 22 of them in 2024 alone, indicating that reform in the field of hydrotechnical land reclamation is gaining momentum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to support agricultural production in Ukraine and ensure national and global food security during the ongoing war, the Ukrainian government collaborated with international partners on a number of rapid measures, among them providing farmers with plastic grain bags (sleeves) as a temporary solution for storing harvest. In 2022, Agriculture Growing Rural Opportunities Activity (AGRO) from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) provided Ukrainian farmers with 7,800 sleeves, capable of storing a total of 1.5 million metric tons of grain, along with equipment for packing grain into sleeves (29 grain packing machines and 30 hoppers) and 36 modular grain storage facilities. In 2024, USAID’s Harvest Program and the FAO announced they would distribute another 7,000 plastic grain bags, which could store 1.4 million metric tons of grain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, where possible, work was carried out to repair damaged elevators, increase the capacity of existing ones, and build new ones. During the first two years of the war, Ukraine’s elevator capacity increased by 2 million metric tons, including approximately 65 new or upgraded facilities. In addition, several new transshipment terminals recently built along Ukraine’s border with EU countries (e.g., the Vadul-Syret terminal in Chernivtsi Oblast, the Chornotisiv terminal in Zakarpattia Oblast, and the Mostyska dry port in Lviv Oblast) provide additional storage capacities and alternative logistics. The Howard Buffett Foundation and other investors supported this initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Current and Future Priorities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Restoring production infrastructure, storage, and logistics must remain a priority even as the war continues. Beyond support already provided, further restoration of production and transport infrastructure based on the “build back better” principle would ensure an increase in agricultural production, uninterrupted supply to domestic and foreign markets, reduction in production costs, and an increase in profitability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Construct new grain elevators.&lt;/strong&gt; More grain elevators in regions of growing agricultural production and near land borders and ports will increase storage volumes and help improve product quality, reduce losses, ensure sufficient ending stocks, and improve export logistics for agricultural products. Due to the increase in production of certain crops in relatively safe regions, changes in crop rotations, a shift to oilseeds, and the potential expansion of processing, as well as the redirection of export routes, the strategic location of grain and oil storage facilities is particularly important.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Redesign transportation networks.&lt;/strong&gt; Although transportation infrastructure is an indirect component of the agriculture sector, it is critical for agricultural sustainability. To ensure a reliable supply of agricultural inputs, affected transport networks will have to be redesigned not only in accordance with EU standards and climate change requirements, but also in a way that reflects the movement of people and industries since Russia’s invasion. In parallel, the transportation sector will require profound reforms, including port governance improvements, railway restructuring, and concessions of highways that will attract private investment. Although the transportation sector of Ukraine has undergone an organizational transformation and administrative functions have been transferred from the government to sectoral executive bodies, state agencies, and private enterprises, the framework of public-private partnership and regulation of the legal status of transportation lands and facilities require further improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restore irrigation systems.&lt;/strong&gt; The creation of WUOs in different regions of Ukraine, especially in the south, opens an opportunity for attracting investments for the modernization, renovation, and enhancement of irrigation systems to increase yields and adapt to climate change. The use of low-pressure sprinkler systems with electric trolley drives, drip irrigation systems, closed-type networks for water delivery, and other modern technologies will reduce the use of irrigation water and electricity for its supply. Sustainable agriculture production through improvement of local small irrigation systems is an important way to compensate for the production losses of the occupied and frontline areas where irrigation is no longer possible due to the destruction of irrigation systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;recultivation-and-security-measures-for-agricultural-areas-and-development-of-the-land-market&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recultivation and Security Measures for Agricultural Areas and Development of the Land Market&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The sustainable recovery of Ukraine’s agriculture sector depends on land demining, environmental restoration, and land market development. The large-scale contamination of farmland with mines and unexploded ordnance remains a major challenge, affecting 25 percent of Ukraine’s territory and requiring extensive clearance efforts. Government initiatives aim to reduce demining costs, accelerate land restoration, and support farmers in resuming agricultural activities. Simultaneously, expansion of Ukraine’s land market is facilitating investment and infrastructure reconstruction in war-affected regions. Strengthening international cooperation, securing additional financial resources, and integrating advanced technologies will be essential for restoring agricultural productivity, ensuring food security, and promoting long-term economic stability.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine is known as a breadbasket due to its wealth of fertile black soil, which has long supported high levels of agricultural productivity. Since gaining independence, Ukraine has undergone significant reforms in land governance, including a moratorium on the sale of agricultural land that lasted for nearly two decades. In 2021, the official opening of the land market allowed private individuals to buy and sell farmland under regulated conditions. This marked a crucial step toward attracting investment, improving land use efficiency, and aligning Ukraine’s agriculture sector with European market standards. Even despite the ongoing war, the land market continues to function and remains a vital component of the agriculture sector’s future development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion, however, has imposed significant physical and chemical damage to Ukraine’s agricultural land. Approximately 25 percent of Ukraine’s total territory—156,000 square kilometers—is potentially contaminated with landmines and unexploded ordnance, posing serious risks to agricultural production and farmers’ safety. Beyond severe humanitarian consequences, explosive hazards have significantly limited the use of potentially contaminated land, hindering agricultural activity and slowing Ukraine’s broader economic recovery. For example, in Kharkiv Oblast, which was partially occupied, nearly half of all farmland remains contaminated, severely straining local agricultural producers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The economic consequences are substantial. Ukraine’s annual GDP losses from this contamination exceed $11 billion, or about 5.6 percent of its national GDP. By the beginning of 2025, more than 7,500 environmental violations had been documented, causing estimated damages of approximately $87 billion. Despite these extensive challenges, Ukraine’s agriculture sector remains a cornerstone of national economic stability and global food security. Therefore, effective land monitoring, demining, and restoration of agricultural lands are critical tasks for ensuring food system stability, supporting economic recovery, and fostering international cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recent Initiatives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian government, in collaboration with international partners, is implementing large-scale programs aimed at humanitarian demining, environmental monitoring, and land market development. Since 2024, a state compensation program has supported farmers engaged in agricultural land demining. This program covers 100 percent of planned demining costs and reimburses 80 percent of expenses for already cleared land, provided the required documentation is submitted. In 2024, the Ukrainian government allocated over $13.5 million for this initiative, and an additional $27 million is budgeted for 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine is conducting extensive humanitarian demining operations in cooperation with international organizations (HALO Trust, Danish Demining Group, Swiss Foundation for Mine Action, Demining Solutions, and others) to mitigate the risks posed by explosive remnants of war and to facilitate the rehabilitation of agricultural and residential areas. As of 2025, the estimated cost of demining war-affected territories in Ukraine stands at approximately $29.8 billion. Achieving full demining would also require the deployment of more than 10,000 trained specialists. These operations are supported by advanced detection technologies, specialized equipment, and highly trained manual demining teams. Simultaneously, organizations such as the FAO, the Sokolovsky Institute of Soil Science and Agrochemistry, and the Howard Buffett Foundation, among others, are helping to conduct environmental assessments in Ukraine. These initiatives evaluate contamination impacts, inform land reclamation strategies, and ensure the safe and productive reintegration of cleared areas into agricultural and economic use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond demining, land market reform remains a key priority, as the absence of a transparent and functional land market has long hindered investment, modernization, and financial access for farmers in Ukraine. In the context of postwar recovery, a fully operational land market will be essential for boosting agricultural productivity, revitalizing rural areas, and ensuring food security. Between the land market’s opening in 2021 and the end of 2023, private individuals completed nearly 250,000 land transactions. During its first year of operation from July 2021 to July 2022, the State Land Cadastre recorded over 200,000 land sale, and sustained demand for land resources has been demonstrated since the land market’s opening. In January 2024, legal entities were granted the right to purchase agricultural land and foster investment in the reconstruction and development of war-affected territories. Land transactions increased further as a result, and by February 2025, the total number of transactions had increased to more than 396,400, covering 877,805 ha. These figures reflect growing trust in the land market, as transparent land ownership attracts investment, enables credit access, and drives agricultural modernization—supporting recovery and rural development and aligning land values with European levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the ongoing war, Ukraine’s land market continues to function, contributing to economic development and providing new opportunities for farmers. The introduction of the Prozorro electronic auction system has ensured transparency and competitiveness in land transactions, representing a crucial step in combating illicit practices in the market. Despite the challenges posed by the war, agricultural land prices have increased by 30 percent since the market’s launch, reflecting the sector’s high adaptability. However, regional disparities in land prices remain significant due to both economic and security factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Current and Future Priorities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The further recovery of Ukraine’s agricultural land requires the expansion of government policy measures and enhanced international support. Key priorities include increasing funding for demining programs, expanding international assistance, and developing the land market to improve agricultural productivity and economic stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expand humanitarian demining efforts.&lt;/strong&gt; International support remains critically important for accelerating humanitarian demining in Ukraine, particularly through the provision of modern technologies such as drones, robotic systems, and specialized armored equipment that enhance the safety and effectiveness of operations. Given the large-scale contamination of agricultural land, additional investment is needed in demining infrastructure, specialist training, and technical capacity building. To ensure quality and accountability, the Ukrainian government must reform the certification system for demining operators, establish clear safety standards, and provide protections preventing certified deminers from being mobilized to the front line. Close collaboration with international partners will support the adoption of best practices, including the use of geospatial technologies and AI-based systems to more accurately detect hazardous areas.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provide financial support to affected farmers.&lt;/strong&gt; The Ukrainian government has already allocated $81 million to compensate farmers engaged in humanitarian demining of agricultural land, aiming to reduce financial burdens and accelerate the restoration of safe agricultural production. Expanding financial support programs for farmers affected by land contamination is essential to help them resume operations without bearing unsustainable financial burdens. Such assistance should be closely coordinated with demining efforts to ensure timely land access and enable investments in recovery and future productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attracting foreign investment into the land market.&lt;/strong&gt; In the context of postwar recovery, the Ukrainian government should consider the potential benefits of opening the agricultural land market to foreign investors (with the exception of citizens and entities from aggressor states). This issue extends beyond land valuation, as the presence of international investors would contribute not only financial capital but also managerial expertise and advanced agricultural technologies. A crucial aspect of such a policy shift is that foreign investors could serve as strategic advocates for Ukraine in their respective countries, strengthening international support and countering geopolitical threats. The integration of foreign capital into the agricultural land market could generate multifaceted advantages, fostering economic revitalization and strengthening Ukraine’s integration into global agricultural and financial systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Legalize land ownership and incentivize investment.&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, over 3.3 million ha of land is cultivated by companies with foreign investment under long-term lease agreements, effectively creating a quasi-ownership market. The formalization of such relations through legislative amendments would enable foreign investors to secure property rights, thereby incentivizing long-term capital inflows essential for the reconstruction and modernization of Ukraine’s agriculture sector. Moreover, introducing foreign ownership rights while maintaining regulatory safeguards could enhance land market competitiveness, attract strategic investments in agri-food processing and infrastructure, and contribute to the overall resilience of the national economy. Given the country’s substantial war-related losses and its growing need for investment, further government policy interventions aimed at facilitating foreign participation in the land market could play a decisive role in ensuring the sustainable recovery of Ukraine’s agriculture sector. Meanwhile, the continued implementation of government programs and international support remain crucial for environmental monitoring, demining, and land market development, ensuring the recovery of Ukraine’s agriculture sector, food security, and economic growth. Strengthening institutional frameworks for land governance and promoting investment-friendly policies will contribute to the sustainable development of rural areas, fostering long-term resilience and economic revitalization.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;financial-support-for-agricultural-producers-and-access-to-soft-loans&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Financial Support for Agricultural Producers and Access to Soft Loans&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Financial stability and access to affordable credit are critical for the resilience and modernization of Ukraine’s agriculture sector. Wartime disruptions have significantly impacted small- and medium-sized enterprises, increasing production costs and limiting access to essential financial resources. Government programs such as the Affordable Loans 5-7-9 initiative and the Partial Credit Guarantee Fund for Agriculture have played a crucial role in providing financial assistance for operational costs, land purchases, and equipment modernization. Further expansion of preferential financing, flexible loan mechanisms, and financial advisory support will be essential for ensuring long-term stability, encouraging innovation, and enhancing Ukraine’s agricultural competitiveness.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has created unprecedented challenges for agricultural producers, disrupting supply chains, increasing production costs, and limiting access to essential resources. Small- and medium-sized agricultural enterprises have been particularly affected. In addition to damaged land, destroyed assets, and increased prices for inputs, agricultural enterprises are facing financial constraints, particularly limited access to the credit resources they need to maintain operational activities during the war. The high cost of loans and inflation risks further complicate their ability to invest in development, modernize equipment, and implement innovations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the initial stage of the war, many agricultural producers faced significant difficulties in marketing their harvested products due to the collapse of domestic demand and the disruption of export channels. This resulted in substantial income losses and created uncertainty regarding future planting campaigns. Additionally, the costs of fuel, crop protection products, and fertilizers increased significantly, while logistical challenges—caused by damaged infrastructure and the blockade of maritime routes—further complicated the transportation of agricultural goods to both domestic and international consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these hardships, many farmers actively supported Ukraine’s armed forces by supplying food and assisting with technical operations for defense needs. In several communities, agricultural enterprises played a crucial role in clearing roads, restoring electricity supply, and supporting essential local services. As a result, the agriculture sector became not only an economic but also a social pillar of rural territories during the early stages of the war. However, these additional burdens, along with direct war-related damages, significantly undermined their agricultural and production capacities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recent Initiatives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To support agricultural producers in Ukraine, the Ukrainian government has introduced several financial programs to facilitate access to credit and improve the financial sustainability of agribusinesses. One of the key initiatives is the Affordable Loans 5-7-9 program, which provides micro and small enterprises, including farmers, with simplified access to bank loans. In 2024, the conditions of this program were revised: The maximum loan amount for working capital replenishment was limited to $140,000, while the limit for processing industry enterprises and investment projects remained at over $4 million, supporting modernization and agribusiness expansion. Under this program, agricultural producers can receive loans of up to $1.4 million for a period of three to five years, depending on the financing objectives, at preferential interest rates ranging from 5 percent to 9 percent per annum. As of early 2025, a total of 33,306 loan agreements had been signed under this program, amounting to $3.5 billion, with $900,000 specifically allocated to support agricultural producers, allowing them to sustain operations and invest in modernization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another significant government initiative is the Partial Credit Guarantee Fund for Agriculture, which was established in 2022 to provide financial guarantees for farmers cultivating up to 500 ha of land. The fund collaborates with banks that provide credit to farmers and guarantees the coverage of 50 percent of loan obligations. Borrowers can obtain working capital loans for up to three years, investment loans for up to seven years, and land purchase loans for up to ten years, with a maximum loan amount of $810,000 per borrower. The fund also conducts consultative meetings with farmers on financing conditions and business planning. These measures are crucial for ensuring the financial stability of the agriculture sector, particularly for small- and medium-sized farms struggling to secure traditional bank loans. Through these financial support initiatives, the Ukrainian government aims to enhance the competitiveness of the agriculture sector, enabling small- and medium-sized enterprises to overcome economic challenges, invest in new technologies, and maintain stable production despite wartime constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Current and Future Priorities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensuring sustainable financing for agricultural producers and expanding access to preferential loans remains a strategic priority for the long-term development of Ukraine’s agriculture sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expand access to preferential financing.&lt;/strong&gt; A key direction for future policy initiatives should be broadening access to preferential financing for a wider range of farmers, particularly through improvements and adaptations of the Affordable Loans 5-7-9 program. Alternative financing methods that are successfully used in the United States and European Union, such as agricultural credit unions and contract farming (with processing enterprises and supermarkets), can also play an important role.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhance loan program conditions.&lt;/strong&gt; Improving the conditions of loan programs is an important factor in supporting agricultural producers during wartime and post-war recovery. In particular, the government should consider further enhancement of the Affordable Loans 5-7-9 program, including lower interest rates and revised repayment schedules, to contribute to strengthening the financial resilience of the agriculture sector and its capacity to invest in development.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthen advisory services and financial literacy.&lt;/strong&gt; Strengthening advisory services and expanding financial literacy initiatives like the Partial Credit Guarantee Fund for Agriculture will increase the ability of small- and medium-sized agricultural producers to access credit resources on favorable terms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promote agricultural insurance and international training.&lt;/strong&gt; Beyond credit programs, the development of agricultural insurance schemes and the integration of international training initiatives aimed at enhancing farmers’ financial literacy will play an important role in ensuring the long-term stability and competitiveness of Ukraine’s agriculture sector.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;short-term-measures-13-years&quot;&gt;Short-Term Measures (1–3 Years)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Short-term measures should focus on ensuring Ukraine’s stability and expanding economic opportunities in the agriculture sector. The two priority areas outlined below are (1) export support and market diversification and (2) development of human resources and education in the agriculture sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;export-support-and-market-diversification&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Export Support and Market Diversification&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The restoration and improvement of export infrastructure and trade regulations are two of the key prerequisites for the sustainable export of agricultural products. Building additional transshipment hubs and terminals near ports and land borders with the European Union will increase export capacity. Diversifying export markets by establishing new trade partnerships in Africa, Asia, and Latin America will reduce dependency on specific markets and improve export stability. Furthermore, improving product quality in line with international standards will increase the competitiveness of Ukrainian agricultural products in European markets.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s agriculture sector, particularly grain and oilseed production, is export oriented. Following Russia’s 2014 occupation of the Donbas and annexation of Crimea—both regions that were previously dominated by heavy industry—agriculture’s share of Ukraine’s total exports rose from below 25 percent to over 40 percent. In 2021, Ukrainian agricultural exports totaled $27.7 billion, with grain exports accounting for $12.3 billion. Although the actual dollar amount of agricultural exports has decreased since the full-scale invasion, due in large part to declining global prices for grains and oilseeds since 2020, the decline has been less severe than in other sectors. As a result, agriculture’s share of Ukraine’s total exports increased to nearly 60 percent in 2024 (see Figure 2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The structure of Ukraine’s agricultural exports is geographically diverse. Prior to the war, Ukraine supplied food to over 170 countries, feeding roughly 400 million people annually. Continued attacks on civilian port infrastructure threaten to disrupt the supply of food to countries in acute need and to drive up global food prices, as seen during the initial blockade of Black Sea ports in early 2022, when global food prices reached all-time nominal highs. Therefore, ensuring the development and diversification of agricultural exports, alongside the stable and efficient functioning of agricultural markets, is critical to global food security and Ukraine’s economic stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/XenPGFb.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: Agricultural Exports vs. Total Exports in Ukraine, 2001–2024&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s blockade of Black Sea ports at the beginning of the war significantly threatened food security in import-dependent countries, as Ukraine was unable to continue exporting agricultural products to its traditional markets. The resulting shortage of grain supply in global markets led to an immediate price spike. At the same time, Ukraine accumulated significant ending stocks of grain and oilseeds that caused a shortage of domestic storage capacity for the 2022 harvest. With Black Sea ports accounting for more than 90 percent of Ukraine’s agricultural exports prior to the 2022 invasion, Ukraine was forced to develop alternative export routes that have significantly changed its trade patterns throughout the war. However, Ukraine faces a number of issues that prevent it from realizing its export capacity without the Black Sea ports, including wider railway track gauges than in Europe, a shortage of railway grain cars, a shortage of lorries and drivers for export by roads, and the low transshipment capacity of Danube River ports and land border crossing points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recent Initiatives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union’s early measures in support of Ukraine included the Solidarity Lanes, which are export routes connecting Ukraine with European countries and Moldova via roads, rivers, and railways. By January 2024, the Solidarity Lanes had facilitated the export of roughly 68 million metric tons of agricultural products, representing 60 percent of Ukraine’s wartime agricultural exports. The Black Sea Grain Initiative, an agreement between Ukraine and Russia that was brokered by the United Nations and Turkey, temporarily restarted the operation of the greater Odesa ports on the Black Sea. During the initiative’s 12 months of implementation (July 2022–July 2023), Ukraine supplied 32.9 million metric tons of agricultural products to 45 countries across three continents, including 725,000 metric tons (8 percent of Ukraine’s total exported wheat) for the UN World Food Programme, which was distributed to people in need in Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. After Russia’s withdrawal from the initiative, Ukraine nonetheless continued exports from the greater Odesa ports. Ukrainian air defense capabilities have enabled the ports’ operations despite frequent Russian missile and drone attacks. Since its development 18 months ago, the Ukrainian maritime corridor has exported 100 million metric tons of cargos to 53 countries, including 65 million metric tons of agricultural products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Logistical challenges and the export diversification brought on by the war affected the geographical structure of Ukrainian agricultural exports as Ukraine was forced to search for alternative markets. While the Solidarity Lanes were intended to facilitate Ukrainian products’ export to markets around the world, a glut of Ukrainian agricultural products accumulated in European markets. In 2021, the share of Ukraine’s agricultural exports to Europe was 32.4 percent; following the redirection of export routes, it increased to 55.2 percent in 2022 and 60.7 percent in 2023. At the same time, Ukraine’s exports to other regions fell due to complicated and expensive logistics. The share of Ukrainian exports to African countries shrank from 13.5 percent in 2021 to 7.1 percent in 2023; in this same period, exports to Asia fell from 19.4 percent to 10.9 percent, and exports to Southeast Asia fell from 12.7 percent to 4.7 percent. To stabilize European markets amid their oversaturation with Ukrainian products, the European Union agreed to significant export restrictions for certain agricultural products, which rebalanced Ukraine’s trade to global markets. Diversifying export opportunities remains a strategic objective for Ukraine as it continues to balance traditional maritime exports with the alternative trade routes developed throughout the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expansion of agricultural exports, especially to highly developed countries, requires improving quality and implementing product certification, which will increase the competitiveness of Ukrainian products on foreign markets. In 2024, Ukrainian producers gained access to new foreign markets for sixteen groups of goods in nine countries around the world. Ukraine is also introducing Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) to harmonize legislation with the European Union in the field of food safety and quality; however, certification of agricultural and food products is optional. At the same time, many importing countries require quality certificates and compliance with their standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Current and Future Priorities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implementing an agricultural export strategy requires an integrated approach toward the agriculture sector and international trade. Numerous direct and indirect measures aim to improve the competitiveness of Ukrainian products, ensure uninterrupted supply and stable demand, and increase Ukraine’s export earnings from agriculture, creating a multiplier effect for the sector’s development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improve seaport infrastructure and navigation safety.&lt;/strong&gt; Restoration and further improvement of seaport infrastructure and guarantee of navigation safety are some of the key prerequisites for sustainable and diversified exports of agricultural products. Recently, the Ukrainian Sea Port Authority released a strategy for development that will require significant investment. It is seeking international assistance from the World Bank and the European Union to improve Ukraine’s seaport capacity for exports, which includes restoring critical port infrastructure, installing special equipment at port facilities and in the water areas, purchasing specialized port fleets and transshipment equipment, and dredging the Danube River ports’ water areas to allow deeper-sea vessels to enter. As part of this strategy, the Ukrainian Sea Port Authority also plans to purchase floating barriers through funding from the Howard Buffett Foundation, including underwater nets, to protect from penetration.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Construct additional transshipment hubs.&lt;/strong&gt; The planned addition of new transshipment hubs, specifically dry ports, within Ukraine and along its border with EU countries will ensure more convenient logistics for agricultural products and increase Ukraine’s export capacity. These new hubs will have the ability to receive grain from trucks, grain wagons, semi-wagons, and containers and transfer it to European standard wagons. A planned extension of European tracks (gauge 1435 millimeter) in Ukraine’s territory and Ukrainian tracks (gauge 1520 millimeter) in the European Union will further support this goal.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diversify export markets.&lt;/strong&gt; The establishment of new trade partnerships for Ukraine across Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and Latin America will reduce agricultural export dependency on the European Union and ensure export stability. This could be mutually beneficial for importers, as they will reduce their import dependence on dominant partners and receive high-quality and relatively low-cost agricultural products, given the affordability of Ukrainian products relative to global prices. Export diversification also involves expanding the range of agricultural exports and improving their quality to meet international standards and increase competitiveness in European markets. Continued work on opening new markets for a range of Ukrainian products—such as poultry products, live cattle and sheep, beef and pork, milk and dairy products, honey, apples, blueberries and cherries, peas and beans, onions, wheat flour, and fish and fish products—would accelerate support of agricultural producers in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improve competitiveness of Ukrainian agricultural products in foreign markets.&lt;/strong&gt; Policymakers should consider export subsidies, value-added tax compensations for exported goods, tax exemptions, and other fiscal measures to help export-oriented agricultural producers reduce their costs and increase marginal profit. Certification and compliance with phytosanitary standards will contribute to quality improvement and facilitate the promotion of products to the markets of higher-income countries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;development-of-human-resources-and-education-in-the-agriculture-sector&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Development of Human Resources and Education in the Agriculture Sector&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ukraine’s agriculture sector is experiencing a labor deficit due to forced population displacement, the conscription of men into Ukraine’s armed forces, and causalities that have resulted from Russia’s war. This deficit is especially acute for high-skilled and experienced agricultural workers. At the same time, the workloads of women and youth on farms have increased as they take on the responsibilities of their husbands and fathers. A reduction in the labor force required to perform the ongoing operations results in additional losses. Exemptions from army mobilization for small- and medium-sized farms can improve agricultural labor provision and help stabilize rural economies. Comprehensive policy measures, including incentives to attract workers back to rural areas from urban areas and abroad, as well as investments in mechanization and innovative technologies to partially offset the lack of manpower, should be considered. Transformation of Ukraine’s agricultural education and extension system to be more resilient, adaptive, and supportive of the nation’s recovery by providing up-to-date knowledge and trainings for young farmers, women, and veterans will contribute to the long-term development of the agriculture sector and ensure sustainable growth.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early 2022, Ukraine’s rural labor force consisted of 5.5 million people, or 31.4 percent of the total labor force of the country. Total employment in rural areas was 4.8 million people—or 87.3 percent of its labor force. Almost 2.7 million people were involved in agriculture, forestry, and fishing (this includes individuals employed in agricultural enterprises, family members of private farms, and commercially oriented households, or those engaged in agricultural production for profit). As a result of Russia’s hostilities, some agricultural workers and farmers were forced not only to cease economic activity in the agriculture sector, but also to leave their homes. More than 150,000 agricultural workers were directly affected by the war and/or were forced to migrate. Small- and medium-sized producers specializing in seasonal products—critical providers of employment and income in rural areas—have been particularly affected. Labor shortages induced by the war, especially for highly skilled and experienced workers, has not only negatively impacted farm operations but increased workloads for segments of the population not previously integrated in Ukraine’s agricultural labor force, namely women and youth. The war has caused irreversible losses not only among the military, but also among the civilian population: At least 126,000 civilians were killed and 294,000 injured during the first three years of the war, and 5.2 million Ukrainian refugees from both urban and rural areas remain abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numerous surveys conducted with agricultural producers across Ukraine reflect the severe shortage of diverse labor needs. In a survey of the Association of Pig Farmers of Ukraine, 26 percent of members reported suffering from insufficient personnel (e.g., technologists, veterinarians, operators, and managers of production sites) and auxiliary workers (e.g., fitters and electricians). Approximately 48 percent of the members reported a shortage of personnel in areas of activity related to agricultural production, such as drivers, tractor operators, mechanics, and agronomists. Similarly, in a producer survey carried out by Mercy Corps and Pro-Consulting, approximately 88 percent of fruit and vegetable producers, 71 percent of poultry producers, and 75 percent of dairy producers in partially occupied, deoccupied, or frequently shelled areas reported that labor shortages limited their production. This reduction of the agricultural labor force—which requires operations to adapt, restore, and modernize production assets—has led to compounding losses, limiting of activity, and even the discontinuation of agricultural activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recent Initiatives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early 2023, Ukraine introduced a procedure for exempting military conscripts for enterprises, institutions, and organizations that are critically important for ensuring a functioning economy and preserving people’s livelihoods. This exempted some agricultural workers at farms with more than 1,000 ha that employ 50 or more people from military conscription. In April 2023, this law was amended to include farms with 500 to 1,000 ha and as few as 20 employees. Although the procedure was amended again later in 2024 to allow extension of the exemption for up to 12 months, it does not apply to basic laborers and fails to address the problems faced by small- and medium-sized operations. Farms that cultivate up to 500 ha make up the largest group of agricultural producers, supplying a significant amount of food to the market, and they are mainly family farms, meaning that their income entirely depends on the farm’s operation. In a March 2025 meeting with the Ukrainian parliament, the Committee on Agrarian and Land Policy once again raised the issue of military conscription exemptions for small agricultural producers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another government initiative aimed at increasing the workforce was the establishment of the Ministry of National Unity of Ukraine (MNUU) in December 2024, which resulted from the reorganization of the Ministry of Reintegration. The MNUU is intended to stimulate the return of Ukrainian refugees from abroad. Its creation sparked significant criticism, as many of its functions duplicate functions already performed by other state bodies. Recently, the MNUU and the UN Refugee Agency launched a strategic partnership to support internally and externally displaced Ukrainians. However, the share of those planning to return to their homeland is nonetheless declining, dropping from 74 percent at the end of 2022 to 43 percent at the end of 2024. This trend will continue in proportion to the duration of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agricultural education and extension are important elements of strengthening the agriculture sector broadly, especially as Ukraine works to fill the skilled labor shortage. During its years of independence, Ukraine significantly improved its education system. However, the destruction of educational facilities and the mobilization and displacement of faculty and students caused by the war negatively impacted agricultural universities’ ability to train a sufficient number of qualified employees and provide in-demand advisory services that meet today’s challenges. Some agricultural colleges, such as the Tavria State Agrotechnological University, Luhansk National Agrarian University, Kherson State Agrarian and Economic University, and Bakhmut Vocational Agrarian Lyceum, were relocated from occupied areas to territory controlled by the Ukrainian government. Many educational institutions switched to distance and hybrid (online/offline) learning, which is complicated by a lack of stable internet connection, insufficient access to electricity, and insufficient access to bomb shelters, as well as limited opportunities to conduct practical and lab classes, experiments, and trials, which are crucial for agricultural education. One initiative aimed at addressing this issue is the FABU project, implemented by the German Ministry of Food and Agriculture, which focuses on improving agricultural vocational training in Ukraine during the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Current and Future Priorities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Labor scarcity in the economy is usually compensated for with the introduction of capital-intensive technologies. Ukrainian agricultural producers have faced significant capital losses during the war, especially in machinery and equipment, and their replacement and modernization based on the “build back better” principle will require significant capital investment. But human resources will still be essential to operating these technologies and performing other operational functions to ensure sustainable agricultural production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preserve human resources in agriculture.&lt;/strong&gt; To ensure sufficient agricultural production, farmers must be able to carry out agricultural work in accordance with the agricultural calendar regardless of the size of their farm. As proposed earlier by the Committee on Agrarian and Land Policy, it is recommended to extend military conscription exemptions for small agricultural producers: reserving the head of farms cultivating 20–100 ha, as well as the heads and 50 percent of military-eligible employees of farms cultivating grains on 100–500 ha of land and farms growing fruits and vegetables, but no more than one person per 100 ha. At a minimum, farmers who are fighting should be able to return to their farms in time to perform critical field work. This would save the workforce for the agriculture sector, stabilize agricultural production, and solve some socioeconomic issues in rural areas.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incentivize employment and labor productivity growth in agriculture.&lt;/strong&gt; Higher-paying jobs in urban areas or make it increasingly difficult to attract personnel to work in rural areas, especially during wartime. Addressing the labor shortage will require comprehensive policy measures, including incentives to attract workers back to rural areas and investments in mechanization and innovative technologies to partially offset the lack of manpower. Workers will also require additional training to operate modern technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improve educational programs and institutions.&lt;/strong&gt; The agricultural workforce shortage is exacerbated by the weak capabilities of the agricultural education system both quantitative (e.g., lack of faculty, staff, and low enrollment) and qualitative (e.g., outdated equipment and curricula and damaged facilities). Event after obtaining certifications, personnel are not ready to perform production tasks without significant additional practical training. To ensure sustainable agricultural production during and after the war, transforming Ukraine’s agricultural education system to be more resilient and adaptive will be crucial. Systematic study of trends in the development of the agriculture sector, as well as deeper collaboration between MAPFU and Ministry of Education, will contribute to this aim. Attracting additional funding and adopting expertise brought by international investors remains a potential direction through which investors can participate in the sector’s future development.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stimulate the influx of labor to agriculture from urban areas and from abroad.&lt;/strong&gt; After the war, Ukraine will be able to count on the return of part of the forcibly displaced population, in particular agricultural workers, which will create additional opportunities for the restoration of production. The main barriers to return remain security issues, as well as access to work in a relevant specialty, a decent salary, and housing. Therefore, the diversification of agricultural production and the corresponding creation of new jobs, along with the expansion of non-farm activities in rural areas, will stimulate the influx of labor from urban areas and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improve the inclusiveness of agricultural education and extension.&lt;/strong&gt; Returning veterans will also be seeking employment. In one survey, 30 percent of interviewed farmers said they were open to hiring veterans and people with disabilities, but agricultural equipment typically lacks the necessary accessibility modifications, pointing to a key gap that needs to be addressed. An important task will be improving the skills of agricultural laborers and training new specialists who can work with modern technologies and ensure effective management of agricultural enterprises. Investments in education and training, as well as the development of agricultural extension services and support programs for young farmers, women, and veterans, can contribute to the long-term development of the agriculture sector and ensure its sustainable growth.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;medium-term-measures-35-years&quot;&gt;Medium-Term Measures (3–5 Years)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medium-term measures should prioritize developing a sustainable and competitive agriculture sector. The two priority areas outlined below are (1) strengthening rural communities and supporting small farmers and (2) developing the livestock industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;strengthening-rural-communities-and-supporting-small-farmers&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Strengthening Rural Communities and Supporting Small Farmers&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Rural communities and small farmers will be essential for Ukraine’s postwar recovery and economic resilience. Although decentralization has empowered local governments, war-related destruction, financial difficulties, and logistical challenges continue to hinder rural life and agricultural production. Small farmers (typically those operating on less than 500 ha), who previously accounted for over 40 percent of Ukraine’s agricultural output, require targeted financial aid, infrastructure rehabilitation, and improved market access. Government programs and international initiatives are already facilitating some recovery through infrastructure investment, grant support, and credit expansion. Additional investments in rural infrastructure, digitalization, and cooperative farming models—both domestically and globally—will be essential for ensuring sustainable development, higher productivity, and long-term food security.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decentralization reform initiated in Ukraine in 2014 significantly strengthened the capacity of Ukrainian communities by transferring administrative and financial powers to local governments, enabling them to manage local resources effectively and with greater independence. This reform aimed to improve public service delivery, increase transparency, and bring decisionmaking closer to citizens by empowering newly formed amalgamated territorial communities, known as hromada. Local governments received greater control over land use, education, healthcare, and budgetary planning, allowing them to respond more directly to the needs of their populations. A key aspect of this reform was the transfer of agricultural land management rights from the state to local communities, granting them greater control over one of their most valuable resources. Supported by international partners and enshrined in national legislation, this reform has become a cornerstone of Ukraine’s democratic governance and postwar recovery planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the war has placed additional pressure on local governance, forcing communities to address security issues, accommodate internally displaced persons, and restore damaged infrastructure. Rural areas have suffered significant losses due to the conflict, with the burden of maintaining agricultural production falling primarily on small farmers and household farms, which play a key role in ensuring local food security. Ukraine’s agriculture sector as a whole has suffered significantly in the face of war-induced challenges. Small farmers and family farms, accounting for over 40 percent of Ukraine’s pre-war agricultural production, have suffered the most due to financial resource shortages, reduced cultivated areas, and the destruction of logistical routes. Other challenges include decreased sowing areas and changes in production technologies, with indirect losses projected to reach $83 billion by the end of 2025. The continued threat of landmines and unexploded ordnance on farmland also poses a major obstacle to recovery, with contaminated territories estimated to reduce Ukraine’s GDP by $11 billion annually, hindering the revival of rural regions and delaying the return of farmers to full-scale agricultural activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Damaged social infrastructure (e.g., housing, roads, bridges, schools, hospitals, stores, and utility lines) and production infrastructure (e.g., land, facilities, and equipment) makes life in rural areas extremely difficult. The recovery of rural communities and small farmers requires a comprehensive approach, including financial aid, state subsidies, international assistance, and the development of social and agricultural infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recent Initiatives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decentralization continues to provide local governments in Ukraine with greater financial resources and administrative autonomy, allowing them to invest in community development, social services, and postwar recovery initiatives. To support war-affected communities, the Ukrainian government has implemented several financial assistance programs, including the Fund for Eliminating the Consequences of Armed Aggression, which allocates funds for restoring critical infrastructure and residential buildings. The government is expanding support mechanisms for local communities, particularly through grant financing for small agricultural businesses and the development of socially oriented enterprises. A major contributor to local communities until 2025 was the USAID Governance and Local Accountability project, which played a key role in strengthening local government capacity by providing technical assistance to communities for improving administrative services, economic planning, and investment attraction. The FAO, in cooperation with the European Union, has launched a new grant support program for agricultural producers, offering grants of up to $25,000 to support berry farming and vegetable production. This program covers up to 50 percent of investment costs and facilitates the integration of small farmers into supply chains, as well as improving logistics, storage, and processing facilities. The European Union and the World Bank have also provided crucial support, allocating over $500 million for the reconstruction of destroyed infrastructure, including schools, hospitals, and roads. In addition to financing infrastructure projects, international partners are also assisting in the development of effective credit and insurance mechanisms for small farms, ensuring their resilience in challenging economic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Current and Future Priorities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure the sustainable development of rural areas and support small farmers, a comprehensive set of strategic measures must be implemented at the local, national, and international levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secure access to finance and modern technologies.&lt;/strong&gt; A key government priority should be expanding access to financial resources, allowing farmers to develop their farms more effectively and implement modern technologies. This includes tailored credit programs, loan guarantees, and subsidies that reduce financial barriers and incentivize investments in precision agriculture, energy-efficient equipment, and climate-smart practices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop rural infrastructure and connectivity.&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to financial support, another crucial policy direction is the development of rural infrastructure, including modernizing transportation networks, water supply systems, energy infrastructure, and digital communications. Infrastructure improvement will enhance agricultural productivity and raise living standards in rural areas. Special attention should be given to ensuring access to high-speed internet and digital services, which will integrate farmers into modern markets and improve digital literacy among rural populations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthen cooperatives and rural entrepreneurship.&lt;/strong&gt; MAPFU should expand support programs for the development of agricultural cooperatives and agro-based clusters, enabling small farmers to share equipment, reduce input costs, and improve access to markets. The development of small farm businesses will contribute to increasing employment and, therefore, the well-being of the rural population, an important factor in preventing rural depopulation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop skills and sustainable technologies.&lt;/strong&gt; Initiatives for professional education and skills development should be expanded, including training programs in financial management, digital technologies, and sustainable farming, which will ensure better adaptation of advanced technologies and increased productivity. The use of innovative agricultural technologies and soil fertility conservation methods will further enhance farm efficiency while minimizing negative environmental impacts on rural areas.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;development-of-the-livestock-industry&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Development of the Livestock Industry&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Even though Ukraine’s livestock industry experienced difficulties before the war, positive trends in its productivity make it a promising direction for agriculture sector recovery. Government measures such as cofinancing farmers’ purchases of animals for breeding, construction and/ or reconstruction of livestock farms, subsides for increasing the number of animals, and reimbursement of incurred expenses due to animal injury and death can contribute to the sector’s recovery. However, livestock development requires larger investments than the Ukrainian government is able to provide and demands international support.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Limited access to veterinary services and medicine increases the risk of disease spread and subsequent loss of livestock population. Therefore, efforts to increase the supply of veterinary drugs, including through domestic production, and expand veterinary services and trainings will be necessary to stabilize the epizootic situation in the country. The creation of progressive forms of entrepreneurship in the livestock industry, particularly for individual farmers, will facilitate these enterprises’ integration into the agricultural market. Stabilizing and further increasing the animal population, improving animal keeping conditions, introducing advanced technologies, using better breeds, developing fodder production and processing as related industries, and stimulating livestock product export are critical prerequisites for the development of Ukraine’s livestock industry.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Ukraine is primarily known for its significant production and export of grains and oilseeds, livestock products also account for a large share of Ukrainian agricultural exports. In 2023, Ukraine ranked as the sixth-largest exporter of live bovine animals, seventh-largest exporter of poultry meats, and eight-largest exporter of dairy products. However, Ukraine’s livestock sector is still relatively small compared to those of major global producers like the European Union, Brazil, the United States, and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even before the war, Ukraine’s livestock sector experienced difficulties. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the destruction of agricultural infrastructure and inter-sectoral connections led to a loss of profitability in the livestock industry and forced farmers to slaughter a significant number of animals. Between 1990 and 2022, Ukraine’s cattle population decreased by 10 times (including dairy cows by 5.7 times), pigs by 3.6 times, and sheep and goats by 8.1 times (See Figure 3). Only the poultry industry, which benefits from a shorter production cycle and lower costs, demonstrated some recovery after declining by half from 1990 to 1998 and then increasing by 79 percent by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion has accelerated losses in Ukraine’s livestock industry. According to the Kyiv School of Economics, farms have lost 238,000 head of cattle, 544,000 head of pigs, 131,000 head of sheep and goats, and almost 13 million head of poultry as a result of the war, a loss worth $254 million. Reduction in the animal population has accelerated a decrease in livestock production. For example, Ukraine’s total meat production decreased by 44 percent between 1990 and 2021; by 2024, this figure had dropped an additional 3.5 percent. At the same time, thanks to more advanced production technologies, better breeds, and improved farm management practices, the productivity of animals per head has increased: For example, milk yields per cow increased from an average of 2,900 metric tons in 1990 to 5,700 metric tons in 2024 (See Figure 3). Moreover, the significant reduction in beef and pork production was partially offset by poultry meat, production of which increased from 708,400 metric tons in 1990 to 1.4 million metric tons in 2024. Considering the positive trends in livestock productivity, the sector’s development is a promising direction for Ukraine’s agriculture sector recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OrpsbT8.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 3: Livestock Population and Annual Production in Ukraine, 1990–2025&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recent Initiatives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even before Russia’s full-scale invasion, the government of Ukraine had prioritized the development and profitability of animal husbandry in order to strengthen self-sufficiency in meat and dairy products. To support livestock producers and increase the number of animals, the government initiated a program providing partial reimbursement (80 percent) of the cost of breeding animals purchased for further reproduction, partial reimbursement (50 percent for agricultural enterprises and 70 percent for cooperatives) of the cost of construction and/or reconstruction of livestock farms and complexes, and a special budget subsidy for farmers to reproduce livestock on-site to disincentivize importing live cattle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the full-scale invasion, and the resulting significant loss of livestock population as a main asset for agricultural production and source of income for many farmers, the Ministry of Agrarian Policy developed a methodology for reimbursing incurred expenses, including replacement of injured, dead, or lost animals, Later, additional subsidies of $170 per head were provided to livestock farmers with 3–100 cattle, along with $50-per-head subsidies for farmers with 5–500 goats or sheep of breeding stock. Though the subsidies were modest, they contributed to efforts aimed at reducing livestock production costs and encouraging the sector’s development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the start of the invasion, farmers, especially in rural areas near the front line, have struggled to access veterinary services and medicine, which significantly increases the risk of disease spread and subsequent loss of livestock population. According to a survey conducted by Mercy Corps, 23.9 percent of respondents reported a deterioration in the availability of veterinary drugs; many emphasized their high cost. To address this issue, the Swiss Federal Office for Food Safety and Veterinary Affairs and the consulting company SAFOSO AG, along with partner organizations, organized humanitarian aid in the form of veterinary drugs and feed additives to support Ukrainian livestock farming and protect animal health. Additionally, in order to ensure food security in Ukraine and improve access to high-quality and safe dairy products, Switzerland has been providing humanitarian assistance to milk producers in the most affected regions with a project launched in cooperation with MAPFU, the Association of Milk Producers, and other partners. Milk producers can obtain products for washing and disinfecting milking equipment, pre- and post-milking udder treatment, wipes for udder hygiene, gloves, reagents for detecting hidden forms of mastitis, and disinfectants for livestock premises. And as part of the activities of the international charitable fund SaveUA, teams from the Association of Milk Producers, the Ukrainian Agrarian Council, and the Association of Pig Farmers of Ukraine have been collecting and delivering humanitarian veterinary aid to livestock farms and offering remote consultations on animal reproduction, health, diet, and feed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, Ukraine’s Ministry of Economy launched a program for farmers to relocate their businesses from dangerous zones. Although there have been some successful examples of livestock farms relocating from the front line to other regions, such possibilities are limited due to regular Russian missile strikes on frontline settlements. In addition, farmers would be able to transfer only part of their livestock, since most farms in Ukraine were built during the Soviet era and do not meet modern requirements for keeping animals, and there is a shortage of open agricultural plots. Indeed, the country’s lack of suitable premises for keeping cows creates the conditions for a further reduction in the livestock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Current and Future Priorities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure national food security and satisfy domestic demand for meat and dairy products, MAPFU recently introduced a concept known as the State Targeted Economic Program for the Development of Livestock Breeding. The concept, still in development, provides a framework for inclusive government policy aimed at restoring livestock production after the war and until 2033. Currently, large agricultural enterprises experience higher cattle and cow productivity than households and small farms, while this trend is reversed for pork productivity. Livestock production has also become more concentrated in large enterprises compared to small- and medium-sized farms. To address these disparities, the program should provide for organizational and economic measures to create progressive forms of entrepreneurship in the livestock industry, particularly for individual farmers, which will facilitate their integration into the agricultural market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modernize the livestock industry.&lt;/strong&gt; Along with the stabilization and increase of the animal population (especially cattle/cows and pigs), improvement of animal keeping conditions and the introduction of advanced technologies are key to the industry’s development. Concurrently, farmers need to take actions to improve animal diet, use feed additives, enhance manure management, and safeguard animal health in order to reduce the negative impact of greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improve livestock breeding and genetics.&lt;/strong&gt; Implementing measures to preserve local breeds of farm animals, provide the livestock industry with genetic resources of Ukrainian origin, and improve the genetics of highly productive transborder breeds through selection will contribute to the formation of more adaptive and resilient livestock for domestic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensure sanitary conditions and stable veterinary care.&lt;/strong&gt; Protecting livestock facilities from biological, infectious, and invasive threats as well as preventing negative environmental consequences from livestock production will not only stabilize Ukraine’s animal population but also increase food safety and facilitate compliance with EU standards. Increasing domestic production of veterinary medicine and expanding veterinary service will be critical to stabilizing the epizootic situation in the country, particularly the ongoing African swine fever outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthen the crop production–livestock–food processing value chain.&lt;/strong&gt; Livestock creates demand for crop products as feed and supply of raw materials for the food processing industry. Development of fodder production will provide animals with adequate nutrition in sufficient quantity in response to the reduction of pastures due to contamination by mines and shells, which will in turn contribute to the increase of animal productivity. Development of the processing industry will stimulate increase of livestock production through stable demand and prices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase self-sufficiency in animal products.&lt;/strong&gt; Even before the war, Ukraine’s self-sufficiency (i.e., domestic production to consumption ratio) in meat, excluding poultry, was no more than 88 percent. Compared to the rational consumption norm (i.e., domestic production to dietary recommendation for consumption ratio), self-sufficiency was even lower: 77 percent for pork, 40 percent for beef, and 55 percent for milk. Expansion of livestock production will not only decrease import dependency for livestock products but also open new opportunities for export, especially after the Ukrainian government abolished the licensing of certain agricultural products for export (e.g., live cattle, frozen cattle meat, poultry meat, meat and edible meat offal, edible meat meal or meat offal, cattle meat, and poultry eggs). Stimulating livestock product exports through the use of fiscal, tariff, and nontariff methods will encourage an increase in Ukraine’s domestic livestock production by harmonizing the interests of raw material producers, processors, intermediaries, and importers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;long-term-measures-5-years&quot;&gt;Long-Term Measures (5+ Years)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long-term measures should focus on supporting Ukraine’s integration into the global agricultural economy and attracting international partners. The three priority areas outlined below are (1) integration of the agriculture sector with Europe, (2) adaptation of agricultural production to climate change and environmental sustainability, and (3) development of the food processing industry and high value-added production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;integration-of-the-agriculture-sector-with-the-european-union&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Integration of the Agriculture Sector with the European Union&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Integrating Ukraine’s agriculture sector into the European market is a strategic priority that requires harmonizing legislation, modernizing infrastructure, and expanding export opportunities. Due to the challenges of war, Ukraine was forced to redirect a significant share of its agricultural exports to the European Union, which accelerated the sector’s partial adaptation to European standards. In response to new market conditions, producers focused on goods that meet the European Union’s phytosanitary and quality requirements. Trade expansion was further supported by temporary liberalization measures under the Solidarity Lanes initiative and the European Union’s autonomous trade preferences. Government initiatives, in partnership with EU-backed programs, have focused on improving sanitary and phytosanitary control, strengthening certification procedures, and enhancing logistical infrastructure. Further efforts should simplify customs procedures, improve quality control, and enhance cooperation with European certification bodies. Expanding financial and technical support from international partners will accelerate agricultural modernization, boost export potential, and enhance Europe’s food security.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine is actively working on integrating its agriculture sector with the European Union, focusing on harmonizing legislation, implementing EU standards, and expanding access for Ukrainian agricultural products to the European market. The country holds official EU candidate status, granted in June 2022, and formal accession negotiations commenced with an intergovernmental conference in June 2024. Ukraine has since initiated bilateral screening meetings, assessing its alignment with EU legislation across various sectors. The country aims to open multiple negotiation clusters throughout 2025, demonstrating its commitment to advancing toward EU membership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the European Commission, in 2024, the share of Ukrainian agricultural exports to EU countries increased, demonstrating producers’ gradual adaptation to European requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite significant challenges caused by the war, the need for rapid adaptation has accelerated the implementation of European agricultural practices. In its annual enlargement report published on October 30, 2024, the European Commission assessed Ukraine’s readiness in the sphere of agriculture and rural development as being in the early stages of preparation. At the same time, in the sphere of food safety, veterinary, and phytosanitary policies, Ukraine was recognized as moderately prepared, highlighting the need to accelerate legislative adaptation, modernize quality control infrastructure, and improve certification mechanisms in line with EU requirements. Ukraine is actively working on harmonizing its regulatory framework in the agriculture sector with EU legislation, particularly in the areas of subsidies, land relations, and environmental production standards. At the same time, there is a pressing need to strengthen the institutional capacity of state bodies responsible for implementing agricultural and food safety policies. Despite positive export dynamics, a significant share of Ukrainian producers still face challenges related to certification, access to EU markets, and compliance with traceability requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recent Initiatives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2024, agricultural products accounted for 59 percent of Ukraine’s total exports, reaching $24.5 billion, marking the second-highest level after the record in 2021. Agricultural exports to the European Union amounted to $12.8 billion, or 51.7 percent of Ukraine’s total EU exports. This reflects Ukraine’s gradual integration into the European market and the adaptation of agricultural producers to EU standards. A significant step forward was the adoption of several laws prepared by the Verkhovna Rada Committee on Agrarian and Land Policy, which aim to improve the regulatory framework and align it with EU requirements. In addition, Ukraine and the European Union are jointly implementing projects to reform sanitary and phytosanitary control, establish effective quality control mechanisms, and introduce European certification procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several recent European initiatives have aimed at increasing coordination with Ukrainian farmers. The EU4Business program supports Ukrainian farmers and small- and medium-sized agricultural enterprises through consultative assistance, grant programs, and loans. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) supports projects that improve logistical infrastructure for agricultural exports and expands certification opportunities for Ukrainian producers to meet EU standards. This support is particularly crucial in the context of postwar recovery, as it contributes not only to stabilizing agricultural production but also to building a more resilient and competitive logistics system. Investments by the EBRD in infrastructure modernization help reduce dependence on traditional export routes, which have become vulnerable due to the war, and promote the development of alternative supply corridors, especially through Ukraine’s western borders. At the same time, certification support opens new market opportunities within the European Union, encourages the adoption of European quality standards, and enhances the position of Ukrainian products in global supply chains. Combined with grants and concessional loans provided through the EU4Business program, these efforts create favorable conditions for the effective integration of Ukraine’s agriculture sector into the European economic area and for strengthening its export potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Commission has introduced additional trade liberalization measures, extending duty-free and quota-free access for Ukrainian agricultural products to the EU market through 2025, fostering integration and increasing Ukraine’s export potential. Strengthening cooperation between Ukraine and the European Union remains a priority, ensuring the modernization of agricultural production, improvement of quality standards, and expanded opportunities for Ukrainian farmers in the European market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Current and Future Priorities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine must accelerate the adaptation of national legislation to EU standards, particularly in food safety, veterinary care, and phytosanitary control, which requires comprehensive infrastructure modernization and the implementation of effective certification mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthen quality control and regulatory alignment.&lt;/strong&gt; To support further integration with Europe, Ukraine will need to focus on improving the state quality control system for agricultural products, enhancing coordination between government agencies and the private sector, ensuring compliance with EU norms, and expanding market access for Ukrainian producers. In 2025, Ukraine is set to undergo an active phase of legislative screening to assess the alignment of its legal framework in the agricultural sector—including land use, farming, and food safety—with EU regulations. A crucial area of focus for policymakers should be the development of laboratory infrastructure to enable high-quality product inspections according to international standards. This will require support from international financial institutions and expert assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facilitate export logistics and border infrastructure.&lt;/strong&gt; To facilitate the uninterrupted export of Ukrainian agricultural products, Ukrainian and European leaders should simplify customs procedures, expand logistical routes, and establish new export hubs in border regions with the European Union. Poland has announced plans to establish a dry port on the border for agricultural products, which will increase Ukrainian export volumes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advance certification and market access:&lt;/strong&gt; Ukrainian authorities should advance cooperation with European certification bodies to streamline the inspection and approval processes for Ukrainian agricultural products, ensuring alignment with EU standards and facilitating smoother access to European markets. This will help producers meet EU standards more efficiently, enabling quicker access to high-value markets and strengthening Ukraine’s position in the European supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mobilize international support and joint investment.&lt;/strong&gt; International partners can enhance their support by financing technical assistance programs, providing grants for adapting production to European environmental standards, and promoting joint investment platforms for Ukrainian agribusinesses. Deepening economic integration with the European Union and implementing joint strategic agricultural initiatives will not only drive the development of Ukraine’s agriculture sector but also strengthen Europe’s food security.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;adaption-of-agricultural-production-to-climate-change-and-environmental-sustainability&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Adaption of Agricultural Production to Climate Change and Environmental Sustainability&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The adaptation of Ukraine’s agriculture sector to climate change is crucial for sustainable growth, food security, and economic stability in the long term. Rising temperatures, soil degradation, and extreme weather events pose serious risks, necessitating modern climate adaptation strategies. Ukrainian farmers are increasingly adopting precision farming, biogas energy solutions, and advanced irrigation systems to improve efficiency and mitigate risks. Ukraine’s Environmental Security and Climate Adaptation Strategy Until 2030 provides a national framework for integrating eco-friendly technologies and sustainable farming practices. Expanding international cooperation, financial assistance, and farmer education programs will accelerate the adoption of climate-resilient agricultural methods, reduce environmental risks, and enhance Ukraine’s agricultural competitiveness in global markets.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian farmers are increasingly facing the negative consequences of climate change, including droughts, declining soil fertility, erosion, rising average annual temperatures, and the spread of new pest species. Over the past 30 years, the average annual temperature in Ukraine has increased by 1.2°C. These changes pose a serious threat to the sustainable development of agriculture; as the frequency of extreme weather events increases, natural ecosystems, human health, and economic stability are negatively impacted. This problem is not unique to Ukraine—one assessment estimates that without adaptation measures, global agricultural production could decrease by 30 percent by 2050—but Ukraine is particularly vulnerable due to its reliance on crop production, export-oriented agriculture, and the significant environmental damage caused by the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adaptation can also provide new opportunities. In the face of growing challenges, Ukrainian farmers are exploring new crops and practices to ensure resilience and productivity. For example, climate change has significantly contributed to the expansion of grain cultivation, particularly corn, which has become one of the most promising agricultural crops in Ukraine. Rising temperatures, an extended growing season, and the northward shift of sufficient moisture zones have created favorable conditions for increasing corn acreage. Additionally, increasing precipitation variability and frequent droughts have encouraged farmers to adopt drought-resistant hybrids and innovative cultivation methods, leading to a substantial rise in corn yields. These changes have not only boosted grain production but have also transformed the structure of Ukraine’s agriculture sector, making it more adaptable to emerging climate challenges. Developing climate adaptation strategies, enhancing resilience, and reducing risks are crucial elements of Ukraine’s commitments under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recent Initiatives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian farmers are actively implementing modern methods to enhance the resilience of agriculture to climate change. The use of precision farming technologies such as soil analysis, field mapping, and crop monitoring has been shown to increase yields by up to 15 percent and reduce agrochemical use by 20–25 percent. Additionally, the introduction of biogas plants for processing organic waste helps reduce energy costs by an average of 30 percent, ensuring farms’ energy independence. The Ukrainian government has approved the Environmental Security and Climate Adaptation Strategy Until 2030, which focuses on modernization of irrigation systems and incentives for implementing eco-friendly technologies. International partners, including the World Bank, are actively supporting these efforts by financing projects aimed at increasing the resilience of agriculture to climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The initiatives mentioned above are not only a response to climate challenges but also an important prerequisite for the long-term enhancement of the efficiency of Ukraine’s agriculture sector. The implementation of precision farming technologies, energy-saving solutions, and environmentally friendly production practices enables agricultural enterprises not only to optimize resource use and reduce costs but also to adapt to environmental changes, decreasing the vulnerability of agriculture to droughts, floods, and temperature anomalies. These approaches contribute to the formation of a new model of agricultural production—one that is more flexible, adaptive, and focused on sustainable development. Combined with government support and international financing, these measures lay the groundwork for increasing the global competitiveness of Ukrainian farmers and strengthening national food security amid wartime conditions, postwar recovery, and global climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Current and Future Priorities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effective adaptation of the agriculture sector to climate change will require a comprehensive national strategy including climate risk assessment, modern agricultural technologies such as precision farming and drought-resistant crop varieties, and farmer training on climate adaptation measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reconstruct irrigation systems and improve water use efficiency.&lt;/strong&gt; Sustainable irrigation and efficient water use are key priorities for farmers, especially in the context of climate resilience and postwar recovery. A major focus is the modernization of infrastructure through the reconstruction of irrigation systems—particularly the introduction of water-saving technologies like drip irrigation—which can significantly reduce water consumption in arid areas and lower crop losses by 20–30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provide policy and financial support for climate adaptation.&lt;/strong&gt; To promote the adoption of climate-resilient practices, government support in the form of subsidies and preferential loans will be necessary. International assistance can also play a vital role in strengthening agricultural resilience to climate change. Cooperation with international partners will facilitate the attraction of investments, expert support, and advanced technologies, enabling the implementation of climate adaptation projects.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improve farmer education and advisory services.&lt;/strong&gt; Educational initiatives and advisory programs will help farmers integrate innovative farming methods that address modern environmental challenges. The implementation of these measures will contribute to enhancing the climate resilience of Ukraine’s agriculture sector and ensure its sustainable development in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The food processing industry plays an important role in the economy of Ukraine. It is responsible for processing agricultural products to produce finished food products and semifinished products with higher added value for consumption in domestic and foreign markets. Despite suffering damage during the war, the industry has demonstrated relative resilience—in 2024, the productivity of the food processing industry increased by 15.9 percent. The development of the food processing industry will require a transformation from Ukraine’s current agricultural model to a new, large-scale, intensive model, which will ensure sufficient supply of quality raw materials through the introduction of modern practices and technologies, including advanced biotechnologies. However, such intensification must comply with environmental protection requirements and European standards. Diversification and growth of food production and exports will increase budget revenue, GDP, and food self-sufficiency, as well as reposition Ukraine in the global food system.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The food processing industry constitutes over 8 percent of Ukrainian GDP and comprises more than 40 subsectors; the dominant sectors (in terms of volume) are vegetable oil and animal fats, sugar, beverages, and animal feed production. In 2021, the food processing industry accounted for 30.9 percent of Ukraine’s overall processing industry revenue. Vegetable oil and animal fats made up the largest share of revenue (8.9 percent), followed by meat products (4.6 percent), beverages (3.1 percent), dairy products (2.9 percent), and bakery products (2.1 percent). From 2015 to 2021, an average of 283,600 people were employed by the food processing industry. Food products ready for consumption are Ukraine’s third-largest export after metals and grains, and most of them are sold to EU countries, providing Ukraine with $11 billion in export revenue. Despite the war, Ukraine has maintained its position as the leading producer and exporter of sunflower oil and meal. In 2021, exports of these products reached 5.1 and 4.1 million metric tons, respectively. Following a brief decline in 2022, the industry recovered and in 2024 exported almost 6 million metric tons of sunflower oil and 4.5 million metric tons of sunflower meal and cake. Ukraine is also the world’s leading producer of tomato paste and one of the five largest European suppliers of apple concentrate. However, Ukraine still exports more raw agricultural commodities than processed products ($12.9 billion vs. $9.1 billion in export revenue, respectively, in 2023), which leads to the transfer of added value to importing countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war has caused a significant crisis in Ukraine’s food processing industry. Logistics disruptions, blocking of transport routes, and damage to bridges, roads, and railways make it difficult to transport raw materials and finished products both internally and externally. Destruction of production facilities, interruptions in electricity supply due to constant missile attacks, and shortages of labor and raw materials further complicate the stable functioning of processing enterprises, and in some cases cause cessation. Economic instability and inflation have led to increased costs for food and food inputs, as well as a decrease in the solvency of both agro-industrial enterprises and citizens. Decline in domestic consumption due to lower purchasing power along with population decline, the loss of some sales markets, and a decrease in export earnings have had a negative impact on the financial stability of food processing enterprises. Food companies typically purchase used, often outdated, equipment from Europe, but due to inflation and logistical challenges, even this practice is becoming increasingly expensive. Increased costs for inputs, security, and infrastructure restoration are diverting resources from investment in food production development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recent Initiatives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure stability in the processing industry during the war, the Ukrainian government has launched several initiatives in collaboration with international organizations, in particular the EBRD. These include relocating production facilities to safer regions, supporting the creation and development of processing enterprises, and implementing further steps toward European integration. Relocating food industry enterprises requires not only finding or building suitable premises and moving equipment, but also attracting employees with appropriate knowledge and skills, developing new logistics for inputs and outputs, and opening new sales markets. The New Level grant program for processing enterprises, which falls within the framework of the government’s e-Work program, gives entrepreneurs the opportunity to receive financial support for business creation and/or development. The main conditions of the program are that business owners must create up to 25 new jobs and cofinance 50 percent the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With another grant program, the Ukrainian government is supporting the creation and development of processing facilities, including in the food industry, by cofinancing the acquisition of technological equipment for businesses that create at least five new jobs. Since 2022, the state has approved 1,156 applications for the program, representing approximately $145 million in production facilities. USAID also introduced two projects to support Ukraine’s processing facilities: USAID AGRO announced subgrant funding for the implementation of agricultural processing projects in rural areas. It was expected to provide an opportunity to attract investments in infrastructure development (e.g., cold storage and storage equipment) and create additional jobs. Out of the projects proposed for cofinancing, particular attention was paid to initiatives that aimed to restore and strengthen processing capacities for the production of value-added products from vegetables and root crops, fruits, berries, legumes, corn for food products, herbs, meat (except chicken), milk, and honey. USAID’s Competitive Economy of Ukraine Program also announced grants that would support the development of medium and large processing enterprises in Ukraine, including in the food industry. However, the continuation of the USAID programs is currently questionable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian government also recently implemented a new “Made in Ukraine” initiative, which is designed to stimulate an increase in domestic consumption of internally produced products, including food, and consequently support domestic producers by helping them accumulate funds for further investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although food producers have also suffered significant losses from the war, the food processing industry has demonstrated relative resilience compared to the rest of Ukraine’s processing industry, as it is aimed at providing for the basic needs of the population and meeting the daily demand for food both within and outside the country. As of September 2022, a total of 62 percent of food industry enterprises were operating at almost full (75–99 percent) or full and above capacity compared to the prewar period, the best result among Ukraine’s processing industries. Increase of agricultural production, stabilization of domestic demand, and recovery of export logistics contributed to a 15.9 percent increase in the productivity of the food processing industry in 2024. The highest growth rates were seen in the production of sugar (39.4 percent), vegetable oils and animal fats (34.7 percent), and fruit and vegetable preservation (30.1 percent). Also, in marketing year 2023–24, a record 1.1 million metric tons of rapeseeds were processed, and export of rapeseed oil reached record 424,000 metric tons; production of soybean oil and meal increased by 22 and 29 percent, respectively. These positive trends should encourage an increase in the production of agricultural raw materials and further investments in the development of the processing industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Current and Future Priorities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development of the processing industry will require the transformation of Ukraine’s agricultural model to a new large-scale intensive model that will ensure a sufficient, quality supply of raw materials. Diversifying types of food processing and increasing the share of finished and semi-finished food products in the structure of domestic consumption and exports will contribute to increasing GDP and export revenues, improving Ukraine’s trade balance, reducing food imports and, consequently, reducing import dependency and import logistics risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attract new investment.&lt;/strong&gt; Intensive development of the processing industry will require significant investment (both domestic and foreign), but these costs are justified by the profitability of processing enterprises (which averaged 3.3 percent profits in 2021 and 8.6 percent profits in 2023). Improving economic efficiency of food processing enterprises and implementing modern technologies, including advanced biotechnologies, will contribute to the food processing industry’s growth and, consequently, Ukraine’s economic recovery. It will also increase return on investments as Ukraine shifts from exporting raw agricultural products to processed, high-value, consumer-ready products.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support new product growth.&lt;/strong&gt; Businesses trying to produce and export food products that Ukraine has not previously supplied, but for which there is domestic and/or international demand, will need financial, legislative, and consultative support. (This applies to companies focusing on both nontraditional types of commodities for Ukraine and ready-to-consume niche and organic products.) The export of agricultural and food products from Ukraine is carried out mainly by large enterprises. The Ukrainian government should provide support for the entry of small- and medium-sized agricultural producers into export markets, their involvement in international projects, and the creation of joint ventures. Contract farming will ensure uninterrupted supply of quality raw commodities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diversify and expand food exports.&lt;/strong&gt; Increasing the share of agricultural products processed in Ukraine and exported as finished food products will reduce the potential for conflict with partner countries that primarily regulate the import of agricultural raw materials. Ukraine’s transition from an exporter of raw materials to a supplier of high-quality and safe products with higher added value will repositioning it in the global food system.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Align the Ukrainian food sector with EU standards.&lt;/strong&gt; Increasing alignment with the European Union’s food processing and environmental standards will be a key strategic approach for Ukraine to rebuild and revitalize its food industry following the war. To address this issue, MAPFU, in partnership with UNIDO and with financial support from the German government, developed the Action Plans for the Green Recovery and Transformation of Ukrainian Food Industries, and which will address recovery for key industries, including dairy, fruits and berries, honey, grain processing, poultry and egg products, vegetable oil, and sugar, as well as cross-cutting areas such as food quality and safety and packaging. Future implementation of this plan will create jobs, enhance resilience, promote sustainable economic growth, and strengthen the productivity, competitiveness, and investment attractiveness of the food processing industry.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agriculture is a cornerstone of Ukraine’s economy, and the recovery of Ukraine’s agriculture sector is of strategic importance for ensuring national food security, reducing dependence on imports of critical goods, restoring export capacity, and promoting the country’s long-term sustainable economic development. Additionally, the stabilization and modernization of this sector are essential for the resilience of the global food system, as Ukraine remains one of the world’s key agricultural suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This recovery will be a complex and long-term process that requires a multidisciplinary and coordinated approach across sectors. It calls for a comprehensive reconstruction model, including infrastructure rehabilitation, technology modernization, financial support for farmers, human capital development, export activation, and effective foreign investment mobilization. The “build back better” principle should guide this process—ensuring recovery not only repairs war damage but also lays the foundation for innovation, reform, and integration into the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across all four stages—urgent, short-term, medium-term, and long-term measures—one priority remains central: the attraction of foreign investment. Despite wartime risks, Ukraine continues to demonstrate resilience and attractiveness to foreign investors—particularly in agriculture, infrastructure, and logistics—reflecting strong investor confidence in the agriculture sector’s long-term potential. Foreign capital is already playing a pivotal role in Ukraine’s recovery. Government initiatives, including war-risk insurance, preferential financing, and the development of industrial parks, have contributed to creating a more predictable and stable investment climate. In 2024, Ukraine attracted significant net foreign direct investment, with a substantial portion coming from reinvested earnings. Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, 2,652 new foreign companies have registered in Ukraine, with agriculture and food remaining the most attractive sectors. Forty-three international companies have invested in Ukraine during the war, including Bayer ($65 million), Carlsberg ($40 million), and CEMARK ($30 million), which continue to expand their production capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agriculture sector requires targeted investment to implement specific priorities. Demining and infrastructure restoration remain critical, as approximately 4 million ha of farmland are still contaminated with landmines. The restoration of grain storage facilities, warehouses, and logistics infrastructure will require significant investment, with projected returns expected to substantially exceed the initial costs over the medium term. Processing modernization is equally essential, as upgrading value chains improves product quality and competitiveness in both domestic and international markets. Land market liberalization and the adoption of advanced agricultural technology have the potential to attract substantial investment and improve efficiency in agricultural production. Innovative technologies can help reduce production costs and boost annual revenues. Investment in biofuels and biomaterials opens new opportunities to strengthen energy security and support sustainability. Likewise, the development of organic agriculture is expected to significantly expand export capacity and enhance Ukraine’s positioning in high-value global markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign investment, therefore, serves not only as a key enabler but also as a cross-cutting driver of agricultural recovery. Its mobilization should follow a two-stage strategy, first addressing the consequences of war, then enabling long-term investment and sustainable growth. The total potential return from these initiatives is estimated to be in the tens of billions of dollars, making Ukraine’s agribusiness sector one of the most attractive destinations for international investors—even under wartime conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

This report analyzes how China’s infrastructure development is being used to gain coercive power ahead of the next conflict.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s use of critical infrastructure to control downstream water supply will threaten vital economic activities and life.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) will leverage rail and road networks to strengthen its positions near the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with India. China’s military-civilian dual-use infrastructure will continue to encroach on disputed lands while posturing the country’s forces to project coercive power and gain an advantage in the next border clash.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regional states will no longer harbor Tibetan refugee camps, while also adopting increasingly authoritarian practices made possible by surveillance systems exported by China.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The People’s Republic of China (PRC) is actively using diplomatic, intelligence, military, and economic tools to influence, deter, and compel countries to act in the PRC’s interest. These tools are derived from a combination of the hybrid strategy and gray-zone tactics that have defined Xi Jinping’s China. The tactics cover operations ranging from corporate cyber theft to international development infrastructure projects. But while U.S. policymakers’ attention is fixed on great power competition, the PRC is also active in periphery zones and even within their own territory. In fact, the infrastructure the PRC seeks to export through Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) development projects emerged from efforts within China’s frontier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is fundamentally redefining infrastructure as a tool of coercion. Under the guise of economic development and increasing connectivity, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is constructing a coercive architecture across the Tibetan Plateau. This includes dams that can choke water flow to downstream states, railways that enable rapid military mobilization, and digital networks that are already exporting surveillance and repressing dissent. These projects are not neutral investments. They are latent instruments of state power—dual-use nodes that allow Beijing to pressure neighbors without triggering open conflict. As infrastructure becomes a strategic enabler of compellence and deterrence, the United States and its partners must reframe how they assess and respond to China’s actions. Failing to do so will leave the region vulnerable to incremental gains that add up to irreversible strategic shifts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report identifies four key sectors where PRC infrastructure development is creating coercive leverage. First—and most alarming—is water. China’s upstream control of Asia’s major rivers—accomplished through the construction of dams—allows it to manipulate downstream economies and ecosystems, giving it a potent geopolitical bargaining chip. Second, the CCP is using land development and gray-zone tactics to de facto annex disputed territory and deploy military assets under the pretext of civilian activity. Third, transportation and rail projects are enabling rapid troop movements, especially near the LAC with India, shifting the military balance in Beijing’s favor. Finally, digital infrastructure projects—particularly through firms like Huawei—are extending China’s surveillance state into neighboring countries, particularly targeting refugee populations and dissidents in Nepal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To build resilience against the PRC’s coercive infrastructure, this report recommends a three-pronged approach centered on capacity-building with regional partners, increased digital sovereignty, and expanded intelligence cooperation. First, the United States should strengthen India-Nepal cooperation through economic and infrastructure partnerships that reduce both countries’ dependency on Chinese projects. This includes leveraging institutions like the International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA), and the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) to offer alternatives to BRI investments. Second, the United States must support the creation of secure digital ecosystems by promoting cybersecurity standards and countering digital authoritarianism, particularly in regions where Chinese firms like Huawei have entrenched themselves. Finally, expanding intelligence-sharing agreements modeled on the U.S.-India Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) pact can enhance early warning systems and regional deterrence against PLA activity. Together, these efforts aim to push back against Beijing’s coercive strategy by reinforcing the sovereignty, security, and resilience of states along the Tibetan Plateau.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;from-public-good-to-a-trap-critical-infrastructure-as-a-form-of-coercion&quot;&gt;From Public Good to a Trap: Critical Infrastructure as a Form of Coercion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Power and politics are old bedfellows, and states will historically use anything and everything possible to advance their interests. This process usually plays out first through threats and indirect measures aimed at gaining bargaining advantages but short of open hostility and war. Thomas Schelling described such coercive measures as the “latent diplomacy of violence,” used to either deter an opponent from taking an action or to compel them to change their behavior. Understanding that this “power to hurt” is a type of influence provides the foundation for analyzing statecraft in terms of a bargaining process played out by rivals seeking to avoid the costly gamble of direct conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the core of this process is a risk-reward trade-off. States have imperfect information about their rivals’ power, interests, and issue salience (e.g., how far they will go to change or defend the status quo). As a result, leaders seek ways of “advancing without attacking” and creating conditions that change the risk-reward trade-off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasingly, these coercive bargains have begun to extend far beyond military signaling and diplomatic démarches to include new means of gaining leverage, often taking advantage of the complex infrastructure that connects people—cyberspace and the internet. Coercion short of a war is a key feature of cyberspace. States avoid costly signals like deploying entire military formations by taking covert cyber actions, often just deniable enough to avoid significant retribution, as a new form of signaling and communication. In other words, leaders hijack the technological infrastructure that connects information-age societies to coerce their rivals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This logic extends beyond cyberspace. In a world of complex interdependence, key infrastructure systems—such as financial systems, transportation networks, digital platforms, energy grids, and water resources—can be “weaponized” to gain strategic advantage. By exploiting others’ reliance on these systems, a state can exert pressure without firing a shot, effectively turning connectivity into political leverage. States in dominant network positions can deny rivals access to essential networks or supply chains—for instance, by cutting off crucial digital services or choking a trade route—thereby coercing concessions. This weaponized interdependence enables coercion through disruption: The mere threat of severing an adversary’s lifelines (financial networks, communication links, transport corridors) becomes a potent bargaining chip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein, states have learned to use infrastructure-based dependencies in classic deterrence and compellence scenarios. Control over water is a notable example. Upstream countries can threaten to dam, divert, or release water in ways that harm downstream nations’ livelihoods, thereby leveraging hydrological interdependence for political gain. Such “coercive water diplomacy” gives the controlling state outsized influence. The coercive value of infrastructure lies in its dual-use nature: Projects presented as benign development or connectivity can also serve to restrain and compel. Transportation infrastructure, for instance, can not only facilitate economic integration but also enable blockades or rapid military mobilization in a crisis, tilting the local balance of power. Digital infrastructure and surveillance systems can both foster interconnectivity and provide means to monitor or black out an adversary’s communications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, major powers have long incorporated infrastructure into their coercive tool kit. China’s strategic investments in roads, railways, ports, and dams across Asia exemplify this approach. By building economic linkages and physical control over critical nodes, Beijing not only boosts regional development but also gains latent coercive leverage (e.g., the ability to restrict trade flows or water supply to neighbors if they defy Chinese interests). In Tibet and other border regions, such infrastructure serves a dual role: promoting Beijing’s governance while implicitly threatening to “turn off the tap” or isolate adversaries. Thus, critical infrastructure has become a new form of power in coercion theory; much like armies or missiles, rail lines, fiber-optic cables, and dams can function as instruments of compellence and deterrence. In sum, the evolving literature on coercion highlights not only military might but also economic and infrastructural dominance as key sources of bargaining power between states. By understanding coercion in these terms—as a spectrum of influence from nuclear brinkmanship to the politicization of pipelines and waterways—analysts lay a foundation for examining cases where development and coercion go hand in hand as tools of statecraft, such as China’s infrastructure strategy on the Tibetan Plateau and its periphery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-western-development-plan&quot;&gt;The Western Development Plan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PRC grounded its domestic infrastructure development projects in a strategy updated in the 1990s known as the Western Development Program (WDP), which focused on addressing economic, ecological, and security concerns within China’s territory. Under the auspices of economic development, China aimed to control, influence, and suppress the people in its western territories, including Xinjiang and Tibet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the beginning, the PRC’s intent was to reduce separatist sentiments and non-party approved ideologies, religion, and culture by coercion and, at times, force within the western regions. In 2025, the PRC’s surveillance state in Xinjiang, as well as its persecution and forced labor of Uyghurs in the region, is well known. Yet it is the Tibetan Plateau—a region also covered by the WDP—that presents an opportunity to study the implications of PRC infrastructure development as a tool for coercion and hybrid strategy application. This is because Tibet represents a security concern for the CCP. In the mid-twentieth century, Tibet’s autonomous governing body, spiritual and non-communist beliefs, natural resources, and border with India made its conquest—whether by diplomatic or military means—required for the CCP to establish sovereignty in what it saw as its territory. Put into action following the foundation of the CCP: The PLA invaded eastern Tibet in 1950, and by 1951, it had coerced the spiritual and political leader of Tibetans, the Dalai Lama, into negotiations. The negotiations rejected demands for autonomy and Western democratic norms (but without Tibetan military capability), and resulted in the signing of the “Seventeen Point Agreement” and China’s annexation of the region. However, the agreement was reneged on and, in alignment with Mao Zedong’s Cultural Revolution, all religious activities were prohibited, while limited “cultural liberation” was pursued. Infrastructure development was intended to compensate for the loss of autonomy and offset the erasure of Tibetan culture by China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From its inception, the WDP sought to bind the Tibetan Plateau to Beijing through a multipronged infrastructure strategy. The Chinese political elite believed that through economic development, the Tibetans would enjoy the merits of the CCP’s leadership and, consequently, then abandon nationalist sentiments and any desire for autonomy. As such, Chinese strategy encompassed transportation networks, civil infrastructure, water resource control, and, more recently, digital surveillance systems. Key projects such as the construction of railways, including the Qinghai-Tibet Railway, and road networks have not only facilitated military mobility but have also served to consolidate economic and political control over the region. These initiatives, while framed as tools for economic development, in fact were aimed at integrating Tibetans into the Chinese state, sidelining the latter’s historic call for “one country, two systems.” Water infrastructure plays a similarly critical role in this strategy. The Tibetan Plateau, often referred to as the “water tower of Asia,” is a vital source of freshwater for neighboring countries. By controlling upstream resources in the plateau, the CCP exerts leverage over downstream nations in the Mekong region, aligning infrastructure development with geopolitical objectives. At the same time, digital infrastructure, including surveillance networks, has been weaponized to monitor and suppress dissent, enforce loyalty, and police Tibetan identity and culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consequences of this repression extend beyond Tibet itself. China’s coercive tactics are increasingly evident in neighboring Nepal, where infrastructure projects and diplomatic pressure echo the methods employed by the CCP in the Tibetan Plateau. This spillover effect underscores how the CCP’s infrastructure strategies are not only confined to domestic objectives but also serve as a blueprint for influence and coercion abroad. As such, Tibet offers a crucial case study of infrastructure coercion and hybrid strategy, foreshadowing the global implications of China’s expansionist ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Strategic Geography of the Tibetan Plateau&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese and Tibetan interaction and conflict trace back as far as the sixth century. Although the conquest of Tibet by mainland China predates the CCP, the core grievances and the region’s importance to the CCP started with the founding of modern communist China. Three important reasons to control Tibet stood out at the beginning of the CCP’s rule. The first was that control of the Tibetan Plateau would provide access to natural resources—most importantly, water. The plateau is home to the Himalayas, known as the third pole because of the ice and glaciers at their peak. When the glaciers melt, the water flows through 10 major riverways that provide water to downstream countries including Nepal, India, Bhutan, and Myanmar. The second reason to control Tibet was the necessity for the CCP to unify what it saw as historically Chinese territory and people under communist control and ideology. In this manner, the CCP viewed the Tibetan people—and their culture—as subjects that needed (re)integration into a common identity. Lastly, the region would serve as a buffer zone against India in the case of interstate war or foreign influence. Securing Tibet provided the CCP with the ability to counter regional powers’ interests in China, including the United Kingdom, India, and the United States. The CCP saw the threat of foreign influence as a security concern because, following the Manchu Empire, the British had established a presence in Tibet’s trade markets and continued to influence the larger region indirectly through India post-independence. This was seen in action when India assumed the trading markets and continued Britain’s protector policies over Tibet, including providing ammunition to Tibetans. In addition, Tibet did not share a history of hostilities with India as it did with China, and Tibet’s religious and cultural connections to India proved a concern to the CCP. As such, for the CCP to establish a sovereign state, Tibet needed to be annexed into the new state to safeguard against foreign influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post annexation and under the auspices of development, the CCP has actively leveraged the strategic importance of Tibet to build out a buffer zone, stage military forces, and control vital economic resources. It has done this through building critical nodes of infrastructure with dual-use capabilities, serving both civilian and military purposes. The coercive threat is both implicit and explicit, and the following case studies illustrate vulnerable areas of infrastructure, ranging from water to rail infrastructure, and the potential for coercion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;water-infrastructure&quot;&gt;Water Infrastructure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: Dam Infrastructure in Tibet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has a long history of dam construction and water control, dating back to the Qin dynasty. This tradition continues today, though modern projects on the Tibetan Plateau come with consequences for downstream countries on a scale heretofore impossible. Mao Zedong’s concern over droughts in northern China laid the ideological groundwork for this extensive development. He famously stated, “There is more water in the south and less water in the north. If possible, it is okay to borrow a little.” Since then, the PRC has embarked on an unprecedented era of hydraulic engineering, constructing over 80,000 dams and creating more than 98,000 reservoirs across the country. Water is thus being redirected to the arid climate in China’s north, improving the country’s water management while also maintaining the claim that “not one drop of China’s water should be shared without China using it first or without making those downstream pay for it.” While these projects have supported domestic growth, their environmental and geopolitical repercussions—particularly for nations reliant on rivers originating from the Tibetan Plateau—remain subjects of international concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 2 highlights the rivers from the Tibetan Plateau that provide access to critical water basins that feed downstream to Nepal, India, Bangladesh, and the greater Mekong region. These rivers provide irrigational, potable, and industrial water to the people of Tibet and other lower riparian states. At the same time, the water supports the PRC’s power generation and modernization plans to reduce its reliance on carbon and fossil fuels through hydropower. As such, the PRC is strategically placing dams downstream to generate energy, but at questionable locations near border river-crossing points with Bhutan, India, and Nepal. This, in turn, has neighboring countries like India concerned about the flow of water, seasonal flooding, and the land that is being claimed in disputed regions for dam construction. One example is a dam project along the Kosi River in Nepal, which flows alongside the Araniko Highway and connects to the Kodari-Zhangmu border crossing. The hydropower project benefits Nepal, but water rights issues surrounding this river flowing into India make the dam a point of contention. Another area of concern is on the Brahmaputra River, which flows from the PRC into India and Bangladesh, with fears that downstream flow could be halted for geopolitical purposes. The unilateral water management by the PRC is already creating negative downstream effects for surrounding countries while also generating a dominate strategic position for the PRC to drive relationships or coerce its neighbors into submission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The leverage earned emerges from the effects of dam building: Specifically, generating the power to turn off the tap and affect water access leads to the ability to harm industries and economic growth downstream. For example, since China built dams on the Mekong River in 1986, water levels, flow disruption, and increased sediment have affected Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam, both individually and collectively. These changes are harming the ecosystems on the river and the economic wellbeing of communities surrounding it. A study published in 2025 found that China’s dams prevented the Mekong mainstream from topping off on the Thai-Lao border and increased water restriction during monsoon seasons between 2012 and 2014. These fluctuations are decreasing both the quality and the quantity of fish, negatively impacting a key source of regional employment. This puts at risk not only sources for employment and food, but also increases the PRC’s leverage. These negative downstream effects showcase how well positioned the PRC is to dictate policy positions and other directives to its neighbors, who otherwise risk facing water scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PRC will continue to strategically expand its water infrastructure in the near future to continue exerting pressure on its neighbors and the greater Mekong region. In 2021, the CCP announced in its Fourteenth Five-Year Plan that it would build a hydroelectric power station on the Yarlung Tsangpo River in Tibet, which would have extensive repercussions for Southeast Asia. Apart from ecological impacts, completion of the dam would allow the CCP to change water levels and induce flood or drought in areas downstream. These commitments lay the groundwork for continuing to challenge land disputes with neighboring countries and coercing them into yielding to the CCP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;land-villages-and-resettlement-efforts&quot;&gt;Land, Villages, and Resettlement Efforts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From its inception, the CCP’s ambitions to assert regional dominance through settler colonialism and coercive tactics were evident. In addition to its military conquest, the CCP implemented systematic efforts to suppress Tibetan culture and erase its historical identity. This included redrawing Tibet’s borders to align with Chinese administrative divisions—prefectures, counties, cities, and townships—effectively fragmenting the region and consolidating Chinese control. The PRC also established a settler-colonial system aimed at dominating Tibet and dispossessing its people of their land, culture, and self-determination. These tactics are further evident in the “whole village relocation programs” that China has enacted since the 1950s and which have accelerated in Tibet since 2016. A 2024 study by Human Rights Watch estimates that from 2000 to 2025, the PRC will have coerced the resettlement of 930,000 Tibetans. The PRC’s expansionist intentions are not limited to Tibet and the Tibetan people. In fact, following the annexation of Tibet in 1962, the PLA found itself embroiled in armed conflict over the annexation of lands shared with India, marking the Sino-Indian War. However, the CCP was not as successful as it had been in Tibet. Following a ceasefire, both countries laid claim to overlapping border territory; as of 2025, the area remains not formally demarcated, yet still serves China’s current pursuit of territorial expansion along India’s northern border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contested border area, known as the Line of Actual Control (LAC), is characterized by harsh, uninhabitable terrain and sparse infrastructure, making demarcation physically difficult. The CCP exploits this ambiguity through a range of methods, including deploying PRC-aligned nomadic tribes to cross and occupy land on India’s side of the LAC. For example, since 2017, the CCP has reinvigorated the construction of border defense villages—xiaokang (“well-off”) villages—along the LAC. These villages attract settlers with government subsidies of approximately 14,000 yuan ($2,000 USD) annually. Using the pretext of supporting those settlements, the PLA constructs infrastructure and demarcates new border markers, claiming the land as PRC territory on the grounds that it is inhabited by Chinese citizens. A local official from the Indian territory of Ladakh explained that the CCP’s tactic of “salami slicing” in the LAC is designed to take land while avoiding large-scale conflict. Salami slicing refers to the prolonged and hybrid strategy conducted in small increments in which the PLA has been extending the LAC, one kilometer at a time, using proxies. Because one large push might provoke military involvement, the strategy of using small incursions over an extended period has, thus far, yielded appeasement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, it is estimated that there are around 965 xiaokang villages, with the most recent additions completed in Arunachal Pradesh, India. One of the most notable instances of salami slicing involved the construction of a dual-use bridge across Pangong Tso Lake. While it does facilitate settlements, the bridge also serves strategic military purposes by enabling the rapid movement of mechanized vehicles. By circumventing the lake, the PLA gains a potential route for striking Indian territory with minimal warning. In this context, the PRC now has a strategic hold on gray-zone territory in dispute and is able to showcase its capabilities to rapidly strike if India tries to pose a threat. In effect, the CCP built a coercive tool when it built the bridge. Given the frequency of past military engagements along the LAC, the region appears increasingly primed for renewed conflict, with CCP infrastructure projects advancing the PRC’s military posture under the guise of civilian development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;transportation-and-rail&quot;&gt;Transportation and Rail&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/LAwzmNa.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 3: Dual-Use Transportation Infrastructure Supporting Military Posture in Tibet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to connect Tibet to mainland China and unlock Tibet’s natural resources—including its terrain for military and goods transport—the PRC has prioritized developing road and rail connections. Since 1959, the PRC has invested in building out Tibet’s infrastructure under the guise of economic development and integration. The scale of road and rail grew exponentially with the implementation of the WDP in the 1990s; since then, Tibet’s road network went from 4,536 miles to 73,818 miles while also connecting the region to the north and the mainland. This infrastructure has also been instrumental in the mass relocation of Tibetans and the large-scale influx of Han Chinese settlers, leading to the (intentional) erosion of Tibetan cultural identity while strengthening the PRC’s strategic positioning along its border with India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 3 highlights the positioning of rails along the path of military assets, with a central concentration in Lhasa but expanding east to Nyingchi via the Lhasa-Nyingchi Railway. Shortly after the opening of the railway, the PLA moved the 52nd or 53rd Light Combined Arms Brigades to an exercise field, for both economic development and military mobilization, underscoring the dual-use nature of Tibet’s rail network. There is already evidence of rapid deployments near the LAC with India in the Tawang Valley, which lies approximately 105 miles south of the Shannan railroad stop. Recent reporting highlights that on the route to the Bumla Pass crossing, there was an expansion of trench build-up in 2024, including Helicopter pads; images taken on January 11, 2025, show the expansion of buildings east of the helicopter landing pads. These developments will grow at a faster rate thanks in part to the growth of railroads in Tibet that facilitate the movement of construction materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi Jinping has shown no signs of slowing down investment in Tibet’s transportation infrastructure. As recently as 2020, he emphasized the importance of major infrastructure projects, stating that China must “promote the construction of key transportation and public-service facilities along the Sichuan-Tibet railway and other roads, building more unity lines and happiness roads.” While framed as a means of integrating Tibet economically and culturally with mainland China, these infrastructure developments serve a more concerning dual purpose. The proximity of new and under-construction railways to the Indian border raises significant security concerns as they offer an additional route for the rapid deployment of military assets in the event of a border dispute or conflict along the LAC near Arunachal Pradesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Tibet’s road and rail infrastructure continues to expand, Beijing is systematically positioning itself for future border skirmishes with India. The PRC’s strategic use of transportation networks extends past economic and political integration; it also serves as a crucial component of its broader military and geopolitical ambitions to deter or coercive its neighbors. By embedding dual-use infrastructure within Tibet, China strengthens its ability to mobilize military assets quickly, reinforcing its dominance in the region while posing a direct challenge to India along the LAC. The strategic use of transportation networks for military logistics underscores the PRC’s long-term ambitions in the region, demonstrating that its infrastructure projects serve not only economic and political objectives but also broader military and coercive goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;digital-infrastructure&quot;&gt;Digital Infrastructure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PRC actively leverages digital infrastructure not only to steal intellectual property abroad but also to enhance computational propaganda and repress minority groups within its periphery. The persecution and human rights abuse of the minorities in China is well documented, with examples including relocations of millions to “reeducation” camps to suffer slave labor and sterilizations. Domestically, the CCP uses Huawei’s digital infrastructure to conduct mass surveillance on Uyghurs in Xinjiang, reinforcing its authoritarian control. Recent reports reveal that Huawei’s sales pitches included surveillance systems capable of analyzing voice recordings, monitoring detention centers, tracking political dissidents, and supporting police surveillance operations. These capabilities illustrate how, under the guise of economic development and smart-city initiatives, China repurposes digital infrastructure into sophisticated tools of coercion, effectively transforming cities into surveillance hubs. Moreover, the CCP’s digital surveillance extends beyond China’s borders. In neighboring countries like Nepal, Beijing has exerted its growing influence to monitor and suppress Tibetan refugees, using Huawei’s infrastructure and influence to curtail their movements and political activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s digital infrastructure expansion has extended its surveillance reach into Nepal, where the government digitally tracks Tibetan dissidents and refugees. In 2010, Nepal awarded Huawei a contract to upgrade the country’s telecommunications network, making Huawei Nepal’s sole provider. Over time, Huawei embedded itself within Nepal’s Ministry of Communication and Information Technology (MOCIT), giving the CCP influence over media, private communications, and censorship policies. With this infrastructure in place, China has intensified its monitoring of Tibetan refugees in Nepal, using internet surveillance to track and restrict their movements, fearing that they might expose human rights abuses in Tibet. In a 2022 report, a Nepalese law enforcement official confirmed that Huawei’s technology has been misused to surveil not only Tibetans but also Nepalese officials, underscoring Beijing’s growing control over sovereign networks in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another case involved a Tibetan residing in Nepal who planned to visit their family in PRC-controlled Tibet but who had not disclosed their intent to anyone. After researching safe passage using a web address received via WeChat, the individual received an unsettling phone call—from a family member believed to be coerced—imploring them not to come due to potential risks to both their safety and their family’s wellbeing. Out of fear, the Tibetan remained in Nepal. A last example involved a Tibetan refugee in Nepal who spoke out publicly against the CCP’s mistreatment of the diaspora. This individual maintained regular contact with their family in Tibet, but suddenly, their relatives began pressuring them to return, with an urgency that felt unnatural and coerced. Suspicious of the requests, the refugee refused. In a later video call, they caught a glimpse of an armed man in the background, confirming that the PLA was attempting to lure them back into PRC-controlled Tibet for detention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s expanding digital infrastructure and surveillance tactics in Nepal exemplify its broader strategy of digital repression by weaponizing technology to silence dissent, monitor exiles, and coerce minority populations beyond its own borders. The CCP’s infrastructural influence in foreign nations extends its persecution of ethnic, religious, and political groups it deems dissidents, and reinforces its authoritarian reach beyond mainland China. In 2019, Nepal and Huawei signed a $100 million deal to supply 4G infrastructure and test Nepal’s 5G network, further entrenching the PRC’s technological dominance in the country. This deal reflects a broader trend in which nations, particularly those in Asia, Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East, welcome Chinese technological investments despite the well-known risks of surveillance, censorship, and coercion. With norms and institutions still unsettled in the realm of internet governance, the PRC is actively working with partners—most notably Russia—to shape global digital standards so that they align with Chinese interests and its authoritarian model. By embedding its technology into critical infrastructure worldwide, Beijing is not just exporting hardware—it is exporting control. As Huawei and other PRC-backed firms expand, their technology will continue to be leveraged for state surveillance, political influence, and the suppression of opposition. Without significant pushback, China’s digital coercion infrastructure will further entrench authoritarian governance models, leaving vulnerable nations increasingly dependent on a system designed to serve the CCP’s strategic interests over their own sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;countering-chinas-coercive-infrastructure-in-the-tibetan-plateau&quot;&gt;Countering China’s Coercive Infrastructure in the Tibetan Plateau&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case studies addressing the CCP’s coercive infrastructure against Nepal and India demonstrate clear opportunities for the United States to counter the PRC’s expanding influence. More importantly, the case studies illustrate the tactics the CCP is likely to use against others in the Indo-Pacific. Much like Nepal, smaller nations should be wary of CCP surveillance and the use of this technology to pursue and persecute anyone considered a dissident. Meanwhile, near-peer adversaries should be cognizant of irregular warfare tactics designed to undermine border integrity and the weaponization of resources. To prevent the CCP from undermining a free and open Tibetan Plateau, the United States must increase its support of Nepalese and Indian sovereignty in the face of Chinese expansionist and coercive infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-1-foster-indian-and-nepalese-cooperation&quot;&gt;Recommendation 1: Foster Indian and Nepalese Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India and Nepal share a common interest in countering Chinese encroachment on their territories, people, and networks. To improve relations and to strategically counter the PRC’s influence, the United States needs to encourage India to take proactive steps in several key areas relating to or involving Nepal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economic and technological partnerships.&lt;/strong&gt; India and the United States can assist Nepal in modernizing its telecommunications infrastructure, offering alternatives to Chinese technology firms like Huawei. The United States can lead the charge by leveraging funding from the International Finance Corporation (DFC) and the United States Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) to engage partners in Nepal and India while also encouraging industry investment in Nepal’s digital infrastructure. Leveraging the DFC and USTDA aligns with expected revisions of U.S. Department of State strategy and, furthermore, will help position the United States to declare South Asia as a region critical to U.S. interests and thus to counter the CCP’s coercive power. In parallel, expanding support for the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) allows the United States to back regional integration and counterbalance Beijing’s influence. BIMSTEC provides a strategic platform to strengthen infrastructure and trade across South and Southeast Asia, particularly with India as a key partner. By investing in local firms and working with partners already embedded in the region, the United States can displace Chinese dominance over time, offering countries like Nepal sustainable, secure, and sovereign alternatives to PRC-backed development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infrastructure development.&lt;/strong&gt; Collaborating on major infrastructure projects such as roads, railways, and hydroelectric plants can provide tangible benefits to Nepal’s economy and demonstrate India’s commitment to its neighbor’s development. One method to do so is by leveraging the grant funding in the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) Nepal Compact. The compact’s goal is to maintain road quality, increase access to electricity, and increase cross-border energy trade between Nepal and India. With only 8 percent of the total $500 million used as of early 2025, the United States should fast-track MCC project approvals and expand funding to include key transport corridors that integrate Nepal with India and Bangladesh, thus reducing Nepal’s reliance on China’s BRI-backed roads. In addition, financing India-Nepal hydroelectric projects with U.S. capital from the DFC can help secure Nepal’s energy independence from China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plan for water scarcity.&lt;/strong&gt; Preparing for the PRC to use its coercive infrastructure needs to start now. Nepal and India both will benefit from modeling outcomes in the event that China significantly reduces or halts water flowing south. This includes studying short-term solutions such as storage facilities or importing more potable water. Tabletop exercises stress-testing Nepal’s and India’s water infrastructures, supplies, and demands can provide an investment roadmap to target medium- to long-term needs. These exercises would build on previous studies funded by USAID that analyzed water programs and infrastructure in the Mekong region—first, to inform policymakers about the extent of coercive power and, second, to build alternatives to BRI investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-2-strengthen-cyber-defense-for-digital-sovereignty&quot;&gt;Recommendation 2: Strengthen Cyber Defense for Digital Sovereignty&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huawei’s myriad vulnerabilities create opportunities for the CCP and others to incapacitate information systems by unleashing malicious computer malware. The 2021 Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack demonstrated that the immobilization of just one oil pipeline could lead to a national state of emergency in the United States. The PLA has an entire command dedicated to conducting offensive cyber operations and can easily interfere with internet connections, power grids, banking systems, and mobile communication worldwide. Recent statements from U.S. authorities regarding an ongoing CCP campaign against U.S. infrastructure highlight these capabilities. If further action is not taken, these examples may be just the first of many potential consequences for China’s neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infrastructure development.&lt;/strong&gt; One way to counter the PRC is to encourage regional partners to mandate a standardized cybersecurity protocol for both the government and private sectors. The United States can leverage the State Department’s United States International Cyberspace and Digital Policy Strategy to strengthen “digital solidarity” and to promote collaborative efforts at the international level. Further, this strategy is designed “to counter and respond to malicious cyber operations, cybercrime, and other digital harms” and to promote “cooperative efforts among states and civic actors to defend and advance human rights.” The United States can use this updated policy to interface with India and Nepal to find solutions for protecting digital rights and privacy from PLA operations and to develop methods for countering human rights violations via digital means. Furthermore, the United States can expand cyber diplomacy efforts to propose cybersecurity cooperation agreements either on a bilateral or multilateral basis. Such cooperation agreements could design mechanisms to connect agencies like the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and foreign service officers to key partners in South Asia to help identify best practices to protect systemically critical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-3-enhance-intelligence-collection-and-sharing&quot;&gt;Recommendation 3: Enhance Intelligence Collection and Sharing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early intelligence indications and warnings of escalatory actions by the PLA have successfully thwarted violence so far. In 2022, for example, geospatial intelligence that the United States shared with India allowed the Indian army to repel a PLA advance in the Arunachal Pradesh region. The skirmish did not result in any deaths, averting the potential for further escalation. This incident represents a success story in which intelligence and information sharing kept regional stability intact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intelligence sharing.&lt;/strong&gt; The United States can reaffirm its willingness to share critical information and intelligence to support India’s own intelligence and surveillance capabilities. The previously mentioned intelligence sharing took place because of the 2020 Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) on geospatial cooperation between the United States and India. Using this as a benchmark, implementing an intelligence-sharing pact between the United States, India, and Nepal would enable higher success rates in predicting and responding to regional threats. Future efforts could expand to include establishing digital indicators that measure the onset of influence operations, including foreign-controlled bot networks. Coordination on identifying and neutralizing automated accounts, especially those used to seed confusion or amplify tensions during border standoffs, will help partners stay ahead of destabilizing narratives while minimizing public attention and concerns, political backlash, and escalatory responses. This type of practice is not uncommon; the United States is already involved in sharing intelligence through the Five Eyes and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) alliances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until now, the CCP has maintained a slow, methodical approach to eroding the sovereignty of nations in the Tibetan Plateau. However, the countdown to 2035 will see increasing pressure on any democracies and hybrid regimes that are not in step with the CCP’s plans. The PRC’s initial method of pressure will rely on the spread of influence operation campaigns to sow distrust and shape foreign influence. In sync with these campaigns, the CCP will employ irregular warfare tactics to foment its expansionist goals. Maintaining a free and open Tibetan Plateau will require an extensive and tailored strategic approach. The key factors to mitigate PRC expansion involve strengthening the border bond between India and Nepal, enhancing intelligence collection sharing, investing in cybersecurity defense, and leveraging economic measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been a growing chorus of policymakers and analysts who argue that the Russian military holds the initiative in the war in Ukraine and will likely triumph. As one U.S. academic contended, “the United States and the West more generally and Ukraine have lost in the war over Ukraine,” and “the Russians are going to win.” Dmytro Kuleba, a former Ukrainian foreign minister, remarked that unless the current trajectory changes, “we will lose this war.” In addition, some U.S. policymakers have concluded that Russia has “all the cards.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, Russian President Vladimir Putin has boasted that Russia is decisively winning on the battlefield: “Overall, we can clearly see what is happening right now. Our troops have the strategic initiative along the entire contact line.” He continued that “we have reason to believe that we are set to finish them off. I think that people in Ukraine need to realize what is going on.” Andrei Kartapolov, head of the defense committee in the Duma, Russia’s lower legislative chamber, followed Putin’s comments with threats that if Ukraine did not accede to Russia’s maximalist demands in peace negotiations, Ukrainian leaders would be forced to listen to “the language of the Russian bayonet.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better understand the state of the war and Russia’s battlefield performance, this analysis asks: How successful has the Russian military been in achieving the Kremlin’s objectives? What factors have contributed to this outcome? To answer these questions, this assessment examines several indicators of Russia’s battlefield performance: the relative rate of advance of Russian forces, the size of Russian territorial gains, the scope of equipment losses, and fatality and overall casualty rates. The evidence suggests that Russia has largely failed to achieve its primary objectives and has suffered high costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Russian forces have advanced an average of only 50 meters per day in such areas as Kharkiv, slower than during the Somme offensive in World War I, where French and British forces advanced an average of 80 meters per day. Russian rates of advance have also been significantly slower than during such offensives as Galicia in 1914 (1,580 meters per day), Gorzia in 1916 (500 meters), Belleau Wood in 1918 (410 meters), Leningrad in 1943 (1,000 meters), and Kursk-Oboyan in 1943 (3,220 meters). Even Russia’s rate of advance in parts of Donetsk Oblast, averaging 135 meters per day, has been remarkably slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Russia’s seizure of approximately 5,000 square kilometers of territory in Ukraine since January 2024 has been paltry—amounting to less than 1 percent of Ukrainian territory—and has occurred mainly in Donetsk, Luhansk, and Kharkiv Oblasts. Russia’s marginal gains are particularly noteworthy compared to its conquest of 120,000 square kilometers during the first five weeks of the war and Ukraine’s recapture of 50,000 square kilometers in the spring of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, Russia has lost substantial quantities of equipment across the land, air, and sea domains, highlighting the sharp matériel toll of its attrition campaign. Since January 2024, for example, Russia has lost roughly 1,149 armored fighting vehicles, 3,098 infantry fighting vehicles, 300 self-propelled artillery, and 1,865 tanks. Even more noteworthy, Russian equipment losses have been significantly higher than Ukrainian losses, varying between a ratio of 5:1 and 2:1 in Ukraine’s favor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, Russian fatalities and casualties have been extraordinary. Russia will likely hit the 1 million casualty mark in the summer of 2025—a stunning and grisly milestone. Overall, a high of 250,000 Russian soldiers have died in Ukraine, with over 950,000 total Russian casualties, a sign of Putin’s blatant disregard for his soldiers. To put these numbers into historical perspective, Russia has suffered roughly five times as many fatalities in Ukraine as in all Russian and Soviet wars combined between the end of World War II and the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. In addition, Russian fatalities in Ukraine (in just over three years) are 15 times larger than the Soviet Union’s decade-long war in Afghanistan and 10 times larger than Russia’s 13 years of war in Chechnya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s poor performance has likely been caused by several factors: the Russian military’s reliance on dismounted infantry and mechanized forces to take Ukrainian territory, Russia’s failure to use operational fires in a coordinated way that enables maneuver, and Ukraine’s effective utilization of defense in depth. For the United States, increased sanctions on Russia and continuing U.S. and European military assistance to Ukraine would likely raise the costs for Moscow of a protracted war and could facilitate peace talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of this analysis is divided into three sections. The first examines Russian objectives and the Russian way of war in Ukraine. The second section analyzes four indicators of Russian military performance: the average rate of advance, the amount of territory seized, the amount of equipment destroyed, and total fatalities and casualties. The third section provides broader implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-russian-way-of-war&quot;&gt;The Russian Way of War&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vladimir Putin’s primary objective is likely to bring Ukraine back into Russia’s sphere of influence, either directly by militarily conquering and annexing Ukraine or indirectly by installing a Russian ally in Kyiv. Putin has been clear and consistent in claiming—falsely—that Ukraine is not, and has never been, an independent country with a distinct culture, history, religion, or language. In his article “On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians,” Putin noted that Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarussians are descendants of Ancient Rus and “bound together by one language (which we now refer to as Old Russian), economic ties . . . and—after the baptism of Rus—the Orthodox faith.” Paraphrasing the Russian writer Nikolai Gogol, Putin asked, “How can this heritage be divided between Russia and Ukraine? And why do it?” Putin continued that “there was no historical basis” for “the idea of Ukrainian people as a nation separate from the Russians.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After failing to bring Ukraine back into Russia’s orbit by seizing Crimea in 2014 and then using a combination of regular and irregular military units in eastern Ukraine, Putin resorted to a conventional invasion in February 2022. The Russian military was unable to swiftly defeat Ukrainian forces through a blitzkrieg campaign and has since resorted to an attrition strategy to conquer Ukrainian territory and defeat the Ukrainian military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A war of attrition is one in which a belligerent attempts to wear its opponent down through piecemeal destruction of its military, including matériel and personnel. The essence of attrition is best described by Carl von Clausewitz, who wrote that it is a mistake to believe that there is “a skillful method of disarming and overcoming an enemy without causing great bloodshed.” Instead, Clausewitz contended that “war is an act of violence pushed to its utmost bounds” and that the side “that uses force unsparingly, without reference to the bloodshed involved, must obtain a superiority if his adversary uses less vigor in its application.” In attrition warfare, the belligerents are mainly concerned with overpowering their adversaries in a series of bloody set-piece battles that minimize exposure to enemy fire. These battles can be characterized by high casualties, massive expenditures of matériel, and limited movement of front lines. In attrition warfare, a successful offensive operation pushes the defender backward along a front line, much like a bulldozer. There is limited expectation of delivering a knockout blow in which a specific action quickly renders the opponent unable to fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attrition can be distinguished from maneuver warfare, in which an attacker attempts to defeat an enemy decisively without relying on bloody set-piece battles to wear down the enemy. For example, Nazi Germany adopted a blitzkrieg strategy in the early phases of World War II to rapidly defeat France, Belgium, and other European militaries. The United States employed such a strategy during Operation Desert Storm in 1990–91 and Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003, as did Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War. While Putin may have hoped that Russia’s military would quickly defeat Ukrainian forces and topple the government in February 2022, it failed to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since early 2024, Russia has held the initiative in the war in Ukraine. As used here, “initiative” involves attacking—or threatening to attack—an enemy to force it to react or deny it the ability to act. As described by British Major R.G. Cherry, the initiative is also “the power of making our adversary’s movements conform to our own.” With the exception of some limited Ukrainian operations—most notably the cross-border incursion into Russia’s Kursk region in 2024—Russia has generally been on the offensive since January 2024 (and even in some areas, such as Avdiivka, since October 2023). During this period, Russia’s offensive campaign has involved several components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Russia has used dismounted infantry (including human wave attacks) and mechanized forces to wear down and attrit Ukrainian lines by killing and wounding Ukrainian soldiers, destroying equipment, undermining morale, and otherwise targeting Ukraine’s capacity to fight. Russian forces have also utilized small first-person-view (FPV) and other drones, artillery, glide bombs, and a range of other stand-off weapons. A glide bomb is a low-cost, conventional bomb modified with deployable wings and a relatively inexpensive global navigation satellite system guidance kit. Glide bombs have been particularly deadly at penetrating Ukrainian airspace and hitting targets because of their speed, low thermal profile, and ability to saturate defenses when fired in large numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6DbIGRd.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Ukraine Battlefield Map, June 2025&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the tactical level, Russian units have routinely conducted advances using small squads of troops, often poorly trained, that are supported by armored vehicles or light mobility vehicles. These forces can include company tactical groups, modified tactical breakthrough groups, and special assault detachments. Higher Russian headquarters frequently order these forces to advance toward Ukrainian positions to conduct reconnaissance by drawing fire. If the soldiers encounter resistance, Russian military commanders may assess the best lines of approach and boundaries—including the seams—between defensive units. If Ukrainian positions are positively identified, Russian soldiers are then routinely sent forward to attack positions, which are further mapped and then targeted with artillery, FPV drones, and glide bombs. When rotation or disruption of the defense is achieved, Russian units aim to conduct more deliberate assault actions. These tactics have led to high fatalities and casualties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Russia has utilized stand-off strikes from ground, air, and naval platforms to terrorize Ukrainian civilians through a punishment strategy. Examples include cruise and ballistic missiles (fired from Tu-160 and Tu-95MS bombers, Tu-22M3 bombers, MiG-31K fighters, and Su-34 fighters), strike and reconnaissance unmanned aircraft systems (UASs), small FPV drones, and artillery fire. But the Russian military has not used long-range fires effectively to shape the battlefield and set the conditions for maneuver warfare. As one CSIS analysis concluded, “Despite inheriting a military doctrine steeped in deep battle, reconnaissance-strike complexes, and precision noncontact warfare, Russia has consistently failed to employ operational fires in a way that reflects this legacy. Instead, firepower has become unmoored from maneuver.” In addition, the Russian military has suffered from weak coordination of units and a lack of battlefield flexibility and initiative of soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian forces have also imposed significant costs with their defense in depth in a war that has largely favored the defending side. Ukraine has used trenches, dragon’s teeth, mines, and other barriers—along with artillery and drones—to attrit advancing Russian soldiers and vehicles. Figures 2a and 2b show Ukrainian defensive positions—including trenches and dragon’s teeth—near the town of Andriivka in Donetsk Oblast in eastern Ukraine during a Russian offensive operation. Dragon’s teeth are anti-tank fortifications formed by truncated pyramids, usually made of reinforced concrete, designed to impede the mobility of main battle tanks and other vehicles. Ukrainian tactics are premised on extending the depth of their fires and dispersing their force to avoid casualties. In response to the threat from fires, Ukrainian units have dug in extensively to reduce force density. Ukraine has also conducted several stunning operations, including smuggling drones deep inside Russia and using them to target and destroy Russian Tupolev bombers in June 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has some advantages with a substantial industrial base and an ability to mobilize a much larger number of soldiers. Nevertheless, the Russian military has struggled to conduct ground force operations at scale, overcome prepared Ukrainian defenses, or break through Ukrainian lines to achieve operationally significant gains. The Russian military has also faced challenges with force quality and the loss of experienced officers. In spite of heavy losses, the Kremlin has likely pinned its hopes of winning on a U.S. decision to end its military assistance to Ukraine. The next section turns to a more systematic analysis of Russia’s battlefield performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russias-battlefield-performance&quot;&gt;Russia’s Battlefield Performance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section uses four indicators to measure Russia’s progress since January 2024: the rate of advance, the amount of territory captured, the amount of equipment lost, and total fatalities and casualties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rate of Advance:&lt;/strong&gt; Russia’s rate of advance since January 2024 underscores the difficulty of breaking through entrenched defenses. This analysis estimates the average daily rate of Russian advance by measuring the straight-line distance that the front line shifted during specific campaigns in Ukraine. For each case, the measured distance is divided by the number of days of the campaign to calculate the average rate of advance in meters per day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the Donetsk front in the east, Russia launched a renewed offensive in October 2023 and captured the fortified city of Avdiivka in February 2024 after one of the war’s most intense battles. From that point through April 2025, Russian forces advanced approximately 60 kilometers westward toward the city of Pokrovsk—an average of just 135 meters per day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s progress has been even slower near Kharkiv in the north. In November 2024, Russian forces launched an offensive around the city of Kupiansk, crossing the Oskil River and pushing westward in an effort to encircle the city. Over the next five months, they advanced roughly 8 kilometers at the furthest point, averaging just 50 meters per day. Elsewhere along the front line, Russia has made little to no progress pushing Ukrainian forces back since January 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figures 3a–3d show the battlefield near the town of Andriivka in Donetsk Oblast, where Ukrainian forces destroyed a column of Russian armored vehicles in early April 2025. An explosion disabled the lead vehicle, which blockaded the remaining vehicles along the T-0428 Andriivka-Novopavlivka highway. Russian infantry dismounted from the vehicles and Ukrainian forces targeted them using drones and artillery. Roughly 12 Russian armored vehicles and tanks were destroyed or damaged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 3d: Destroyed Russian Vehicles Near Andriivka, Donetsk Oblast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The slow pace of Russia’s recent advances is part of a broader pattern that has defined the war in Ukraine. Both sides now operate along extensively fortified front lines featuring dense minefields, trench systems, anti-armor obstacles, and fortified artillery positions. These defenses impose severe costs on attacking forces and dramatically limit potential breakthroughs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, during the first year of the war in 2022, surprise and the absence of fortified defenses in many areas allowed attackers to maneuver more freely and achieve rapid breakthroughs in sweeping offensives. For example, during the initial phase of Russia’s invasion from February to April 2022, Russian forces advanced approximately 120 kilometers south from Belarus toward Kyiv, averaging about 3,120 meters per day. Along a separate axis, they advanced roughly 250 kilometers west through Sumy and Chernihiv toward Kyiv’s eastern outskirts, an average pace of 6,675 meters per day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, in the fall of 2022, Ukraine conducted multiple successful offensives. In the north, Ukrainian forces retook the city of Kharkiv and surrounding areas in a blistering offensive that advanced an average of 7,400 meters per day. Around the same time, Ukrainian forces advanced an average of 590 meters a day in the south, retaking the city of Kherson and surrounding territory. More recently, Ukraine’s Kursk offensive illustrated the benefit of attacking with surprise against unprepared defenders, as Ukrainian troops advanced roughly 30 kilometers into Russia in three weeks, an average of approximately 1,250 meters per day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s slow and limited advances since January 2024 are most comparable to Ukraine’s own offensive in the summer and fall of 2023, which managed to push forward at a rate of just 90 meters per day against heavily fortified Russian positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 4 illustrates these trends by comparing the average rates of advance for major operations in Ukraine since 2022 alongside historical benchmarks from World War I, World War II, and the Yom Kippur War. Russia’s ongoing Kupiansk offensive has advanced at barely more than half the rate of the Allied forces in the Battle of the Somme in World War I, one of the most grinding offensives of the war. Even the relatively faster Avdiivka–Pokrovsk Russian offensive moved much slower than several historical campaigns, such as the U.S. offensive in the Battle of Belleau Wood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/CG4BReW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 4: Rates of Advance for Selected Combined Arms Offensives, 1914–2025&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Territorial Gains:&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to its slow rate of advance, Russia’s territorial gains since January 2024 have been modest. Russia’s largest gains have come in the east, where it captured the city of Avdiivka and has continued to push westward toward Pokrovsk. Over the course of this offensive, Russia has seized approximately 3,100 square kilometers. In the northeast, Russia’s operations to encircle Kupiansk since November 2024 have captured approximately 500 square kilometers. Along the entire front line, Russia has captured less than 5,000 square kilometers since January 2024. By April 2025, Russian territorial gains had slowed down, with Russian ground forces seizing an average of roughly six square kilometers per day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By comparison, these territorial gains are far smaller than those that occurred in earlier phases of the war. For example, at the peak of its initial invasion in March 2022, Russian forces had seized approximately 120,000 square kilometers of Ukrainian territory in less than five weeks. By the end of April 2022, Ukraine had retaken approximately 50,000 square kilometers. Later that year, Ukraine’s Kharkiv and Kherson counteroffensives reclaimed roughly 17,000 square kilometers combined in approximately 11 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like its slow advance, Russia’s modest territorial gains since January 2024 indicate the difficulty of breaking through entrenched defenses and sustaining large-scale offensive operations in today’s battlefield environment. In contrast to the large exchanges of territory experienced in the first year of the war, fighting in 2025 is characterized by a grinding contest of attrition, where even limited territorial shifts typically require months of battle and offer few opportunities for decisive breakthroughs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equipment Losses:&lt;/strong&gt; Equipment losses illustrate the high cost Russia has paid since January 2024 for its modest gains. As shown in Figure 5, Russia has lost substantial quantities of equipment, highlighting the steep matériel toll of sustaining offensive operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rEEjCqm.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 5: Equipment Losses by Type, January 2024–April 2025&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attrition ratios of Russian equipment losses to Ukrainian equipment losses show the relative intensity of attrition across different phases of the war. Figure 6 plots the quarterly ratio of Russian fighting vehicle losses to Ukrainian losses based on visual confirmations. A value above 1 indicates Russia lost more matériel than Ukraine, and the higher the ratio, the more lopsided and costly Russia’s operations were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/dgQ88zK.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 6: Loss Ratio of Russian to Ukrainian Fighting Vehicles Over Time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During Russia’s initial invasion, the ratio hovered just under 4:1 as Russia’s thrusts toward Kyiv burned through fighting vehicles far faster than Ukraine lost its own. The ratio dropped in the fall of 2022 to around 2:1 when Ukraine went on the offensive at Kharkiv and Kherson and incurred higher losses. A smaller crest followed in early 2023 as Russia escalated its assault on Bakhmut, followed by another dip in the summer of 2023 during Ukraine’s Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia counteroffensives. The steepest spike appeared in late 2023 and early 2024, rising to a ratio of nearly 5:1 when Russia captured Avdiivka. Since mid-2024, the ratio has generally declined and in May 2025 it was approximately 2:1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changes in the Russian-to-Ukrainian fighting vehicles loss ratio underscore the growing inefficiency of Moscow’s invasion. In early 2024, Russia experienced loss ratios higher than those it suffered during its initial 2022 invasion in exchange for only a fraction of the territorial gains. Russia’s offensives since January 2024 have yielded only marginal territorial gains but consistently suffered unfavorable loss ratios. The disparity points to the challenge of attempting repeated frontal assaults into well-prepared defenses and Russia’s reliance on mass rather than maneuver. Russia has attempted to offset these losses by greatly increasing its domestic defense production and supplementing with foreign supplies, including from China, Iran, and North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the Kremlin appears willing to absorb high attrition in a bid to outlast Kyiv, the sustained disproportionate equipment loss rate erodes its capacity to generate fresh, high‑quality formations for the decisive breakthroughs it still seeks. Since January 2024, Russia has traded vast quantities of equipment for mere meters of ground—a strategy that decisively falls short of Moscow’s objective to greatly expand its control of Ukrainian territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fatalities and Casualties:&lt;/strong&gt; Russia has also suffered significant fatalities and casualties. As Figure 7 shows, there were as many as 250,000 Russian fatalities in Ukraine between February 2022 and May 2025, compared to a high of roughly 50,000 total Soviet and Russian fatalities in all wars combined between World War II and February 2022. That means that Russia has suffered as many as five times the number of fatalities in Ukraine (in just over 3 years) as in all Russian and Soviet wars combined since World War II (covering roughly 77 years). No Soviet or Russian war since World War II has even come close to Ukraine in terms of fatality rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Wy51z39.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 7: Russian Fatalities in Selected Wars, 1946–2025&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, over 950,000 Russian soldiers have been killed and wounded since the war began. As Figure 8 highlights, Russia’s daily average of casualties has increased every year since 2022. However, many of the soldiers killed and wounded in Ukraine are from Russia’s Far North, Far East, and prisons—and are not the children of Moscow and St. Petersburg elites. Putin likely considers these types of soldiers more expendable and less likely to undermine his domestic political support base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian fatality rates are also high at between 60,000 and 100,000 Ukrainian soldiers killed, with a total of 400,000 casualties (which include both killed and wounded).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/w4vdR6j.png&quot; alt=&quot;image12&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 8: Russian Daily Average of Casualties, March 2022–April 2025&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russia-does-not-hold-all-the-cards&quot;&gt;Russia Does Not Hold All the Cards&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has struggled in Ukraine. As this analysis shows, Russian military forces have failed to significantly advance on the battlefield, seized limited territory, lost substantial quantities of equipment relative to Ukraine, and suffered high rates of fatalities and casualties. Russia has paid an extraordinary blood price for seizing less than 1 percent of Ukrainian territory since January 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian attrition has likely been caused by several factors: Russia’s reliance on dismounted infantry attacks to take Ukrainian territory, Russia’s failure to employ operational fires in a way that facilitates maneuver, and Ukraine’s effective defenses and tactics in a defense-dominant war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin’s main hope to win on the battlefield is for the United States to cut off aid to Ukraine and walk away from the conflict. Moscow’s aspiration is likely grounded in the U.S. decision to end aid to the Syrian opposition around 2015–16 (which allowed the Russian- and Iranian-backed Bashar al-Assad regime to defeat most insurgent forces) and the U.S. decision to withdraw from Afghanistan in 2021 (which allowed the Taliban regime to overthrow the Ashraf Ghani government in August 2021).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wars of attrition frequently come down to mass and defense industrial mobilization. As the historian Paul Kennedy wrote in The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers, it is “incontestable” that “in a long-drawn-out Great Power (and usually coalition) war, victory has repeatedly gone to the side with the more flourishing productive base—or, as the Spanish captains used to say, to him who has the last escudo.” The victorious side is often the one that can more readily replace the soldiers and equipment—including artillery, air defense systems, munitions, and armored vehicles—that are lost in huge numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet even in cases when attrition warfare is ultimately successful, it has huge costs. Winning a war of attrition requires a willingness to absorb considerable casualties and significant losses of equipment. In Ukraine, Russia has some advantages in population size and industrial mobilization, particularly with the help of China, Iran, North Korea, and other countries. European and U.S. aid is critical for Ukraine, and an end of U.S. assistance would likely tip the balance in favor of Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Moscow does not hold all, or even most, of the cards. It has at least two vulnerabilities that the United States and Europe could better exploit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is Russia’s economy. Russia is grappling with stubborn inflation, labor shortages, and limited paths to economic growth. The country’s economy is seriously exposed in oil and gas, which make up between 30 percent and 50 percent of Russia’s total federal budget revenue. Increased sanctions against Russia’s energy sector—including sanctions against any country that buys Russian oil (what policymakers call “secondary sanctions”)—would likely cause major pain. One analysis estimated that secondary sanctions against Russia would cause Kremlin oil revenues to drop by 20 percent while raising gasoline prices in the United States only 15 cents per gallon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Energy sanctions could be combined with sanctions against other Russian exports, such as minerals, metals, agricultural goods, and fertilizers. Some members of Congress, such as Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), have introduced legislation that imposes additional primary and secondary sanctions against Russia. The legislation includes up to 500 percent tariffs on imported goods from countries that buy Russian oil, gas, uranium, and other products. The United States and Europe could also seize approximately $300 billion in frozen Russian assets and use them to provide Ukraine with sustainable assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second Russian vulnerability is the blood cost of a protracted war, particularly if it erodes Putin’s political support base. As this analysis has outlined, Russia has suffered massive numbers of fatalities and casualties. If Moscow continues to drag its feet on peace talks, a U.S. decision to provide more weapons, intelligence, and training to Ukraine would escalate Russia’s battlefield costs. U.S. Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS), High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), 155-mm artillery rounds, air defense systems, and other weapons systems and intelligence assistance have seriously complicated Russia’s offensive campaign. And unlike the forever wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the United States has not lost any soldiers in Ukraine. American military assistance has also benefited workers in Arizona, California, Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Texas, and other states where these weapons systems are developed and produced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet despite Russia’s vulnerabilities, the United States has failed to wield either the economic or military cudgel. Without serious pain, Putin will continue to drag the peace talks out, keep fighting, and wait for the United States to walk away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States holds many of the cards in Ukraine. It just needs to start playing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Trump administration makes a generational change in U.S. grand strategy, it should create a new map of the world that better aligns military activities to that strategy. The current command structure is inefficient and slow—designed for an era when the United States’ military was larger and threats were more easily contained and geographically aligned. As a result, increasing lethality will require more than just cutting the number of general officers and consolidating headquarters. It requires a new framework for seeing the world. It requires a new map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making a new map starts with a bureaucratic document unknown to most Americans that has significant consequences for global security architecture: the Unified Command Plan (UCP). Every two years the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) initiates a review of the UCP. Sometimes there are sweeping changes, like creating new functional commands to address cyber and space operations. Other times, the UCP adjusts regional priorities, such as the creation of the U.S. Central Command (USCENTCOM) in 1983 and the U.S. Africa Command (USAFRICOM) in 2007. And proposed reforms—both today and in years past—generate intense debates in Congress and across the Pentagon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As strategy changes, the map the Pentagon uses to align military power to national security interests should change. The Trump team is correct to call for bold changes to the UCP. In fact, substantial changes have the potential to improve command and control, flexibility, and adaptability for day-to-day competition and war fighting while modestly reducing costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two possible ways to achieve these gains are to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;consolidate combatant commands, giving each four-star commander broader responsibilities to better manage competition; or&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;shift to a more global approach that abolishes regional commands in favor an integrated global command focused on waging modern joint all-domain campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The principal trade-off between these approaches is placing a greater emphasis on border security and day-to-day competition versus prioritizing preparation for global war against a rival great power. That is, should the United States manage its defense commitments by prioritizing a “world of regions” or visualize and describe military strategy using a single map focused on preparing for a global war, most likely with China? This global competition in turn would require mission-focused commands that adapt to the threat across different regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the Trump national security team aims to prioritize addressing immediate threats—through measures such as strengthening border security, using security cooperation to shape strategic conditions, and conducting deterrence operations—it should consolidate the combatant commands (CCMDs) and better align operation, activities, and investments in support of regional competition. This approach focuses on the most likely course of action: day-to-day competition and using military forces to deter adversaries and support partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, if preparing for protracted, global conflict is more important, it should eliminate regional CCMDs and focus on a single global struggle that requires synchronizing effects across domains. This approach prioritizes the most dangerous course of action and sacrifices gaining access and reassuring partners regionally for a more a direct approach to securing U.S. interests globally through mission-aligned task forces that constantly evolve and adapt. The trade-off is regional nuance for global focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these approaches are not mutually exclusive, the difference is one of prioritization and how best to align authorities, command structures, and the marginal defense dollar. Both of these options reduce the current number of commands, lower the number of four-star officers, and reduce the burden of manning service component headquarters. And any restructuring should focus on improving the efficacy of the command structure to ensure political leaders have access to adaptive and dynamic military options in lieu of cumbersome, and often stale, plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the path chosen, there are additional steps the Trump national security team could take to support improved flexibility and adaptability. Most importantly, the team should add two deputy secretaries of defense (DSDs) for current and future operations who have command authority over sections of the department. This will make the Department of Defense (DOD) more agile by allowing faster decisions for current and future operations, essentially enabling greater decentralized execution, which is necessary for large bureaucracies. This simple change also reserves the defense secretary’s time for the thorniest, most strategic issue: determining when to sacrifice the future for the present, or vice versa. This added bureaucratic layer is only helpful if the DSDs have decisionmaking authority. They must be in the chain of command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. military has an extremely broad range of global responsibilities across many functions, which creates demands for the secretary to lead an organization larger than several small countries. This reality means the secretary should push many day-to-day decisions to lower levels so he can focus on the long-term strategic issues and one or two immediate priorities. Placing DSDs in the chain of command with some budgetary control creates a structure to facilitate lower-level decisions for many issues. The current limited number of civilians in the U.S. chain of command—numbering just one or two for the military services—is offset by numerous, equivalent four-star military commanders and over 40 four-star officers, which President Donald Trump and Congress should reduce. Consolidating several combatant commands in either of the ways this report describes offers potential savings. After all, three-star generals lead the militaries of several small countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the authors firmly believe these changes will improve the effectiveness, agility, and efficiency of the DOD, the department needs to quickly conduct additional classified analysis and war gaming with congressional staff to ensure the production of a new UCP and National Defense Authorization Act within a year to codify these revolutionary adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report proceeds by providing an overview of the UCP’s history and reform debates. It then provides two options for substantially reforming the UCP. The report concludes by listing major recommendations the Trump administration should consider regardless of the path it takes to redraw its military map of global competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-history-of-a-military-map&quot;&gt;The History of a Military Map&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pentagon’s military map of world is the UCP. President Harry S. Truman approved the first UCP in 1946—then known as the Outline Command Plan. The original plan called for a Far East Command (FECOM) for Japanese occupation, along with a Pacific Command (PACOM), Alaskan Command, Northeast Command, U.S. Atlantic Fleet (later Atlantic Command, or LANTCOM), Caribbean Command, and European Command (EUCOM). From the beginning, drawing lines to focus military operations on a global scale led to service conflict. In the early years, this conflict centered on whether to place the Mariana Islands and Bonin under PACOM or FECOM, a fight largely defined by rival service perspectives between the U.S. Navy and U.S. Army. This trend continued over the decades and included failed efforts by the U.S. Army to raise the status of Military Assistance Command Vietnam to a unified command supported by PACOM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a map, the UCP addressed not just physical boundaries but complex coordination questions involving emerging military capabilities. Control over strategic forces—from nuclear weapons to space and cyber capabilities—has long plagued planners. As early as 1946, Army Air Force officers advocated for a Strategic Air Command (SAC) operating globally, seeing the alignment as reflecting the principles of mass and unity of command as well as hard lessons learned in World War II. This premise was subsequently challenged by the U.S. Navy, which argued that ballistic missile subs must work alongside other ships, leaving them subordinate to fleets in LANTCOM, EUCOM, and PACOM. The debate came to a head in 1960 when the secretary of defense gave the commander-in-chief, Strategic Air Command (CINCSAC), the director, Strategic Target Planning a U.S. Navy deputy rather than creating a unified command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar debates defined the emergence of space and cyberspace as war-fighting domains, with a mix of defense analysts and Congress alongside military members trying to align emerging technologies with their war plans and service priorities. Command structures to manage operations in space evolved within the U.S. Air Force between the 1960s and the creation of Space Command in 1985. The command emerged in parallel with President Ronald Reagan’s Strategic Defense Initiative. The command was officially closed in 2002, with space missions transferred back to the U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) until Congress approved a measure to reestablish it in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interest in separate military capabilities aligned to cyber missions emerged from the fallout of a war game. Eligible Receiver 97—an early cyber-focused exercise—created deep concerns about systematic vulnerability in the DOD, leading to the creation of the Joint Task Force Computer Network Defense (JTF-CND) in 1998. The entity evolved into a JTF working for the U.S. Space Command (USSPACECOM) until it transitioned to USSTRATCOM in 2002. In 2009, then–Defense Secretary Robert Gates directed the reorganization of service cyber forces, including merging two separate cyber task forces to form the U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This history provides crucial context for thinking about reforming the UCP. Historically, changing trends—from the emergence of space as a war-fighting domain to the invention of cyberspace—and shifting regional threat dynamics have pushed defense officials to rewrite the UCP and create new maps of how best to align military power with strategic interests. The United States stands at the cusp of a similar moment in 2025. As a result, the DOD should consider sweeping changes to the UCP to streamline day-to-day competition and war-fighting activities while modestly reducing costs. While this report discusses two options for consolidation, the administration could also consider a third option: mission-oriented CCMDs, building on the work that think tank Center for Naval Analyses (CNA) completed in 2024 and provided to Congress and the National Security Council. Fewer CCMDs with appropriate authorities give combatant commanders (CCDRs) the ability to streamline decisionmaking and move resources between priorities as requirements shift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-ucp-reform-debate&quot;&gt;The UCP Reform Debate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given its division of the world into neat lines and attempts to synchronize multiple domains, the UCP has historically been a lightning rod for defense debates. Most of these involve disputes about territory, forces, and freedom of action (i.e., authorities as well as command and control). Substantial adjustments to the UCP have the potential to improve effectiveness and reduce costs if carefully considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first debate centers on whether the military should organize its force around geographic regions (i.e., territory) or functional missions and capabilities (i.e., force) lines. This relates directly to strategy, force posture, unity of effort, and operational art, as it impacts how military formations are organized, commanded, deployed, and employed across theaters. Within this debate is a second order question of whether to organize forces around one, global fight or a series of flexible regional contingencies. At one extreme, forces resemble the McNamara-era efforts to establish a unified command over all general-purpose forces in the United States focused on joint training, experimentation, and mobilization exercises. At the other extreme is a base force construct built around regionally aligned formations or even a world of a single global wartime commander.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second debate concerns practical questions: How large and broad should each command be? Where should the lines be drawn functionally and geographically? The larger the command, the more flexibility the commander has to shift resources between the different responsibilities owned by the command. However, this also means the commander has less time to focus on important but often less urgent issues. If a commander is responsible for fewer countries or functions, they have space for more subject matter expertise but will also need to make tough prioritization decisions or recommendations when trade-offs are necessary. There is ongoing tension between CCMDs having a clear focus versus flexibility to respond to global challenges that cross traditional geographic boundaries and domains. For example, is it better to have separate space and strategic commands or one, merged entity? Over time, this tension has emphasized a clear but relatively narrow focus, leading to functionally and geographically aligned commands that struggle to support global campaigning and are top heavy—led by four-star commanders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This question of command arrangements becomes more central with the emergence of joint all-domain operations and global campaigning. Today, war against another great power will cross all functional commands and many, if not most, regional combatant commands. In this world, there are likely advantages to fighting as a single combatant command using a single joint task force with one combined joint air force component and land component. There are different advantages to using a series of small, subunified commands and task forces with flexible authorities and shifting areas of operation. The concept of subunified commands has been used, for example, to support global cyber operations as well as to focus on specific mission areas like the Combined Joint Task Force–Horn of Africa. According to a Government Accountability Office study, historically combatant commands have relied on subordinate commands for mission management and execution, leaving one to wonder if a series of more adaptable joint interagency task forces, led by ranks as low as colonels to as high as four-star generals, might perform as well or better than CCMDs in combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;toward-a-new-map&quot;&gt;Toward a New Map&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report proposes two UCP reform options: (1) modest consolidation of the current CCMDs, retaining a focus on theater shaping and deterrence, or (2) eliminating regional CCMDs to improve lower-level coordination between fighting elements during war. The principal trade-off is the level of emphasis on border security and day-to-day competition relative to preparing for war with a great power. While day-to-day competition focuses on deterrence and has links to war plans through nested competition activities, the relationship is at best indirect and often difficult to measure and assess. A more direct focus on war fighting would reduce the emphasis on day-to-day competition and security cooperation. In practice, this would mean fewer partner exercises and more time spent rehearsing aspects of major plans and experimenting with emerging capabilities. Regardless of which option the Trump team pursues, the DOD would benefit from additional bureaucratic reforms to make the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) more agile, including by creating additional DSDs with command authority over CCMDs and the military services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ccmd-consolidation&quot;&gt;CCMD Consolidation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consolidating CCMDs runs contrary to the United States’ recent history of creating more CCMDs to ensure every important issue has the strongest advocate. However, these expansions effectively created grade inflation—too many issues require a four-star advocate and resolution requires the secretary of defense or president, the only individuals authorized to resolve disputes between CCDRs or task CCMDs. Thankfully, the DOD can do many things with consensus; however, consensus is rare when making trade-off decisions. Reducing the number of CCMDs has the potential to modestly reduce DOD costs and, with appropriate changes in authorities, significantly improve operational and strategic efficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/sCsLt0r.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Current Combatant Commands&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merging several CCMDs will not change the importance of each region and could recreate the past problems that drove CCMD proliferation. Therefore, consolidating CCMDs must coincide with substantial changes to authorities and culture to avoid past problems. Each CCDR needs the ability to shift resources between the problems their CCMD is responsible for, and leadership must accept that CCMDs cannot solve every problem. Reasonable consolidation could turn the current 11 CCMDs into 6, which should reduce the number of decisions the secretary needs to make and streamline meetings for the secretary and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It also would streamline key forums like the “tank”—Joint Chiefs of Staff meetings—which often include 11 combatant commanders, 6 service chiefs, the CJCS, the vice chairman, and many of the Joint Staff’s three-star principals (e.g., J2, J3, J5). The large number of senior leaders in each meeting often limits meaningful discussion, as time is needed to give every leader an opportunity to comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rn83M1Y.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: Proposed Revision of Combatant Commands&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These changes assume that consolidation can drive prioritization and integration. Larger geographic areas allow regional-oriented CCMDs to better manage assigned forces and engage partners. This regional perspective better aligns with campaigning and the use of operations, activities, and investments to deter adversaries and reassure partners. This will not significantly reduce the workforce because the CCMD will still need experts for all the issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consolidated, functionally oriented commands provide a way to compete in space and cyberspace, as well as to conduct deterrence operations in a synchronized manner. Campaign-related activities in space can be integrated with ongoing cyber campaigns to better deter or encourage specific adversary actions. The current authorities required to conduct space and cyberspace operations can be delegated to three-star commanders reporting directly to the four-star commander of STRATCOM. An alternative would be to keep nuclear-related capabilities separate and distinct but merge cyber and space capabilities. The question again is one of emphasis and prioritization, and is only answerable by the president given his understanding of security and how best to align military capabilities to advance his grand strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making this aggregated structure work requires appropriate delegation to empowered deputies. Each region or function needs a three-star deputy CCDR with the authority to direct activities within their area of responsibility. Without command authority, consolidation provides limited operational benefit. Overall, this structure supports the mission command and decentralized execution that senior military leaders routinely advocate for. Delegating most authorities and responsibilities frees the CCDR to focus on issues affecting all subordinate elements, set strategic priorities, and resolve trade-offs. The CCDR can, and should, withdraw authority when the strategic environment dictates. Three-star generals have sufficient experience and gravitas to provide command and control of daily activities for competition, lead war planning, and manage most other tasks. The military only promotes individuals to three-star general if they have the ability to manage a large organization. Four-star generals have the skills and experience for a broader focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, this approach has worked before—for example, when the EUCOM commander was responsible for Africa, Israel, and Europe. The commander quickly and efficiently adjusted headquarters efforts between these regions as the situation warranted. Prior to the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict, the EUCOM staff and the commander focused heavily on North Africa, which had the most prominent threats at the time. However, when the Israel-Lebanon conflict broke out, commander and staff time shifted rapidly to the conflict. Once the conflict ended, there were fewer priorities, operations, and CCMD decisions related to EUCOM’s responsibilities in its narrow slice of the Middle East. As a result, EUCOM resources and attention shifted quickly back to North Africa. Ironically, when AFRICOM stood up, many of the North Africa experts at EUCOM stayed in EUCOM because those experts occupied billets allocated for Middle East responsibilities. A similar reaction occurred when there was a substantial counterterrorism threat in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consolidating the National Security Agency and the Cyber, Space, and Strategic Commands will cause consternation, given that they were recently separated (in 2010 and 2019). However, that was before Space Force existed, and consolidation assumes empowering three-star leaders for each of these organizations. All of these organizations have significant interdependencies and exist in highly compartmented environments, which makes evaluating consolidation a complex but worthy task for official channels. These 3–4 missions remain paramount for the future and current fight—after all, CYBERCOM is fighting an active war every day—but U.S. three-star generals have incredible talent and can manage these issues. The United States appears to have made these commands four-star positions to emphasize their importance and improve their bureaucratic influence in an inflated bureaucracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While consolidation has the potential to allow faster decisions and adaptation to changing situations, Transportation Command (TRANSCOM) needs to remain independent. Few outside the military understand TRANSCOM’s importance because its mission is viewed by too many as boring and technocratic. However, TRANSCOM punches well above its weight; the old adage that “amateurs talk tactics, professionals talk logistics” remains true. TRANSCOM provides the professionals and clear technical advice necessary for every CCMD, Joint Staff, and secretary. Having observed many conversations about war preparations, the DOD needs a command to objectively articulate the concrete logistical trade-offs for prioritization decisions between CCMDs. Most combatant commands make value judgments based on strategy and their priorities. TRANSCOM provides the hard math regardless of the value judgment, which is probably why it houses the Joint Enabling Capabilities Command that supports every CCMD when crises strike, from nuclear plant disasters (Fukushima, Japan) to military invasions (Russia-Ukraine) to hurricanes (Katrina) to counterterrorism (Iraq). Outside professional military circles, few understand TRANSCOM, but it is a vital CCMD for managing logistics and sustainment support, as the DOD learned through the Nifty Nugget exercise in 1978. These competing interests have not changed since then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special Operations Command (SOCOM) would largely remain as is, with responsibility and authorities for global Special Operations Forces (SOF) activities and service-like responsibilities (e.g., procuring SOF-specific equipment). SOCOM would continue to work with the Joint Staff and CCMDs to ensure SOF activities advance peace-time objectives, set conditions for successful war fighting, defeat counterterrorism threats, and generally support global priorities effectively. In some cases, SOF capabilities will support lower priorities when those capabilities lack efficacy against higher priorities. Coordination with CCMDs and embassies will remain crucial to prevent conflict with other U.S. activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary advantage of consolidation, beyond headquarter reductions, is allowing CCMDs to prioritize resources against threats within their responsibility according to strategic guidance from the secretary and president. Consolidation will reduce the need for decisions by the secretary and president and free them to focus on grand strategy and global issues. This should not affect crisis response, where SecDef or POTUS will pull specific decisions up to their level—a normal and sensible reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important consolidation risk is the potential to deprioritize important tasks. Every CCMD has significant responsibilities. However, U.S. three-star generals are eminently capable of commanding large organizations if given sufficient authorities. Streamlining requires cuts somewhere. The greatest consolidation risk is even slower decisionmaking, which could occur if four-star commanders retain this authority for everything and their three-star deputies become another bureaucratic layer to traverse. Empowering three-star deputy commanders with the default authority to make all decisions except those narrowly, and explicitly, reserved to the CCDR provides the best chance to minimize this risk. Additionally, replacing four-star commands with three-star ones reduces the number of support staff and helps flatten organizational structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;global-combatant-commands&quot;&gt;Global Combatant Commands&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although consolidation could improve command and control, CCMD responsibilities are based on historical threats and technologies. Twenty-first century threats are global and do not conform to UCP boundaries. From great powers to violent extremist organizations (VEOs), threats have access to weapons and means that allow them to exploit the gaps and seams created by the current joint command arrangements. All command and control arrangements are designed to optimize the military’s ability to accomplish tasks in the most efficient and effective manner possible. Rather than optimizing for efficiency or effectiveness, the current UCP construct limits operational commanders’ ability to exploit what their units can do while forcing the secretary of defense to make tactical level deconfliction and deployment decisions. If an enemy commander responsible for the Eastern Mediterranean imposed the current boundaries on the DOD, he would receive a medal for forcing U.S. tactical commanders to coordinate between three CCMDs before acting. The current system has too many exploitable seams that U.S. adversaries actively exploit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States funds its military to fight a single major theater war at a time, but has eight theater-level headquarters, including Korea and NATO. Because of the current and projected size of the military, the United States only needs a single, dedicated four-star Operational Level command (OPCOM) to employ forces globally against an adversary. This would prevent adversaries from exploiting the seams between CCMDs, allow streamlined operational decisions, and reduce costly force structure. In this “task based” approach, all remaining four-star commanders have global “functional,” rather than regional, responsibilities. Although regional commands remain necessary, they would have narrow authority and be limited to two- or three-star peacetime “shaping” and “competition” commands that support all four-star commands as directed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These smaller regional commands would lose combatant command authority (COCOM) but would tactically employ forces provided by the Services and four-star commanders. The regional commands would have no permanently assigned forces or obligation to monitor or coordinate operational fires, maneuver and effects, etc. Using a portion of the force structure savings, the DOD would activate a four-star level Operational Level Warfighting Command, or OPCOM, in the United States to exercise command authority over any forces deployed outside the country for combat. OPCOM would be the only four-star command with the full suite of joint subordinate commands—such as a joint land component, joint maritime component, and joint air component—allowing for further cost and structure savings. The Pentagon would only employ geographic UCP boundaries with two- or three-star coordinators to meet peacetime “conditions setting” requirements; geographic UCP boundaries would have no bearing on OPCOM’s ability to employ forces or assign priorities. Regional commands consistently ask for any force available, regardless of the national strategy. Reducing the rank of regional commanders will make it easier for the Pentagon to make decisions based on long-term strategy instead of immediate, but rarely vital, crises. Four-star commanders have significantly greater ability to push the system to ignore strategic priorities for immediate demands because only an extremely busy secretary or even busier president have the authority to overrule a CCDR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An OPCOM structure will operate differently than current command constructs. In a war with the People’s Republic of China (PRC) or Russia today, U.S. forces would have difficulty attacking Russian or PRC extended lines of communication along the “Belt and Road” countries because multiple CCMDs must deconflict forces and effects. This friction may be acceptable against opponents who cannot operate with advantage in all domains, but would likely cause the United States to lose a war with the PRC or Russia. A single OPCOM would be better positioned to conduct war planning; for example, the operational design and operational art tasks of choosing where and how to use forces without bias for or against any specific region. Today’s CCMDs have an incentive to prioritize their area of responsibility first—only the Pentagon (OSD, Services, and Joint Staff) really look at the world holistically. Additionally, OPCOM’s limited responsibilities for day-to-day competition activities would allow greater focus on preparing to conduct combined, joint all-domain conflict under the toughest conditions. Today, immediate competition requirements often, and appropriately, pull the focus of CCMDs from the important but longer-term war-planning and preparation activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This OPCOM construct would likely require another nation to fulfill the four-star Supreme Allied Commander Europe role that the EUCOM commander holds today. While it would be difficult, it would not be impossible to reassume the role during a major theater war if a NATO nation were attacked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving to lesser threats, a three-star Joint Task Force (JFT) could likely handle most situations. A JTF built around the 5th Fleet could likely handle a conflict with Iran given Iran’s lack of global capabilities. Similarly, a three-star JTF supporting South Korea’s armed forces should be sufficient until the PRC or Russia become significantly involved, which OPCOM could address. Special Operations Command has sufficient capabilities to deal with the long-term and acute threats from violent extremist organizations while existing O6-O9 tactical headquarters could form the core of a JTF to handle other unforeseen contingencies short of a great power conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to streamlined command and control, the OPCOM approach’s primary advantage is improved resilience. Moving operational command and control to the United States would fully leverage the nuclear shield against long-range strikes and provide the National Command Authority additional distance to determine the extent of a U.S. commitment with less concern for U.S. forces in immediate contact with a threat. These changes would also free senior leadership to focus on strategy and not referee CCMD requests for forces and reclamas. Additionally, this would reduce requirements for service component commands because there would be less need for regional combatant commanders to receive advice on service force employment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the major benefit is a single command focused on fighting a global war. A single command would, by definition, be better placed to fight the way emerging joint concepts, including the Joint Warfighting Concept and Joint All-Domain Operations, imagine. This command could rapidly synchronize pulse attacks across domains and, given longer weapons ranges and space and cyber effects that are less fixed to terrestrial geography, quickly shift priorities. The command could better align smaller JTFs dynamically stood up to seize local opportunities, for example targeting People’s Liberation Army (PLA) terrestrial space assets outside of China like downlink stations and space ports, and manage a global blockade designed to limit the flow of resources to Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are disadvantages to this proposal as well. Reducing the role of the regional commanders would likely create perception of regional disinterest since the change would be perceived and portrayed as a retreat back to “Fortress America.” Maintaining the subject matter experts in the middle ranks (military and civilian) should limit the loss of regional expertise. Such a move would also require a substantial culture change in the U.S. military, which has operated with the current model since the 1980s—a period longer than the careers of nearly all serving military officers. A final challenge would be blending the new structure into existing alliance relationships such as Europe and South Korea, where the U.S. regional commander holds a coalition leadership role. However, this last challenge also provides a potential opportunity if the United States wants to lower its costs for supporting international alliances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;aligning-the-national-security-enterprise&quot;&gt;Aligning the National Security Enterprise&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside fundamental changes to the UCP, reorganizing the OSD without growing the overall staff size could address concerns CCDRs, their staffs, and the National Security Council frequently raise about slow DOD decisionmaking. Currently, approximately 16 individuals report directly to the secretary and 19 individuals report directly to the sole deputy secretary. Importantly, the secretary must approve any dispute between CCDRs, even over a single military dog team. The secretary’s span of control is far too large, which forces him to make too many decisions and creates an unacceptably slow decisionmaking process. Providing the secretary with three empowered deputy secretaries, in the chain of command, provides the best way to mitigate this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/oIcwTlV.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3: Revised DOD Organization Chart Without Deputy Secretaries.&lt;/strong&gt; Note: The chart shows a potential DOD organization structure without additional deputy secretaries and streamlined to six combatant commands. In this structure, all conflicts between combatant commanders or service secretaries require secretary involvement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/w6PQTMS.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4: Revised DOD Organization Chart With Deputy Secretaries.&lt;/strong&gt; Note: The chart shows a potential DOD organization structure with deputy secretaries and six combatant commands. The secretary only needs to resolve conflict between services and combatant commands or around issues over which he chooses to retain all decisionmaking authority.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current OSD staff capacity can produce far more decision memos than the secretary can review and act upon. For example, the secretary ordered a CCMD to make an adjustment in a meeting coordinated and attended by the office of one of this report’s authors. However, the CCMD staff refused to follow the secretary’s clear verbal guidance to their commander and the OSD staff until they received official written guidance from the secretary himself to “prevent miscommunication,” which wasted several weeks and hundreds of staff hours. Having deputy secretaries who can task service secretaries, CCDRs, and agency heads would substantially mitigate this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One DSD could be responsible for current operations and make decisions when CCMDs disagree. A DSD for future operations could lead the services to manage trade-offs between services while overseeing service manning, training, and equipping functions. Service needs and CCMD needs would still come into conflict, but the two DSDs would be able to consolidate current and future issues to make a clearer decision for the secretary. More importantly, a DSD focused on the services would provide a stronger service perspective in many senior decision forums. A third DSD could have authority over major issues affecting the defense enterprise, such as finances, auditing, and the information technology backbone.1 Ideally, this DSD could focus on upgrading and streamlining the DOD’s information technology to improve productivity across the department. The OSD already has offices and staff that cover these issues, but few decisionmakers. Although assistant secretaries of defense (ASD) and under secretaries of defense (USD) are 4-star equivalents who have influence, they reside outside the chain of command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than the current system, where the services control the vast majority of funding, each DSD should control a portion of the overall budget established by the secretary. This would enhance the secretary’s influence over the budget and help encourage trade-offs between services for similar mission functions. Additionally, this construct would provide a stronger pathway for CCMDs to advocate for funding of near-term priorities. This should include providing CCMDs with a method to “bid” to use extant forces while providing a clear market signal for what CCMDs truly value. These adjustments also enhance the secretary’s power by pushing less important decisions to empowered DSDs, which would allow the secretary more time to focus on major strategic issues, such as determining how to apportion funding between current and future priorities and any other issues the secretary prioritizes. When the secretary takes on a major issue, like Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles, the DSDs can keep everything else moving. Overall, adding two DSDs and empowering them should substantially improve the benefits of CCMD consolidation without adding large additional staffs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States is entering a new era of great power competition that demands more than marginal reform—it requires a new map. The current UCP reflects the world as it was, not as it is becoming. Designed for the post–Cold War moment and stretched to address everything from terrorism to near-peer rivalry, the combatant command structure has become a bureaucratic labyrinth. Each node—each four-star billet—fights for attention, resources, and relevance. Instead of generating clarity, the system multiplies friction. If Washington wants to win in the era of systems warfare and strategic competition, it must reimagine the machinery of defense—starting with the architecture of command. The recommendations that follow aim to generate more flexible options for national leadership, rebalance the relationship between current operations and future force design, and create an institutional structure that can think, compete, and adapt at the speed of relevance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the DOD should significantly reduce the number of four-star CCMDs and broaden the responsibilities of each four-star commander. The CCMDs give greater emphasis to their specific problems; however, the proliferation of “priority” problems has created an arms race for bureaucratic power instead of improved prioritization and subject matter expertise on each issue. Consolidating the CCMDs into three regional commands and three functional commands provides the best first step. These consolidated CCMDs should have additional budgeting authority to purchase munitions or commercially available solutions that do not create a long-term sustainment bills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the secretary or Congress should create a deputy secretary of defense (DSD) who is in the chain of command for all of the Combatant Commands (largely current operations focused) and another who is in the chain of command for all of the services (largely future focused). Each of these DSDs would have budgetary responsibilities for the entities they are responsible for. The primary purpose of these DSDs would be resolving disputes between CCMDs or Services in accordance with secretary and presidential guidance. Today, there are too many four-star commanders with appropriately different priorities that the secretary must adjudicate. The system generally works well for important and urgent problems, but all other decisions move at a glacial pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the options outlined in this paper require immediate attention by an interagency planning team to assess their viability. This team could—within 60 days—offer concise recommendations for the next UCP. If the DOD has more time, then a more sustained, deliberate effort should be undertaken by a mix of think tanks and federally funded research and development centers to ensure that the secretary has access to a broad range of perspectives, as well as insights from war games, that can inform the FY 2027 NDAA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, the interagency team should also confront one of the most overlooked barriers to strategic coherence: the fact that the Department of State and the Department of Defense use different maps to see the world. This is not just a bureaucratic artifact—it is a strategic liability. When diplomats and war fighters operate on mismatched regional boundaries, they create seams that adversaries can exploit and that allies find confusing. The result is a series of missed opportunities and diminishing marginal returns in everything from security assistance to crisis response. If the United States wants to operate as a truly integrated state actor in a contested world, it needs to align its cartography. Harmonizing these maps would enhance interagency planning, create shared mental models, and help forge more coherent campaigns that blend defense and diplomacy across regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reforming the Unified Command Plan is a way to support the Trump administration’s desire for a smaller, more focused federal government and national security enterprise. However, such an effort should rest on interagency coordination and rigorous analysis, including ideas outlined in this report and past work completed in accordance with the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2022. This report provides a starting point for discussion and analysis, not a final answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The designers of the current UCP faced a different international situation, a different range of threats, different communication tools, and a different speed of events. Today, the U.S. administration anticipates a need to shift U.S. grand strategy to be more agile and efficient while also better aligning with changing international conditions. Administration officials have clearly signaled a desire to lower international commitments today to preserve and expand economic strength for a potential great power conflict with the PRC tomorrow. This “reordering” of national strategy will create the largest change in the international system since 1945. Fewer resources will also require the DOD to do less with less on a daily basis. Therefore, the DOD must operate differently so it can rapidly adjust training and operations as the international situation and presidential priorities change. Operating differently requires an updated military command structure to effectively use the resources the American people have given the DOD. As U.S. national strategy evolves, the military instrument must adapt to support that strategy if it is going to meet the moment. Form should always follow function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 12 May 2025, the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) announced its decision to dissolve and end its armed struggle against the Turkish state. The announcement followed the PKK’s 12th Congress, held from May 5 to 7 in northern Iraq, and came after a February call from the group’s imprisoned leader, Abdullah Öcalan, who urged the organization to lay down arms. This followed an unexpected call by right-wing nationalist leader and government coalition partner, Devlet Bahceli, who in October last year suggested that Öcalan could be granted parole if he renounced violence and disbanded the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the group’s statement, the PKK’s struggle “brought the Kurdish issue to the point of resolution through democratic politics . . . As a result, activities carried out under the name “PKK” were formally terminated.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ending the four decades-long armed conflict, the disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration (DDR) process now expected to take place in the coming months is conceptually straightforward, yet translating this into practice in post-conflict settings is fraught with complexities. Recent trends in comparative counterinsurgency and DDR studies offer some insight into the challenges and strategic opportunities that may lie head for Turkey but will also serve as an important case study to inform future counterterrorism efforts and wider US and UK interests in the region. Comparative cases demonstrate that success can vary significantly based on local conditions and levels of political will across stakeholders. The interplay between DDR and peacebuilding processes with longer political horizons is also a factor, when it promotes legal reforms that can address the root causes behind the conflict and avoid a relapse into violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 12 May announcement does not explicitly outline a roadmap for the laying down of weapons, rather, it references disbandment, and the end of armed struggle in favour of the beginning of a new phase of democratic political struggle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkish media reported that the PKK has around 3,500 members in northern Iraq. Fighters are expected to hand over their weapons to designated verification centres as Ankara works with Baghdad and Erbil to oversee the process. It is expected that this will also include a phased withdrawal of the PKK from its controlled areas in Iraq, such as Qandil, Gara, Sinjar, and Makmur, in a process coordinated by Turkey’s National Intelligence Organization (MIT) and Armed Forces. Media reports suggest that around 100 senior leaders may be sent to third countries, while around 2,000 members without active arrest warrants or egregious criminal records are expected to return to Turkey, where they will be subject to prosecution under counterterrorism laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kurdish conflict presents a complex case for the effective prosecution of DDR. An examination of other international conflict resolution and DDR processes highlight three potentially complicating factors in relation to the PKK, a designated terror organisation by Turkey, the US, UK and European Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the PKK has overseen a transnational conflict involving national and subnational dynamics in Turkey, Iraq, Syria and Iran. This distinguishes it from most other post-conflict DDR processes since the late 1980s, such as those in Mozambique (1992), Liberia (2003) Nepal (2006), and Colombia (2016), which came in the aftermath of mainly internal conflicts. The protracted civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) stands out as having transnational dimensions with DDR processes explicitly dealing with regional fighters. The Sierra Leone-Liberia DDR efforts were also deeply intertwined regionally, given the cross-border flows of combatants. Conflicts with transnational dimensions are more complex and harder to resolve than purely internal or bilateral conflicts. However, the number of fighters to be demobilised is relatively small compared with other cases, rendering a successful outcome more likely. By comparison, around 70,000 fighters from different rebel factions were demobilised by the international community in Sierra Leone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the PKK’s origins and evolution as mainly an armed self-determination actor will influence the trajectory of its political transition. The organisation’s stated ideology has undergone significant pragmatic shifts – from its roots as a separatist movement in the late 1970s, to seeking autonomy in the 1990s and 2000s, and now, in its current phase, advocating for democratization within the state’s existing borders. Post-conflict-transitions involving actors with some form of self-determination-claims have shown the need to address wider demands for political reform beyond DDR to achieve stability and avoid recidivism. A Marxist-Leninist organisation at its inception, the PKK’s ranks are filled with fighters that undergo strict ideological training, practice martyrdom culture, and valorise a cult of personality around Ocalan. The concept of “devoted actors” within armed-conflict- and rebel-group-studies suggest that fighters motivated by deeply held, non-negotiable commitments to the organisation’s cause may either resist demobilisation or struggle with reintegration processes unless there are targeted policies to “flip” allegiance or facilitate a transition to non-violent forms of political contestation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, relevant conflict resolution and terrorism scholarship argues that the way in which conflict comes to an end can influence the sustainability of the transition and stabilisation phase. In the modern era, terrorist groups have typically ended through hybrid policy instruments, including military force, reduced public support, disruption of illicit financing, and diplomatic pressure on external sponsors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;terrorism-termination-and-democratisation&quot;&gt;Terrorism Termination and Democratisation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ankara views the dissolution of the PKK as the outcome of the state’s military victory in line with its security doctrine, intelligence gathering and counterterrorism strategy, which meant the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) narrowed the PKK’s area of action and operational capabilities in the Qandil mountain range and territory in northern Iraq. However, some within the PKK movement, including Murat Karayilan, a co-founder and a top commander, have interpreted the decision differently. He recently claimed that the PKK had not been defeated militarily, that the PKK had new war tactics and had developed its technological capabilities. While denouncing armed struggle, Karayilan said laying down weapons was contingent on the Turkish state codifying legal guarantees. Should this narrative gain traction among the PKK’s rank and supporters, it may undermine the level of commitment to disarmament protocols.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the explanations cited for the decline or termination of terrorist groups is the achievement of the group’s aims. However, following the collapse of the two-year ceasefire in mid-2015 and the return to armed violence in Turkey’s southeast, the PKK failed to achieve its aim after taking a maximalist posture and unilaterally declaring autonomy across several towns and villages. Turkish special police and gendarmerie forces carried out a counter-insurgency operation. The PKK intensified its attacks, and the violence reportedly resulted in more than 3,800 reported fatalities in 2016. Turkey’s security doctrine intensified following this phase in the conflict with increased cross-border air operations inside northern Iraq – codenamed Claw (2019), Claw-Lightning and Claw-Thunderbolt (2021), and Claw-Lock (2022) – that systematically targeted PKK infrastructure. Turkey also conducted military operations since 2016 inside northern Syria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the PKK’s armed insurgency aimed at establishing autonomous areas inside Turkey failed operationally, the group lost public legitimacy, and it retreated geographically from Turkey into areas of control in northern Iraq, where it became vulnerable to Turkish airpower campaigns and drone strikes. While there is scepticism among some in Turkey about the PKK’s long-term intentions, even after disbanding, the organisation’s failure to achieve its core aim – and its shift away from autonomy demands now – combined with the assessment that it is militarily weaker than it has been are factors that may enhance the likelihood of success for the current process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, there are concerns that the PKK’s self-declared “disbandment” may mean different things to different actors. Since the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime, the situation on the ground in Syria has been shifting rapidly. These changes have created opportunities for the PKK’s announced disbandment and for advancing the “Terror-Free Türkiye” process. However, Turkey’s position is that the PKK’s Syrian offshoot, People’s Protection Units (YPG), the armed unit of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), must equally heed Ocalan’s call to disband. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said the declaration should apply to all PKK-affiliated groups: “We consider this announcement to encompass all of the organization’s branches, including those in northern Iraq, Syria and Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to the PKK’s formal announcement, the SDF commander Mazloum Abdi welcomed the move as a step towards a “new political and peaceful process in the region,” Consistent with his long-standing position that the SDF is a distinct entity, his message implied that his forces were not bound by the PKK’s decision. On 19 May, the Kurdistan Free Life Party (PJAK), the Iranian offshoot of the PKK announced that it would not disarm despite the decision of its parent organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This apparent contradiction risks undermining the wider process unless it is resolved through a negotiated settlement. Nonetheless, two cost-benefit calculations enhance Ankara’s commitment to effective implementation of the PKK’s disarmament. First, the dissolution of the PKK marks a historic milestone, bringing an end to an organisation that primarily targeted the Turkish state and the conclusion of a costly four-decade-long counter-terrorism campaign. Second, Ankara anticipates that the YPG-SDF will be incorporated into the Syrian central army and state institutions, with Turkey coordinating this integration with the Ankara-friendly interim government in Damascus. The extent to which the PKK’s disarmament and demobilisation process succeeds in the coming months will likely positively influence the integration of the SDF into the Syrian state-building process as a recognised and legitimate actor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unresolved questions over how the PKK’s disbanding will impact the SDF in Syria is fuelling scepticism among some in Turkey that the outlawed militant organisation may gradually evolve under a different banner. Related to this is that PKK-linked splinter groups may operate in north-eastern Syria or Iraq, perhaps under Iranian patronage, particularly if power vacuums or ungovernable spaces emerge. Ankara can be expected to monitor activities in Kurdish-run areas in north-eastern Syria and the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) and reserve the right to take military action against PKK remnants. This, however, would risk undermining stabilisation efforts in Syria and Iraq, underscoring the importance of a successful and verified disarmament process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen how the disarmament process will interface with democratisation outcomes in Turkey. What renders this case complex is that the disbandment decision arrived without a negotiated settlement or peace agreement, rather, constitutional reforms in Turkey are expected to be debated in parliament follow disarmament. On 27 May, a team of legal experts was appointed to work on a new constitution. The legal framework for managing the DDR process, along with the anticipated pro-democracy reforms, faces significant challenges as Turkish lawmakers navigate this uncharted territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PKK’s announcement of its intention to dissolve marks a pivotal moment in the protracted conflict and will have implications for peacebuilding in Turkey, Iraq and Syria. However, the current moment is a liminal one, throwing up dilemmas from the perspective of post-insurgency politics given uncertainties about how the reintegration phase will be implemented. And this is the part of the DDR process that is being discussed the least. How ex-fighters that may receive amnesty, for example, will integrate and select to pursue political goals will impact Turkey’s wider political system and carry consequences for prospects for democratisation. Conversely, prosecuting those who committed crimes and abuses during the conflict may lend greater legitimacy to the process and promote democratic principles. It is important to support policies that balance various grievances within the broader polity in Turkey and do so under parliamentary oversight, broad based political buy-in, and transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-sdr-is-released-from-purgatory&quot;&gt;The SDR is Released from Purgatory&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The much-discussed UK Strategic Defence Review (SDR) has recently been subject to a wearingly familiar succession of leaks and speculation, and now appears likely to be published in the week of 2 June. Through its gestation, the review has been dogged by concerns about delays caused by the changing global context, the level of its ambition, and the extent to which the government’s commitment on spending 2.5% of GDP would be enough to address the issues in Defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the review was in its research phase, a trio of distinguished former UK officials set out a framework against which to judge it. Now the results of the review are imminent, how might it be read, and what should be examined as measures of success or challenge when it eventually sees the public light of day? In particular, how might its level of ambition for the “transformation” of the UK’s Armed Forces be judged?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;schrodingers-review&quot;&gt;Schrodinger’s Review&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first area on which to evaluate the review is the manner of its presentation, particularly in its conclusions. The review is unusual in it is notionally independent, delivered by Lord Robertson as part of a trio of senior figures (Dr Fiona Hill and retired General Richard Barrons the other two), alongside a number of external experts and specialists, supported but not directed by a secretariat in the Ministry of Defence (MOD). They had free rein to make suggestions and propose ideas to change Defence, albeit they also have terms of reference – including a budget ceiling – within which to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These constrained the review, as did limited capacity (albeit bolstered by artificial intelligence summarising the thousands of submissions), but in the final analysis this should be a review less encumbered than previously by inter-service politics or the orthodoxy of the MOD. However, if media reporting is accurate, we can infer it was largely finished some time ago, but has been delayed until now by wrangling over how to implement it, what this means for the MOD’s finances, and how to present the subsequent work the MOD will need to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was always the danger inherent in picking an independent team but running the review on behalf of the MOD: it could present politically difficult options. It is not feasible to only publish part of it, and cherry-picking will be obvious, leaving the alternative of watering it down. But if the report’s authors are lukewarm over the final results, or step away entirely, it will undermine its intellectual case, and lead to doubt about the government’s seriousness in approaching the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A completely independent review would not need government “sign-off” or “approval” from the Treasury. Of course, the Government might not have liked the conclusions, but much like a report from a Select Committee, a government response could have then applied budgetary realism or an alternative perspective and then engaged in the resulting open and (hopefully) educational public debate about priorities. Instead, we are left with something like “Schrodinger’s Review”: both independent and dependent at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategy-requires-making-choices-and-compromises&quot;&gt;Strategy Requires Making Choices and Compromises&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second area for judgement is its utility as a “strategic” document and whether the SDR is trying to be “a” strategy or not. If so, it should be read as an attempt to achieve the cliched but necessary balancing of “ends, ways, and means” for Defence: determining the purpose of the Armed Forces, how they should go about their business, and with what resources (inside a ceiling dictated to the authors).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The signs for this are not positive at the moment, given the previously-mentioned delay for discussions in the interval between the SDR’s conclusion and its publication. The terms for the review talk about prioritisation of objectives, investments and activity, which certainly sounds like important components for a strategy. But more recently, the Permanent Secretary of the MOD appeared to suggest details around investment decisions might not appear until the autumn in a separate, MOD-authored document, not least because the MOD is still trying to work out the shape of the revised Equipment Plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be fair, it would be unreasonable to expect this work to both review all of Defence and perform the function of an MOD Budget Cycle in its totality. But given the challenges to the current structures and capabilities of the military, if it can’t even approach the level of detail of recent reviews in relation to capability choices (e.g. the 2010 and 2015 proposed future forces) then there is a danger it becomes too aspirational to be useful (or more cynically, too vague for the MOD to be held to account against it). We should therefore expect a “strategic” review to be about prioritisation, assumptions and guidance for choices. This is also where it is possible to judge the ambition and scope of the review’s conclusions, particularly on the use of technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;money-alone-is-not-transformational&quot;&gt;Money Alone is Not Transformational&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This immediately brings up the most obvious cause for any caution about the short-term impact of the review. The spending target of 2.5% of GDP (which we now learn will also include money being spent to “lease” Diego Garcia, albeit as a tiny fraction (0.2%) of the Defence Budget) is not so significant an increase as to be genuinely “transformational” – at least, not given the current state of the Armed Forces. To be transformational, it will need to cut and significantly reshape the Armed Forces by taking risk in some areas to transform others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boost of several billion pounds a year should probably first be used to fill gaps: in ammunition and other weapons stockpiles; in infrastructure and housing; logistics and support functions; and in support to personnel conditions, pay and recruitment. To make radical, rather than incremental additions to military capability (for example in order to take advantage of new technologies) will therefore require some big choices on early retirement of capabilities or reductions in numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defence has been here before in terms of the promise of new capabilities being presaged by the early loss of others due to budget pressure: the cuts of November 2024 were just such a case and given the modest savings made over five years, were an indicator of just how tight in-year finances are at the MOD. Before that, the Integrated Review and related Defence Command Paper both promised investment in “advanced technologies” would improve the forces – after a number of “legacy systems” were cut to make room. We have had years of talk of “sunset and sunrise capabilities” but rather than a planned and managed transition from older forces to new, the UK has instead been left with an eclectic mix of the cutting-edge sitting uneasily alongside the obsolete – for which replacements are often late, or, where weapons upgrades lag, new capabilities find their potential limited. This was not the planned “high-low mix” as part of an “integrated force” we were promised, but a classic British attempt to muddle through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implementation-needs-to-move-beyond-experimentation&quot;&gt;Implementation Needs to Move Beyond Experimentation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is here the SDR could make a major mark. Never mind quibbling over the sufficiency of the 148 Challenger 3 tanks the UK will eventually have by 2030: given the experience of Ukraine does the SDR believe tanks have a future as currently envisaged? Are the Army’s expensive attack helicopters still worth it in a world where the front line is increasingly dominated by drone threats? If, as reported, the Navy wants to radically increase the number of uncrewed vessels for a variety of tasks, should it still be developing large surface combatants, and what role is envisaged for the aircraft carriers? And in air and space, might future surveillance capabilities be better provided by stealthy drones and space-based sensors rather than large, slow, vulnerable crewed aircraft such as the E-7 Wedgetail?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has talked a good game on experimentation and trials, including on artificial intelligence (AI) and directed-energy weapons, but these have yet to translate into large-scale production of any new capabilities operating outside of niche organisations. New processes and structures such as a Defence Innovation Unit, and an Integrated Procurement Model are being introduced, but will take time to show their worth: the MOD already had an innovation unit alongside other innovation centres, and the IPM’s acceleration of the DragonFire laser weapon came after it had already spent seven years being developed. At least the recent announcement of the new StormShroud drone coming into service represents the first major implementation of the RAF’s Autonomous Collaborative Platforms Strategy and is a significant improvement on the RAF’s over-hyped “drone squadron” which spent several years without conducting a drone trial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ambitious-targets-for-change-are-needed&quot;&gt;Ambitious Targets for Change Are Needed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SDR could help by making clear where the big bets could be made on technology – and where cold water needs to be poured on ideas that represent a triumph of optimism over reality. It could identify where “legacy” items have outlived their usefulness and where technological solutions will enhance existing capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, it should identify where mass and depth remain vital to the creation of effective fighting power: the inexorable reduction of force sizes combined with the increasing cost of systems is unsustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some advice on where either the expansion of forces and stockpiles are required, or acceptance of limitations will be necessary alongside collaboration with allies and partners. On this last point, there should be some consideration of how to survive friction in the critical relationship with the US; a complete break is in neither’s interests, and tremendously expensive but given the unique extent of the UK’s intertwining with the US military – and thus its vulnerabilities – some additional insulation is required if the US is less reliable or (not unreasonably) expects a more prominent role for Europe in its own security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do all this it may be necessary to set ambitious, and crucially, measurable targets. For example, what proportion of RAF combat aircraft should be uncrewed and by what year should this target be achieved? What functions in the Royal Navy should be handed over to remote or autonomous systems, and by when? The Army has reportedly already identified a target for the proportion of its combat power to be provided by traditional crewed capabilities (20%), reusable uncrewed capabilities (40%), and disposable drones (40%). But it is not yet clear how this metric is calculated, and it is hard to believe the first category will only comprise a fifth of total budget or firepower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other goals could be about testing the Defence Secretary’s claim that the UK will be at the leading edge of innovation on AI; for example, the widescale adoption of AI to complete all initial analysis of imagery, thus accelerating intelligence analysis, or the use of software to do initial operational estimates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Targets matter: although similar targets in the US have been missed, as has been pointed out, the fact they existed created a benchmark against which some aspects of modernisation could be measured. The statement by the Chief of the General Staff that he intends to double the Army’s combat power within three years is exactly the sort of target that focusses minds and could potentially be useful if they appear in the SDR, and can be measured (in this case defined as a brigade being capable of defeating a Russian Combined Arms Army).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if the MOD disagrees with these, for example, because it has a different understanding of the risks, or the speed at which technology might develop, then it should be asked to set out its own analysis, such as the probability AI smarter than people (Artificial General Intelligence) will arrive, the point at which this becomes more likely than not, and if never then why. The briefing this week that the MOD will develop a “Digital Targeting Web” to be in service in 2027 is a decent start, though if it is learning lessons from what Ukraine has been doing since 2022, and uses technology already available, is this fast enough?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this is to suggest the SDR should purely focus on being a technologist’s manifesto. It also needs to make judgements on the state of the UK’s industrial base, and effective use of the UK’s reserves, amongst many other issues. We have not even mentioned the expense of the nuclear deterrent, its longevity and other options to improve deterrence in Europe. But many of the developments in UK Defence since the end of the Cold War have inevitably justified shrinking forces on the back of more advanced capabilities. Given we are now seeing the speed of adaptation and counter-measures in the war in Ukraine, it is reasonable to ask how this review will cut through the hype and myths and make concrete recommendations, using its independence to force change at a pace the MOD has been unable to demonstrate on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April 2025, the Sanctions and Illicit Finance Monitoring and Analysis Network (SIFMANet), led by RUSI’s Centre for Finance and Security (CFS) in partnership with the Democracy Development Foundation (DDF), convened a multistakeholder roundtable in Yerevan, Armenia. The session brought together key representatives from Armenian public institutions, financial authorities, civil society and international partners to assess the country’s response to mounting geopolitical pressures, the enforcement of sanctions frameworks, and the vulnerabilities posed by illicit financial flows and electoral financing ahead of the 2026 parliamentary elections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roundtable was supplemented by a series of bilateral engagements and one-on-one consultations with representatives from Armenian commercial banks, the Ministry of Justice, investigative journalists, youth groups, diplomats and international think tanks. These discussions provided further detail and contextual depth. This report integrates insights gathered from all formats of engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with previous SIFMANet roundtables across the EU and its neighbourhood, the Yerevan meeting offered a platform for candid, off-the-record discussions among senior officials from the Central Bank of Armenia (CBA), the State Revenue Committee, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, civil society organisations (CSOs), private sector representatives, and compliance professionals. The dialogue was informed by Armenia’s evolving geopolitical situation, including its close historical and economic ties with Russia and Iran, ongoing regional instability, and the increased scrutiny brought about by Western sanctions regimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report synthesises the insights collected during the Yerevan roundtable and associated meetings, highlighting Armenia’s institutional innovations in sanctions compliance, the limitations posed by structural and political challenges, and the role of public–private coordination. Additionally, it identifies emerging risks in political financing, including the potential misuse of cryptocurrency and foreign-linked funding channels. These discussions have important implications not only for Armenia but also for neighbouring jurisdictions seeking to strike a balance between maintaining financial openness and safeguarding national integrity against malign financial influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;armenias-sanctions-landscape&quot;&gt;Armenia’s Sanctions Landscape&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;geopolitical-and-economic-context&quot;&gt;Geopolitical and Economic Context&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armenia’s geopolitical position presents a unique and multifaceted set of challenges, shaped by its limited open borders, unresolved conflicts with neighbouring countries, and a small, trade-dependent economy. These conditions present an operational challenge in imposing G7 sanctions on Russia. Participants underscored the Armenian government’s proactive stance in harmonising with Western sanctions frameworks (for example, introducing Government Decree 808-N), despite economic dependencies and regional dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armenia’s foreign policy is multi-vector and seeks to reconcile relations with global powers and neighbouring countries. The strategy has been strained due to continuous war with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh, which has caused long-term displacement and regional instability. In addition, Armenia’s diplomatic relations with Turkey remain frozen due to Turkey’s support for Azerbaijan, and while there have been cautious efforts at dialogue, deep-rooted tensions continue to limit Armenia’s broader diplomatic and geopolitical outreach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closely linked to the aftermath of the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, Armenia’s relationship with Iran has gone through meaningful change, evolving into a more strategic partnership. Participants highlighted key initiatives strengthening this cooperation, including the construction of the 7.2-km Kajaran tunnel, part of the international North–South Road Corridor, and several other major infrastructure projects. According to a diplomatic representative, while these ties benefit Armenia and Iran, they also align with Russia’s political interests, potentially complicating Armenia’s efforts to deepen cooperation with the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These dynamics demonstrate the complexity of Armenia’s foreign relations, particularly in the context of its enduring alliance with Russia – a key strategic partner with ties spanning the military, political, economic and energy sectors. Participants noted that Armenia’s continued membership in regional alliances such as the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), the Commonwealth of Independent States, and the Collective Security Treaty Organization highlights the continuing depth of its institutional and geopolitical ties with Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 had a significant impact on Armenia’s economic ties with Moscow. Participants indicated that Armenia’s economy witnessed a significant acceleration, expanding by 12.6% in 2022 and sustaining a strong momentum, with 8.3% growth in 2023, before moderating to 5.9% in 2024. During this period, participants also highlighted the considerable expansion of trade with Russia – Armenia’s largest trading partner – which increased nearly fivefold from $2.6 billion in 2021 to $12.4 billion in 2024. It was brought up during the discussion, however, that this rapid growth has sparked apprehensions that Armenia may increasingly serve as a transshipment hub for goods subject to international sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid this rising scrutiny, participants mentioned that there has been a parallel surge in misinformation and disinformation targeting Armenia. Hostile foreign actors have been spreading false narratives, suggesting that Armenia is facilitating the circumvention of international sanctions. A representative from the Ministry of Justice stressed that these claims are unfounded, but they represent a considerable danger to Armenia’s global reputation. If left unchallenged, the representative noted, these claims could deter foreign investment and further complicate the country’s economic outlook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To counter these challenges, Armenia has taken visible steps to illustrate its dedication to sanctions compliance. This has most prominently been accomplished through its financial sector. Representatives of the CBA suggested that Russia-owned VTB Bank and Iran’s Bank Mellat have been sanctioned. These banks are no longer connected to international networks such as Visa and Mastercard or US dollar transactions, and Armenian banks no longer have correspondent relations with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these actions fulfil formal compliance obligations, participants noted that legacy financial ties, particularly through remittances and cross-border transactions, continue to pose systemic risks. Armenia’s large diaspora in Russia, estimated at over 2.5 million people, is instrumental in sustaining financial flows between the two countries. A representative from the Ministry of Economy acknowledged that although remittances can be processed through a wide range of commercial banks operating in Armenia, other Russia-linked channels – informal, alternative, or non-sanctioned ones – still remain faster and more accessible, making them the preferred option for many in the diaspora. This reliance, however, has increasingly come into tension with Armenia’s sanctions commitments. As a CBA representative explained, Armenia has had to discontinue several widely used services to remain compliant with international obligations. One prominent example is “Unistream”, a Russia-based money transfer platform heavily used by the diaspora, which ceased operations in Armenia following US sanctions. In response to such disruptions, Armenian authorities are now working to identify alternative channels that strike a balance between accessibility and compliance with evolving international standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parallel to Russia-related concerns, Armenia’s increasing economic and trade relations with Iran pose concerns in the West about sanctions compliance. This is especially heightened by a new agreement between the EAEU and Iran. A private sector representative pointed out that the agreement is expected to streamline customs procedures, facilitate expanded trade and support the development of regional infrastructure aligned with member states’ economic interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Armenia remains committed to adhering to international sanctions frameworks. A representative from the CBA said that the country’s sanctions compliance efforts continue to meet international expectations. Recently, Armenia’s interagency working group reviewed the updated US National Security Presidential Memorandum (NSM-2), which provides guidance on reassessing licences involving Iranian entities. A CBA representative noted that while no violations have been identified within Armenia’s financial sector to date, this has been attributed to proactive derisking measures by Armenian banks, especially since most high-risk Iranian actors are already subject to UN sanctions. Nonetheless, the NSM-2’s broader implications for sectors beyond finance are still being assessed by the Armenian government, who are awaiting further engagement with US authorities to clarify the scope of enforcement and reassessments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sanctions compliance becomes increasingly important for Armenia as the country seeks to strengthen its ties with the EU and the US. Participants highlighted several key initiatives that have strengthened Armenia’s relations with the EU, including the Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement. They also noted that the Council of the European Union welcomed the European Commission’s decision in 2024 to initiate a visa liberalisation dialogue with Armenia. In early 2025, Armenia took another significant step in its foreign policy by signing a Strategic Partnership Charter with the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this political and diplomatic pivot toward the West, participants noted a stark disconnect on the economic front. While Russia continues to dominate Armenia’s foreign direct investments, Western countries have yet to make a significant economic impact. No major projects from the EU or the US have matched the scale of investments from Russia or Iran, which continue to act swiftly in executing their strategies in Armenia. Armenia has made efforts to diversify its investment sources; however, these gaps remain a persistent challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;export-control-the-linchpin-of-armenias-sanctions-enforcement-model&quot;&gt;Export Control: The Linchpin of Armenia’s Sanctions Enforcement Model&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armenia’s membership in the EAEU is making it difficult for the country to impose G7 sanctions on Russia. The free movement of goods and services among the EAEU member states provides potential avoidance of sanctions as the sanctioned goods can easily go through Armenia and other EAEU member states. This poses a challenge for Armenia to prevent sanctioned goods from flowing into Russia, reducing the efficacy of the sanctions and bringing into question Armenia’s role in facilitating such trade flows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants emphasised that to address these challenges, sanctions compliance needs to be imposed at various levels in Armenia. They explained how responsibilities are shared among competent institutions. The CBA plays a key role in supervising financial institutions and in implementing compliance with sanctions, particularly in detecting and preventing suspicious financial transactions. The State Revenue Committee is responsible for overseeing the licensing process, and the Ministry of Economy enables the support to business subjects, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, to comply with requirements. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs plays a key role in coordinating policy and diplomatic cooperation with foreign counterparts to ensure Armenia’s compliance with international sanctions frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reinforce sanctions enforcement mechanisms, the CBA has also greatly improved its enforcement function. CBA members clarified that, in the absence of binding sanctions law, the bank has adopted internal compliance rules and heightened supervisory control through the use of audits. Risk-based guidance tools in compliance with Office of Foreign Assets Control standards have been distributed to financial institutions, supplementing sanctions screening procedures. The CBA has also strengthened its engagement with correspondent banks to maintain Armenia’s link to the international financial system as derisking pressures remain on the rise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attempting to circumvent sanctions is classified as a criminal offence under Armenian law, according to participants. During the discussion, attendees referred to the legal framework and noted that at the core of Armenia’s sanctions compliance framework is the Law on Control of Export and Interstate Transit of Dual-Use Goods and Technologies. This law, along with supporting Government Decree No. 924-N (July 1, 2010) and Government Decree No. 1785-N (December 15, 2011), provides the regulatory basis for Armenia’s sanctions compliance efforts. According to participants, these measures govern the movement of sensitive goods and technologies through Armenia, ensuring the country aligns with international sanctions obligations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants were in consensus in naming two flagship initiatives that are the most important results of Armenia’s sanctions compliance. First, the adoption of Government Decree 808-N in 2023 was widely seen as a milestone in the creation of a more robust compliance system. The decree formalised targeted controls – particularly over dual-use items (Common High Priority List) – within a general strategy of monitoring and controlling exports with potential military applications. Second, Armenia’s establishment of a high-level interagency working group, chaired by the deputy prime minister, was mentioned as an accomplishment for institutional coordination on sanctions implementation. According to an official from the Ministry of Justice, the working group was formed in accordance with a 2023 government decree, with the aim of aligning Armenia more closely with the G7 sanctions regimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants also pointed to Armenia’s export licensing system as a central component of its sanctions compliance architecture. This regulation requires individuals and entities to obtain prior authorisation for the export of dual-use goods, irrespective of the destination, thereby reinforcing Armenia’s commitment to rigorous oversight and alignment with international sanctions regimes. From this foundation, Armenian authorities have introduced a set of pragmatic enforcement measures, such as transit declarations and electronic invoicing of air exports to EAEU destinations. Not only do these measures enhance the traceability of goods, but they also enable more efficient monitoring of exports, particularly those transiting or destined for Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tighter control has already generated a measurable impact. A representative from the State Revenue Committee said that in 2023 fines were imposed on illegal exports of dual-use items, and as a consequence such exports to Russia had fallen dramatically, with volumes reportedly at near-zero. This is a desirable outcome that is testimony to Armenia’s growing ability to restrict illicit trade in sensitive goods. Still, however, the official highlighted that there are issues at play, primarily in detecting more sophisticated evasion tactics. One such issue is Harmonised System code manipulation, the practice of mis-stating commodities to avoid the prohibitions of sanctions. Such breaches, both intentional and inadvertent, underscored the necessity of building stronger technical ability on the part of traders and supply chain providers to detect and neutralise such actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In strengthening financial regulation in Armenia, another milestone was the acknowledgement of cryptocurrency as a possible avenue for illicit financial flows. Participants discussed the need for strict regulation in this case. One of the CBA representatives explained that the government is formulating overall policies for how to tackle these matters. This also includes the draft law on crypto financial assets, which has already passed on the first reading in parliament. The aim of this provision is to encourage security and order in the digital currency market to facilitate openness of ownership, source of funds monitoring, and safeguarding of the financial system against abuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on Armenia’s increasing focus on the enforcement of sanctions, the role of the financial intelligence unit (FIU) has assumed a central position in addressing new risks and adhering to international frameworks. A key mechanism through which it achieves this is the analysis of suspicious transaction reports (STRs), which are filed whenever there are concerns regarding potential sanctions violations. According to a representative of the FIU, STRs are reviewed in the broader context of anti-money laundering systems and only reported if there is a clear suspicion of a link to criminal activity or illicit proceeds. The analysis of such reports has shown trends reflecting that individuals are involved in efforts to circumvent sanctions. Rather than engaging law enforcement directly at this stage, the FIU coordinates with the concerned department responsible for sanctions supervision to ensure preventive actions are undertaken where possible. While there is cooperation with foreign counterparts, for example, the Egmont Group, the representative acknowledged a gap in reciprocal investigation requests from foreign governments, which is a deficiency in Armenia’s overall sanctions enforcement system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;private-sector-response-and-unintended-consequences&quot;&gt;Private Sector Response and Unintended Consequences&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armenia’s efforts to comply with international sanctions have had a wide-ranging impact on the country’s private sector. Following the sanctions on major Russian banks, Armenian financial institutions and trade operators have had to quickly shift how they connect to the global financial and trade systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent implementation of G7 sanctions, Armenian banks mainly used Russian banks as their correspondent banking relationships with the international financial system. Since these major Russian banks (notably VTB and Sberbank) have now been sanctioned, Armenian banks have had to rewire their connections to the international financial system. Although a US bank continues to provide this service to one Armenian bank, no other Western banks have been willing to step in to fill the gap left by the Russians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of sanctions has led to the introduction of more stringent procedures within Armenia’s banking system. Participants noted that while the measures are generally seen to be effective in imposing compliance with international sanctions, they also complicated banking procedures. An NGO representative commented that over the past three years, Armenia’s banking system has undergone a substantial tightening of regulatory practice, with financial agreements becoming more restrictive. This shift can be seen in the increased recruitment of compliance officers across the sector. In the meantime, these heightened demands have added layers of complication for entrepreneurs and citizens conducting their routine banking transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of sanctions is not only felt in the banking sector but also by small businesses and producers. According to a Ministry of Economy representative, these firms are now under more scrutiny, with banks asking them to identify their end customers before transactions are approved – a demand that is challenging for many small firms to meet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This intensified due diligence has translated into mounting operational pressures. Participants pointed to concrete obstacles such as delayed transactions, derisking by financial institutions and restricted access to correspondent banking services. These disruptions have had a disproportionate effect on smaller businesses, whose limited leverage and capacity make them more vulnerable to financial bottlenecks. One constant issue permeating participant discussions was the uneven enforcement environment: as larger businesses have generally been able to handle matters through unofficial networks or available ties, small actors remain in the position of lingering uncertainty and organisational disarray.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants highlighted that Armenian businesses, particularly small ones, cannot survive without their economic connections with Russia, as the access to the EAEU market and Russian online stores still offers vital opportunities that are not readily available in European and American markets. This concern was repeated by a Ministry of Economy official and one MP, who quoted testimony from local businesses, a good number of which view Western substitutes as insufficient. The MP added that Western partners have not made a strong counter- offer, as yet, and most in the private sector view those alternatives that have been offered as lacking what is necessary to enable a serious move away from Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implications of sanctions have also been felt acutely in the country’s IT sector. Participants noted that the industry has been disproportionately impacted by Western technology firms’ overcompliance policies, where they have cut back or entirely shut off their services or cooperation with Armenian counterparts based on perceived compliance risk. A representative of the Ministry of High-Tech Industry of the Republic of Armenia expressed concern over the UK’s warning to British exporters to avoid dealing with those that can assist in circumventing sanctions against Russia. Consequently, Armenia’s high-tech sector has suffered significantly, slowing its general development and making developments in the industry more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although significant steps have been taken by Armenia to strengthen sanctions compliance infrastructure, participants emphasised that sufficient monitoring of cash flows continues to be a key vulnerability. This concern was raised repeatedly as a systemic flaw with limited transparency of financial flows causing potential loopholes that might be exploited to bypass sanctions, highlighting the necessity for enhanced oversight tools and ongoing institutional capacity building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another key point raised by participants was the role of public–private partnerships (PPPs) and cross-sector coordination in strengthening Armenia’s sanctions compliance efforts. It was underlined that there is already significant cooperation between the private and public sectors, which can form a solid foundation for progress. For example, the interagency committee, headed by the deputy prime minister, includes representatives from the private sector. It offers a platform for consultation on issues such as the risks sanctions pose to financial inclusion. A representative from the CBA noted that PPPs are extremely strong in areas such as anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing (AML/CTF). By the end of 2024, several meetings had been held to discuss the findings of the National Risk Assessment (prepared in advance of Armenia’s ongoing Financial Action Task Force/MONEYVAL evaluation), namely money laundering and terrorism financing risks, reflecting the growing institutionalisation of these collaborations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with national efforts, regional cooperation was also considered essential. Participants emphasised the importance of enhancing data sharing and joint development of typologies of risk to more effectively identify and deter sanctions evasion. In preparation for the ongoing MONEYVAL evaluation, stakeholders recommended intensifying public–private dialogue, further enhancing national risk assessments, and drawing on international experience to align Armenia’s compliance practice with evolving global standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;election-integrity-and-financial-flows&quot;&gt;Election Integrity and Financial Flows&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants highlighted enduring vulnerabilities in the country’s electoral finance system, as Armenia moves towards its 2026 parliamentary elections. The main issue focused on gaps in enforcement. While the legal framework is in place, stakeholders widely described its implementation as irregular and insufficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armenia’s Corruption Prevention Commission, tasked with supervising financial disclosures, faces serious limitations that risk undermining the integrity of elections. Among the primary issues, an NGO representative said, is the severe shortage of staff – typically, only one or two officials are assigned to scrutinise complex financial statements. This lack of resource seriously hampers the Commission’s ability to put its mandate into practice, causing delays in analysing asset declarations and impediments to their timely and transparent disclosure to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These institutional limitations are exacerbated by the comparative shortness of the official campaign period – only three weeks. The participants agreed that the brevity of this time period makes effective observation impossible and rules out a careful examination of election-related financial activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to structural and procedural flaws, participants also flagged issues about the application of campaign finance laws in Armenia. During previous election cycles, there were instances of apparent violations of campaign finance regulations that did not lead to significant consequences, raising concerns that similar issues might rise again. A representative of an NGO explained how a ban on corporate donations to election campaigns has been circumvented. In one case in 2018, two large factories were involved in questionable campaign finance operations, with investigations later showing that employees of the factories appeared to be contributors to political parties. This raised strong suspicions that their names were being used without their knowledge to conceal corporate interests and avoid the ban.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To counter such transparency issues, a CSO representative deliberated on Armenia’s beneficial ownership transparency reforms as a way of raising accountability. Under the current regulations, all legal persons, including NGOs and private entities, are required to annually disclose their beneficial owners. The potency of this move is, however, undermined through weak implementation. According to a representative of the Ministry of Justice, the authorities currently lack the capacity and resources to verify whether the declared owners actually own the entities, thereby creating the opportunity for misuse and further complicating efforts to prevent illegal company donations and guarantee transparency in the election process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These past experiences, combined with experiences other countries have had with elections, have fuelled heightened concerns that foreign interference will escalate as the election approaches. Participants cited Russia’s efforts to interfere with the electoral process in Moldova, Georgia and Romania, and indicated that Armenia could be vulnerable to similar attempts. Among the principal issues raised was the potential for extraterritorial influence, such as online political advertisements financed from abroad. The NGO representative cited Russia’s use of 27,000 accounts in Moldova to interfere in the country’s elections and warned of the challenge of prosecuting such activity in Armenia’s elections outside its borders. In addition, CSO representatives pointed out techniques applied in Moldova, where individuals were reportedly encouraged to open bank accounts in Russian banks and were immediately credited with amounts ranging from €50 to €100. This represented a form of vote bribery, which made participants suspicious about the likelihood of Russia employing similar methods in Armenia, as the country has vulnerable groups facing financial difficulties who could be manipulated through such tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this array of concerns, the increased impact of media channels was added as a notably important line of foreign interference. Various new media channels, which participants assumed to be financed by Russian-affiliated interests, were spreading propaganda that corresponds with the Kremlin’s agenda. As one participant recognised, some media outlets adopt names suggesting pro-European interests while propagating anti-Western and anti-government themes. The participant gave the example of Euromedia24, a media source that, even with a pro-European name, has been working actively to disseminate anti-Western rhetoric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants agreed that Russian influence is not merely at the media level, reaching as deep into think tanks and NGOs. Such entities are accused of actively working against Armenia’s democratic reforms, frustrating peace and normalisation efforts with Turkey and Azerbaijan and threatening to destabilise the foundations of democracy in the country. Participants warned that the scope and intensity of such activities are likely to grow as the 2026 elections draw closer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another risk highlighted for the 2026 election financing system is its transnational ties to Russia’s large diaspora community. Participants warned that such bonds between communities can be used for unlawful political financing or interfering in elections. Remittances and unregulated money transfers are prevalent in Armenia, posing enormous regulatory difficulties. In addition, the beneficiaries of Russian financing may unknowingly be caught up in influence operations due to the absence of stringent controls to check against such abuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further adding complexity to these risks, diplomatic officials raised concerns that Nagorno-Karabakh forced displacement provides increased numbers of vulnerable populations to be targeted. These communities are exposed to greater risks of manipulation by vote-buying and informal financial assurances that damage electoral integrity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another key threat identified by participants is the presence of Iranian and Russian banks operating in Armenia, which produces alternative financial systems and deepens existing difficulties. The lack of transparency of such entities, combined with incomplete integration into the compliance system in Armenia, allows room for foreign actors to use them as backdoor conduits of finance to shape local political processes during election periods without being discovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These foreign influence concerns are further fuelled by the Armenian financial regulatory system that, according to participants, leaves loopholes for illegal financing to find its way into politics. In response to these complaints, an FIU official explained that while the FIU’s mandate does not directly cover political parties or elections, their activity becomes relevant as and when suspicious signs of a crime – in the form of illegal enrichment or money laundering – are detected. In such cases, the FIU cooperates with the banking sector and law enforcement agencies. Armenian AML/CTF legislation prescribes specific high-risk categories, including politically exposed persons, by which financial institutions are allowed to apply automated screening systems and flag suspicious activity for deeper scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another threat on the horizon raised by participants was the use of huge cash payments and cryptocurrency as instruments of illicit election funding, which go undetected with ease. To address these growing threats, an FIU official disclosed that the unit is now using blockchain analysis software in tracking cryptocurrency transactions and searching for warning signs. In an effort to close continuing gaps, the FIU is working to develop mechanisms for better early detection and surveillance. In terms of cash transactions, the official noted that any transaction exceeding $10,000 must be declared, with the data inputted into the FIU strategic analysis systems to help identify anomalies as well as block systemic threats to financial integrity and the electoral process. As the election looms, civil society representatives have registered alarm over the lack of effective mechanisms to track and monitor illicit financial flows amid increased risks of foreign interference. CSO members urged authorities to strengthen coordination and cross-sectoral collaboration and further underscored the need for more cross-country collaboration between Armenia and other countries that face risks of foreign election interference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the national efforts, participant discussions then turned to the role of international institutions such as MONEYVAL, considered to be one of the most important stakeholders in improving the electoral security of Armenia. MONEYVAL has so far been anti-corruption oriented, but participants emphasised the necessity for their agenda to be broadened to encompass electoral integrity. With an in-country evaluation to be conducted in October 2025 and the final report published in 2026, Armenia has a great chance to learn some meaningful lessons and gain valuable recommendations, presenting the country with a genuine chance to strengthen its mechanisms against electoral vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armenia finds itself at a financial and trade crossroads, caught between the West and the targets of sanctions (Russia and Iran) and facing financial headwinds that may threaten the integrity of its 2026 election. While the country has strong legislation in place, a financial sector that is alert to the threat posed by sanctions evasion, a vibrant civil society and an experienced anti-financial crime community, it will need to embrace a whole-of-society approach to bring together these capabilities to ensure the integrity of its financial system in the face of persistent and rising challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With his second term, Donald Trump is wasting no time in redrawing the global technological and strategic map. His high-profile tour to the Middle East combined old-school power politics and a new-age tech offensive. In Riyadh, he presided over a $142 billion arms package with Saudi Arabia, underscoring traditional security ties, but the centrepiece of his visit was something far more future-tech focused: artificial intelligence. From massive chips deals and cloud infrastructure commitments to the launch of state-backed AI champions, the trip marked a deliberate US push to entrench itself at the heart of the Gulf’s digital transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scale of the announcements was staggering. In Riyadh, Saudi Arabia unveiled Humain, a new national AI champion backed by the Public Investment Fund and boasting an initial procurement of a least 18,000 Nvidia Blackwell chips. In tandem, AMD inked a $10 billion infrastructure partnership, while Amazon Web Services committed $5 billion to build a dedicated AI zone in the Kingdom. Across the Gulf in the UAE, Abu Dhabi’s G42 firm, already a regional AI heavyweight, struck deals to import up to 500,000 Nvidia H100 chips annually, facilitated by eased US export restrictions. Qatar, not to be outdone, sealed the largest-ever Boeing deal in its history, signalling its own intention to remain central in US commercial and strategic interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This flurry of high-end tech deals represents more than just a set of business deals, it reflects a deliberate recalibration of US strategy, from export controls and tech denial under Biden, to a geoeconomic offensive that arms allies with cutting-edge capability. But in empowering Gulf monarchies with the tools of advanced AI, Washington is not just outcompeting China, it is taking significant long-term risks. These technologies could be repurposed for surveillance, repression or military use and their diffusion may ultimately undermine the very norms and alliances the US seeks to uphold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-pivot-from-denial-to-diffusion&quot;&gt;A Pivot from Denial to Diffusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration’s approach to AI and semiconductor policy was defined by strategic denial. Export controls against China, pressure on allies to restrict technology flows and a concerted push to multilateralise guardrails on AI development were the cornerstones of its international tech policy. Trump’s second term, by contrast, has begun with an aggressive pivot by easing export restrictions, dismantling tiered licencing systems, and facilitating US firms’ access to fast-growing, but politically sensitive, markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For US tech giants such as Nvidia, AMD and AWS, this is a bonanza. The Middle East, flush with oil revenues and motivated by existential concerns about a post-hydrocarbon future, offers massive capital, centralised decision-making and near limitless ambitions. For Trump, it offers a twofold win: economic benefits for US firms and a geopolitical wedge against China’s growing tech presence in the Gulf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet this shift has not come without criticism. Some US lawmakers have expressed concern that the export of frontier AI capabilities to Gulf states risks undermining long-term American technological advantage, and could open the door to indirect Chinese access, particularly given UAE’s historically ambivalent alignment and G42’s past ties with Chinese entities. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has dismissed such fears as “naïve”, arguing that the benefits of closer alignment with trusted Gulf partners outweigh the risks. But the tension between commercial expansion and national security remains unresolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-middle-east-as-an-ai-battleground&quot;&gt;The Middle East as an AI Battleground&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Gulf nations, AI has become a core strategic priority. As the energy transition accelerates, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar see AI as a foundational pillar of their post-oil economies. But beyond diversification lies ambition, to become global AI hubs that can shape future norms, control regional data ecosystems, and project soft power through technological leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trumps’ visit validated those ambitions. The deals inked were not just about chip sales, they included infrastructure, cloud sovereignty, and data centre construction. In effect, the US is helping Gulf allies build end-to-end AI ecosystems that could rival Western digital economies in scale and sophistication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the heart of these efforts is a drive toward AI sovereignty, the ability of states to control their own compute power, training data and cloud infrastructure without reliance on foreign platforms. For the Gulf states, this is not only a matter of economic futureproofing but also of strategic autonomy. Building massive domestic data centres, securing dedicated chip pipelines, and localising cloud operations are steps toward reducing dependence on external providers and shaping their own digital destinies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This emerging Middle Easter tech bloc, however, is not emerging in isolation. China has invested heavily in Gulf digital infrastructure, including Huawei’s cloud services, smart city initiatives, and surveillance technologies. Trump’s AI diplomacy aims to displace that influence, but the contest is far from over. In many Gulf capitals, the preference remains for balancing, not choosing, between Washington and Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;risks-of-a-fragmented-digital-order&quot;&gt;Risks of a Fragmented Digital Order&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The geopolitical consequences of this AI arms race are profound. The first is the growing fragmentation of the global digital order. Rather than a cohesive rules-based system for emerging technologies, the world is increasingly defined by bilateral tech pacts, regional standards, and selective access to innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump’s Middles East tour reinforced this trend. His administration’s approach to AI governance is unilateral and transactional, favouring deals over diplomacy and power over principles. The implication is that access to American technology no longer depends on shared values or regulatory alignment, but on strategic loyalty, and, often, the ability to pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second consequence is the diffusion of dual-use technologies without robust oversight. Blackwell chips and massive data centres are not neutral tools, they are accelerants of surveillance, military AI development, and influence operations should their owners choose to direct them to do so. In the absence of international guardrails, their unchecked proliferation could fuel authoritarian entrenchment and regional instability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, this strategy could undercut the very alliances it seeks to strengthen. European and Indo-Pacific allies, many of whom were pressured under Biden to adopt restrictive AI governance frameworks and align with US-led semiconductor controls, may bristle at what looks like a double standard. Why are Washington’s Gulf partners receiving the world’s most advanced AI tools with minimal conditions, while other face scrutiny and constraint?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;toward-a-new-tech-grand-strategy&quot;&gt;Toward a New Tech Grand Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deeper question raised by Trump’s Middle East AI offensive is whether the US has a coherent grand strategy for technology. The postwar American order was built on more than just dominance, it was rooted in norms, institutions and alliances. In the AI age, those foundations are eroding. In their place, the Trump administration appears to be constructing a world of high-tech spheres of influence, in which economic opportunity trumps normative convergence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is the new reality, then allies and adversaries alike will adapt accordingly. China, having watched Washington’s AI diplomacy unfold in the Gulf, is unlikely to sit idle. It is already offering open-weight AI models to partners seeking alternatives to US restrictions and could double-down on providing infrastructure-as-a-service via Huawei Cloud and other digital silk road assets. Beijing may seek to undercut American firms in regions where cost and political alignment make it an attractive alternative, particularly in parts of Africa, Central Asia and Southeast Asia. The US may have secured a tactical lead in the Gulf, but the strategic competition with China over global AI alignment remains wide open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe may seek to chart a more independent digital path, wary of both American tech exceptionalism and Chinese surveillance exports. The Global South will continue to navigate a fragmented landscape, forced to make choices between competing standards, platforms and providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the Gulf, the coming years will bring both opportunity and scrutiny. Their partnership with Washington on AI may accelerate economic transformation and geopolitical relevance, but it will also invite deeper debates over surveillance, data control and the militarisation of AI. Whether they emerge as responsible stewards of this new digital power, or as flashpoints in a wider tech conflict, will depend as much on domestic governance as on external alignment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What also stands out from the Middle East tour is how central US tech firms have become to the execution of foreign policy. Companies like Nvidia, AMD, and AWS were not peripheral to these agreements, they were main instruments. Their infrastructure, chips, and cloud services are now tools of statecraft, blurring the lines between commercial enterprise and geopolitical actor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it was not just corporations in the room. High-profile tech leaders and billionaires, including OpenAI’s Sam Altman, Tesla and Space X’s Elon Musk and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang, all joined Trump on tour, reflecting a broader shift in who wields influence over international technology strategy. These individuals, through their platforms, capital, and personal networks, are increasingly operating as de facto diplomats, brokering access, shaping narratives, and influencing which nations get fast-tracked into the AI-powered future. As national security priorities become increasingly entangled with private-sector capabilities and personalities, the strategic influence of these actors, and the degree of transparency and oversight they are subject to, will be a critical issue in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week marked a significant evolution in how technological influence is being wielded in global affairs. By supporting the rapid expansion of AI capabilities in Gulf states, Washington is both accelerating regional ambitions and reshaping the geopolitical contours of advanced technology. These deals reflect a growing recognition that access to cutting-edge infrastructure, chips, data centres, cloud capacity, is becoming a central axis of strategic alignment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet this approach also brings complexity. The diffusion of high-end AI tools into politically diverse and strategically independent environments raises important questions about long-term interoperability, trust and governance. Managing the balance between commercial opportunity, strategic influence, and technological safeguards will be a persistent challenge, not just for the US, but for its partners as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the global race for AI leadership intensifies, what unfolds in the Gulf may prove a bellwether for the broader digital order, a test case for how major powers engage in technology statecraft in an increasingly multipolar and often fragmented world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is safe to say this is a challenging time for the NATO Alliance and Euro-Atlantic Security. In this changing world, when the UK is taking a leading role in Europe’s adaptation to the new security paradigm, there is a requirement for demonstrable action and leadership today. The delivery of a fully-enabled corps is one of the British Army’s essential contributions to UK Defence. How the corps will fight is the subject of this RUSI study day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-a-corps&quot;&gt;What is a Corps?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the tactical, operational and strategic framework the modern corps sits on the seam between the higher tactical and operational levels of NATO’s warfighting architecture. While still very much focussed on the battle, the corps looks much wider than the division and has a very different role. Divisions focus on enabling the close battle, allowing their subordinate brigades to fight and win against our adversaries. The corps fights the deep battle, striking key enemy command and control, long range fires, electronic warfare, air defence and logistics capabilities, thereby shaping the environment and setting the conditions for the divisions and brigades in their close fights to come. The advent of new technologies, driven in part by the war in Ukraine, are offering new capabilities that increase the range of the corps deep battle to 300km and beyond. The corps also protects the force, an increasingly difficult proposition in modern times, ensuring forward echelons can survive to fight, supply lines remain intact and that troops can rest and rehabilitate before being redeployed. In the close battle the corps synchronises the divisions providing protection and support from corps level capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our recent focus on counter insurgency operations means the corps level of warfighting is not well understood. I believe it has three key characteristics: scale, complexity and endurance. In terms of scale, a corps commander can expect to command at a minimum, two divisions and a range of key capabilities, between 50,000–150,000 people and their equipment, with a requirement to synchronise effects across all of the domains in support of the divisional fight. In terms of geographic scale, planning distances mean that the corps area of operations is approximately 100km wide by 200km deep, with the corps deep extending another 300km beyond that. Or to put it another way, an area roughly the size of Wales. Complexity exists everywhere: from protecting the force against increasingly sophisticated threats; the logistics designed to keep a large force supplied with food, ammunition, fuel and medical support; and managing the thousands of data points produced every minute, all while contending with whatever the enemy decides to throw at it. The corps also endures in a way that no other formation can. A division can rotate in and out of the fight, but a corps remains throughout; managing complex logistical trails, supporting the host nation and providing a consistent command and point of presence until the task at hand is complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-the-21st-century-corps-fights&quot;&gt;How the 21st Century Corps fights&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To quote a former French Prime Minister “Generals always prepare to fight the last war, especially if they had won it”. Our insights from Ukraine provide an indication of what the next war may look like. To ensure we are ready to fight and win there are a number of key areas where we are focusing, to improve how the corps fights in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I start where we normally finish. For most of my career, logistics has been the last thing that is covered in any planning meeting or orders session. It is now my first point of call and for good reason. We all must understand the scale of logistics required for the UK’s corps to be credible in delivering deterrence. For the ARRC to arrive in the right place, at the right combat effectiveness, ready to fight and win – the challenge is vast. But that is the tip of the sustainment iceberg; we then must sustain the force over protracted and contested lines of communication. The complexities involved in deploying a multinational force across oceans and multiple international borders are significant; while we are working closely with NATO and national formations, it would likely be a national undertaking of a scale not seen since the Gulf War. Our ability to sustain the fight would require a whole-of-society and industry approach, one now capably being led by the National Armaments Director to give us the magazine depth and production capacity to match that of our adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our adversaries have a sophisticated and effective system of layered defence, both in the physical and electromagnetic spectrums on the Land and in the Air. We must learn from this and change our view of how we deliver protection and how we manage risk. Protection cannot be something we consider for defending our critical assets. Instead, it must become integral to everything we do – it is a building block of modern corps warfighting. At the most simplistic level the bubble of protection creates freedom of manoeuvre in the corps’ rear and close which enables timely effects to be delivered in the corps’ deep. In future battles the corps with the most extensive and lethal bubble will wrestle a significant advantage, and those corps that are able to move and synchronise their bubbles with multi-domain effects will be able to dominate the battlefield. To prosecute the corps battle we have traditionally fired to manoeuvre – suppressed the enemy then moved. But without the protection from layered defences both physically and in the electro-magnetic spectrum any attempts to fire into the enemy’s deep are likely to attract the wrath of the enemy’s recce-strike complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With logistics and layered protection in place, my next priority is to strike the enemy at distance, creating the unfair fight for the divisions. The proliferation of uncrewed systems has changed the character of conflict and how we fight in the deep. There is still a vital role in modern warfare for our survivable systems, the tank, the attack helicopter and the artillery piece. But as Ukraine has showed, we can be smarter with how we develop and integrate these with less-expensive attritable and consumable systems. CGS has set the target that in the future 40% of the Army’s lethality will come from the attritable, 40% from consumable and 20% from the survivable. With this in mind we are ideally positioned to ensure that we are preparing to fight the next war, not the last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a period of our history where demonstrable action and leadership is required today our reinvestment in the UK’s corps has started. There is much work still to do and I hope the focused study day at RUSI will provide much of the impetus we require.&lt;/p&gt;

While existing scholarship on bug bounty reveals how these platforms structure hackers’ labor, we look symmetrically and ask: How do bug bounty platforms shape the work of program managers on the clients’ side? We use data from 13 semi-structured interviews with bug bounty managers and concepts from platform studies and computer-supported cooperative work. Our study reveals, first, that managing a program requires four types of articulation work: (1) to attract quality hackers, (2) to manage the high number of reports (3) to find the internal asset owner, and (4) to negotiate the disclosure schedule with hackers. Second, managers consider this additional labor positively, despite some adversarial behaviors from hackers. This study makes a case to study how platforms shape labor on both the supply and the demand sides and calls for further analyses of platform labor using the concept of articulation work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critical scholarship has long revealed the fallacy of platform companies’ position as a “neutral intermediary” between two or more parties. The pioneering work of Tarleton Gillespie showed instead how this stance acted as a rhetorical device to entice the various parties to join the platform, while serving the interest of the platform owners. Ample scholarship has since revealed the many interventions of platforms across sectors e.g., by actively curating online content, creating new forms of dependencies within several cultural industries, and acting as de facto employers in many industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scholarship uncovers the agency of digital platforms by focusing on their constraints on people and industries; conversely, it shows how platform users resist, mitigate or subvert these constraints. However, equally important is the power that platform companies derive from their absence of constraints: Huber and Pierce characterize platforms as a structured but intentionally flexible framework which they call “an empty shell”. In their study, they show how such a loose structure can be as powerful as rigid rules to shape the activity of platform users: the health workers they analyze develop various forms of articulation work to compensate for the absence of clear rules from platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We apply the concept of the “empty shell” to platforms and similarly reveal the articulation work they generate. We specifically look at bug bounty platforms i.e., companies selling bug bounty programs (henceforth, “vendors”). In such programs, independent security researchers (or “hackers”) report security vulnerabilities (or “bugs”) to organizations for a reward (or “bounty”). While bug disclosure has a much longer history, it is increasingly organized by a few large vendors (such as HackerOne or Bugcrowd) that apply the platform model to cybersecurity, putting into contact independent cybersecurity researchers with clients, and monetizing this intermediary position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Existing research on bug bounty platforms focuses on the vendors’ constraints on the work of hackers: they shape their labor conditions and effectively turn them into “gig workers”. We complement this scholarship by focusing, first, on the other side of the platform, i.e., not the labor supply side (the hackers), but the currently under-researched labor demand side (the client of the program). We focus specifically on the employees of the clients managing the bug bounty program (henceforth, the “manager”). Second, following Huber and Pierce, we reveal how these workers react to and perceive the absence of platform’s constraints: looking at bug bounty platforms as an “empty shell” reveals the plurality of articulation work that managers provide to ensure their program is successful. We describe in the remainder of the introduction how we engage with scholarship on bug bounty, how we leverage the theoretical framework on articulation work, our research question, and our methodology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;literature-review-and-theoretical-framework&quot;&gt;Literature review and theoretical framework&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;bug-bounty-as-a-platform&quot;&gt;Bug bounty “as a platform”&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large vendors of bug bounty programs, such as Bugcrowd and HackerOne in the United States, and YesWeHack and Intigriti in Europe, all emerged during the 2010s. The history of bug bounty has already shown how this vendor-driven model emerged following a decades-long shift of the professional and legal statuses of cybersecurity researchers. A few organizations experimented with this form of vulnerability reporting throughout the 1990s and 2000s (such as Netscape and Mozilla), before Meta and Google put bug bounty into the spotlight in the early 2010s by releasing their highly-publicized programs. Throughout the 2010s, the model reached the mainstream when Etsy, GitHub, and Microsoft also launched their own programs. Bug bounty gained respectability in 2016 with the U.S. Department of Defense’s widely reported “Hack the Pentagon” event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large bug bounty vendors apply the platform model to bounty hunting by monetizing their brokering function between the two parties. In this context, scholars have extensively revealed the detrimental implications this model has on hackers’ labor. Large vendors have effectively commodified vulnerabilities by taking control over the disclosure schedule and reward. Moreover, they have created a bug market that is highly stratified and power-law distributed, with few researchers reporting frequently and for a high reward, while the vast majority report little and for little to no compensation. As a result of this market structure, “skilled bug bounty hunters rarely make a good living by Western standards”. In other words, bug bounty vendors transform security researchers into “gig workers,” a form of labor characterized by casualization, informalization, and precarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scholars of bug bounty have so far overwhelmingly focused on the labor supply side, that is, on hackers. What is still missing is an equally rich analysis of how the platform model shapes the work of the client to manage their program. Moreover, the existing focus is on the multiple constraints that such platforms create. Following Huber and Pierce, we show that the absence of constraints in bug bounty platforms is equally important to shaping how program managers work, which we analyze here using the concept of articulation work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;articulation-work-and-computer-supported-cooperative-work&quot;&gt;Articulation work and computer-supported cooperative work&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Articulation work originates from the sociological analysis of professional practices and work situations, and is central to the field of computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW). The concept reveals the plurality of forms of work, the involvement of workers, and the various levels of visibility attached to different forms of work. Strauss first defined it as the work that is involved in organizing both tasks and the relationship between workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strength of the concept is to link the general goal of a project and the many tasks required to complete it. Strauss names the former the “arc of work” i.e., the complete set of tasks organized both in sequence and in parallel throughout the trajectory of a project. In this view, completing such a project requires the integration of “tasks, clusters of tasks, and segments of the total arc”. The person ensuring that all the sub-projects eventually align toward the completion of the project is said to provide articulation work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subsequent scholarship has extended the concept by emphasizing the plurality of elements constituting articulation work. Lucy Suchman mentioned the ongoing effort to integrate fragmented elements – such as organizations, professional practices, and technologies – into working configurations. Similarly, she mentioned that articulation work requires “diverse discursive and material, human and artifactual elements” that must be integrated to build “stable organizations and artifacts”. The articulation workers align all these elements toward a coherent end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is a paucity of scholarship in platform studies using the concept, the work of Huber and Pierce is enlightening as it reveals the forms of articulation work that a platform architecture generates. For them, the looser the rules of a platform, the more articulation work it requires from workers to conduct their activity, e.g., a health practitioner must compensate for the missing “professional norms, regulations, and managerial expectations” on teletherapy platforms. In this article, we similarly apply the concept of articulation work to bug bounty platforms, and ask: How do bug bounty platforms shape the work of managers at the client’s side?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We conducted 13 semi-structured interviews with employees in charge of managing the bug bounty program at their current or past company. Twelve respondents worked at private companies and one at a non-profit organization. All respondents except one had contracted with one of the four major bug bounty vendors (Bugcrowd, HackerOne, YesWeHack, and Intigriti). Most respondents contracted with one vendor only, and one contracted with two vendors. Our respondents either managed public or private programs, or a mix of both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we use the generic terms of “program manager” or just “manager” in this article, our respondents identified with several different titles. Some managers worked full time on managing the bug bounty program, while others did it along other responsibilities. They worked at companies located in Europe, North America, Australasia, and South America. This coverage is limited but is representative of the global geography of the bug bounty market, with the major vendors exclusively headquartered in the Global North and with only a limited customer base in the Global South. Despite our efforts to recruit non-male respondents, we ended up with only two female respondents, echoing the strong male dominance in the cybersecurity sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recruited respondents in three phases. First, we relied on personal connections in the field to recruit two respondents to pilot the question guide. After revising the question guide, a call for respondents was published in a private bug bounty forum, and several other managers volunteered to be part of the study. We extended the pool by looking up authors of customers’ testimonies published on vendors’ websites and invited them to participate in the study via LinkedIn messages. Finally, we contacted additional program managers on LinkedIn that we found using variations of the query “bug bounty program managers.” We stopped the interview recruitment upon reaching data saturation after 13 interviews of managers working at 10 different companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We conducted all the interviews via Zoom between March 2022 and March 2023 after piloting the question guide twice. We designed our topic guide around key themes based on the existing literature, our past research on the topic, and our research objectives for this article. The 13 interviews were with one respondent each and lasted between 35:38 and 71:48 min. Respondents were not compensated. Interviews were conducted in English or French. Prior to the interview, we sent an information sheet and consent form via email, and we collected their signed consent. Two respondents requested oral consent, which was recorded prior to starting the interview. One respondent requested the interview not to be recorded but agreed to have the interview notes used in the analysis. Audio files were transcribed via a paid service, and all transcripts were anonymized. We then conducted a thematic analysis of the transcripts by proceeding both deductively (by coding for themes that we had already identified in the literature and our past research) and inductively (by coding for new themes that emerged from the transcripts). This thematic analysis took the form of a codebook that one of us created in NVivo and that contained the deductive and inductive codes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;findings&quot;&gt;Findings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reveal the articulation work of managers, we first need to define the services that platform vendors provide to their clients, ordered here chronologically. Before the program starts, they advise clients on how to design and manage their program e.g., whether they want a public or private program. Other key parameters are the types of vulnerabilities clients will accept (the “scope”) and the type and level of rewards. To start the program, vendors leverage their database of independent researchers to connect them to clients and their programs. While the vendors’ outreach to hackers is very minimal in a public program, they directly invite researchers to specific private programs. Particularly appreciated by our respondents are background checks (basic identity check, presence on lists of sanctions, etc.) and payments (especially dealing with different tax systems and foreign currencies, etc.). Optionally, the vendors can also review the hacker’s submissions before passing the relevant ones to the clients (“triage”). This list reveals that platform vendors take care of the logistics of a program (program design, inviting researchers, payment and triage, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, all the work necessary to animate the program – i.e., getting actionable reports of relevant vulnerabilities – is the responsibility of the program managers. Our study reveals, first, that this labor is complex and multifaceted; specifically, it requires four types of articulation work, which we describe in the first result section:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To obtain valid reports from researchers, managers must attract quality hackers and convince them to participate in the program;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They must manage the high number of low-quality submissions (the “noise”), usually by using the triage function of the vendor;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prior to remediating the vulnerability, the manager must identify the owner of the compromised asset, and convince them to fix it;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The public disclosure of the bug usually requires a negotiation around the timing with the hacker.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/mGrtAaH.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1. Articulation between main and sub-tasks in the bug bounty pipeline.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these tasks constitute a sub-project, and it is the manager’s role to align them with the arc of the project. We describe what each of these four types of articulation work entails and what is at stake. In the second result section, we show that while this articulation work is additional labor for managers, they consider it a positive aspect of their work. Managers mostly enjoy the opportunity to interact with hackers, even though this can involve some adversarial behaviors. Managers are mostly satisfied with the “empty shell” that platform vendors provide and are not looking for the vendors to impose more constraints or to weigh in their relationship with hackers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four-types-of-articulation-work&quot;&gt;Four types of articulation work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;finding-and-retaining-quality-hackers&quot;&gt;Finding and retaining quality hackers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was not hard for the managers we interviewed to obtain bugs reports via their programs, but it was harder to obtain relevant ones. Several of them designated the high volume of irrelevant bug reports as “noise.” Bug reports are classified as noise if they are outside the scope of accepted bugs, if they are duplicate, or just a report from automated scanning tools. Respondent 9 described this noise as “the worst problem for [them].” Managers attribute this noise to the high number of low-qualified hackers, as eloquently put by R12: “On the platform, you have many script kiddies that are just launching a vulnerability scan and providing a report.” Moreover, programs compete to attract the best hackers: “If you are a big beefy company,” as R3 says, “there will be people lining up at the door to get into your program.” Smaller companies, however, will have a harder time finding quality researchers for their programs. A first difficulty for managers is therefore to find competent hackers to join their programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While triage (described in point 2 “Managing noise via triage” below) allows managers to deal with the noise quantitatively, equally crucial is how managers deal qualitatively and preemptively with this issue. They create and maintain a network of hackers to attract the best ones to their program. To start with, program managers multiply venues for recruitment. They use their own channels and don’t rely solely on the pool of researchers that the vendors provide, for example in a private program. They use various social media as channels to recruit, such as WhatsApp or Signal groups, X, or bug bounty forum Slack channels – all of which are key “to create awareness about [their] programs,” according to R13.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding quality hackers sometimes requires clients to train them. For example, R7’s team visits universities “to find that next generation of talent.” They also give students “books and media posts and all the bug bounty community research” to get them started with bug hunting. Simply spreading the word might not be enough for some specific products that are complex to understand and therefore to test. Some managers like R6 must literally “train [researchers] to speed up the preconditions to start to report vulnerabilities” by providing “technical deep dives on design work and the componentry involved in software design,” while being aware that such preliminary and additional work might be a deterrent for some researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After scouting quality hackers, managers must keep them engaged with their program. Program managers with both public and private programs can shift researchers from one pool to the next as a reward: “If we see a hacker from the public program […] being really active and sending us valuable reports, we immediately invite him in private, as a sign of appreciation” (R11). Private programs are invite-only and rewards are typically better. Managers can also contact researchers with whom they have already worked in past programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another key factor to increasing engagement is the reward. While the reward structure is defined up front and communicated to the researcher via a severity scale, managers can be flexible to keep the researcher participating in the program. For example, since a frequent difficulty for triagers and managers is to understand the report (typically requiring a back-and-forth between them and the researcher), some managers will offer an additional reward for a high-quality report providing clear steps for quick replicability. Similarly, some will pay for out-of-scope bugs if they are of strong interest to the security team. Others like R6 can add a monetary bonus “just to reward the effort,” e.g., a detailed report, even for a duplicate vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-monetary rewards are another common way for managers to keep researchers engaged. Since there is strong competition between programs, managers like R5 need to innovate beyond financial rewards “to make [researchers] feel that they’re part of a big thing that’s happening.” Swag (e.g., a piece of clothing with the name of the client’s company) is an important tool for reputation building, especially at public events. To some extent, they are more valued by researchers than monetary rewards, as R6 ponders: “Swag is one of the recognitions that we do, and I find that extremely useful. It’s really interesting to me that if you send someone a $50 gift card, or you send them a $20 hoodie, they’ll like the hoodie more than the gift card.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;managing-the-noise-via-triage&quot;&gt;Managing the “noise” via triage&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common way of dealing with the high volume of reports is to hire the service of a triage team. Vendors provide access to such a team as an additional paid service. Triagers are the first to receive the report and, crucially, they assess the severity level of the reported bug which corresponds to a reward structure (typically, the higher the severity, the higher the reward).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since clients outsource this service to the vendor, one could assume that their relations with triagers are straightforward. Managers, however, must constantly monitor triagers’ work. First, since the triage team is the first point of contact with the researchers’ community, they are the “front” of the company, and some managers want the triagers to positively represent their company in the hackers’ community. R4 mentioned how they had to “teach” the vendors’ triage team to treat researchers more respectfully. A researcher who has experienced a poor triage experience will not be inclined to look for more bugs for this company. Some clients have exposed complex products to hackers, requiring their team to train triagers to understand the product and better identify relevant bugs. Finally, the specific needs that the clients have must be also clearly and constantly communicated to the triagers’ team to customize their treatment of bugs – for example, to receive any “customer questions and complaints” as well as bugs – usually after “a long process training” of the triage team for R4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;finding-the-internal-owner-of-the-compromised-asset&quot;&gt;Finding the internal owner of the compromised asset&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the bug has passed through triage and has been identified as a valid report, fixing it requires the manager to create another sub-project: they must coordinate with the internal owner of the product affected by the bug, who must fix it. In small companies, the security team might handle both the program and the remediation of the bug, but there is frequently a division of labor between the security team and the developer/production team. The former allocates the report and monitors its remediation, while the latter fixes the vulnerability. Once again, this process is not always straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon reception, some product owners might deny the severity of the report altogether. R12 recollects how they once reported to a staff member an internal document that was not protected (hence accessible by uncredentialed staff). The answer they received was that it did not matter, since “people don’t have the link” – leading the manager to reflect that “sometimes, internal communication is more complex than communication with a researcher.” Others will try to dodge the responsibility to fix the bug, as R3 reports: “If you’re a software engineer and the bug is assigned to you, you’ll be like: ‘No, no, no, no, that’s not me. But I know who that person is!’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Product owners might also feel accused of doing their job wrong, which is a feeling the program managers have to defuse: “It’s a very awkward conversation,” recollects R2. Vulnerability is usually not designed on purpose. “Nobody wakes up one day and says, I’m going to write terrible code,” as R3 put it, and more plausible causes are that “they might not know how to write secure code, or they might be in a hot rush because some product manager might be pushing them.” R2 reveals that some product owners develop a strong emotional attachment to their product, which will result in pushback after the manager has “just told them they have an ugly baby” i.e., that their product is faulty:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;They can spend an entire career on one set of products. They’re very attached to that. […] Then you have somebody from the outside who comes in and says: “Oh, by the way, your product is all messed up and how dare you put this product out there in the wild.” So, there is a natural conflict that happens there. (R2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the negotiation between the manager and the product owner to accept the bug, managers must monitor their progress in fixing it. The product team might reluctantly respond to such a request, as R3 put it: “Sometimes they ignore it. Sometimes they don’t look at it. Sometimes they don’t have time.” Managers use Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and their specific timelines to pressure the development team by “holding any SLAs over their head, making sure that they’re moving forward.” This can also be escalated to increase pressure on the internal team, as R3 sometimes does: “Break it to the board. Here’s the risk that is coming from older bugs that are not being fixed. Create pressure from the top and create responsibility.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some companies spend a considerable amount of resources to inform and train their staff to fix bugs early and quickly, as R7 recollects: “They do now understand what we are talking about, they do understand the SLA and that they need to fix that.” Other companies have been less successful. The best R1 could get was a compromise over a 90-day response: “Even that had to be a bit of a battle with our developers internally. Seriously? […] 90 days is a long time.” The team has since agreed to “shorten it down but even then, once in a while, a vulnerability stretches a bit beyond for whatever reason” – an “unfortunate” result according to the manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;negotiating-the-disclosure-schedule&quot;&gt;Negotiating the disclosure schedule&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After fixing the bug, there can still be tensions around the timing of the disclosure of the bug. Researchers are usually independent workers in a reputation-based market: they want to quickly promote their skills to the community by describing how they found a specific bug (online or at key industry events). This desire to publicize their finding clashes with the desire of companies to keep control over the communication and timing of public disclosure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies try to work out a timeline with researchers to make sure they have time to fix the bug internally, then issue a patch to their clients and leave them time to implement it, before they (or the researcher) publicly disclose the bug, as R2 put it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If we disclose to the public, we’re actually zero-dating our own customers, which is not a good thing to do. We give them pre-notice and say, okay, this is going to come out in 90 days, here is our suggested security implementation […] They then will do whatever work they need to. If they need to hold for whatever reason then we’ll go back to the security researcher and say, this is what’s going on, we’re going to be delayed for two weeks. At that point, once the 90 days are up, we disclose the vulnerability publicly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managers mention hackers frequently using such a threat of disclosing: R4 recollects that “many times we receive a submission that starts with: ‘I intend to disclose this within 90 days, here’s the issue.’” Hackers might have experienced past poor treatment from a client or the vendor’s triager and might be keen on getting their attention via a preliminary show of force. It can also be a way of guaranteeing a speedy treatment of their report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, the disclosure of a bug usually happens via negotiation between the client and the hacker. Program managers have experience and procedures to deal with such a threat and will usually engage with researchers to control the narrative around the bug. R4 mentions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If they are going to disclose, we have playbooks for responsible disclosure where we ask them: “Hey, can you share the blog with us? Can we have a say in the blog? Can we change this? Can you work with us here?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;managers-perception-of-articulation-work&quot;&gt;Managers’ perception of articulation work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scholarship on platform labor tends to emphasize how labor management via platforms generates hardship for workers. Adopting a symmetrical point of view and looking at the managers of the programs, we look here at their perception of how the platform shapes their work. Managers appreciate the fact that the minimal involvement of the platform allows them to interact directly with the hacker’s community which is, for many, an important reason to have a bug bounty program. They acknowledge, nonetheless, that the model generates adversarial interactions with hackers due to competing interests and timing. They do not, however, want more involvement from the platform, except in rare cases where mediation is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many managers, attending events, hosting receptions, talking to highly skilled hackers, and learning about new techniques are all aspects of bounty hunting that they value. R11 remembers the positive outcome of attending a hacker’s event: “it was awesome, to meet the hackers in person, to have a chat with them, see the real person behind the username, shake hands, have some fun together, and collaborate during the live hacking event.” R6 mentions the importance of “putting names to faces” via informal meetups at conferences:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;we’re going to a conference, let’s take everyone out to dinner or happy hour or something to put names to faces. And [to] recognize people as humans rather than just a name on the other side of the screen somewhere around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others like R7 have deeply integrated the organization of hacking event as part of their bug bounty management:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;From two years ago to now, we spent a lot of money going to different countries and organizing hacking events. And getting there with them to try to help them to their vulnerability or try to answer their questions in a close way. That’s very important to be close with them. Not just in terms of playing, but in terms of people skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managers acknowledge, however, that not all interactions with hackers go well. The platform brings together two actors with opposed goals: hackers want money and timely processing for their reports, and managers must enforce a scope of accepted bugs, a reward scale, and a timeline for remediation. These two interests can clash. As R2 put it: “Sometimes hackers behave badly. We had an instance where somebody […] was unhappy with the results of their submission, and they started basically harassing and stalking [the employee].” In such cases, the vendor can act as a mediator in the conflict. This is important to managers such as R2 to “make sure that there’s a code of conduct, make sure that there’s an escalation policy.” The effect is usually positive: “Sometimes having that objective third party is enough to calm the situation down.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One step further, dealing with hackers can have strong implications on managers’ mental health. As R2 carries on: “There is a high burnout rate because everyone’s mad at you all the time no matter what you do.” Their company has implemented a surprising measure against this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There’s a company out there called [ – ] and they do conflict resolution training. It’s funny because the person who created it was an FBI hostage negotiator. All of our team goes through that training. And it’s basically to help you figure out how you do not internalize when people are yelling at you all day long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This minimal engagement of vendors, leaving the managers the work to animate the program, directly echoes the model of platform as an empty shell. However, despite the tensions this model can generate, managers do not ask for greater platform involvement. As R5 put it, the direct link to the researchers is the lasting bond they want to create, and it is stronger without the mediation of the platform:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I think for our organization, we want to have that direct line with the researchers. We want our brand to be associated to it, not necessarily the vendor […] Because vendor relationships change. And we want that loyalty towards us, not other places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While managers acknowledge the difficulties with several actors and tasks, they do not want the vendor to be more present in their relationship with hackers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-and-future-research&quot;&gt;Conclusion and future research&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine if the user of a ride-sharing application, to obtain their ride, had to first get in touch with the drivers’ community, convince them to come to their location, and proactively maintain good rapport to keep getting rides? While this sounds unconceivable in many sectors, it is exactly the work bug bounty vendors ask their clients to perform to get hackers reporting bugs to their programs. While our sample of respondents is relatively small, our analysis of the manager’s side of a such programs complements existing scholarship on bug bounty, which overwhelmingly focuses on hackers. Drawing upon the concept of platforms as an “empty shell”, we reveal that managers must engage in four types of articulation work to make their program a success. Each of the important stages of a typical bug bounty pipeline (1. obtaining bug reports, 2. reviewing the report, 3. fixing the bug, and 4. disclosing it) generates four sub-projects that are necessary for the success of the program (respectively, to 1. to attract quality hackers, 2. to manage the noise, 3. to find the asset owner, and 4. to negotiate the disclosure schedule with hackers), cf. Figure 1. Managers coordinate all these sub-projects and align them toward the arc of the project. Furthermore, while this study included respondents with a public and / or a private program, further research uncovering the reasons why managers choose one versus the other (or both), and what effects this choice has on the articulation work with the other actors involved, could extend the results from this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The specific case of bug bounty platform enriches the analysis of digital platforms by highlighting a set of new tensions, summarized in Table 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9t3LV2R.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1. Summary of current and future research.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the article shows that focusing only on the labor side (in this case, the hackers) misses half of the consequences this model has on platform work, and it makes a case to symmetrically look at consequences on the demand side. Second, it expands existing calls for the analysis of how the platform model shapes labor via the absence of constraints, which is as powerful as its constraints to shape labor. Third, while resistance to platforms’ constraints can be important and generative, some actors endorse the “empty shell” that the platform provides. Fourth, while platform scholars aim to design a governance model adapted to the agency of platforms, some actors are satisfied with the minimal involvement of platform owners. Finally, the concept of articulation work and CSCW writ large are useful perspectives to critically study the consequences of the platform model on labor, and we hope more research will adopt this interdisciplinary perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

Europe needs a new doctrine that places cyberspace at the heart of strategic planning, bridging civil and military domains for national resilience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent shift in US strategic posture towards Europe and trade is beginning to reveal significant implications, particularly in cyberspace and the role of the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe must not only equip itself with a defence strategy that substantially boosts investment and enhances its own autonomous capabilities, but it must also reframe how it integrates the cyber domain within its broader defence architecture. This article outlines how Europe needs a new doctrine for defence in cyberspace and makes three key proposals to accelerate and consolidate civil-military cyber convergence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While cyberspace has been formally recognised as the fourth operational domain – alongside land, sea, and air – this designation has yet to translate into making it a central pillar of defence strategy. Being recognised as a domain is not the same as being treated as central in strategic planning and operational doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyberspace is not only a theatre of operations in its own right; it is a critical enabler that underpins and intersects with all other domains. What remains lacking is the “how” – the frameworks, doctrines, and institutional mechanisms needed to embed cyber at the heart of defence planning and execution, also covering the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional defence doctrine is not readily applicable to cyberspace, due to the fundamentally different nature of the domain. Unlike kinetic environments, cyberspace does not conform to the laws of physical space, and it is shaped by a vastly different set of actors and dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The private sector plays a decisive role – not only as a provider of technology, but as the operator of essential national services. This dual dependence on infrastructure and private operators demands a radically new approach to integration, coordination, and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional defence doctrine falls short in cyberspace, necessitating the transformation of National Cyber Coordination Centres into real-time operational hubs that integrate civilian, military, and critical infrastructure actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-limits-of-traditional-approaches&quot;&gt;The Limits of Traditional Approaches&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is precisely this complexity that demands new frameworks and doctrines. Rather than treating it as an afterthought, the cyber domain must become a central pillar of Europe’s evolving defence architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional battlefields, cyberspace operates as a single, interconnected domain where technological architecture serves multiple purposes simultaneously. A server that hosts military communications could be technically indistinguishable from one supporting critical financial infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, traditional military strategies, designed for physical spaces governed by kinetic force, fall short in the cyber domain. A bullet, for instance, is universally recognised across contexts as a weapon. In contrast, a string of digital code has no inherent meaning until it is interpreted within a specific technological and operational framework – one that can vary dramatically depending on the context, the technology in question, and the identity of the operator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes cyber defence much more complex and creates a strong link between the infrastructure and its cyber threat detection and attribution, significantly increasing complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address the limits of traditional approaches, an Extended Permanent Cyber Defence Force composed of cybersecurity professionals embedded in their civilian roles should be established to optimise national resources and ensure scalable and rapid national cyber defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-fragmented-system-gaps-in-governance-and-risk-management&quot;&gt;A Fragmented System: Gaps in Governance and Risk Management&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most cyberspace operators and assets are privately owned. Consequently, private enterprises are both the primary targets of cyberattacks and frontline defenders against these threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;National cybersecurity agencies have developed regulatory frameworks aimed at fortifying critical infrastructure protections. However, while the private sector should not only comply with regulations but also proactively collaborate with governmental and military institutions to enhance collective defence mechanisms, this is currently missing from many cyber defence approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The protection of critical infrastructures is almost everywhere the responsibility of civilian agencies, with little or no coordination with the defence side. While many countries have identified a connection between defence and national cyber authorities, these are often in the form of committees that are involved in case of conflicts or major incidents, as for example the model adopted by US with Presidential Policy Directive 42 of 2016, that creates a patchwork of overlapping authorities without a clear operational model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has been one of the first countries to promote an Integrated Operating Concept, which has been followed by a new version of the National Cyber Strategy, that established the National Cyber Force (NCF), a joint unit between the MoD and GCHQ (intelligence), but only to conduct offensive cyber operations. The integrated operating model is providing ambitious objectives around multidomain integration and developing an integration model that is different from operating and warfighting – something essential for cyber as resilience can only be built overtime in preparation for warfighting. But even these examples show we are still missing the definition of an operational doctrine to develop and fully implement the high-level objectives given by the strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the often-overlooked web of interdependencies between infrastructures, the challenge is not just about protecting isolated systems but understanding how failures in one domain can cascade through interconnected systems. These connections form an intricate network where vulnerabilities in one sector can have profound ripple effects across others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An even subtler form of dependency arises from shared technologies. Independent operators may unknowingly rely on the same technological components, such as widely used software or hardware platforms. A cyberattack exploiting a vulnerability in this shared technology could simultaneously compromise a vast array of seemingly unrelated infrastructures. A particularly telling example is the deployment of identical solar panel controllers across numerous independently managed facilities. In 2024 a targeted attack against this common technological point already disrupted energy generation on a relevant scale, effectively turning what appears to be a decentralised system into a single “virtual critical infrastructure” with national-level consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many countries have established strong regulatory foundations and dedicated cybersecurity agencies, this must still translate into practical, effective action. Current frameworks often focus too heavily on individual infrastructures without fully considering the broader systemic risks posed by interconnectivity and technological convergence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, countries such as the UK, France, Germany and Italy all place the onus of protection primarily on the individual operators, which are responsible for identifying threats and countermeasures almost autonomously. It is true that all four countries mention information sharing and early warning as key enablers, but most operators of essential services have not integrated cyber risk into their broader risk management frameworks and, on the other side, national authorities struggle to have a systemic view of the national and sectorial risks, as confirmed by the lack of standards and taxonomies for sharing threat scenarios and impact on critical services. Another confirmation comes from the separation on the EU DORA regulation and the NIS2 directive between incident reporting and information sharing arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;building-integrated-civil-military-cyber-ecosystems&quot;&gt;Building Integrated Civil-Military Cyber Ecosystems&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The convergence between military and civilian authorities in cybersecurity has become an essential component of national and collective defence strategies across NATO and allied nations. Institutional configurations, such as NATO’s Integrated Cyber Defence Centre, the US. Joint Cyber Defence Collaborative, and the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre structurally embed cooperation between armed forces, intelligence agencies, civilian cyber authorities and critical infrastructure operators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joint cyber exercises – including NATO’s Cyber Coalition, US Cyber Guard, and Israel’s joint civil-military national drills (Cyber Dome) – serve as crucial testing grounds to rehearse coordinated responses to complex cyberattacks, strengthening interoperability between military cyber units, national CERTs, law enforcement and private-sector operators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information-sharing mechanisms have been formalised through platforms like NATO’s Malware Information Sharing Platform, the UK’s Cyber Information Sharing Partnership, and the US Cyber Information Sharing and Collaboration Program, ensuring rapid, bidirectional threat intelligence flows between defence entities and civilian stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public–private partnerships have expanded with initiatives such as the UK’s Defence Cyber Protection Partnership and Israel’s close industry-military ties, reflecting the recognition that national defence relies heavily on securing privately operated critical infrastructure. Additionally, innovative models, such as Estonia’s volunteer Cyber Defence League and Israel’s fluid workforce between military units and the tech sector, illustrate how talent and expertise can seamlessly operate across civil and military spheres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these convergence efforts have significantly matured, they often remain reactive, fragmented, or bound by temporary frameworks, primarily mobilised during crises rather than embedded as part of permanent national defence postures. Moreover, legal, cultural and operational barriers continue to slow the full institutionalisation of truly integrated civil-military cyber ecosystems. To overcome these limits, three decisive actions are needed to accelerate and consolidate civil-military cyber convergence into a cohesive and scalable model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, national cyber authorities should expand their strategies and frameworks to explicitly integrate the military dimension of cyber defence, establishing clear, permanent coordination mechanisms with armed forces to ensure comprehensive protection of national digital assets. This requires not only aligning responsibilities and processes but also fostering joint planning, information sharing and response protocols. At the NATO level, a common doctrinal and operational framework should be developed to guide member states, ensuring full interoperability in multinational contexts and enabling effective execution of multidomain operations, where cyber defence plays a critical role alongside traditional military domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, governments should expand the operational capabilities of their National Cyber Coordination Centres (NCCCs), transforming them into real-time operational hubs that integrate civilian, military and critical infrastructure actors. These centres should deliver shared situational awareness, fusing threat intelligence from military sources with civilian network monitoring to better predict the potential impacts of cyber threats on vital services and infrastructure. This joint operational picture would enable dynamic defence actions, improve proactive mitigation strategies and become indispensable during military operations that risk spilling over into the cyber domain – ensuring that civilian systems are defended and national resilience maintained during periods of heightened tension or conflict. Some countries such as the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Israel and Australia have already started this journey. Other national cyber authorities have started to integrate military personnel into their structure to create a stable channel with the military, like the Italian National Cyber Agency (ACN).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, an extended permanent cyber defence force (EPCDF) would address structural constraints and optimise national resources. This force would be composed of cybersecurity professionals who remain embedded in their civilian roles – whether in the private sector, critical infrastructure, research, or public administration – while being permanently integrated into national cyber defence efforts under military coordination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional reservist models, the EPCDF represents a constant, distributed defence capability operating in parallel with formal military structures, ensuring that national cyber defence is not only scalable and rapid but also deeply rooted within the systems it protects. Through joint training, shared platforms, and active participation in national cyber defence strategies, this network of civilian professionals would operate as a standing line of defence, turning the entire national cyber ecosystem into a strategic asset for deterrence, resilience, and response in both peacetime and crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These three actions would transform today’s fragmented and reactive collaborations into a coherent, institutional and enduring national defence framework, bridging the military, civilian and private sectors as a unified force to counter increasingly complex and persistent cyber threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of this strategic landscape, the development of new frameworks – and, in military terms, a new doctrine – is no longer optional; it is essential. Addressing the challenges outlined above requires institutional initiatives to accelerate the doctrinal process, overcoming the inertia and timelines that traditionally characterise defence reform. Within NATO, the pathway from early conceptualisation to full doctrinal maturity can take up to a decade. When factoring in external actors such as EU institutions, national authorities and private-sector critical infrastructure providers, that timeline could stretch to 20 years before tangible impact is realised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is clearly untenable. What is needed is a fundamental acceleration of doctrine development, anchored in a new model of private-sector participation from the outset. This must be accompanied by the immediate, agile adoption of core principles to guide collaboration, resilience, and readiness across sectors. Institutions like the European Union, NATO, and leading research centres must play a catalytic role in initiating this shift – one that aligns strategic urgency with operational agility to meet the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent Conservative governments were increasingly concerned with recognising that defence spending should contribute to UK prosperity. The Labour government, elected in July 2024, has firmly underlined this stance. In its consultation paper on national industrial strategy, the defence sector is identified as a key sector for growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In government policy, private sector defence spending aims to further multiple goals. Spending is traditionally associated with enabling UK forces to deter and frustrate aggressive adversaries, but even this is not a simple matter when a sustained conventional conflict occurs. Today, the risks of relying on foreign suppliers appear to be higher than a decade ago. Further, the outputs of the defence industry become a foreign policy tool when they are provided to others, such as Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These considerations make the defence industry a cornerstone in generating UK security. But defence-focused installations, including military bases, do also provide employment and local spending for businesses and, formally since 2015, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has been charged with using funds to support greater national prosperity. Thus, although defence spending serves multiple purposes, government policy does not precisely direct how different ends are to be weighted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Philip Dunne, a former procurement minister, found when he prepared his report on the value of the defence industry to the UK economy, there is an information problem due to the multiple sectors that are involved with defence: the MoD buys everything from office furniture to combat aircraft. This paper points to findings about which there can be considerable confidence while also noting where more research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the defence industry appears as a small element in the overall UK economy, it looms much larger once the most prosperous areas of the UK (London and the southeast) are removed from the picture. As the UK defence industry is predominantly located outside London, the importance of good salaries, a skilled workforce and above average productivity is enhanced when prosperity is the focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although defence is making increasing use of electronics and software, major weapons and platforms must be engineered and physically manufactured. Consequently, many defence industrial sites are located in areas that were part of the Industrial Revolution. Shipbuilding and its support are concentrated in historical coastal sites in Scotland and the southwest. Submarine building has become the maritime focus at Barrow-in-Furness in the northwest since the early 20th century. And as UK coastal areas are poorer than the overall UK average region, these defence sites play a significant role in sustaining economic stability in those areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aircraft became a national endeavour during the First and Second World Wars but their construction and design have since become concentrated around Blackburn and Preston in the northwest, although their engines and other subsystems are made elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While basic economic principles assert that the labour and capital resources of failing businesses will normally be taken over by others with better prospects, UK and wider international experience is that areas dominated by long-standing industries such as textiles, coal, steel, pottery and mechanical engineering take much longer to recover when such industries fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the defence industry in the UK should be recognised as a protection against impoverishment. There is wide recognition of the long-term social deprivation of a town where the workforce has been run down – for example, the shipyard’s workforce on the Trident programme in Barrow-in-Furness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defence businesses in the UK also positively contribute to the development of the national economy. With a longer-term prospect of orders, defence businesses train apprentices and graduates, some of whom become available to the commercial economy. They push forward areas of technology, including digital engineering, which is starting to dominate most manufacturing sectors. Firms in defence supply chains must use MoD standards for the protection of their IT systems, which promotes cybersecurity both nationally and in firms that work on both military and commercial contracts. This includes large firms such as Leonardo, Rolls Royce and Airbus, as well as thousands of smaller firms. Additionally, the limited exposure of defence to commercial economic cycles supports both those firms and wider resilience when the wider economy is suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK government has committed to factoring in the prosperity-generating aspect of defence to its defence equipment decisions. This can play a key role where economic infrastructure is otherwise degraded. However, the lack of concrete methods to measure prosperity-related impact often leaves this factor undervalued when deciding between international and domestic bids. This paper addresses this gap by offering a more nuanced perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The significance and value of defence industry businesses have often been contested. This attitude can be traced back to post-First World War writing countering private sector involvement in supplying defence, President Dwight D Eisenhower’s warning about the power of a military–industrial complex, and debates about the impact of defence spending on economic growth. The 2020s have seen the rise of Environmental, Social and Governance standards that sometimes classify investing in defence as “unethical”. While this line of argument has been weakened by the acknowledgement of the defence industry’s importance in supporting Ukraine, it has re-emerged through controversies surrounding the Israel–Hamas war in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spending on defence could be seen as a necessary evil. In an ideal world where armed forces were no longer needed, dismantling the defence industry would be a welcome challenge. Some felt this was the situation in the early 1990s: as demand for defence products declined, many defence companies sought business in the commercial world, which proved more difficult than expected. The leading UK example of failure concerned the General Electric Company (GEC), the large UK engineering and defence business, which sold its defence interests to BAE Systems in 1999 and moved into telecommunications a few years later. In the 2020s, changes in Russian foreign policy, an increasingly unstable Middle East and northern Africa, and China’s more assertive posture have generated a significant security agenda for Western countries. Equipping their armed forces adequately is back on the European political agenda. The UK government seeks independence in its use of and access to assured capabilities and materiel, pointing to the necessity of critical British industrial capabilities that can provide it. At the same time, political leaders are calling for defence choices to contribute to spreading prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 1 shows the multiple objectives and decisions to be served by defence spending with the private sector. Some are inter-related: for instance, operational independence is closely linked to, and even based on, industrial capability. While acknowledging all these areas, this paper focuses on prosperity and considers how the UK defence industry relates to UK economic prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has four chapters. Chapter I focuses on the key factors shaping the UK defence economy and considers the context of government policy towards the defence industry in the UK. This chapter also discusses the question of how much money is involved and considers the range of goods and services bought by the UK defence industry, and how much suppliers are focused on the defence market. Chapter II recognises that the defence industry is a relatively small part of the economy but with a disproportionate impact. Reasons for this include high pay levels, advanced technologies and the interactions between military and commercial work. The industry’s regional presence also plays a vital role, often supporting areas that are otherwise economically struggling. The chapter also considers the probable fate of defence sector-dependent areas should that business disappear. Chapter III outlines the areas in the UK in which it is likely that a significant defence industry will have a positive impact on the wider manufacturing base, where the development of skills and knowledge in defence include additive manufacturing technologies, communication technologies and digital engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology-the-residual-data-problem&quot;&gt;Methodology: The Residual Data Problem&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper does not directly address the difficult question of how value in defence should be defined. It is a multifaceted concept that is subjective and dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper uses a range of existing datasets in its descriptive analysis, including government statistics, commercial studies and academic research. It also makes reference to studies from independent consultancies sponsored by individual large firms to assess their contributions to the economy. However, despite all this quantitative information, the complexity and scale of the defence industrial sector mean that much is still unknown. Former procurement minister Philip Dunne highlighted this in his 2018 report on defence in the economy. In response, during the same year, the Joint Economic Data Hub (JEDHub) was established within the Ministry of Defence’s (MoD) Defence Solutions Centre to enhance data collection and reporting on this area. The JEDHub has since published three annual reports, the latest in April 2024, which this paper uses for its analysis and on which it builds. For much of its information, the JEDHub relies significantly on the willingness of 22 companies to collect and send information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key issue with these statistics is the definition of “defence business”. As outlined in Chapter I, the range of products and services supplied to defence is broad. This paper focuses on the specialised defence business, as this sector is mostly not driven by traditional market dynamics. The complexity, the required expertise to develop and produce defence technology and the value of major defence products, such as platforms, mean that there is often only one or very few suppliers. At the same time, these suppliers have only one primary customer – the MoD. This makes the relationship between supply and demand special and requires policy to govern that relationship. One effect is that the MoD potentially has greater agency in shaping the market than it would in a market where it is one of many customers. This paper is concerned therefore with a key driver of that policy – the economic impact of UK defence businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key definitional problem remains: even businesses that specialise in defence technology may also have a substantive commercial business. Thus, there is a need to differentiate between their activities for defence and for the commercial market. This can be hard to describe statistically because of the lack of a distinct definition of what constitutes “defence business”. For instance, dual-use items may be primarily developed and produced both for defence and for the commercial sector. This has an impact on the effect that defence spending has on jobs associated with that business and is also difficult to measure. There is no easy way to establish the necessary share of a firm’s work being devoted to a defence product for it to qualify as a “defence business”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statistical datasets struggle with accurately pinning down the regional impact of the defence industry. This is because regional data is often compiled from the address to which money is paid, but not necessarily from where the cost has been incurred. Also problematic is the challenge of discerning what contributes a “British defence business” when the headquarters is located overseas. At the turn of the millennium, the Blair government concluded that a range of factors impacted “Britishness”, including where technology was created, where skills and intellectual property resided, where jobs were, and where investment is made. Clearly these are related but separate elements, although the link between jobs and investment is normally close. A significant part of this framework was that the location of ownership and overall control was considered not relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, the UK activities of firms such as Airbus, Leonardo, Thales, Raytheon and General Dynamics are all treated as “British” businesses, even though they are all foreign owned. They add significant value to UK jobs and the UK economy, are permitted to be members of the UK industrial body Aerospace, Defence &amp;amp; Security (ADS), and several were part of the former UK Defence Suppliers Forum. It should be stressed that there are many more foreign-owned businesses in the UK carrying out defence work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of decades of privatisation, almost all businesses supplying the MoD are in the private sector. Those whose shares are available on the London Stock Exchange can be bought by funds from around the world, although the government does keep an eye on foreign purchases that would give a controlling interest to foreign businesses. Additionally, over the last two decades, important second-tier UK-owned firms have been bought either by foreign primes (for example, Lucas Aerospace is now part of GE Aerospace), or by capital funds looking to generate more value through restructuring (while generating an option of selling off part, or the whole of, the business). GKN, bought by UK-based Melrose, Cobham, bought by Advent International and Ultra Electronics, bought by the now US-based Cobham share this experience. In early 2025, the latest target of a US investor has reportedly been the defensive aid business Chemring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all this in mind, this paper uses the best information currently available, noting that the most common limitation in the JEDHub work is the omission of defence data rather than overstatement of defence claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-government-policy-on-the-defence-industry&quot;&gt;I. Government Policy on the Defence Industry&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper was primarily prepared in the context of previous Conservative government policy, which encouraged the MoD to use its resources to deliver on multiple objectives beyond securing military advantages for the UK’s armed forces. The 2021 Defence and Security Industrial Strategy referred to “critical industrial capabilities” as “a vital strategic asset in their own right”. Defence choices should provide the UK government with operational independence regarding the use of its armed forces, contribute to UK economic prosperity and levelling-up agendas, and strengthen the UK. The current Labour government’s January 2024 paper on safeguarding the UK made particular reference to the role of the defence industry in Northern Ireland. Since coming into office in July, the government has also underlined its expectation that the defence sector should benefit the UK economy. Its Green Paper on UK industrial policy identified the defence sector as a key sector to driving growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper directly addresses how to build, strengthen and sustain UK prosperity, with limited attention paid to the link between domestic industrial capability and the government’s desire for operational independence in its forces, which would be compromised if domestic defence firms fall short. However, the importance of operational independence should not be overlooked, especially as the UK aspires to use its forces for purposes other than the defence of national and allied territory. This paper also does not consider the economic impact of spending on governmental defence establishments in detail. However, it recognises that some military bases are of great local significance in terms of direct civil employment, as are those who deliver infrastructure projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In principle, the current government could abandon all these policy stances, but its previous positions on defence suggest that this is unlikely. In fact, the government would like to generate further positive economic benefits from defence spending, and has identified defence as a key sector for economic advances in its first paper on national industrial strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-much-money-is-spent&quot;&gt;How Much Money is Spent?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MoD data for 2023/24 separates payments to the US government for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) items – which the US Department of Defense (DoD) then buys for the UK from US industry – from direct transactions with UK and overseas industry. The MoD knows that some FMS work is carried out in the UK, particularly with the F-35 fighter aircraft, and reports its value. The MoD also reports on spending directly with industry worldwide and the proportion that is spent in the UK. Thus, it is possible to discern how much money has been spent in the UK and how much has been spent overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The total amount spent by the MoD globally with UK and foreign-owned organisations was £38.2 billion in 2023/4, of which £600 million was on FMS deals with the US. Of this, the total spent with UK firms was £28.8 billion. Excluding mine-protected vehicles for Afghanistan and Iraq, such as Mastiff and Ridgeback, the list of platforms bought from the US in the last 15 years includes C-17 transport aircraft, F-35s, Predator remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAs), Reaper RPAs, Apache A-64E attack helicopters, Rivet Joint electronic intelligence aircraft, Chinook helicopters, Wedgetail airborne command and control aircraft and P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft. The latest data from the US State Department (published in 2019) showed that the UK imported three times more defence equipment from the US than Germany did, and seven times more than France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defence firms and the government seek to use the domestic defence goods and services market as the basis for exports to foreign governments. The scale of exports is a matter of some contention since the data collected in the UK and published by the government typically addresses orders rather than the deliveries that often follow years later. The data shows that the five-year average of defence exports between 2018 and 2022 was around £10 billion a year, equivalent to 40–50% of what the UK MoD buys overall. The aerospace sector dominates defence exports and the Gulf states have emerged as major customers. However, the full picture is more complex. Rolls-Royce and Leonardo sell important subsystems, such as radars, to a wider range of customers. The Swedish Gripen, for instance, has a Leonardo radar from the UK, some Japanese ships have Rolls-Royce engines, the New Zealand navy has MBDA missiles, and BAE Systems has provided technical help for other national combat aircraft programmes, including in Sweden and Korea. There is no assurance that UK-developed and UK-built military equipment would succeed in export markets, but extensive reliance on imports certainly erodes the UK defence industry’s export potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-does-the-ministry-of-defence-buy-and-from-whom&quot;&gt;What Does the Ministry of Defence Buy, and from Whom?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goods and services used by the defence industry span a vast range of categories. At one end, governmental defence customers require generic commercial goods and services, such as office furniture, sports clothing for soldiers, fuel and catering services. There are many potential suppliers in these areas, and the MoD is just one of multiple customers, and could account for just a small part of such firms’ sales. Moreover, the entry barriers for firms trying to break into most of these areas are modest in terms of the required expertise, facilities and finance. New firms can come in while poorer performers disappear. Such commercial products have many characteristics of perfect markets on which much of conventional economics is based.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the large middle are firms supplying goods and services on a commercial basis, but which involve little to major modification to make them suitable for defence use. Trucks, roll-on roll-off ferries, some helicopter types and some UAVs have these attributes. A useful delineator of such goods is whether they are defined in export control law and regulation as dual-use goods requiring export licences before they can be sold to a foreign customer. The UK list of dual-use goods is extensive, covering some 350 pages in the government’s Export Control List. The list also contains 36 pages for specialised defence areas, such as combat aircraft, artillery pieces, armoured vehicles and warships. Suppliers of major platforms and systems for defence tend to have very different problems, opportunities and natures from those in the commercial world. There is just one key initial customer for a UK specialised defence supplier – the MoD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-ministry-of-defence-and-armed-forces-as-sole-buyers&quot;&gt;The Ministry of Defence and Armed Forces as Sole Buyers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Navies, air forces and, to an increasing extent, armies rely on platforms to move and indeed to operate. Platforms are thus important, with many remaining in service for decades. For example, there was a 20-year gap between one UK Army order for an armoured combat vehicle (Challenger 2 in 1994) and the next (Ajax in 2014). For firms required to develop, produce and sell such platforms, a viable business model can be difficult to specify because national orders can be rare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When intervals have been long between domestic orders of a military product category, the unsuccessful firm in a bidding competition, or even the winning firm, often either closes or sells that part of its business. Other firms have behaved similarly when they believed that their overall defence order prospects were too limited. In 1989, General Electric, Plessey, Vickers Shipbuilding &amp;amp; Engineering, Devonport Management, Ferranti, Hunting, Racal, Thorn EMI, Vickers plc and Westland were among the 18 suppliers listed by the MoD as among its top suppliers paid more than £100 million in 1987–88. Today, none exist as a separate entity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, UK defence in 2025 is often marked by a monopsony buyer (one buyer among many sellers) facing an oligopoly or even a monopoly seller. This is not just a UK phenomenon, with oligopolies or even national champion companies facing the defence ministries of countries such as France, Germany and even the US. After 1993, as noted by Michael Brown, “America’s 50 main defense suppliers consolidated to five. Today, the top six suppliers to the U.S. Department of Defense receive two-thirds of all procurement dollars”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some companies survive in the sector through export orders and by generating required upgrades to older systems. However, it is never easy to sell a defence product internationally that has not been endorsed – that is, bought by the armed forces of that company’s national government. Moreover, a growing number of countries are seeking to develop their own defence industrial capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is here that several policy directions meet. The UK government wants operational independence regarding the use of its forces, which means the UK should enjoy access to a capable industrial base. To survive commercially, a firm requires continuity in development, production and support work. For national and regional prosperity, a region needs defence businesses that provide secure and sustained opportunities. A firm might struggle to attract and train specialised young staff if they will only have a job in their locality for eight or nine years. The Appledore shipyard in Devon, for example, had minimal work once it had completed its blocks of the Queen Elizabeth-class carriers. Babcock closed the shipyard in 2019, and its yard in Rosyth, Scotland has no assured shipbuilding work once the five Type 31 fleet is completed. There is uncertainty about the Type 32 project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boards and personnel of major defence firms should not be drawn into complacency and must be aware that their position depends on their delivery record, creating a synergistic relationship between government and defence business. If firms perform well, they enjoy security and the government obtains operational independence and military capability. If companies fall short, they are likely to lose their business with the government, and the government will have to turn to foreign suppliers. The price of this, for government, is the loss of a credible claim to operational independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some firms that have a significant defence portfolio can choose whether they will focus entirely on defence sector equipment or whether they want to also compete in the commercial sector. In a comparison of three UK firms in the Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP), BAE Systems is 96% dependent on revenue from defence sector products; Leonardo 75%; and Rolls-Royce 25%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deeper investigations go into supply chains, the more it is revealed that firms address both defence and commercial markets. Every firm has its own concept of how defence work fits into its overall strategy and business model. Specialised defence products contain components, and even subsystems, that are produced by firms serving both commercial and military markets, and it is likely that there are more than 10,000 firms in the UK that have some defence business. From a prosperity perspective, a crucial, yet unresearched, question concerns the extent to which a mixed commercial–military firm benefits from more defence work or suffers from its cancellation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To contain external dependence while seeking the claimed benefits of competition and maintaining access to advanced systems, successive governments in the UK have allowed, or even encouraged, foreign defence firms to invest in the UK. Each firm has its own individual pattern of activity, which can address some or all R&amp;amp;D, manufacturing and support activities. Airbus, Leonardo, MBDA and Thales are the most prominent firms from Europe operating in the UK, while General Dynamics (about 1,500 employees), Lockheed Martin (about 1,700) and Raytheon (about 2,000) are the larger US firms operating in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further feature of the market for many defence systems is that the purchase price is often just the beginning, with direct in-service costs exceeding the purchase within a decade. A US DoD memorandum observed 15 years ago that: “Sustainment costs have five to ten times more impact on total life cycle costs than do RDT&amp;amp;E [research, development, test and evaluation] costs”. Frontline defence equipment is still generally designed for high-level performance rather than the maintenance-free operating periods that form the basis for most commercial equipment. Military platforms and many of their subsystems are supplied and supported on the basis of mean time between failure rates that would be unacceptable in commercial markets. The US is more open about availability than the UK: in 2021, across the US Air Force, for every 10 aircraft in its possession, three were unavailable at any one point in time. As of 2022, all variants of the F-35 had lower availability rates than this. Other reports indicate that the situation has not much improved, if at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These factors mean that defence maintenance, repair and overhaul absorb significant costs, but also provide much work for the industry. Many in-service needs can only be supplied by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), which may opt to offer a modest initial purchase price, knowing that it can charge handsomely for parts supply and related services over the following decades. Total in-service costs are much harder to calculate than “sticker prices” and are much less available in the public domain. However, particularly with combat aircraft, UK governments have pursued in-service support savings by contracting with the lead companies for availability and reliability rather than simply supplying parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An increasing challenge in the 2020s is that there is an opportunity, and in some cases a need, for regular upgrades to military equipment as opposed to just maintenance and repair, given the increased electronic content and software of many systems. In defence (as in the commercial world), firms are usually reluctant to transfer full intellectual property (IP) rights to a user, which would be needed for the government to make its own arrangements for the modification and even repair of equipment. Understandably, some governments are seeking to weaken the power of OEMs, but this is not easy given legitimate concerns about safety, fair trade and the commercial importance of IP for the firm involved. The bottom line is that in defence, the governmental customer can feel itself to be subject to vendor lock-in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defence industrial capabilities and behaviours are also central to governmental efforts to protect the country and the government’s perception of the national interest. Happily, for the most part, defence activities are focused on deterrence and capability preparation, but actual military operations often place special demands on the industrial sector. Experience of protracted conflicts, including the Second World War, the Korean War and the ongoing war in Ukraine, have demonstrated the value of access to a strong and agile supply base. Maria Eagle, the UK Minister for Defence Procurement, observed at RUSI in March 2025:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Amidst the uncertainty surrounding European security … one thing … is certain and that’s a fighting force is only as strong as the industrial base that stands behind it. So transforming European defence industrial capabilities and boosting capacity are going to be integral to this defining mission of our time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the more recent British military operational activities, despite being less intense on an order of magnitude, placed urgent demands on the supply base. All these considerations result in the choice of this paper to focus on defence in the economy rather than “defence economics”, as well as why the government, like others, has accepted that the defence industrial base should be viewed as a strategic asset. However, as noted earlier in the Methodology section on data issues, there is no clear specification of which defence suppliers qualify as sufficiently British to be a strategic asset. What is most likely to interest the MoD, from an industrial capability perspective, is a firm’s capacity in R&amp;amp;D, integration and production, as well as support and upgrades. From a wealth-creation perspective, the scale of employment and salary levels should also loom large. Each of these considerations should inform the MoD’s approach to choosing firms, which will in turn inform the government’s strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-key-economic-contributions-of-defence-firms&quot;&gt;II. Key Economic Contributions of Defence Firms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter addresses the economic consequences of defence spending with the private sector rather than the consequences of defence spending overall. There is an argument that suitable defence spending boosts investor confidence, because defence spending assures potential investors that a country is unlikely to be attacked (and is thus a safe investment), but this is not addressed in this paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;defence-can-appear-economically-insignificant&quot;&gt;Defence Can Appear Economically Insignificant&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;National economic statistics signal that defence should be a minor factor in the UK economy. Defence’s share of the economy, at a little over 2.3% of GDP, has reduced from its Cold War percentage share (4.1%) and considerably reduced from what its share of GDP was 50 years ago (5.1%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defence has become a small part of the national R&amp;amp;D effort. The Office of National Statistics reported governmental R&amp;amp;D spending in 2022 as £2.1 billion on defence, with £13.4 billion focused on commercial purposes. For the economy as a whole, a parliamentary study notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Office for National Statistics (ONS) shows that, in 2020, total public and private expenditure on R&amp;amp;D in the UK was £61.8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, along with government funding from UK Research and Innovation, defence may be ready to support projects with a more distant return than that of some commercial firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding employment, MoD data for 2022/23 shows that defence accounted for a total of 434,000 UK jobs, which constitutes one in 60 UK jobs. Of these, 239,000 were in the private sector, and the MoD employed 58,000 civilians and 142,000 service personnel in the UK. (The private sector numbers exclude those involved in the promotion and delivery of defence exports.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The employment significance of exports is almost impossible to decipher since the levels of exports and the numbers of people involved varies from year to year. Thus, the significance of exports must include their potential to provide a continuity of work once UK needs have been met, which in turn sustains the industrial capabilities needed for the development and production of future systems. For some years, Thales in Belfast sustained a workforce and capability in anti-tank and short-range air defence missiles through exports. The RAF took delivery of its last Typhoon in 2019 and production has been sustained by sales to Austria, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, as well as additional deliveries to collaborative partner countries. At the 2024 Berlin airshow, Germany announced that it would be buying an additional 20 aircraft to cover the period until approximately 2040 (when the Franco-German SCAF aircraft should come into service).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of ships, although the sales of the Type 26 frigate to Australia and Canada mainly involve the design (the vessels will be built in the customer states), there are some subsystems involved that will be made in the UK. The same is true of the three Type 31 ships being bought by Poland. There are hopes of further sales of both vessels. Under Patrick Sanders as Chief of the General Staff, the Army focused on equipment modernisation and relationships with industry. In a keynote speech in 2023, Sanders said,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Like many other nations and Defence industries, we have studied the war carefully, identifying and learning valuable lessons which are shaping our decisions for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At RUSI, I trailed our initial response to these lessons and we have forged a credible plan for the British Army’s renewal. Renewal to make sure we can fight the war we must. A renewal founded in hard-won lessons of the past, orientated to the future to ensure that we emerge more lethal, agile, expeditionary and resilient, all underpinned by our digital framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This renewal is delivering now and gathering momentum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also underlined the need and opportunities for more exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its modest size, the defence industry has features that give it greater importance than numbers without context would imply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;high-productivity-pay-and-levels-of-knowledge-and-skills&quot;&gt;High Productivity, Pay and Levels of Knowledge and Skills&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defence firms feature high productivity rates, offer high salaries and are adept at generating knowledge and skills. JEDHub data shows that value added per employee is high in defence, with gross value added estimated in 2022 at £112,000, compared with the national average in manufacturing as a whole of £81,062.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the national level, the JEDHub (as well as company-sponsored studies) finds that salaries in the defence sector are higher than the UK average, and that salaries in the defence sector are higher than UK average pay in the manufacturing sector specifically. While this could make some government officials complain that the MoD is paying more than it should for its private sector labour, defence firms are under clear pressure to pay what is required to recruit and retain their expert staff, whose training they have often significantly funded. Moreover, firms serving both military and commercial markets, such as Rolls-Royce and Leonardo, who move their staff around, do not pay their employees in the commercial sector less than they do those in the military domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/EYer0qT.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: MoD Expenditure Per Capita with UK Industry by Region 2023/24.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/mod-regional-expenditure-statistics-with-industry-202324&quot;&gt;MoD, “MOD Regional Expenditure with Industry 2023/24”, 21 November 2024&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it could be argued that higher wages come at the expense of creating more, albeit lower-paying, jobs through government spending in other areas. However, higher salaries mean higher disposable incomes and a more significant multiplier effect in terms of supporting a wide range of businesses. For example, a 2024 study by Oxford Economics of Leonardo’s economic impact in the UK showed average wages at Leonardo Yeovil of £51,000 compared with the overall local average of £32,000, and that every Leonardo and Leonardo-supported job in its supply chain generated about a third of a job through employees’ spending in the wider economy. Oxford Economics also researched similar salaries and multiplier effect ratios for Leonardo’s Edinburgh electronics firm and other smaller UK sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Higher salaries also mean that the government gets more than a third of its defence industrial spending in the UK directly back in the form of national insurance payments, income tax, corporation tax and VAT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is likely that the eventual net cost to government revenues will be small when a foreign bid has succeeded, provided that an unsuccessful UK bidder has other projects to work on. But defence is a de facto UK government monopsony, meaning that a similar opportunity is often unavailable. As noted, British defence firms have been subject to multiple takeovers and plant closures over decades. This issue is discussed later in this paper in the section The Consequences of Defence Cuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further consideration is that while defence firms employ a high number of people from science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) backgrounds, they also train a large number of apprentices who become everything from skilled tradespeople to chartered engineers. For example, more than 10% of Leonardo’s employees in Luton and Edinburgh are graduate trainees, apprentices or placement students. In 2022, BAE Systems said it had invested approximately “£100m in education, skills and early careers activities in the UK annually”. In 2025, it will have a record 6,500 people in training, around 15% of its UK workforce. Such qualified young people become an important part of the UK’s overall stock of knowledgeable and skilled personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The view that defence firms do not spend their own money on R&amp;amp;D also needs to be qualified. Much of defence is R&amp;amp;D intensive and, while most defence funding comes from government, the 2024 JEDHub report found that up to 30% of defence R&amp;amp;D funding comes from the private sector. In relation to the wider economy, Dunne’s report observes that: “Historically, there has been a strong correlation between defence research and technological advances across society”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK governments usually make sure an announcement of a contract with a UK firm mentions how many jobs will be sustained and/or created, to allay any doubt regarding the positive economic consequences of defence spending. Also, perhaps as an effort to win favour from the first Trump administration, a British defence official based in Washington stressed in 2018 that British defence spending was increasing to America’s benefit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;That’s not only good for strengthening our defense capabilities; it’s excellent news for the U.S. We’re focusing on American priorities, like counterterrorism, while bolstering the U.S. economy. This year, European allies are buying more than $35 billion of American products, such as F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, Poseidon P-8A Maritime Patrol Aircraft, Reaper drones, and billions of dollars in Patriot missile defense. UK’s defense spending alone is helping to employ more than 160,000 Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A month later, then-secretary of state Gavin Williamson repeated this number (of defence-supported jobs) to a Washington DC audience. If the MoD recognises that UK spending in the US benefits the US economy, it must also recognise that defence spending at home helps with the UK economy. Similarly, if it is accepted that technology and manufacturing are important foundations even for a service-based economy, it is significant that defence appears to be in excess of 10% of total British manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-value-of-defence-business-in-a-commercialdefence-firm&quot;&gt;The Value of Defence Business in a Commercial–Defence Firm&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to generalise about the extent that businesses which work with defence find such work to be helpful in sustaining and developing their commercial work. Even at the top level, firms vary in their strategies and market focuses. While BAE Systems and QinetiQ are dominated by defence, Rolls-Royce receives only about 30% of its revenue from defence. In terms of the commercial–defence links, much of the technical workforce in Rolls-Royce has the ability to work in either side. Babcock received 68% of its 2023 revenue from the defence sector and presents itself as serving defence, security and commercial markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While defence spending is most visible in terms of the large primes that dominate major projects, and while governments for some years have sought to bring more (innovative) small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) into defence, it is easy to overlook the fact that major firms already outsource much of their activity and have hundreds of identified firms in their supply chains. Oxford Economics and individual companies’ reports provide evidence of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Babcock International 2022:&lt;/strong&gt; “£1bn spent with more than 5,700 UK suppliers, including £230m spent with 1,070 suppliers in deprived local authority areas, and £337m spent with 2,200 SMEs”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leonardo 2020:&lt;/strong&gt; “Two thirds of Leonardo’s 2,100 UK suppliers were small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and more than a quarter (28%) of all Leonardo supply chain spending was spent directly with these SMEs”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BAE Systems 2018:&lt;/strong&gt; “More than 3,000 contractors [are] employed by BAE Systems as part of its procurement spending”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rolls-Royce&lt;/strong&gt; (with its larger civil business) spends £2.3 billion a year with more than 2,300 companies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The degree of corporate dependence on defence reduces further down supply chains. Certainly, many members of ADS, MAKE UK Defence and Tech UK (the industrial bodies that support access to the defence market), have members serving the commercial world as well. The perceived benefit of having some defence business is reflected in the growing number of companies joining these bodies. As mentioned earlier, another consideration is that supplying defence requires all firms to have high cybersecurity standards, which should enhance their overall resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this constitutes hard evidence of the benefits of defence work, but it does signal that many firms see access to both sectors as beneficial. Spirit AeroSystems in Northern Ireland explicitly pursued the defence market as a strategy because, having experienced the collapse of commercial air transport during the Covid-19 pandemic, it recognised defence as a valuable counter-cyclical element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An issue worth detailed research concerns the wider impact of defence work on dual-use suppliers. For example, can longer-term defence contracts justify capital investments that a predominance of short-term commercial contracts would make more risky? And can gaps between work be a difficulty for dual-use firms?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these considerations suggest that, as a generalisation, defence business appears to have a higher impact on the UK economy than a superficial look would suggest. This message is reinforced when regional and local needs are considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-local-and-regional-economic-impact-of-defence&quot;&gt;The Local and Regional Economic Impact of Defence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defence industrial and wider economic considerations loom larger once London is excluded from the picture. MoD data shows that London only gets around £2 billion in defence spending – around 7% of the total. London accounts for 13% of the UK population but 23% of GDP. In brief, although London has some very poor areas, it is much richer than the rest of the UK, while not receiving much from the defence budget. GDP per head in London was £69,000 in 2023. GDP per head in the southeast made it the next highest income region at £41,319. This high level in the southeast might be surprising, but the delineation of naval facilities in and around Portsmouth, plus army facilities in the southeast, contribute to this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of the MoD’s top 10 suppliers has major defence manufacturing installations in the southeast, but BAE Systems employs around 650 staff at Frimley, who carry out IT and ship support work. Airbus is now the owner of Surrey Satellites, based in Guildford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparing defence spending per capita in different areas with GDP per capita suggests the positive impact of defence (except in the southeast). Defence spending per capita is high in the northwest, the southwest and Scotland. These regions, despite having either extensive coastal boundaries or significantly de-industrialised communities, have slightly higher GDP per capita than any other UK region (except London and the southeast). For the southwest, there is little defence activity in Cornwall compared with other counties in the region. It is possibly not a coincidence that it has higher unemployment and lower pay than the overall southwest region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognition that defence spending in a local area can be of significance is reflected in the focused interest that MPs from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland show in whether their regions are getting their share of defence, however “defence” is defined. The Scottish Affairs Committee has completed a series of inquiries, with those members who oppose Scottish independence looking for evidence of the benefits of being in the UK. The Scottish National Party finds it awkward to oppose shipbuilding links with the rest of the UK that bring so many benefits to Scotland. The Welsh Affairs Committee can see how little defence work has come to their area, and the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee is in a similar place. Both the Northern Ireland and Wales inquiries established by these committees were terminated due to the June 2024 general election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;government-revenues-and-the-balance-of-trade&quot;&gt;Government Revenues and the Balance of Trade&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK government has a significant budget deficit problem, and the country has a long-standing balance of trade deficit. It is therefore of some significance to assess the impact of the defence industry on these matters. In terms of the trade deficit, a foreign defence product clearly constitutes an import, which presents a challenge for a country that imports more than it exports over a sustained period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is incontestable that, when the MoD spends government money in the private sector, some of that becomes revenue to the Treasury in the form of tax. At first glance, free-market economics would argue that, if well-paid defence jobs were not available, those affected would quickly find other well-paid sources of employment (which would mean they paid similar amounts of tax). For some this will indeed be the case, while others will opt for early retirement, albeit on a reduced pension income. Some will take time to find new work and weigh on government spending rather than contribute financially to the Treasury. Here it could be said that the burden of proof lies with those who argue against the assertions in a 2012 RUSI Briefing Paper which demonstrated that, on a contract involving no foreign elements, the government would get back as much as 36% directly in the form of income tax, national insurance and other direct payments to government, without any multiplier effects included in the calculation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exports present a slightly different situation. A UK or collaborative product may or may not generate foreign exchange revenues from exports, depending on its commercial terms. But it is quite clear that a product bought from a foreign supplier, such as Apache E or Predator, can only be an import. This is not an argument for rejecting foreign products when the frontline military case is strong and/or there is no capable supplier in the UK. But security of supply in the support phase, and operational independence, are other factors that affect import decisions – as is clearly considered when the US buys an overseas defence product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-consequences-of-defence-cuts&quot;&gt;The Consequences of Defence Cuts&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The argument so far is that defence work has wider benefits than might be assumed, but there is a further issue. What can be observed about the impact of reduced defence spending and a lack of defence orders? In mid-2024 there was uncertainty about the affordability of the defence programme, so such reductions cannot be ruled out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, adjustment to defence closures has been easiest in regions with a diversified, already prospering economy. Here, those affected by a defence firm closure may be able to quickly find other ways of contributing to the economy, and any abandoned infrastructure would get reused. The closures of BAE Systems factories at Kingston, Hatfield and Enfield have not affected long-term local prosperity – at Hatfield, for instance, the site of the Flight Test Hangar “is currently a David Lloyd Leisure Centre and hotel”. In diversified, prosperous areas, other activities can usually replace closed defence entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it is also clear that, in many areas of the UK, the loss of major industries has had major negative repercussions for decades. Many of the towns and areas that were at the forefront of the Industrial Revolution have seen the decline of their traditional industries (especially textiles, coal, steel and heavy engineering) in the face of foreign competition from countries with less expensive labour and/or more efficient working practices. Many of these places, not least the north and some parts of the West Midlands, did not experience the speedy replacement of a failed firm with well-paid jobs, and their populations have instead suffered sustained periods of unemployment, low pay and social deprivation. The employment and value added by an Amazon warehouse near a motorway exit differ from the benefits of a thriving factory. Social deprivation is a multidimensional concept with a range of metrics, several of which are inter-related: low wages, unemployment, poor levels of educational performance, poor health and crime. Once in place, it is difficult to improve social deprivation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further consideration is that coastal areas in the UK are poorer, have poorer health and more crime than their inland neighbours. By definition, they are peripheral rather than “core” UK locations, and many have not experienced a replacement for UK tourists moving to international destinations or for the decline of the fishing industry. In the defence domain, a report in March 2024 covered the current revitalisation of Chatham, albeit 40 years after the closure of its naval dockyard. Industrial sites by the coast thus have a special economic and social significance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The town of Barrow-in-Furness, for example, had a highly negative experience when there was no design work for a new submarine for almost 20 years between the Vanguard and Astute projects, and Astute manufacturing did not start until three years after the completion of the last Vanguard. Indeed, as the shipyard’s number of employees dropped from 14,000 to 3,000, the town went into a major decline, although some were able to find work at the neighbouring Sellafield nuclear installation. This resulted in more people living on social security payments and increased drug use. Male unemployment in the constituency was 7.3% in 1998. In 2001, data showed that there were almost half as many economically inactive males in Barrow-in-Furness as those measured as economically active. Poor educational standards became a feature, with almost 50% of the adult population having no formal qualifications and another 20% with only Level 1 qualifications. Almost 2,000 people had never worked or were long-term unemployed. A significant question that merits future research (but may prove tricky in terms of data access) is to what degree running down the shipyard contributed to the region becoming less a contributor to government tax revenues and instead a greater burden on social security spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of industrial capability, defence suffered as the restoration of submarine building proved a protracted, difficult and expensive process. According to John Schank and others, “submarine design and build skills atrophied in the United Kingdom, resulting in a costlier and lengthier Astute procurement effort”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The maturing of Astute production and the start of Dreadnought-class building has contributed highly to the restoration of employment in and around Barrow-in-Furness: BAE Systems reported in 2024 that its “submarines business already employs approximately 13,500 people, mainly in the North West of England, with that figure set to grow to around 17,000 in the coming years”. This has required, and been accompanied by, improvements in education and cultural opportunities. Given the labour demands of the Astute and Dreadnought programmes, and plans for the Astute successor, BAE Systems felt it necessary to establish its own education and training centre (Academy for Skills and Knowledge) and its website proclaims:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Barrow-in-Furness is a hub for learning and innovation. We’re not just building the next generation of nuclear submarines here. We’re developing the next generation of engineering talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, cutting defence work often quickly leads to levelling down when no comparable new opportunities arrive, and bringing about recovery using defence money is a protracted process. There has been progress in Barrow-in-Furness, but there is still a way to go. The government’s March 2024 nuclear white paper detailed the multi-year efforts being made to rejuvenate the town with a major waterfront housing development, improved education provision and a decade-long, £20-million-a-year Barrow Transformation Fund, all aimed at encouraging “more people to come to live and work in the area”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of sustained economic difficulties in areas that led the first Industrial Revolution, the survival of defence aerospace and missile firms in the northwest takes on added significance. BAE Systems, with core factories near Preston and Blackburn, contributes significantly to local prosperity. BAE Systems also uses multiple subcontractors in a regional cluster. Also in the northwest, MBDA has a modernised missile factory in Bolton, which employed “670 highly skilled design, engineering and manufacturing employees” when it opened in 2018. As of January 2024, the company employs more than 1,000 people and has plans to triple its workforce in future years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When considering that defence cuts would likely mean levelling down an area for a sustained period, naval work conducted entirely in coastal locations merits particular attention. UK warship building is focused on the Govan and Scotstoun yards near Glasgow and the Babcock site at Rosyth, also in Scotland. These sites are currently busy building Type 26 and Type 31 ships, but what will come next (if current work is successfully completed) has not been confirmed. There is also extensive ship support work in Portsmouth, Devonport (Plymouth) and Faslane. Because of the overall reduced size of the Royal Navy, there is now much less of this type of work. Gosport, adjacent to Portsmouth, is now recognised as one of the more deprived areas of the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeovil, the home of Leonardo helicopters, is unusual. Its rural location was important to a new firm called Westland Aircraft during the First World War, when the aircraft industry came to life. The company survived the downturn in defence spending after the end of that conflict and after the Second World War the company focused on helicopter technology. In 2024, Leonardo was directly employing around 3,000 people in a town of just over 40,000 inhabitants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Westland Aircraft is owned by Italian firm Leonardo, and the Italian side of its helicopter business is larger than the British element of the business. However, the latter still works on development, production and support for both military and commercial helicopters. A factory with such a long history and significance is inevitably a key presence in its community. To ensure it has suitably qualified and motivated young people to come into its workforce, it actively supports local education. Nonetheless, Yeovil’s future is uncertain. In recent years the MoD has turned increasingly to US helicopter suppliers, opting for the Apache E helicopter (with no role for Leonardo), and buying more Chinook helicopters. With the Wildcat helicopter production completed, and despite Leonardo having a strategic partnership agreement with the MoD, the (MoD) initial decision was to use a formal competition for the next military helicopter (the New Medium Helicopter, NMH) – with Airbus and Lockheed-Martin chosen alongside Leonardo as viable bidders. In April 2024, the MoD bought six Airbus H145 helicopters as Puma replacements for deployment in Cyprus and Brunei. Later in 2024, Airbus and Lockheed-Martin withdrew from the NMH competition, and as of April 2025 there was no firm MoD commitment to the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leonardo does, however, have a £50-million, four-year MoD contract agreed in 2022 to generate Proteus, a flying demonstrator of an uncrewed naval helicopter that, when developed, could carry out surveillance, supply and casualty missions. Proteus could also substitute, to a degree, for the EH-101 Merlin helicopter. The project has been pursued on an incremental basis and is intended to provide employment for about 100 development engineers in Yeovil until 2026. If Leonardo closed in Yeovil, the town would likely become another (seasonal) tourist centre, although the southwest region has a wide range of defence industrial capabilities which in 2025 its companies came together to publicise and attract further work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A feature of domestic defence industrial capabilities is that they can provide a variety of benefits. When successful, they can serve as a conspicuous symbol of national technological and management capability, support both the reality and the image of a government with meaningful sovereign freedoms and enable an armed force to secure access to equipment with its preferred characteristics. They can provide stable and well-paid employment, deliver tax revenues and reduce a government’s foreign exchange needs. In this situation, it is not surprising that ever more countries are seeking to enhance their domestic defence industrial capacity, with many having formal offset regulations to stimulate advances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-the-potential-of-the-defence-industry&quot;&gt;III. The Potential of the Defence Industry&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter outlines the key areas in which defence could make contributions to the wider manufacturing base in the UK. Their impact has been of particular interest to the current government, which pledged to harness it further through defence investments, stating: “Defence and strategic capability play a unique role in our economy, providing both high-skilled jobs and spillover innovation, as well as supporting Britain’s position on the world stage”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Integrating defence spending more closely with economic benefit would imply maintaining the previous government’s focus on developing UK products for which there was also an export market. The GCAP and Type 31 projects are both instances of the UK aiming to generate a core product (with a minimum deployable capability) that would be affordable in export markets and modifiable to meet the specific needs of a customer. Currently, Australia and Canada are working to modify the Type 26 to meet local needs, while both Poland and Indonesia are interested in buying their own versions of the Type 31.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A government seeking to improve the wider economic benefit from defence would consider the wider potential of the technologies in a defence project. Some focused technologies, such as those involved with gas turbines, have applications in both military and commercial products. Others can be understood as almost general purpose technologies, with applications in multiple domains: for example, the electric motor. At least four areas in the defence industry stand out as having many commercial applications:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aerospace&lt;/strong&gt; has been defined in dual-use terms since its inception. The RAF was supplied until 1964 by the Air Ministry, which had responsibility for both the military and commercial worlds. On the commercial side was the Society of British Aerospace Companies, which transformed into ADS in 2009. The lead professional body is the Royal Aeronautical Society, founded in 1866, and it also has both commercial and military agendas.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In (outer) space&lt;/strong&gt;, challenges and opportunities for sensors and communication abound. This can be subdivided into ground installations, launchers and satellites. UK industrial progress was long neglected by the MoD on the grounds of expense and a readiness to rely on US capabilities, but the small-satellite achievements of Surrey Satellites, plus falling launch costs and participation in some European programmes, have resulted in some changes in attitude. A National Space Strategy was announced in 2021 as a joint effort of the MoD and the (then) Department of Business, Energy &amp;amp; Industrial Strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digital engineering&lt;/strong&gt; is destined to become the central driver behind manufacturing advances. Of great interest to defence, but also of huge commercial potential, is the integration of a range of focused digital technologies into a digital engineering whole. GCAP is a demanding product for digital engineering, but it could generate a large, informed workforce and multiple lessons to be learned through integrated digitisation. These lessons learned could be curated and mechanisms put in place to make them available across the whole UK manufacturing sector.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Computing, AI, machine learning and data science&lt;/strong&gt; are key enablers of digital engineering but also have huge implications for many decision-making activities, including modelling, empirical analysis of data from multiple sources, recommendations for risk assessments, and commitment to an action. In the defence sector, AI is not a new phenomenon: defence has been using advanced data processing and analysis for decades. But AI is advancing quickly and will have many commercial uses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to these four fields, there are more specific areas on the defence agenda, including advanced materials with weight, strength and radar absorption attributes. Additionally, power generation, storage and distribution technologies have the potential to provide mobile capabilities and reduce the use of fossil fuels. Such fields also have commercial applications and potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For defence to lead on technologies with wider applications, defence systems must work in a much more hostile environment than most commercial products. Organised crime and governments pursuing deniable attacks on civilians are blurring this distinction, but it still carries core validity. For example, how long would “self-driving” cars work once those who wished to subvert them resort to using the electromagnetic spectrum to interfere with their connectivity. The reverse argument also can be offered: if a technology has been demonstrated to work in a military context, it will almost always also work in a commercial one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To generate enhanced macroeconomic benefit from military progress, it will not be enough to entrust defence work to firms with a dual-use output. Some firms choose strategically to focus on defence because of the background knowledge this requires about defence challenges, organisational structures and procurement procedures. Also, those who invest in defence firms bring a risk perspective over a portfolio of activities: sometimes they do not embrace diversification in those firms but rather see defence investments as generating modest, but low-risk, returns because of the long-term nature of contracts and the assured financial survival of the customer. This does not make commercial spin-offs within defence companies impossible, but it involves choices that should be seen as strategic rather than opportunistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government needs to think hard about how it will make the nature of dual-use but defence-origin technology advances available to the wider UK economy. This will include specifying the security classifications of a technology to allow dissemination but prevent undesirable releases to non-UK firms and governments. There could be pressure on the MoD to continue to support defence companies in defence-dependent areas, even if the outputs of those companies have lost much of their security relevance. This consideration would be less important if regions that are currently defence-dependent had a more diversified economy. Supporting firms that could use the skills and knowledge found in the defence sector and improving infrastructure in neglected areas of the UK would also help. But a broader point is that government, military and industrial leaders need to be thinking ahead to innovative products and new routes to military capabilities. All this implies that, while the defence sector already can be seen to provide benefits to the wider economy as well as imposing costs, careful allocation of defence funding and effort mean that it has the potential to do more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The defence industry’s role in the UK’s economy extends beyond pure macroeconomic metrics. This paper has attempted to provide a more granular perspective on the value of defence to the UK economy. Defence can contribute significantly to social stability and regional cohesion by providing meaningful employment and vocational training in areas where they are not always provided by commercial industry. This socioeconomic impact aligns with broader established government objectives, such as narrowing the gaps between the wealthiest and poorest areas, and efforts to strengthen the UK by ensuring that all regions benefit equitably from defence spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, UK forces must have the equipment that enables them to deter adversaries, and to prevail in conflicts, if necessary. But, to sustain the quality of their products, defence firms need continuity of work (as is well understood by other countries, including in the US, France and Germany). For projects of particularly high cost and risk, collaborative approaches with allied states are often available. For the immediate future, the MoD will be pressing for more funding, an option that it seems to believe is more likely to win public support if it can be seen to contribute to national prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defence industrial spending is a major component of the UK’s economic landscape, particularly in terms of local and regional prosperity and industrial capability. It helps prevent the levelling down associated with de-industrialisation in traditional areas and supports higher-than-average wages and productivity. As the UK navigates its future defence and economic strategies, it must balance immediate fiscal prudence with the long-term benefits of a robust, strategically managed defence industrial base. This balance is crucial not only for national security but also for sustaining regional economies and, by extension, the socioeconomic fabric of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK defence spending currently benefits the economy and society through several of its attributes, from providing a national supply base, which brings well-paid jobs wherever it is located, to training many young people, especially in STEM-related areas. This is not the case across the wider economy. Defence spending is especially beneficial in coastal areas that are less prosperous than the country overall, but it is also beneficial in regions, such as the north of England, which have already experienced long-term damage from de-industrialisation. Large defence firms spread MoD revenues across extensive supply chains, including to many small firms. As defence-relevant technology increasingly interacts with rapid growth commercial technologies, defence spending can provide stimulus for dual-use innovations and a counter-cyclical source of revenue. Several countries are working to develop their own defence industries, and globally there is widespread appreciation for defence industrial employment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK government does not, and should not, spend defence money in the UK just to prop up disadvantaged regions. Nonetheless, the reality of 2025 is that assured defence capabilities look especially valuable. Russia has re-emerged as a hostile entity, and it seems the US can no longer be seen as a reliable ally to the UK. Moreover, there is little reason to think that defence spending at levels significantly higher than today would damage the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last 20 years of the Cold War, the UK government spent on average just under 5% of GDP per year on defence. Economic growth fluctuated significantly during this period, but the average was over 2% per year. In the last 20 years, defence has been just over 2% of GDP per year. Although growth rates during the same period fluctuated, the average annual growth has been just over 1.4%. If there has been a peace dividend, it has allowed governments to spend more on social welfare, health and education, which dominate government spending, but there is no obvious evidence that this helped economic growth. Overall, it appears that increasing defence spending in the UK would not necessarily be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The arguments in this paper are broadly compatible with the policy stances of both the current government and its predecessors, dating from around 2015. However, policy implementation is usually more challenging than policy formulation. Defence industrial policy can only be implemented through acquisition choices, and these choices can be shaped by a range of stakeholders with different, more focused priorities than supporting the UK economy. While the next iteration of the UK Defence Industrial Strategy should be closely studied, much will rest on how it is put into practice.&lt;/p&gt;

With NATO-burden sharing under renewed scrutiny, European allies are being forced to reassess defence responsibilities ahead of the Alliance’s upcoming Hague Summit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European security is caught between a rock and a hard place. On the one hand, Russian aggression against Ukraine and the broader Euro-Atlantic architecture shows no sign of halting. In fact, the threat continues to increase, as Russia has now mobilised for protracted conflict and continues to absorb losses in a way few European countries are ready to contemplate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the willingness of the US to support Ukraine unconditionally and to underwrite European security more broadly has clearly diminished. The Trump Administration expects the responsibility of defending NATO territory to be shouldered primarily by the European allies. This is largely the product of a problem of US overstretch across multiple theatres; a resource scarcity problem that is greatly exacerbated by the growing rapprochement between China, Iran, North Korea and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that this strategic problem for European security is increasingly well understood by different European capitals. Since the new NATO regional defence plans were approved at the Vilnius Summit in 2023, different analytical work strands have been trickling down into national defence establishments. As NATO approaches the upcoming summit in The Hague, the ever-green discussion about intra-alliance burden-sharing is intensifying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet this should not obscure the fact that the broad contours of a rebalanced alliance have already become apparent: European allies fast-track a conventional force build-up, the US continues to underpin extended nuclear deterrence and enable force integration across the conventional and nuclear domains, and all NATO allies together embrace the defence industrial expansion that is urgently needed. In turn, this allows the discussion to shift to some hard and technical hurdles, to be overcome by remembering the cohesion of the alliance remains a key hard-nosed interest for all parties concerned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;natos-conventional-force-build-up-gets-underway&quot;&gt;NATO’s Conventional Force Build-Up Gets Underway&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past years, NATO planners have designed an elaborate family of plans for deterring conflict with the Russian Federation and defending the North Atlantic area in case of Article 5 scenarios. These plans, which cut across different geo-spatial domains and geographical regions, can only be executed if the defence establishments of individual allies are sufficiently resourced so that the collective NATO force structure does not feature meaningful gaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What has become readily apparent is that European allies cannot continue to rely on the prospect of large-scale US reinforcements for plugging all such gaps in crisis. In addition, US strategic enablers – many of which are swing capabilities that underpin deterrence in different theatres – may not be permanently available due to the growing risk of simultaneous conflict elsewhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The force requirements that result from the regional plans approved in Vilnius have been integrated into the NATO defence planning process. When the Defence Ministers meet in June 2025, capability planning targets are set to be apportioned to all individual allies. Whilst it will require time and effort to build the forces in the numbers that are required – including providing for adequate training, munition stockpiling and infrastructure – the European allies now have a very granular understanding of what is required. As these plans are threat-based, the force requirements are sized and accounted for in function of possible Russian aggression, wherever it may appear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the US contribution to NATO is limited in scale, the resulting gap will need to be picked up by the European allies. This means that the conventional force build-up is now set to accelerate in earnest, with different European capitals rapidly increasing their defence budgets to avoid becoming the weakest link in NATO’s collective defence. As a result, intra-European pressure to invest has become as intense as the transatlantic discussion about defence spending – if not more so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-case-for-nuclear-posture-adaptation&quot;&gt;The Case for Nuclear Posture Adaptation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Russia’s war against Ukraine has been accompanied by persistent nuclear intimidation, it has become readily apparent that NATO must plan for any Article 5 contingency to unfold under a nuclear shadow. After all, the Russian playbook of shielding its consecutive landgrabs under a barrage of nuclear threats has now unfolded repeatedly – with partial success in terms of deterring external intervention and delaying assistance to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When NATO leaders met in Vilnius, they not only approved conventional defence plans but also instructed their military authorities to update planning to increase the flexibility and adaptability of the alliance’s nuclear forces. This would be done with a view to making sure that “NATO is ready and able to deter aggression and manage escalation risks in a crisis that has a nuclear dimension”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst the increased uncertainty about the extent of US retrenchment from European security is fuelling debate about European alternatives to extended nuclear deterrence, strategic reality dictates that NATO’s nuclear deterrence remains the only viable option for countering Russian nuclear coercion, at least in the near to medium term future. Just like the conventional defence plans must be measured against the Russian conventional threat, nuclear deterrence arrangements protecting the territory of NATO allies must be measured against the Russian nuclear threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the latter is ominously large, immediate and highly diversified across strategic and sub-strategic delivery systems and warhead yields. Such a Russian posture that is built for threatening nuclear warfighting cannot be countered with the promise of a strategic-level nuclear response alone. It instead requires a combination of strategic nuclear forces as well as diversified non-strategic nuclear strike options that neither France nor the UK can generate by themselves. This is not to say that UK or French deterrence cannot step up in a way that increases NATO deterrence, to the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anything, the nuclear planning work that has been underway over the past two years is likely to indicate that NATO’s nuclear posture may need to evolve significantly to keep up with Vladimir Putin’s appetite for sabre-rattling. NATO’s nuclear deterrence relies on the strategic nuclear forces of France, the UK and the US as well as on forward-deployed US weapons and dual capable aircraft provided by other allies. The large disparity between NATO and the Russian Federation in terms of non-strategic systems suggests that NATO will need to bolster the theatre-level nuclear deterrence architecture. At the same time, NATO’s nuclear powers will need to consider whether their existing strategic nuclear forces suffice to deal with the two-nuclear-peer-environment that is emerging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France and the UK can envisage expanding their strategic arsenal as well as re-introducing non-strategic strike options to help offset the pressure on the US nuclear posture. In turn, the non-nuclear NATO allies would do well to facilitate the integration of planning across the nuclear and conventional domains, and to ensure the conventional support to nuclear operations remains adequate throughout what may be a protracted campaign. This pertains not just to the number of dual capable aircraft, but also to available tanker aircraft, ground and/or sea-based air defences, stand-off munition stockpiles, and the infrastructure that is required for all of the above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;skyrocketing-defence-industrial-demand-is-challenging-supply-chains&quot;&gt;Skyrocketing Defence-Industrial Demand is Challenging Supply Chains&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The force build-up that has got underway implies that European defence establishments are now expressing a skyrocketing demand signal to defence industry. This means production capacity must be scaled appropriately. Due to the gravity and the urgency of the strategic outlook, this will entail a mix between expanding co-production of systems that exist already (both in Europe and across the Atlantic) and designing new systems with more diversified and integrated supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this discussion is receiving ample attention in European capitals and EU institutions alike, the fact remains that truly European systems will emerge only to the extent that the diversification of industrial supply chains will make that vision a practical reality. In addition, several European states will be loath to choose between European-only and transatlantic defence industrial integration for the simple reason that a combination of the two is required for meeting the capability requirements that have been identified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irrespective of whether the expansion of defence industrial production capacity unfolds in a purely European or in a transatlantic context, it requires a variety of technical hurdles to be overcome. When concluding security of supply agreements, trust is key, and this is easy to forfeit but hard to build. Yet beyond such questions of trust – responses to which can flipflop in function of political vagaries – lie deep-rooted structural issues. These pertain to supply chain bottlenecks concerning adequate access to raw materials, industrial workforce issues and various regulatory challenges. Addressing these effectively may well require decreasing the level of regulation and enabling swift procurement cycles to drive up production – even if this sometimes will raise thorny issues relating to export control regimes. It is arguably in these technocratic dimensions that EU-NATO cooperation can help deliver the mutually supporting ecosystem that the European defence establishments are craving for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-importance-of-nato-cohesion&quot;&gt;The Importance of NATO Cohesion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether one considers the ongoing build-up of European conventional forces, the debate about nuclear posture adaptation, and the defence-industrial implications of the still unfolding Zeitenwende together, one conclusion stands out. That is that European allies and the US will be in a much better position to overcome all possible hurdles by working together. The emergence of two monopolistic defence industrial blocs on both sides of the Atlantic, the questioning of extended nuclear deterrence, and the dissociation between nuclear and conventional deterrence and defence plans all constitute outcomes that would profoundly damage the alliance and the core national interests of all allies. As NATO capitals approach the summit agenda for the summit in The Hague, the importance of maintaining unity remains as paramount as ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to the terrorist attack in Pahalgam, India launched Operation Sindoor on 7 May. Initially limited to strikes on terrorist-linked targets, the operation expanded over several days, with subsequent phases coinciding with Pakistani retaliation. Within hours of the first sorties, international media had seized on Pakistani allegations that their Chinese-built J-10s shot down up to five Indian aircraft, including three French-made Rafaels. In the absence of official clarification from India, the episode was swiftly recast in popular outlets as a technology shootout between Chinese and French fighters. Lost in the noise were the questions that mattered: What were India’s objectives? Were they achieved? And what does this operation reveal about the future trajectory of South Asian deterrence?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;losing-the-narrative&quot;&gt;Losing the Narrative&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any military campaign, shaping the strategic narrative is nearly as important as shaping the battlespace. Unfortunately, India ceded that narrative space. The initial silence from Indian military spokespeople created an information vacuum. Into that vacuum poured commentary that was often technically uninformed and strategically misleading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What emerged was a distorted framing of the conflict. Rather than serious analysis of India’s targeting methodology, command intent, or escalation thresholds, coverage focused instead on the air-to-air engagement that led to the loss of Indian aircraft.Undue prominence was given to the performance of specific platforms, with little regard for the broader operational context or the rules of engagement that shaped the encounter. As a result, Chinese arms manufacturers enjoyed a perceived PR win – one arguably disproportionate to the tactical or strategic context of the engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-quiet-operational-success&quot;&gt;A Quiet Operational Success&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That misleading narrative obscures a more consequential truth: despite Pakistani tactical successes, India appears to have largely achieved its stated objectives. On the opening day of strikes, the Indian Air Force (IAF) demonstrated a credible capacity to identify and destroy what New Delhi characterised as terrorist-linked infrastructure in Pakistani territory, employing stand-off weapons to deliver precision strikes at speed. In the following days, operations expanded in scope, penetrating Pakistan’s Chinese-supplied air defence network to target select forward airbases for the first time since the 1971 war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While losses were incurred, these must be evaluated against the scale and complexity of the mission – not simply tallied in isolation. The mere fact that the Indian Air Force could strike targets under defended conditions and undertake follow-on attacks demonstrates its capacity for coercive precision operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;restraint-under-fire&quot;&gt;Restraint Under Fire&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arguably more impressive than the operation’s reach was its restraint on the first day. According to Indian officials, pilots operated under strict rules of engagement that prohibited initiating attacks on Pakistani aircraft or pre-emptively suppressing air defence systems. This decision – to accept heightened operational risk in order to confine the conflict strictly to terrorist-linked infrastructure – is telling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It suggests a political leadership determined to signal its intent with clarity: India was not interested in initiating a conflict with the Pakistani state, but rather in degrading a specific ecosystem of terrorist violence that exists in the country. That some Indian aircraft were lost on the opening day of the operation was a direct consequence of a consciously limited rules of engagement. In effect, India accepted heightened operational risk in pursuit of clear strategic messaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such discipline in the face of a capable adversary is neither automatic nor easy. Yet it may well have prevented a broader escalation spiral. That alone deserves more analytical attention than it has received.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;escalation-managed&quot;&gt;Escalation, Managed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some reporting suggested that the region stood on the brink of nuclear war during Operation Sindoor. US President Donald Trump alleged that if the conflict had not ended when it did “…it could have been a bad nuclear war. Millions of people could have been killed.” These characterisations appear overstated in light of the facts on the ground. Unlike prior crises in South Asia, there were no public nuclear threats issued by either side, nor were there discernible moves toward strategic mobilisation. Rather than the brinkmanship so often invoked in academic literature on the subcontinent, what we saw instead was calibrated force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both New Delhi and Islamabad appeared to make deliberate choices about what not to do: India refrained from targeting Pakistani air defences or forward-deployed fighter aircraft in the early phases, while Pakistan retaliated against military targets but did not initiate large-scale mobilisation of its forces. The thresholds of escalation were tested, but not crossed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This conflict illustrates that limited military engagement under the shadow of nuclear weapons can be contained – provided escalation thresholds are mutually understood, signalling remains disciplined, and objectives are narrowly defined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some analysts have questioned how carefully escalation was managed during the conflict, the absence of nuclear signalling and the evident restraint by both sides suggests that this particular crisis was more contained than it first appeared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-new-normal&quot;&gt;The New Normal?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most significant legacy of Operation Sindoor is the precedent it sets. In the eyes of the Indian government, the use of cross-border force against terrorist-linked targets in Pakistan proper has now moved from exception to expectation. Whereas past crises often relied on signalling and symbolic action, future attacks on Indian soil – especially those traced to infrastructure across the border – are likely to draw a response of equal or greater magnitude to degrade the assets enabling terrorist action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of attempting to concretely link the terrorist incident to agents of the Pakistani state, the Indian government has taken the view that a failure to control or deny space to terrorist groups on Pakistani soil is sufficient to legitimate military action. Thus, India appears to have signalled a revised threshold for response, one that regional actors will have to factor into future risk assessments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;international-stakes&quot;&gt;International Stakes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The temptation among some external observers will be to treat Operation Sindoor as a contained South Asian episode with little wider relevance. This is a mistake. With India’s new posture, so long as Pakistan’s territory continues to serve as permissive environments for transnational terrorist infrastructure, the risk of periodic crises will persist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few examples better illustrate Pakistan’s long-standing role as a sanctuary for terrorist leadership than the discovery of Osama bin Laden in a compound just miles from the country’s premier military academy. Preventing the next Sindoor – or the next 26/11 – requires sustained international pressure to dismantle the networks that make these attacks possible in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sustaining-calibrated-deterrence&quot;&gt;Sustaining Calibrated Deterrence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Operation Sindoor demonstrated India’s ability to apply military power with restraint and precision, the durability of that approach will depend on how future crises are managed. India’s signal of intent to retaliate against cross-border terrorism marks a clear shift in posture. Yet deterrence by punishment carries inherent risks – chief among them the possibility that fringe actors may attempt to provoke confrontation in order to manipulate state responses. The continued viability of this approach may depend, in part, on the creation of complementary mechanisms for crisis management. Expanding communication channels – beyond existing National Security Advisor (NSA) and Director General of Military Operations (DGMO)–level contacts – could offer decision-makers greater flexibility to evaluate and contain emerging incidents. In a strategic environment shaped by tempo, perception, and public pressure, preserving space for discretion may be as vital as projecting resolve – particularly when domestic audiences may expect increasingly forceful responses in the wake of future provocations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equally salient is the operational challenge of maintaining the effectiveness of coercive military action over time. As targeted groups adapt – dispersing their assets, improving their concealment techniques, and altering their operational rhythms – the demands placed on India’s intelligence and targeting apparatus will intensify. The strategic interaction may increasingly resemble an iterative contest of adaptation, in which each side seeks to outpace the other’s capacity for detection and response. In that sense, the long-term viability of calibrated retaliation may rest not only on its political logic, but on the practical capacity to identify and neutralize meaningful targets in an increasingly evasive operating environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operation Sindoor should be remembered not as a dogfight between airframes, nor as a stumble toward strategic instability. It was a calibrated use of force, intended to signal resolve, degrade terrorist infrastructure, and demonstrate capability – without crossing the line into broader war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In doing so, it has redefined the contours of India’s response toolkit. What comes next will depend not only on India and Pakistan, but on whether the international community chooses to engage with the structures that give rise to such operations – or simply wait for the next one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rise of China and its growing assertiveness present both a challenge and an opportunity for the United States to strengthen its alliances and partnerships across Asia. While countries like Japan, South Korea, India, and the Philippines are increasingly alarmed by Chinese actions, U.S. efforts to coordinate with these allies are hindered by misaligned interests, weak institutions, occasionally overbearing American leadership, and China’s countercoercive strategies. Problems such as poor intelligence sharing, burdensome arms sales procedures, and limited multinational strategic planning hinder overall cooperation. The United States should institute a White House–led prioritization of China coordination, implement reforms to better respect allied political and economic needs, expand regional institutions like AUKUS and the Quad, and strengthen personal ties among defense and intelligence officials. Implementing these steps is essential to enhancing deterrence and warfighting capability in a rapidly shifting Indo-Pacific security environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rise of China and Beijing’s aggressiveness have alarmed countries across Asia. This growing fear—seen in Australia, India, Japan, the Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan, and other states—represents an opportunity for the United States to solidify, and build on, its partnerships in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s advancements in its military capabilities, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region, demand a coordinated response; no single nation can effectively manage this challenge alone. Indeed, close ties to allies and partners are a notable U.S. competitive advantage compared with China. These nations provide basing and access for U.S. forces, help deter aggressors, and ensure there is strong support in the face of Chinese economic coercion. They are often at the cutting edge of a range of defense-related innovations, such as directed energy weapons that use concentrated electromagnetic energy, rather than kinetic energy, to destroy targets, and advanced semiconductors. Should war break out, they would do much of the fighting—and the dying. Most U.S. operational plans include a major role for allies and partners, providing for basing, access, pre-positioning, logistics, and coalition operations. Protecting allied territory and populations would also be an important U.S. mission in many scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its competition with China, the United States needs to share intelligence, plan jointly, sell arms, and otherwise cooperate with a range of countries. Some of these, like Australia and Japan, are long-standing partners, but many other regional countries have not worked closely with the United States in the past. But even the United States’ closest allies face barriers that inhibit effective cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even when allies are rhetorically embraced, they are often treated as afterthoughts. Allies are not given timely and detailed intelligence against shared threats because of security concerns and cumbersome procedures. They are excluded from strategic planning even though their own roles are often central to U.S. plans. Allies are often encouraged to buy U.S. arms, but face barriers receiving advanced technologies and military equipment because of the cumbersome Foreign Military Sales (FMS) policy and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results are potentially catastrophic. Allies may be less aware of threats because they lack access to U.S. intelligence, contribute less to military operations when excluded from planning processes, and face delays acquiring vital weapons systems and integrating U.S. technologies into their armed forces. They may question U.S. willingness to support them in a crisis and thus be more receptive to overtures from China. These problems may lead to redundancies—or worse, gaps—as allies pursue their own intelligence and military capabilities, and perhaps even seek their own nuclear capacity, separate from those of the United States. Some allies may even question whether they should risk standing up to Chinese aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poor cooperation may also result in allies being surprised by or unprepared for a conflict, leading to higher casualties. They could be quickly overwhelmed because the United States did not help them prepare properly for various contingencies. The United States may need to deploy more of its own forces in response or otherwise step up its direct involvement even when allies would otherwise be willing and able to play a greater role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solving coordination and bureaucratic problems is necessary, though rarely glamorous. However, any effort to contain or otherwise counter China requires using all available resources, including those of allies and partners, efficiently and cost effectively. Relatively small changes in the U.S. approach can unlock tremendous benefits in the contributions of allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brief addresses three areas where the United States can strengthen its alliances and partnerships across Asia in peacetime in order to enhance deterrence against China and be better prepared for conflict: strategic planning, intelligence sharing, and arms sales. It draws heavily on (and at times takes text directly from) three other CSIS reports in this series on cooperation with allies and partners that examine ways to improve U.S. intelligence sharing, transform the Department of Defense’s multilateral strategic planning, and streamline U.S. arms sales. These earlier reports and thus this brief rely on interviews, discussions, and workshops with officials and experts; a literature review on the practice and theory of alliances; survey work of key partner states; and historical case studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper identifies four categories of challenges that hinder effective cooperation in any confrontation with China: competing interests and unclear priorities; weak institutions and cumbersome procedures; concerns about U.S. dominance; and potential Chinese countercoercion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States, however, is well positioned to manage these challenges. This can be achieved by prioritizing a White House–led effort focused on Asia, supporting Asian states in developing their own industrial bases and otherwise respecting their own political needs, improving regional institutions and expanding resources dedicated to cooperation with Asian allies, and bolstering personal ties whenever possible. Taken together, such steps will help solidify U.S. alliances and partnerships and, in so doing, enhance both deterrence and warfighting capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper first briefly lays out some of the challenges China poses to the United States and its allies. Second, it describes a range of problems and fears that inhibit strong partnerships in Asia. Third, it assesses how these problems might manifest in a confrontation with China. The paper concludes by offering recommendations for strengthening U.S. partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-china-challenge-a-brief-overview&quot;&gt;The China Challenge: A Brief Overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China poses an array of threats to the United States and its allies. Beijing is making aggressive claims in both the East China Sea and the South China Sea, infringing on the sovereignty of Japan, the Philippines, and other countries. China has made the assimilation of Taiwan a top priority, building up its conventional military and nuclear forces and turning them into a potentially formidable foe. More broadly, Beijing is seeking to challenge U.S. global dominance and create a new international order centered on China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of its effort to build military and economic power, China is methodically developing its defense industry. China’s arsenal grew by over 400 modern fighter aircraft and 20 major warships between 2021 and early 2024. China also more than doubled its ballistic and cruise missiles arsenal, developed a stealth bomber, and doubled the number of nuclear weapons it possesses. China is the world’s largest shipbuilder, with a military and commercial shipbuilding capacity that is roughly 230 times larger than that of the United States. In addition, China has become notably faster than the United States in acquiring weapons systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to a strong industrial base, China is moving increasingly close to Russia, Iran, and North Korea. Although these relationships are not institutionalized like NATO, they have already proven formidable. Russia has sustained its war in Ukraine with massive economic assistance from China, Iranian drone systems, and North Korean troops. It is plausible, and indeed likely, that these countries might assist China in any confrontation it has with the United States and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is engaged in a massive espionage campaign, seeking to penetrate the United States and allied governments. In 2023, the director-general of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) warned that Australia faced “unprecedented” threats from Chinese intelligence. This danger requires U.S. allies to have robust security protocols, which many of them lack. Chinese intelligence penetration of the Philippines and Taiwan, for example, is considerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is thus seeking to advance on multiple fronts. In addition to using its growing military prowess to bolster its aggressive regional foreign policy, Beijing is also using alliances with other anti-U.S. countries and its intelligence services to advance its agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fears-and-problems-of-allies-and-partners&quot;&gt;Fears and Problems of Allies and Partners&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the shared threat from China, U.S. cooperation with actual and potential allies and partners is uneven and fitful. Some reasons for this are inherent to any alliances, while others are due to U.S. policies and attitudes. The reasons can be grouped into four categories: competing interests and priorities; lack of institutionalization and cumbersome procedures; concerns about U.S. dominance and a lack of autonomy; and Beijing’s countercoercion. These issues are discussed in the context of intelligence sharing, multinational strategic planning, and arms sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-competing-interests-and-priorities&quot;&gt;1. Competing Interests and Priorities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and its allies often have competing interests, hindering military planning and other forms of cooperation. One South Korean official noted fears in his country that Europe and the Middle East would distract the United States from threats in Asia. Allies, for their part, often have different priorities: North Korea, not China, is Seoul’s top concern. Even when there is agreement on the threat, there may be disagreement on the response. Some regional states that fear China believe that accommodation is necessary, while others favor a more confrontational approach. One official pointed out that many in South Korea, while not sympathetic to China, do not share the U.S. view that China is an adversary that must be confronted, preferring a more stable relationship. The Philippines, which seeks U.S. support in its own maritime disputes with China, at the same time is hesitant to back Taiwan in a crisis. Making this more difficult, many U.S. partners in Asia do not trust each other: U.S. efforts to bring South Korea and Japan together have had multiple setbacks due to their bitter history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So-called “chain gangs,” where allies drag their partners into a conflict, are another problem where different interests lead to inadvertent conflict. U.S. leaders have feared that a Taiwanese declaration of formal independence would generate a backlash in China, which would in turn lead Beijing to go to war and force the United States to come to Taiwan’s defense. Thus U.S. officials have tried to assure Taiwan of U.S. support in a conflict with China while trying to prevent it from acting unilaterally, claiming that in such a scenario the United States would not back Taiwan. If U.S. support is too unconditional, Taipei may believe it has a shield against Chinese aggression even in scenarios where it, rather than Beijing, is changing the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as the United States worries about chain-gangs, so too do U.S. allies. NATO leaders have declared that they oppose any Chinese military efforts to control Taiwan, but European states have less concern about a China-Taiwan dispute than does the United States; as a result, they lack the extensive security relationships that the United States enjoys in Asia. Even a basic step such as NATO opening a liaison office in Japan was met with opposition within the alliance after Chinese concerns became clear. However, through NATO and other relationships, European states are tied to the United States, and it would be difficult for them to remain neutral in a U.S.-China conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mixed messages and unclear prioritization on the U.S. side have worsened these problems. Although the United States has emphasized Asia as its top area of security interest since the Obama administration, Europe, the Middle East, and (under the second Trump administration) Latin America have all competed for resources and senior-level attention. Part of this is due to the nature of the U.S. system, where multiple voices speak simultaneously on security and other issues. However, even within smaller communities there can be confusion, with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, combatant commands, and other entities within the U.S. defense establishment sending different signals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States, however, faces a dilemma: Increasing trust can, at times, lead allies and partners to do less, particularly when they have other priorities, such as emphasizing domestic spending over national security. A historic problem has been “buck-passing,” wherein allies free ride off their alliance with the United States or another power, not spending enough on their own militaries or otherwise not contributing their fair share. Although measures like military spending as a percentage of GDP are at best rough, it is clear that many at-risk Asian states are spending relatively little (often short of 2 percent) on their militaries. Many allies have failed to invest in basic capabilities, such as fuel storage and transport, as well as high-end systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-weak-institutions-and-cumbersome-procedures&quot;&gt;2. Weak Institutions and Cumbersome Procedures&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strong institutions can build trust, facilitate planning, reduce barriers to arms sales, promote interoperability, ease information sharing, and play many other important roles. Institutions create their own momentum, reinforcing habits of cooperation that in turn feed back into the sense of shared purpose and strategic alignment that birthed the institutions in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is, however, no Asian NATO. The institutions that do exist are valuable, but they are more limited in their size, scope, and integration. Four existing arrangements merit discussion: the Five Eyes, the Quad, AUKUS, and the Military Framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Five Eyes intelligence alliance, which grew out of the U.S.-UK World War II partnership, is often held up as the gold standard for intelligence sharing. The Five Eyes consists of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. As scholars have noted, the Five Eyes “is unique in the combination of its longevity, its resilience to changing global circumstances, and its ability to survive periodic tensions as well as maintain an ongoing similarity in the worldviews of its membership.” The countries involved share extensive intelligence related to foreign communications and methods of collection, as well as finished intelligence products. There is also some division of labor, with Australia monitoring South and East Asian communication while New Zealand covers the South Pacific and Southeast Asia. In recent years, cooperation has increased with regard to intelligence collection on China, with different members trying to expand their overall collection and coordinate regularly with others.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Quad, composed of the United States, Australia, India, and Japan, focuses on high-level coordination on issues like maritime security and natural disasters, with little day-to-day integration. Although all members worry about an assertive China, India has been reluctant to go beyond general joint statements. In 2022, however, the Quad launched the Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness, which provides an opportunity for expanding institutionalization and organizational structures in maritime areas related to law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A small but powerful alliance structure is AUKUS, a 2021 trilateral agreement between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States to equip Australia with a conventionally armed, nuclear-powered attack submarine and enhance cooperation on advanced capabilities, including arms sales. This has included limited trilateral planning through the rotational presence of U.S. and UK submarines in Australia. The United States, United Kingdom, and Australia have also established the International Joint Requirements Oversight Council (I-JROC) as a forum for the vice chiefs of defense in the three countries to review joint and combined warfighting concepts as they develop.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Military Framework is a U.S.-led forum of 14 countries that began with a focus on the Islamic State militant group. In recent years, however, it has expanded its scope to address strategic competition in both Europe and in Asia, with an eye toward improving planning and intelligence sharing. The Military Framework and the Five Eyes have members from Asia, but key countries such as South Korea are not included.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these institutions are valuable, but none include all of the key countries in the region that the United States would work with in a confrontation with China. Others do not involve detailed integration and planning or efforts to facilitate arms sales. The strongest—AUKUS and the Five Eyes—are particularly narrow in both their composition and function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the U.S. efforts with allies and partners in the region are bilateral. These include the U.S.-Philippines Salaknib exercises or the U.S.-Republic of Korea Freedom Shield exercises; bilateral wargaming such as the U.S.-Japan Integrated Air and Missile Defense Wargame; and various dialogues and working groups. There are also formal joint commands, such as that with South Korea. The United States has extensive, but uneven, bilateral intelligence sharing relationships with key countries in Asia beyond the Five Eyes, such as Japan and South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States sets its own intelligence collection requirements, as do most allies; this can make resource issues more pronounced. Because collection is not coordinated, the United States often does not know what information allies—even Five Eyes countries—already have, thus reducing the economy of efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to insufficient military spending, allies and partners often have weaker counterintelligence capabilities than the United States, which inhibits sharing. Allies often lack Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet) access and similar systems designed for sharing highly classified information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because institutions are weak, cooperation depends more on personal relationships. These types of relationships allow a margin for error: When things, inevitably, do not go as expected, interpersonal relationships allow for creative solutions and workarounds that the standard institutional processes cannot generate in a timely way. Relationships formed when sharing intelligence or making joint plans can pay off in numerous ways during a crisis and help overcome bureaucratic complexities. In many cases, however, U.S. officials deployed to non-English speaking countries do not know the local language and at times have limited background on the country’s history and strategic situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to weak institutions for coordination with partners, the U.S. system is bureaucratically complex and technically difficult to access, which inhibits bilateral cooperation. The United States also often defaults to NOFORN (Not Releasable to Foreign Nationals) classifications, hindering planning, intelligence sharing, and information about arms sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when institutionalization works, information sharing and coordination are often confined to military, intelligence, or other technocratic problems, with a lack of commensurate dialogue at the political level. This hinders broader strategic planning, as key actors are often not present. In addition, allies may receive different signals from military officers versus political leaders, making it harder for them to understand U.S. objectives and priorities. Indeed, the non-military side may be going in the wrong direction. A U.S. official responsible for security cooperation noted that the military is the front end working with partners, but civilians are the back end, and the latter do not have enough capacity to keep up with constant demands in Asia. The official pointed out that personnel cuts to the civilian workforce will harm military efforts at security cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-concerns-about-us-dominance&quot;&gt;3. Concerns About U.S. Dominance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cooperation with the United States creates autonomy issues for allies and partners. U.S. budgets and capabilities dwarf those of even wealthy allies like Japan, and thus partners can benefit tremendously from U.S. assistance. At the same time, however, specialization of partners to avoid duplication or reliance on U.S. intelligence, logistics, or other capabilities leaves partners vulnerable if the United States sees its interests differently during a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States at times worsens this problem with its tendency toward unilateralism. During Desert Shield, an important U.S. operational plan (OPLAN 1002-90) did not account for Saudi logistics capacity, which led to the overallocation of U.S. logistics assets to Saudi Arabia and the ad hoc incorporation of Saudi logistics capacities by local-level leaders. In the end, this error meant little due to the enormous coalition military advantage over Iraq, but a war with China would depend heavily on effective logistics, and similar errors could be disastrous. In Afghanistan, the United States took greater control over planning as the insurgency worsened in order to improve overall speed. Plans, however, were often implemented before NATO validation, and the contributions of U.S. allies were often more limited as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allies see multinational planning as initiated, led, and dominated by the United States, and this is difficult when allies have their own interests and views of how to fight a conflict. One former U.S. official noted that the United States often believes it understands the interests of allies better than they themselves do—even as U.S. policies and priorities regularly flip-flop. U.S. stances are, or can be perceived as, arrogant and uninformed at times: A “daddy knows best” approach, as the official described it. In arms sales, U.S. procedures are designed to reduce U.S. purchases from allies and partners, leading to resentment when the United States pushes allies to purchase U.S. systems. In general, building domestic industry capacity is a top goal of allies, which they see as vital economically and also a way to bolster deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nationalism and local politics often complicate other countries’ relationships with the United States, making open coalition planning and formal alliances more difficult. In general, states do not like to openly rely on other states for their security, as it implies government weakness. In addition, world opinion of the United States varies considerably by country and historical period, often creating pressure on governments to publicly distance themselves from Washington. In some important countries relevant to potential China-related contingencies, such as Vietnam and the Philippines, the United States has a history of conflict, generating additional suspicions. When the United States acts without consulting allies, the political consequences can be considerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4-countercoercion&quot;&gt;4. Countercoercion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because allies are often weaker and closer to potential aggressors, the cost of betting on the wrong horse is higher. As one foreign official noted, “Allies have less room to say ‘oops’.” This is a problem for allies in Asia, where China is near and the United States is far away. Thus, they are highly vulnerable to Chinese military and gray zone pressure, particularly if the United States is not there to back them up. Sam Roggeveen, a former Australian intelligence analyst, notes that greater U.S. military ties to Australia—including the construction of air bases in the country that host U.S. forces—“conflates America’s strategic objectives in Asia with ours, and it makes those bases a target.” Similarly, a South Korean official noted, “Being on the side of the United States is not cost free,” adding that “South Korea cannot wish away geography.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is also an important trading partner for allies in Asia, and it weaponizes these economic relations when its political positions are challenged, imposing selective boycotts on imports from the offending country or otherwise imposing restrictions. This threat has shaped the behavior of even close U.S. allies. New Zealand, for example, has feared alienating China, and thus its intelligence partners have at times been reluctant to cooperate with it. As one expert put it, “the Kiwis are reluctant to say ‘boo’ to China.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. allies and partners worry that the United States will not honor its promises to them, making them more sensitive to the risks involved in crossing China. This concern has grown in the Trump administration, as the United States has criticized many long-standing allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-these-problems-inhibit-cooperation-against-china&quot;&gt;How These Problems Inhibit Cooperation Against China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a confrontation with China, problems related to intelligence sharing, strategic planning, and arms sales could prove catastrophic. These would hinder deterrence, making a conflict more likely; undermine responses to Chinese coercion before and during a crisis; and hinder the U.S. and partner response should a shooting war with China break out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problems may begin with different threat perceptions. Some valuable information may fail to reach allies. One Japanese intelligence official noted that they rarely see U.S. information in their day-to-day work. This, in turn, affects threat perceptions and attitudes toward the United States. Allies may prove slower to recognize aggression from Beijing in the absence of salient U.S. intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lack of trust occurring due to different interests and a limited and slow supply of critical weapons systems may inhibit allied confidence in U.S. security guarantees. This in turn may weaken deterrence and create incentives for nuclear proliferation. Allies may be more willing to bandwagon with a potential aggressor if they are unsure that the United States will back them or if they believe close ties to the United States will “chain gang” them into an unwanted war. Some partners and allies might turn to China or other providers for weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In such circumstances, it is far easier for Chinese countercoercion to function. Allies and partners will fear that they are too weak or that the United States will not back them—or both—and they will not have a coordinated response to Beijing’s military and economic pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing may believe that poorly armed and trained U.S. allies create an offense-dominant environment in which a fast strike would succeed while a more prolonged conflict would fail, as the United States would then step up its support. China may also believe that allies with poorly armed militaries and weak defense industrial bases will be easy pickings. This perception is especially likely if they believe that the victim state has weak intelligence and could be caught by surprise. Chinese leaders may also reason that differing U.S. and allied interests will allow them to find cracks in any alliance, posing challenges in areas where one party has less of an interest, such as China staking a claim to tiny, unpopulated islands in the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cooperation is likely to suffer both before and during a crisis. Military operations depend on a wide range of tactical information, and, as one allied official put it, “Bad intelligence means bad plans.” Allied military forces may have suboptimal postures, fail to be prepared for a confrontation, or lack personal relations that can facilitate cooperation during a crisis. As one official put it, key figures may be exchanging business cards as they meet for the first time rather than rolling up their sleeves to work. Interoperability at all levels would pose tremendous challenges. This would include allies and partners having weapons systems from non-U.S., perhaps even Chinese, manufacturers, but also unfamiliarity due to insufficient preparedness, limited training, and coalition-wide military exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a conflict, a lack of effective coalition planning may lead the United States to wrongly assume that allies will take on roles for which they are unprepared or unwilling, while conversely allies may wrongly assume that the United States will manage difficult aspects of a conflict, such as air supremacy or strategic lift, without fully understanding U.S. limits. Allies that are poorly trained and lack access to high-end military systems will be less able to counter air supremacy, deny sea lanes to adversary shipping, prevent cyberattacks, or otherwise act on their own. This increases the risk that the United States would enter a shooting war from a position of weakness and that, during a conflict, it would not be able to take full advantage of allied and partner capabilities and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To improve cooperation with allies against China, the United States should consider four steps: improving prioritization; respecting allied politics; strengthening Asia-focused institutions; and bolstering personal ties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-prioritize-coordination-on-challenges-related-to-china&quot;&gt;1. Prioritize Coordination on Challenges Related to China&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government, in the best of times, involves a welter of competing bureaucracies with different missions and concerns, which in turn make different and competing demands on allies and partners. When the United States prioritizes a concern, as the Biden administration did after the 2022 full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, the resulting chaos can be overcome, but this is the exception, not the rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A high-level working group on China, run out of the White House, should coordinate planning, arms sales, intelligence sharing, and other requests from China-facing allies to ensure they are given top priority. Examples would include ensuring that intelligence-sharing procedures are streamlined for key countries in Asia and that ITAR; Technology, Security, and Foreign Disclosure (TSFD); and FMS processes do not hinder arms sales. Coordination would also ensure that U.S. guidance to allies and partners is clear and does not conflict at different bureaucratic levels. Working with Congress to reduce the number of Congressional authorizations for sales that are not strategically sensitive and do not involve the most sophisticated systems could speed up the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prioritization should then occur when U.S. officials engage allies in bilateral and multilateral forums in Asia. This will be a back-and-forth, with the United States adjusting its priorities in response to allied concerns as well as encouraging allies to embrace U.S. priorities. In the end, U.S. priorities will not be achieved without allied assistance, so accommodating their concerns is vital for ultimate U.S. success. Ideally, this would be bipartisan, as allied and partner cooperation will span administrations and suffers when U.S. priorities oscillate. Intelligence sharing also plays a role here. One former allied official noted that U.S. assessments shaped their own country’s worldview in dozens of small ways that, over time, brought the two countries into greater alignment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-respect-allied-politics-and-economics&quot;&gt;2. Respect Allied Politics and Economics&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as arms sales and other forms of cooperation bolster the U.S. economy, so too can military cooperation help allies’ economies and their willingness to work with the United States. In particular, a “build allied” approach allows the United States to better achieve important goals, such as more rapid shipbuilding, while benefiting allied economies, making cooperation much easier for them politically and giving them a vested interest that will transcend various administrations. Collaborative ventures can be particularly valuable, increasing economies of scale and enabling the United States to profit from allied arms sales and vice versa. However, the U.S. bureaucratic incentives all go in the other direction. As one interviewee noted, “no one gets fired for buying American.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, Washington must recognize that the unpopularity of the United States and allied concerns for autonomy may at times make cooperation difficult. Improving cooperation often requires behind-the-scenes engagement rather than open pressure, accepting that allies will differ with the United States, at times publicly, and letting allies take the lead in visible ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-strengthen-institutional-ties-and-expand-the-circle&quot;&gt;3. Strengthen Institutional Ties and Expand the Circle&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. alliances and partnerships in Asia may never mirror those in Europe, but they can be strengthened. Expanded, AUKUS-like arrangements with Japan and South Korea would be highly valuable, and the Philippines should also receive extra attention. Outside AUKUS, the United States could consider coordinating arms sales and FMS cases for countries like Japan and South Korea to speed up the process so both can advance together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the Quad is among the weaker of the existing institutions in Asia, there is hope for invigorating it. President Donald Trump’s good relations with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and the recent commitment to deepen the U.S.-India defense relationship, could be used to address India’s concerns and improve alignment over the Quad’s role and purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should also begin the long process of expanding and institutionalizing intelligence cooperation with key Asian allies outside the Five Eyes. This will involve technological upgrades on the allies and partner side and procedural changes on the U.S. side to reduce the automatic default to NOFORN. In addition, the United States will need to start with more limited sharing and build from there as allies and partners improve their counterintelligence and, over time, harmonize their collection efforts with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. systems are complex for partners and allies to navigate, and they are made worse when the United States lacks the personnel to ensure prompt responses. More liaison officers for joint planning and intelligence sharing are necessary, as is more training for both U.S. and allied officials on the complexities of U.S. procedures, so their requests can avoid common pitfalls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4-build-stronger-personal-connections&quot;&gt;4. Build Stronger Personal Connections&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multinational efforts can also improve personal connections and, in so doing, build trust that is invaluable during a crisis. In addition, these connections are vital for work-arounds when institutional cooperation is slow or otherwise insufficient. As the Military Framework’s official history notes, “The most precious ‘product’ of the framework is neither tangible nor measurable. It is instead something elusive and sublime: trust.” Expanding the circle for institutions will strengthen personal connections, as will increasing personnel. A particular effort should be made to increase the number of speakers of Asian languages who work with allies and to ensure that rotations and assignments to Asia help build long-term expertise and personal connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-benefits-of-greater-cooperation&quot;&gt;The Benefits of Greater Cooperation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These recommendations, taken together, can improve planning, make partner militaries stronger, and bolster sharing in general. With common or compatible systems, procedures, and communication protocols, allied forces can coordinate actions more efficiently, respond faster to emerging threats, and achieve objectives with greater precision. Intelligence relationships can also bolster overall diplomacy and alliance strength. By sharing capabilities, resources, and information, interoperability leads to more efficient use of military assets and more coordinated responses. Demonstrating military interoperability also sends a clear message about the solidity of alliances and the collective commitment to maintaining international security and order. Integrated command and control systems enable allied forces to deploy and operate together effectively on short notice, helping allies to leverage each other’s strengths and compensate for individual limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with allies and partners can be frustrating and is always time-consuming. The results are invariably incomplete, and the benefits difficult to measure in peacetime. Strong alliances, however, are the bedrock of deterrence and warfighting: They can help the United States avoid a war with China through effective deterrence and, should deterrence fail, enable the United States to triumph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;US defence policy and planning will increasingly focus on preparing for possible military conflict with China. The trade war between the two could accelerate tensions and planning on both sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The policy will be more transactional, requiring allies and partners to assume greater responsibility for defending their countries and regions, underwriting the costs of US bases and activities, and expecting them to continue to buy US equipment in large volumes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At home, there will be attempts to refocus US defence towards better securing and defending the US homeland. The DoD will need to square the circle between the trillion-dollar defence budget Trump has mooted and the cost-cutting exercises in train. Key areas for investment will include accelerating force modernisation and missile defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these strands could overlap or combine this Summer: at the NATO Summit in June, in the event of a ceasefire in Ukraine (or major falling-out between the US and Russia) and in case of major Israeli strikes against Iran’s nuclear facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new National Defence Strategy is due to be completed by the end of August. We should expect a short, punchy document setting out principles, tasks and priorities rather than a detailed blueprint for future US force structure and capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-approach&quot;&gt;Policy Approach&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the first 100 days of the President Trump’s second presidency, his economic policy approach and foreign policy priorities became clearer, with the contours of his defence policy now firming up to become increasingly consequential as the year progresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as the “America First” principle, key themes of US defence policy include: stopping current wars and preventing new ones; restoring US military strength and rebuilding the US defence industrial base; requiring allies and partners to pay more for their own defence and their regions’ security; strengthening US borders and stepping up protection against potential missile attacks on the US; and rebalancing US capability planning and force posture to prepare for a future conflict with China – as “the pacing threat”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Washington post reported in March the headlines of a secret internal planning document, the Interim National Defence Strategic Guidance, which provides a prioritisation framework for officials to turn these defence policy themes into plans, activities and operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assessment in the executive summary above assumes a relatively orderly approach to implementation of this policy approach. Trump’s approach to foreign policy, tariffs and trade show that he is prepared to take significant risks. It remains to be seen whether his approach to defence will remain within the contours that have emerged so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of May, Defence Secretary Hegseth issued a memorandum directing the development of a new National Defence Strategy to help deliver Trump’s twin imperatives of putting “America First” and delivering “Peace Through Strength”. It is due to be completed by the end of August, with an unclassified version probably available in September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;use-of-military-force&quot;&gt;Use of Military Force&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tump authorised the first military action of this administration, against the Houthis in Yemen, in March. US-led attacks increased in scale over several weeks. On 6th May Trump announced that the Houthis had agreed to stop attacks against international shipping in the Red Sea, and in response he was suspending attacks against Houthi targets in Yemen. The Houthis have subsequently said that attacks against Israel will continue. There is speculation that this “truce” will end after Trump’s tour to the Gulf this week concludes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand Trump’s attitude to the military instrument requires looking back to his first term. In 2017, Trump inherited a major coalition campaign already underway against ISIS, but US operations against the organisation intensified and culminated under his leadership. He eventually presided over its final territorial defeat in Syria in 2019 (and, with some fanfare the special forces operation which led to the death of its leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi). The coalition later assessed at least 80,000 ISIS casualties during operations against the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Publicly hostile to long-term military commitments, beyond the Counter-ISIS campaign, Trump authorised relatively few military operations in his first term – but those he did sign-off were significant (notably strikes against Bashar Al-Assad’s Syria after use of chemical weapons and the targeted killing of IRGC Quds Force Commander Qassem Soleimani).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite his own personal interest in being perceived as a peacemaker, he could be prepared to resort to the military instrument more regularly – and potentially at scale – during his second term if he judges that circumstances require such responses. As well as the operations against the Houthis, the US bombed targets in Somalia, Iraq and Syria in the past three months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump will want to avoid the military entanglements and longer-term commitments of which he has been so dismissive. So, he will prefer the precise and occasional use of naval and air power – and particularly stand-off missile strikes – to the use of land forces wherever possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The build-up of US forces in the Middle East now underway would provide the capability to undertake a range of operations if circumstances required. The US is actively discouraging Israel from any attack against Iran’s nuclear programme this summer and is investing heavily in diplomacy designed to reach a new nuclear deal with Iran. But in the event that Israel ignores this counsel and mounts independent large-scale attacks against Iran, and Iran retaliates at scale, it seems likely that the US would be drawn into the conflict. Any such conflict could well be protracted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Middle East, the US has been clear that it will not provide a “backstop” security guarantee for Ukraine or support for a European assurance force in the event of a ceasefire or peace deal there. More broadly, the US commitment to the NATO Article V guarantee seems weaker than at any time since it was agreed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closer to the US, DoD planners have been asked to draw up options to increase the US troop presence in Panama. Defence Secretary Hegseth visited last month and has spoken of “reviving” US military bases there. Further covert US military action against the cartels in Mexico and Venezuela seems possible – surveillance operations over Mexico are being stepped-up and the US military is taking control of land along the US-military border. Ecuador’s president said recently that he would welcome US military assistance in his “war” against the cartels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Direct US military action against Greenland seems unlikely, but it would not be surprising to see the US military presence at its space base there being increased, perhaps quite substantially. That would enable the US to declare effective military control over Greenland if circumstances required it – in US eyes. A US military attack against Canada seems inconceivable; continuing economic coercion seems highly likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither the US nor China want to go to war over Taiwan. But both are actively preparing for major operations in that area. The risks are increasing sharply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-people&quot;&gt;The People&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with other areas, major US defence policy decisions will continue to be made by Trump and his immediate inner circle. But Trump has no background in defence, the DoD is a huge, complex bureaucracy and defence planning is a long-term business. So, the top team in the Pentagon should have increasing influence as Trump’s second term progresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Defence Secretary Hegseth and his deputy, Stephen Feinberg, have little relevant defence experience (Hegseth’s position is also in doubt after his own role in the “Signal” controversy, as well as firing several of his own personal advisers). On the military side, having removed Charles Brown as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Trump has replaced him with a retired 3-star Air Force officer, Dan Caine, who has now been confirmed by the Senate. He has also removed a string of other senior military personnel and national security staff. There are concerns that, after public disagreements with a series of strong-minded Defence Secretaries and Chairmen during his first term, Trump is appointing figures who will demonstrate the personal loyalty he prizes – and be less likely to obstruct his plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major contours of US defence policy are instead likely to be set by Elbridge Colby, who was confirmed by the Senate last month as Under Secretary for Defence Policy. He is a China hawk and critic of European defence spending. He will reinforce arguments for re-setting US defence policy, posture and planning towards preparing for a conflict with China. He will argue for withdrawing some US forces from Europe and spoke last week about the need for the Europeans to assume much greater responsibility for and focus more directly on security in this region. He supports AUKUS in principle but has suggested that the US will need to re-think its commitment to providing Virginia-class submarines to Australia in advance of building up the US attack submarine fleet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colby will author the new US National Defence Strategy. The strategy he produced in 2018 was well regarded, including for its qualities of brevity and clarity. We should expect another short, punchy document setting out principles, tasks and priorities for US defence rather than a detailed blueprint for future US force structure and capabilities. The prospectus he spoke to at Policy Exchange last summer and during his Senate confirmation hearing will likely be reflected in this new strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above the Pentagon, four figures other than Trump will be particularly influential. Vice President Vance’s position on European security and disdain for allies is very clear. On defence matters, we should expect him to be aligned with the positions Colby is advocating. Analysts in the defence community hold that Stephen Miller, Trump’s Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy sees major reductions in the defence budget as possible, and that Russell Vought, the director of the Office for Management and Budget, shares his view. Elon Musk’s views are starker still, although he now seems to be losing ground and influence as he steps back from his role in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Nonetheless, we expect the cost-cutting and efficiency initiatives he set in motion will continue to influence federal agencies, including DoD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This quartet is likely to be influential and hands-on in the approach Trump takes to driving through plans to re-set military commitments overseas and reform US defence at home. It remains to be seen whether Marco Rubio or whoever succeeds him as NSA chooses to play a major role in setting defence policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;re-setting-us-defence-overseas&quot;&gt;Re-setting US Defence Overseas&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European theatre will be an early test-case for how the US intends to re-set its overseas commitments. A set of steps/measures could include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Withdrawing progressively up to a third of current US combat forces from Europe, mainly from Germany, potentially some from UK, Poland, Italy and Spain, and rotational forces from the Baltics and Romania.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Progressively withdrawing key capabilities and enablers, particularly command and control capabilities, air defence, armour and artillery, deep strike capabilities, air and space-based ISR, AAR and transport aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Explicitly linking a US commitment to Article V only to those allies that satisfy certain conditions, including levels of defence spending.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More radically, and less formally, the US nuclear guarantee could be diluted by equivocation about using US nuclear weapons in the defence of Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some capabilities and enablers would be redeployed to the Asia-Pacific theatre, others would return to the US. More importantly, US contingency planning seems likely to quite significantly adjust downwards assumptions about the scale of reinforcements the US would be prepared to deploy to Europe in the event of a major crisis there. In the scenario above, the US would continue to sell platforms, weapons and other systems to European nations (insofar as they wish to buy them in future) and provide effective support to in-service capabilities and systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secretary of State (now also NSA) Rubio offered European members of NATO reassurances in Brussels at the start of April that the US would re-set its approach to European security in a measured way. And some US figures, including outgoing SACEUR, General Cavoli, are stressing that a strong US presence in Europe contributes to US national security by defending the US homeland forward, allowing the US to project combat power globally, and deterring Russian aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But from Trump down, senior US figures are united behind the demand the European members of NATO should spend 5% of their GDP on defence and take greater responsibility for the defence of Europe. Most will regard this target as an unrealistic negotiating ploy. NATO Secretary General Rutte is working to find creative ways to bridge this gap. These issues could well come to a head at the NATO Summit in the Hague between 24-26 June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There would be a major gap to fill in the second half of this decade as and when the US enacts the changes set out above – or goes further. Major European defence players are reportedly drawing up plans to take on greater responsibilities for the continent’s defence, on the basis of a managed transfer over the next 5-10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the current US military build-up in the Middle East region and the growing possibility of a major crisis there this year, we do not expect the US to make any significant adjustments to the current US basing-arrangements in the region until after this tension has subsided – or the crisis has played itself out (though the US military presence in Syria is being trimmed). Thereafter, the US is likely to continue to adopt a mercantile approach to US military presence in the region, maintaining bases and forces in countries who pay for those bases and buy significant amounts of US military equipment. Trump will be well satisfied with the major financial commitments he received from leaders in the Gulf this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reforming-us-defence&quot;&gt;Reforming US Defence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picture on reforming US defence at home is less clear. Some announcements have been contradictory. One of Hegseth’s first moves was to announce that he would significantly re-balance US defence towards Trump’s new national security priorities, and remove 8% of the budget, circa $50 billion, allocated to non-core activities over the next five years. A major set of programmes that would be exempted from these measures, including the nuclear programme, Virginia-class submarines, uncrewed systems and the Air Force’s emerging uncrewed fighter jet program, surface ships, cybersecurity, munitions and homeland missile defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together this list of programmes accounts for the vast majority of the DoD’s equipment spend. It follows that, in order to deliver these reductions, the DoD would need to take an aggressive approach to delivering the core programmes more cost-efficiently, cutting back non-core programmes and reducing the costs of the civilian and contractor workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two constituencies will potentially stand in the way of this approach. The defence-industrial complex in the US has adapted slowly over the past several decades, despite the reformist zeal shown by more effective teams than the new management in the Pentagon. And Congress has always played a significant role in the oversight of defence policy, plans and particularly the defence budget. Senior Republicans might yet find their voices on these issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of last month, Trump spoke of increasing the US defence budget to $1 trillion (up from circa $890 billion this US financial year). Neither the DoD nor White House has provided any detail on how this uplift would be spent. The “Golden Dome” missile defence system Trump has spoken of could absorb a significant element, as would widespread force modernisation. The defence budget request for the year ahead is expected in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the picture on US defence should be clearer by the end of the summer, when several of the issues described above will have developed or played-out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the 2014 Wales Summit, the UK country spearheaded the formation of a multi-national military partnership – the Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF). The announcement elicited only a moderate degree of attention and reaction at the time. But more than a decade later, it has proven to be a remarkable and surprising success in keeping the peace in Northern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An often overlooked but strategically vital part of Europe – the Western Balkans – now stands at a critical turning-point. Decades of peacebuilding risk being undermined by secessionism and increasingly militant local nationalisms, both emboldened by Russian interference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Croatia, Slovenia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Albania are in NATO – but as long as Bosnia and Kosovo remain outside of the Alliance, they will remain deeply vulnerable to external interference. In the absence of their membership in the trans-Atlantic community, these two countries have remained the prime target of Serbian and Russian meddling in recent years. This could cascade into greater instability, and even warfare, in the Balkans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This situation can be changed by thinking outside the box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-origins-of-the-jef&quot;&gt;The Origins of the JEF&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The origins of the Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) date back to 2010, when the UK Ministry of Defence established the Northern Group concept. The Northern Group includes the five Nordic countries, the three Baltic states, as well as Poland, Germany, and the Netherlands. Three main factors motivated the creation of this grouping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the UK is a Northern European country with corresponding security interests. At the time, much of the strategic focus was on counterinsurgency operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. As a result, British policymakers appeared to lose sight of the enduring threat posed by Russia, and London’s broader role in European security. The 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review placed an emphasis on boosting “Alliances and Partnerships,” stating that the UK should seek “new models of practical bilateral defence and security co-operation with a range of allies and partners.” As a key power in the region, the UK had both the interest and the responsibility to assume a more proactive leadership role in Northern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Northern Europe needed greater co-ordination and co-operation on security matters. There was significant overlap and fragmentation among the various existing regional security arrangements. For example, in 2010, Finland and Sweden were members of the European Union but not of NATO. Norway was a NATO member but not part of the EU. Denmark was in both the EU and NATO, but had a special opt-out from the EU’s Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). The Northern Group demonstrated that traditional diplomacy and multilateral engagement could still enhance regional security – defence co-operation need not be confined to or directed by large institutional frameworks like NATO or the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the creation of a multinational security platform in Northern Europe served a domestic political purpose. It allowed Conservative ministers in the coalition government with the Liberal Democrats to show that scepticism toward Brussels was not synonymous with being “anti-European.” At a time when Euroscepticism was beginning to rise in the UK, initiatives like the Northern Group helped communicate that London was not abandoning Europe – even as debates about the UK’s relationship with the EU intensified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These developments eventually led to the establishment of the JEF in 2014. For the Nordic and Baltic states, the JEF has become a flexible, predictable and capable source of deterrence in Northern Europe. This 10,000-strong force – “committed to upholding peace, stability, and international law” – has consistently punched above its weight. Rather than undermining existing defence efforts, the JEF has complemented them, helping to turn the ambitious goals of the Nordic Defence Co-operation (NORDEFCO) into a reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The JEF has demonstrated its ability to address today’s most pressing geopolitical challenges. It has been a steadfast supporter of Ukraine, and there have been growing calls from key officials and ministers to invite Ukraine to participate in the future. The JEF could also play a constructive role in any future ceasefire or post-war security arrangement between Ukraine and Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has praised the JEF’s support, attending a JEF summit and urging its members to “help yourselves by helping us.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The durability and popularity of JEF is a testimony to its success. It has even been touted as a model for addressing wider Indo-Pacific theatre and emerging global security issues more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bjef-is-needed&quot;&gt;BJEF is Needed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is another region that also requires a more focused UK role: the Balkans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the same factors that prompted the creation of the Northern Group and the Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) also apply to the UK’s approach to the Balkans and support the case for establishing a Balkans Joint Expeditionary Force (BJEF) led by the UK and including the seven Balkans countries of Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Slovenia (Henceforth, the BJEF-7).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, Britain has a long historical involvement in the region dating back to the 19th century. More recent history – whether the events of 1914 or the wars of the 1990s – demonstrates that instability in the Balkans often reverberates across Europe, including the UK. While the UK is not itself a Balkan country, it can act like a Balkan power, as the region remains closely tied to Britain’s security and broader strategic interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, as in Northern Europe, the Balkans comprise a complex patchwork of overlapping security and organisational affiliations. Croatia and Slovenia are members of both NATO and the EU. Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Albania are in NATO but not the EU. Bosnia and Herzegovina is in neither but is a candidate for NATO membership and hosts the EU’s largest military operation through EUFOR. Kosovo – while not recognised by all NATO and EU member states – strives for deeper integration with the Euro-Atlantic community and currently hosts NATO’s largest ongoing military operation through KFOR. Despite this fragmented institutional landscape, the countries of the region face shared security challenges. The UK is well positioned to serve as a framework nation and convening power for a JEF-style force in the Balkans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is a domestic political incentive for London to act. The UK has been a leading European power for centuries, and this will continue regardless of its EU membership status. Moreover, the Labour Party was recently elected on a platform that included a commitment to establish a new security relationship with the European Union. Focusing UK-EU defence cooperation on the Balkans would be an ideal way to build confidence between London and Brussels – while also demonstrating to Washington that Europe is willing to shoulder a greater share of the security burden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;geopolitical-and-security-challenges-in-the-balkans&quot;&gt;Geopolitical and Security Challenges in the Balkans&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirty years after the Dayton Peace Agreement brought an end to the Bosnian War, the Balkans remain an area of unfinished business for Euro-Atlantic integration and continue to represent a source of instability in the continent’s immediate neighbourhood. Aside from Ukraine, it is Europe’s most persistent geopolitical challenge. Following the violent wars of the 1990s that accompanied the dissolution of Yugoslavia, Europe and the United States helped stabilise the region through sustained peacekeeping and diplomatic engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, times have changed. With the US and Europe unwilling or unable to engage meaningfully in the Balkans, a deep power vacuum has emerged in the region that outside actors like Russia and China are rushing to fill. The challenges in the Balkans are threefold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the past risks repeating itself if the West/Britain fails to learn its lessons. Serbia is where Russia was in 2014, intoxicated by historical grievances, anti-Western sentiment, and engaging in “wolf-warrior” diplomacy. Unfortunately, the EU, US and UK have met this sabre-rattling with equivocation and weakness. Seeing Serbia’s success with this approach, others have increasingly followed their lead, including Croatia and Hungary, who now routinely interfere in the domestic politics of Bosnia and Kosovo. (NB: Croatia has excellent links to Kosovo, mainly due to Kosovo being seen as a counterbalance to Serbia).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, Serbia has matched such rhetoric with action – the “Serbian World” agenda is in full swing, inspired by Slobodan Milosevic’s “Greater Serbia”. President Vucic has been called “The Political Son of Milosevic” and has taken Serbia down an increasingly illiberal and irredentist path. Serbian rearmament, the planned introduction of conscription, and the illegal deployment of troops to the Kosovan border are no accidents – they are part of this broader strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, across the Balkans, with the exception of KFOR, there is no credible and effective deterrence to meet this challenge. EUFOR has been hollowed out, and the lack of a robust NATO and EU commitment to the region has created a power vacuum which adversaries have exploited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has fuelled and embraced the rising discord in the region. Russia has provided extensive political, economic, and diplomatic support to Serbia and secessionists in Bosnia’s Republika Srpska entity. The Russian Ambassador even remarked that ’In the case of practical rapprochement of Bosnia and Herzegovina and NATO, our country will have to react to this hostile act’. Yet the vast majority of Bosnians – including a significant minority of Bosnian Serbs – support NATO membership, and the 2005 “Law on Defence” clearly stated the ambition to join NATO, and committed officials to prepare the country’s legal architecture for the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, Russia continues to block international recognition of Kosovo, to embolden secessionists in the Republic Srpska entity, while seeking to expand their “near monopoly on the oil and gas market” in the region. Russian sympathizers in Bosnia’s Croat nationalist HDZ also continue to block the country’s decoupling from Russian gas. Moscow’s “War on Truth” disinformation campaigns, spearheaded by state-backed media forces such as RT and Sputnik, have also fuelled the rising anti-Western sentiment in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could escalate into armed conflict if the situation deteriorates much further. Successive rounds of armed clashes in Kosovo and acts of state-backed sabotage are major red flags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;benefits-and-challenges-of-a-bjef&quot;&gt;Benefits and Challenges of a BJEF&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result – a Balkan Joint Expeditionary Force (BJEF) may just be the “Game-Changer” the region needs in a time when the peace, 30 years later, seems to be unravelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A BJEF could bring the unity, stability and security the region deserves and needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improving regional interoperability.&lt;/strong&gt; A Balkans Joint Expeditionary Force (BJEF) would enhance interoperability among participating forces and deepen the region’s integration with the institutions of the democratic world. It would help place the Western Balkan countries firmly on the path toward Euro-Atlantic integration, supporting their eventual membership in NATO and the EU. British forces could serve as the framework nation and provide training, mentoring and assistance to local forces, as they already do under existing initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expanding Operation CHELONIA.&lt;/strong&gt; The UK could use the BJEF framework to scale-up and broaden the scope of Operation CHELONIA, its current defence cooperation initiative in the Balkans.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establishing a standing coordination mechanism.&lt;/strong&gt; The BJEF would institutionalise UK-Balkan defence coordination, leading to annual BJEF ministerial meetings and CHOD-level (Chiefs of Defence) engagements. Between summits, UK officials would regularly consult and coordinate with their BJEF-7 counterparts to ensure strategic alignment and operational readiness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improving regional military capability.&lt;/strong&gt; By standardising training, facilitating joint exercises, and promoting doctrinal alignment, the BJEF would strengthen the military effectiveness of participating countries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operational flexibility.&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike NATO or EU CSDP missions, the BJEF would not require unanimity to initiate operations. As with the JEF, the United Kingdom would act as the framework nation and, following consultation, could launch operations with any combination of participating members. Each BJEF-7 state would retain full sovereign authority over whether or not to contribute forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expanding options for policymakers.&lt;/strong&gt; Like the JEF, the BJEF could serve both as a deterrent and a rapid-response mechanism. It would train for, and when necessary, conduct localised operations across the region, such as:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Bosnia and Herzegovina,&lt;/strong&gt; it could reinforce EUFOR-Althea in deterring secessionist threats from the entity of Republika Srpska or establish a permanent presence in the strategically critical Brčko corridor.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Kosovo,&lt;/strong&gt; the BJEF could augment KFOR to deter aggression and support the security of Serb-majority municipalities in the north. It could work alongside local security services in joint patrols and border control missions to combat organised crime and smuggling.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In the event of natural disasters, the BJEF could also provide emergency relief, including search and rescue operations.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Giving Britain a stake in Balkan security.&lt;/strong&gt; The UK would serve as the “organiser-in-chief” of the BJEF, with regional partners contributing the bulk of the personnel. The UK would provide planning, command and control, special forces capabilities, logistics, and the institutional knowledge gained from its leadership of the JEF. Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina, due to their relatively larger armed forces, would likely be the main troop contributors, with Kosovo rapidly developing its own capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhance burden sharing within the transatlantic alliance.&lt;/strong&gt; President Trump and his senior officials have consistently highlighted the imbalance in transatlantic defence contributions. Greater British involvement in the Balkans – particularly through the creation of a BJEF – would serve as a clear example of a European-led solution to a European security challenge. Such a move would undoubtedly be well received by the White House as a demonstration of increased European responsibility in regional defence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give the UK more leverage.&lt;/strong&gt; A UK led BJEF would enhance London’s leverage in regional talks and negotiations, sending a clear signal of resolve and strength to autocrats like Vucic and Putin. For example, a decisive show of strength, such as the mobilisation of the BJEF may be sufficient to deter them from aggressive policies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake, even with the many opportunities that the creation of a BJEF could have on the region, this initiative is not without its challenges. Several obstacles would need to be addressed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limited resources among regional states.&lt;/strong&gt; Collectively, the BJEF-7 countries spent approximately $4.1 billion on defence in 2024, according to NATO’s official data releases for NATO members and World Bank estimates for Bosnia and Kosovo. For comparison, Sweden – a single JEF member – spent roughly three times that amount in the same year. Only four of the BJEF-7 (Kosovo, Albania, North Macedonia, and Montenegro) met or slightly exceeded NATO’s 2% of GDP defence spending benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enduring regional mistrust.&lt;/strong&gt; The historical and contemporary tensions between the Western Balkan nations make it a challenge to bring these nations together in a common cause. However, a bias-free neutral framework combined with mission clarity will ensure that BJEF operates as a force to heal, not exacerbate, existing tensions. A key example is the relationship between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia. Croatia’s involvement, particularly its political support for Bosnian Croat leaders seeking greater autonomy or the creation of a separate entity within Bosnia and Herzegovina has, at times, complicated Bosnia’s internal stability and efforts at unity. Addressing such sensitivities with balance and care is essential for building regional cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-recognition of Kosovo.&lt;/strong&gt; Bosnia and Herzegovina does not formally recognise Kosovo’s independence. While this complicates Kosovo’s full participation in the BJEF, it does not render it impossible – particularly if pragmatic and inclusive policies are pursued.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resource constraints in the UK.&lt;/strong&gt; Successive British governments have underinvested in defence. Nonetheless, the geopolitical benefits of serving as the BJEF framework nation would far outweigh the modest financial burden. For context, since 2023 the UK has allocated only £1.19 million to the JEF – an affordable investment relative to the strategic value returned.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russian misinformation.&lt;/strong&gt; As with any significant NATO or European military deployment or training exercise, Russian disinformation efforts will seek to undermine the legitimacy of the mission and sow distrust among local populations. The UK must proactively counter this by developing a clear public engagement strategy that explains the purpose of the BJEF, its activities, and the benefits it brings to regional stability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand that the BJEF is not a silver bullet.&lt;/strong&gt; The Balkans region faces many challenges unrelated to security. Rampant corruption and stagnant economic activity are exacerbated by a lack of energy security and sectarian divisions. The BJEF should be considered a tool in the UK’s Balkan toolbox, but it must be one part of a larger strategy that London should take towards the region.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenging situation in the Western Balkans is a security issue – demanding a security response – grounded in firm clarity and decisive action. With this in mind, there are three pressing challenges facing the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-british-role&quot;&gt;The British Role&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Britain ought to take this seriously and urgently. Indeed, globally there are now the highest number of active conflicts than at any point since the Second World War. MI5 recently warned of “mayhem in our streets” due to covert, and overt, Russian action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Britain has taken a more active approach to the Western Balkans, as embodied by the recent Operation Chelonia training exercises and the signing of new deals to tackle smuggling gangs are most welcome. It has also provided critically needed training to the Bosnian Armed Forces in recent years, increasing their NATO interoperability capacities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Britain has the means and resources to organise and promote BJEF, supporting the force from its bases in Cyprus and Gibraltar. As the UK seeks to fulfil our post-Brexit “Global Britain” ambitions, there are few better ways to signal its commitment to deterrence. There are also facilities in Bosnia and Kosovo that could be easily re-operationalized for these purposes, in addition to NATO facilities in Albania, Montenegro, and North Macedonia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the sidelines of the UK-hosted Berlin Process Summit in October, the UK should convene an initial meeting of the BJEF-7 countries. This should be followed by technical consultations at the official level, leading to the signing of a Letter of Intent, a Foundational Memorandum of Understanding, and ultimately a Comprehensive Memorandum of Understanding. The Comprehensive MoU would provide the strategic context and formalise the operational framework within which the BJEF would function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration has made it clear that the Europeans must step up “Burden-Sharing”, and not rely on American resources and troops, as their geopolitical focus shifts further to the Indo-Pacific. The creation of the BJEF could be the first step in this direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now is the time to show firm leadership and clear resolve. An EU-UK defence pact is welcome, and the Western Balkans ought to play an important role when European security is considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rapid reaction capabilities and the flexibility of the BJEF would be an essential tool to act not only to deal with crises quickly and effectively – but also to deter them. If such a force had existed and been employed in Bosnia and Kosovo in the 1990s, countless lives could have been saved, and the region’s political stability would certainly be in far better shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK can either ignore the problem and deem it to be beyond its immediate concern and interest because the Balkans are more than 1,000 miles away, or policymakers can deal with an even greater problem later on. If conflict did break out, another refugee and energy crisis would once again sweep Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recall, Putin moved on Ukraine first in 2014, and then again in 2022. Years of Western appeasement, the rollback of military commitments, and the inadequate sanctions regimes emboldened Moscow. The UK risks repeating the same mistakes in the Western Balkans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the UK has a responsibility to the region, to the soldiers who served and to those who do not wish to see decades of peacebuilding and reconciliation abandoned. From the Baltics to the Nordics to Ukraine to Hong Kong, the British Government has shown admirable leadership and moral clarity in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK ought to take the initiative once again to prevent our continent from sleepwalking into conflict once again. The challenge in the Balkans, due to the lack of deterrence, the rise of Serbia, and the spectre of Russia, risks escalating into a full-blown crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would be a much more efficient, organised, and powerful force than the existing haphazard and fragmented arrangements. And it would help to bring unity and hope to the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A force centred around the use of rapid reaction, pooled resources and cutting-edge technology – but guided by the timeless principles of unity, peacekeeping and collective security, will blend the old with the new to create a power fit for the challenges of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The price of pre-emptive action is always much cheaper than the price of apathy and abandonment. But if the UK opts for the latter, it won’t be just the Balkans which will suffer as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

Closer cooperation with allies on ship construction and repair could help counter China’s maritime threat and bolster U.S. industrial resilience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military conflict in the Indo-Pacific would demand overwhelming U.S. naval power. Yet the shipbuilding sector faces capacity shortages, industrial base constraints, cost overruns, and delayed delivery, suggesting that Washington should explore alternative pathways for delivering naval capability. One approach is to enhance cooperation with close allies such as Japan and South Korea. Options for cooperation include allied participation in maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO); allied purchase and revitalization of U.S. shipyards; various methods of coproduction, including modular construction; and U.S. purchase of allied-built ships. Novel strategies that leverage the United States’ strong and unique network of allies and partners will require thoughtful implementation of industrial cooperation policy, which has historically been challenging. For the United States to strike the right balance between leaning on its allies and partners to alleviate its shipbuilding problems and investing in its own capabilities at home—for these approaches are not mutually exclusive—it should understand the implications of its various cooperative options with its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2022 National Security Strategy identifies China as the United States’ “pacing challenge,” and recent announcements by the Trump administration have reaffirmed this focus. CIA Director John Ratcliffe said in April 2025 that “no adversary in the history of our nation has presented a more formidable challenge” than China. Given the vastness of the Pacific theatre, its vital shipping lanes, and the many regional allies and partners depending on a persistent U.S. security presence, sea power is critical to the U.S. strategy for promoting a free and open Indo-Pacific and competing with China. However, the United States has long struggled with shipyard capacity as well as timely and cost-effective construction of naval vessels. Policies aimed at maintaining its shipbuilding industrial base have failed to yield a sector that keeps pace with those of potential adversaries. In April 2024, a 45-day review of the U.S. shipbuilding industrial base by the secretary of the Navy found that many of the Navy’s major shipbuilding programs were one to three years behind schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lack of adequate naval shipbuilding capacity, as well as the moribund state of the U.S. commercial shipbuilding industry, significantly hinders the country’s ability to increase production of ships. U.S. workforce constraints, facilities limitations, and supply chain challenges have contributed to an inability to deliver necessary capabilities on schedule and at scale. At the same time, China’s share of global commercial and military shipbuilding continues to grow rapidly, accounting for 51 percent of global ship deliveries in 2023, with current trends pointing toward an eventual shift in the maritime balance of power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/HvglsBq.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;

Funaiole, Brian Hart, and Aidan-Powers Riggs, Ship Wars: Confronting China’s Dual-Use Shipbuilding Empire (Washington, DC: CSIS, March 2025)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to this shipbuilding crisis, new modalities are needed, particularly those that lean on the United States’ allies. The U.S. Navy could turn to Japan and South Korea for industrial cooperation to scale warship production, which would represent an important shift in its naval acquisition policy and broader industrial partnerships with allies. South Korea and Japan are the world’s second and third largest producers of ships, respectively, and could contribute significantly to U.S. warship production, whether overseas or at U.S. shipyards. Carlos del Toro, the secretary of the Navy under the Biden administration, was forward-leaning in considering the possibility of looking abroad to reinvigorate the U.S. shipbuilding industry and maritime production, and recent comments from the Trump administration appear to indicate it is also favorable to rethinking approaches to increase capacity. An April 2025 executive order entitled “Restoring America’s Maritime Dominance” explicitly discusses the possibility of shipbuilders in allied nations undertaking capital investment to help strengthen the shipbuilding capacity of the United States. However, there is currently a lack of rigorous and public analyses on the potential advantages and challenges of the several ways in which U.S. industry could cooperate with allies on shipbuilding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are multiple approaches that United States could take to leverage allied capacity. These include using allied MRO capabilities to free up space in U.S. shipyards, enabling allied purchase and revitalization of U.S. shipyards, working with allied shipyards to coproduce ships through modular construction methods, or purchasing ships directly from allied yards. All these pathways involve trade-offs between time, cost, regulatory and political hurdles, as well as other variables of interest to policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each approach to international shipbuilding cooperation comes with its own benefits and drawbacks. These pathways are not mutually exclusive, and the U.S. government may also choose to pursue a combination of pathways; if so, it should also consider whether and how cooperation methods affect each other when pursued simultaneously or sequentially. Such an analysis should take into account the possibility that pathways impact the same underlying factors, such as labor availability or overall demand, as well as potential path dependencies in industrial planning, wherein funding one shipyard approach may require the conversion or use of limited yard space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these approaches could each serve as useful measures to enhance naval capability, they would each affect the long-term health of the U.S. shipbuilding industry. Determining the nature of this impact—be it positive, negative, or a combination of the two, with variation across different subsectors—is critical for policymakers as they balance meeting the imminent threat from China with the strategic need to ensure the long-term strength of the U.S. shipbuilding industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background-and-analysis&quot;&gt;Background and Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-strategic-situation&quot;&gt;The Strategic Situation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sea control will likely play a key role in any potential conflict with China given the vastness of the Pacific Ocean and the location of flashpoint areas such as Taiwan, the South China Sea, the Korean Peninsula, and Guam. A series of wargames conducted at CSIS in 2024 indicated that in the case of a conflict over Taiwan, the United States would likely incur significant losses of ships, submarines, and planes, including naval aviation assets. While the U.S. Navy retains a qualitative and tonnage edge over China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), the pace of PLAN construction greatly exceeds that of the U.S. Navy. Chinese shipbuilding, both naval and commercial, has been thriving. Due to substantial industrial subsidies, China’s shipyards have gone from producing 5 percent of the world’s commercial ships in 1999 to over 50 percent in 2025, and many of these shipyards embrace the Chinese Communist Party’s military-civil fusion strategy and produce warships for the Navy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a protracted great power conflict that leads to significant losses, the United States would have to rapidly repair and replace its ships and invest in new vessels to maintain control of sea lines of communication. Given the well-documented struggles of U.S. shipbuilding, the United States should explore supplementing domestic production with other options for sustaining and growing its naval might. Cooperation with shipbuilding heavyweights South Korea and Japan offers one possible approach to solving this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-united-states-shipbuilding-challenge&quot;&gt;The United States’ Shipbuilding Challenge&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. naval shipbuilding sector faces critical hurdles. The most commonly cited are skilled-workforce constraints, antiquated shipyard infrastructure and equipment, insufficient use of new technology including digital tools and modular construction techniques, and legacy organizational structures. Analysts point to issues in U.S. design capacity, hyper-specialization of military shipyards that holds back scalability, and a 20-year backlog of maintenance and repairs that constrains the Navy’s ability to practice and train with its existing ships. Some of these issues stem from the closure of U.S. shipyards during the 1990s, which hindered the domestic production of ships and left significant gaps that in industrial readiness. The reasons behind the U.S. shipbuilding challenge are the subject of a substantial and growing body of literature, including recent analyses from policymakers such as Senator Jack Reed (D-RI) and former Senator Jim Inhofe (R-OK); public institutions such as the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the Congressional Research Service; and various think tanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A near universally agreed-upon challenge for the U.S. shipbuilding industry is the need for a larger skilled workforce. A demographic shift away from manufacturing careers, coupled with the retirement of workers with shipbuilding skills, has created recruitment and retention issues, resulting in an inexperienced workforce that lacks proficiency in skilled trades and requires increased supervision to avoid quality problems. A March 2025 Congressional Research Service report found that part of the difficulty in recruiting and retaining new workers lies in the relatively low wages and benefits of shipbuilding jobs. While such jobs still pay better than service and retail, the differential in wages has narrowed, and the latter are less likely to involve risk of serious injury, are often located in areas with easier commutes, and are generally done in cleaner indoor settings. Although increasing total wages for shipbuilding workers could reestablish a large differential in wages and benefits, it would also substantially increase ship procurement costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, shipbuilders also struggle to acquire land for expanding existing shipyard facilities, building new shipyards, or providing housing for workers near shipyards. In 1988, the first Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process prompted the selling of land access along coastlines, resulting in the closure of four naval shipyards in the 1990s. In some places, land could theoretically be repurchased, but at a steep price, given that it has since been put to new productive uses. Greenfield development along coastlines is generally difficult, as there are few appropriate locations that are both unused and affordable to buy and build on. Even when land itself is inexpensive, shipyards can face high costs when developing it—whether for industrial use or worker housing—due to the potential for industrial contamination, which requires expensive remediation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many shipyards around the world, civilian shipbuilding is a critical supporter of naval construction due to the scaling benefits of sharing skillsets and material inputs, as well as the smoothing of demand over time. The United States has rarely been a world-leading constructor of civilian vessels, except during and immediately after World Wars I and II. Consequently, maritime historians argue that the United States’ strategic culture is split between alignment with territorial land empires such as Germany and true sea power states such as the United Kingdom—and therefore is less likely to maintain a consistent engagement with the sea via commercial shipbuilding the way a fully maritime state would. This lack of persistent cultural and strategic interest is reflected in the poor state of U.S. shipbuilding today relative to the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While analysts debate the root cause of the United States’ shipbuilding issues, the U.S. Navy’s demand is only increasing. Its requested shipbuilding budget has risen 38 percent from FY 2020 to FY 2024, according to the Navy’s 2024 plan. The disconnect between supply and demand of shipbuilding capacity is a strategic problem for the United States as it faces stiffer global competition from China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;us-policy-options&quot;&gt;U.S. Policy Options&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to these clear challenges in the face of growing strategic demand, the United States has several possible options, some of which have engaged leaders’ interest and support. Senior political figures such as Senator Mark Kelly (D-AZ) and former National Security Advisor (and former Congressman) Mike Waltz (R-FL) have been at the forefront of efforts to revitalize shipbuilding via domestic investments. Their “Congressional Guidance for a National Maritime Strategy,” published alongside other members of Congress, proposes both incentives for building ships in the United States and carrying cargo on U.S.-flagged commercial vessels. This congressional effort, in the form of the Shipbuilding and Harbor Infrastructure for Prosperity and Security (SHIPS) for America Act of 2025, advances a domestic approach focused on revitalizing shipbuilding within the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SHIPS for America Act, like other current efforts, focuses on generous subsidies and legal privileges for the U.S. shipbuilding industry. This domestic approach draws upon a wide and deep body of literature that aims to diagnose the issues facing domestic shipbuilding; it has many political and intellectual champions within the United States, including from powerful industry groups that have been active since the 1930s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the most promising—yet less comprehensively studied or advocated—policy options involve the United States partnering with Asian allies. Statements from officials in the Trump administration, such as Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, as well as from the Biden administration, including former Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro and former Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel, suggest that U.S. policymakers are interested in exploring cooperating with South Korea and Japan to overcome challenges to the naval shipbuilding industry. Even the SHIPS for America Act’s explicitly domestic strategy includes references to assistance from international actors, especially treaty allies such as South Korea and Japan. The associated congressional guidance notes that the United States should “seek mutually beneficial relationships with treaty allies, exploring comparative advantages to lower cost, time, and the complexity of rebuilding America’s domestic shipping and shipbuilding industry.” Indeed, analysts have proposed a variety of international cooperation options, from realistic ones grounded in statements by Navy and political leaders to more theoretical and creative options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;why-cooperate-internationally-examining-allied-strength-in-shipbuilding&quot;&gt;Why Cooperate Internationally? Examining Allied Strength in Shipbuilding&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the United States, South Korea and Japan have impressive shipbuilding industries, making them valuable potential partners. While China builds more ships overall due to its greater number of shipyards, South Korean and Japanese shipyards continue to lead the world in contemporary productivity due to technical advancements. However, China is rapidly closing the productivity gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea rose as a commercial shipbuilding power between 1970 and 1990 as significant government subsidies, technological advancements, and favorable economic conditions such as low labor costs enabled it to outpace U.S. and European industry during a challenging period for the global shipbuilding market. South Korea has retained its cost-competitive edge even as its labor has grown more expensive alongside the development of its economy. Advancements in automation and control systems within its shipbuilding industry have shifted the sector from labor-intensive to technology-driven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japanese shipbuilders maintain a strong market presence, building on their long period of dominance that began after World War II. The country nevertheless faces challenges in competing with South Korean and Chinese shipyards that excel in increasingly high-value and rapid ship construction. Japan’s focus on high quality standards and adoption of automation could be enhanced to meet military demands, especially with increased collaboration across maritime technology sectors. Much like South Korea, Japan has a strong focus on automation in its shipbuilding sector for both simple vessels and highly complex naval ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the appeal of working with allied shipbuilders, U.S. policymakers should also consider the impact that international approaches to shipbuilding may have on the health of the U.S. shipbuilding industry. Some pathways explored below, such as international companies purchasing U.S. facilities and incorporating their advanced production techniques, have the potential to boost domestic productivity and competitiveness. Other approaches could undermine the industry’s long-term health, particularly if they direct production to foreign shipyards at the cost of domestic order books—which could have downstream impacts on labor force retention and the capacity of U.S. shipbuilding in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea and Japan are not the only U.S.-aligned countries with innovative and effective shipbuilding industries. Other nations may have much to offer the United States, particularly regarding cost-effective warship construction. However, South Korea and Japan are logical starting points for possible cooperation owing not only to their dominance of the commercial shipbuilding market, which gives them significant scale advantage on cost, but also their history of close industrial cooperation with the United States on military production and sustainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;possible-pathways-for-international-cooperation-with-us-allies&quot;&gt;Possible Pathways for International Cooperation with U.S. Allies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study identifies several approaches for international cooperation on naval shipbuilding with South Korea and Japan, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;allied maintenance, repair, and overhaul of U.S. ships to free up U.S. shipyard capacity;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;allied acquisition of U.S. shipyards to revitalize their production capability;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;joint distributed production of warships via modular construction methods; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;U.S. purchase of existing allied warship designs from allied shipyards.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although there are additional avenues for cooperation, these four pathways have emerged as the most likely based on a survey of public discourse, existing U.S. government policies such as the Regional Sustainment Framework, and CSIS interviews with U.S. and allied industry, as well as with government officials, over the past year. Other policy options outside the scope of these pathways, and this report, have been floated, including various combinations or divisions of the above ideas, as well as proposals that depend on outside parties, such as the global naval export market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following sections discuss these possible pathways for cooperation in greater detail. They review the extant literature relevant to each pathway and describe the most viable forms of cooperation within it, as there is often more than one form of activity that the pathway could take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;international-cooperation-on-us-maintenance-repair-and-overhaul&quot;&gt;International Cooperation on U.S. Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MRO activities are essential for ensuring a fleet’s operational readiness and long-term availability for action. MRO activities range from routine inspections and maintenance actions (for example, applying surface coatings) to major service life extensions or refits of weapons systems. Robust MRO capacity enables a nation to maintain combat power during prolonged conflicts and ensure cost-effective and timely servicing of ships during peacetime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, MRO operations in the United States are under severe stress. Due to shipyard capacity, the U.S. Navy is estimated to be 20 years behind on maintenance work; this has led to the decommissioning of viable ships as a result of its inability to conduct core MRO, modernization, and service-life extensions. A February 2025 GAO report identified a lack of infrastructure and workforce capacity as the main obstacle to ship repairs, resulting in an inability to perform unplanned work such as emergency repairs. Even if hiring and retention efforts for skilled labor are successful in ameliorating the widespread workforce shortages, new employees will still be inexperienced, which will likely result in reduced efficiency in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report also notes that workforce and infrastructure capacity is dependent on “fleet concentration areas,” or places where ships are homeported and undergo repair at domestic facilities. The GAO identified the five such areas that conduct major repair: one each in California, Florida, Hawaii, Virginia, and Washington. If slated repair work exceeds the capacity of one fleet concentration area, it may have to be done at another location. To address these physical capacity constraints, two out of seven shipbuilders interviewed for the GAO study have outsourced work to their suppliers, with “plans to expand the volume of material they are outsourcing.” Another shipbuilder has plans to use outsourcing, and an additional one is considering outsourcing if it is awarded a new contract by the Navy. While outsourcing can reduce physical constraints at shipyards, suppliers often “have their own workforce and infrastructure problems.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of these challenges, enabling greater use of allied MRO in the Indo-Pacific region is critical for U.S. strategic goals and those of Japan and South Korea. Allied MRO could help the United States by strengthening supply chains, leveraging the strategic positioning of allied ports, and expanding MRO capacity. Some scholars believe the United States could solve its shipyard dilemma by empowering domestic yards to focus on facilities and process modernization by having allied yards take on maintenance work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has already begun laying the groundwork for greater MRO cooperation across the Indo-Pacific through the Regional Sustainment Framework. One of the core goals of the framework is to leverage existing regional MRO capacity within partner nations, particularly for shared weapons systems operated by allies and partners. Close MRO cooperation with Indo-Pacific treaty allies has already been pursued in Australia, where the United States has begun an initiative to advance combined regional MRO solutions in support of the framework. Another venue for cooperation is the U.S.-Japan Defense Industrial Cooperation, Acquisition, and Sustainment (DICAS) Forum, which aims to accelerate joint development and sustainment of defense equipment. DICAS oversees multiple working groups, including the Ship Repair Working Group, which seeks to identify opportunities and challenges for U.S. naval ships to be maintained by Japanese shipyards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MRO cooperation with South Korea and Japan is hardly new. The U.S. Navy has been collaborating with Japanese industry on MRO since the end of World War II, with NIPPI beginning to service assets in the 1950s. In 2019, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) conducted maintenance on the USS Milius, an Arleigh Burke–class guided missile destroyer, and signaled their desire for more contracts with the U.S. Navy. In 2024, U.S. Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel announced plans to build on the 2019 maintenance collaboration with MHI, saying that the U.S. Navy would send some of its vessels to Japanese shipyards for MRO. Japanese companies have also performed MRO activities on some U.S. auxiliary vessels. Similarly, in August 2024 South Korean naval shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean received their first MRO contract with the U.S. Navy to provide services to one of their cargo and ammunition ships, the USNS Wally Schirra, which has since been completed. In November 2024, Hanwha Ocean received another contract to perform MRO services on the USNS Yukon, a replenishment oiler. Another South Korean shipbuilder, HD Hyundai, signed a Maintenance and Ship Repair Agreement (MSRA) with the U.S. Navy, which qualifies them to bid for maintenance projects for U.S. combat and support ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, some existing literature highlights that shifting MRO work to foreign yards could have negative economic consequences for the U.S. ship-repair and shipbuilding sector, namely the potential loss of business. Other sources indicate that certain parts of MRO operations, such as routine maintenance, constitute only a limited part of shipyard economies; as such, shifting some MRO operations abroad is unlikely to damage the U.S. shipbuilding industry and broader economy. Nevertheless, naval MRO activities between World Wars I and II were a source of stability for cash-strapped shipyards that were otherwise out of work—even if these activities only constituted 0.3 percent of the value of U.S. private shipyards’ total commercial and naval work from 1920–39.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This pathway requires close study to ascertain its potential value to the U.S. Navy, especially in terms of how much it may free up new production capacity in the United States and how offshoring these small but routine (and therefore valuable for long-term financial stability) contracts to U.S. allies may affect the domestic shipbuilding industry. A critical factor in determining the viability of this approach will be its anticipated ability to create new shipbuilding capacity—as the facilities, machinery, and skilled workforce used in MRO operations are not necessarily the same as for shipbuilding and may require substantial time and money to switch. For U.S. allies and partners, the economic appeal of this pathway will depend on the potential magnitude of the market as foreign shipbuilders consider whether to dedicate existing facilities to U.S. naval MRO, expand capacity to support U.S. Navy ships in their home country, or expand capacity in third countries such as the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;allied-acquisition-of-us-shipyards-tech-transfer-and-productivity-improvements&quot;&gt;Allied Acquisition of U.S. Shipyards: Tech Transfer and Productivity Improvements&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allied companies’ acquisition of U.S. shipyards offers another approach for Japanese and South Korean shipbuilders to support U.S. shipbuilding via entering the U.S. market. The goal would be for the purchasers to impart the home nation’s shipbuilding expertise. The foreign company would need to set up a U.S. subsidiary that can prove it is not under foreign ownership, control, or influence—meaning it qualifies as a U.S. company for both Jones Act considerations and “Buy America” clauses in military contracting. In a relevant example, Hanwha Ocean completed its purchase of Philly Shipyard in 2024, having received the necessary regulatory approval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is not just one way for international shipbuilders to become involved in the U.S. domestic shipbuilding market. Through reviews of the literature, qualitative research, and interviews with industry over the past nine months, the following have emerged as possible sub-pathways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;international purchase of existing operational U.S. military shipyards;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;international purchase and renovation of defunct or nonmilitary U.S. shipyards;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;creation of new government-owned, commercially operated (GOCO) U.S. shipyards with foreign shipbuilders considered in the operator bidding pool; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;creation of a joint venture or consortium between U.S. and international industry to produce ships within an existing U.S. shipyard.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key question regarding international acquisition of U.S. shipyards in any of these sub-pathways is whether new ownership can improve shipyard performance. Given that the U.S. workforce and material input costs will largely remain unchanged, the key theorized drivers of improvement would be altered management practices, possible training of U.S. shipyard workforces by experts from shipyards in allied countries, and technology transfer of more advanced foreign shipbuilding techniques to the United States, as well as the accompanying capital infusion required to implement those new techniques. Some of these methods have been publicly discussed by officials from Hanwha as ways to improve their newly acquired Philadelphia yard. These sub-pathways are not mutually exclusive, and selecting one for a given situation would depend on both local conditions and an assessment of how its particulars would facilitate—or not—productivity gains in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology transfer is difficult to catalyze and manage properly. The United States’ experience managing military technology transfer—especially through the Department of Defense, where national competitiveness and security are paramount concerns—has overwhelmingly been as the provider, rather than the recipient. This lack of DOD experience may be a complication for this pathway, necessitating further close study so policymakers and implementers are fully aware of potential hurdles and best practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A limited literature supports the possible beneficial returns of technology transfer from advanced shipbuilding nations like Japan to companies in the United States. One 1987 study examined Japan’s Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries’ (IHI) technology transfer efforts to U.S. shipbuilders, which built on IHI’s advanced techniques, such as block construction, process lane systems, and a strong emphasis on material management and design standardization. It found that IHI was able to improve productivity, but could not bring the U.S. shipyards up to Japanese standards. More recent comprehensive studies are lacking, however, providing an opening for scholars to contribute to the literature on the possible returns and tradeoffs of technology transfer to U.S. shipbuilders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This pathway has been pursued in recent history. Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri purchased the Wisconsin-based Marinette Marine shipyard in 2009, with Lockheed Martin as a minority owner. The new company won the competition to build the Constellation-class guided missile frigate in 2020, although construction setbacks, including workforce limitations and requirements creep, have contributed to late delivery of the first-in-class ship. Austal, an Australian shipbuilder, started operations in Alabama in 1999 and began to expand rapidly in 2005 after winning a contract to design the Independence-variant Littoral Combat Ship for the U.S. Navy. Foreign shipbuilder acquisition in these cases has brought in new investment and modernization efforts. Fincantieri has invested over $300 million in its yards in Wisconsin. It also has leased new yard space in an existing Florida shipyard near Commodores Point in Jacksonville, and announced plans to invest $30 million into improvements and modernization there to support its sustainment and repair work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These examples of international acquisition offer some insight into the opportunities and challenges of foreign ownership that could be applied to future cooperation with South Korea and Japan. The benefits of foreign ownership are clear. Foreign parent firms with commercial shipbuilding enterprises—a rarity in the United States—can bring the energy, expertise, and innovative capabilities of the advanced commercial market to U.S. shipyards. For example, these shipbuilders often use more robotics and automation in processes such as panel making than U.S. defense shipyards do, which can reduce strains on a depleted workforce and improve efficiency. Foreign ownership by large shipbuilders can also enable buying certain inputs in bulk, especially if they are not exclusively military in nature. At a minimum, parent firms can help provide information and negotiation power to their U.S. subsidiaries as they buy components for ships, contributing to lower costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regulatory barriers such as complying with Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) and Foreign Ownership, Control, or Influence (FOCI) mitigation are unlikely to pose major barriers provided there is government support. However, International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) are likely to pose challenges. Ship designs are controlled by ITAR, down to the nonmilitary design elements that could benefit from foreign owners’ commercial expertise, including galley and berth plans. Even visits by experts from potential parent companies can involve ITAR, and long-term residency permits to allow foreign expertise to benefit U.S. yards can be difficult to obtain. A further complication is that U.S. Navy standards and procedures are unique, and communicating these requirements to foreign parent firms can require an additional ITAR waiver, making it more cumbersome for the U.S. shipyard to benefit from foreign expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;modularity-in-shipbuilding-via-distributed-construction&quot;&gt;Modularity in Shipbuilding via Distributed Construction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modularity is part of the advanced shipbuilding approaches employed by South Korean and Japanese shipbuilders. For commercial shipbuilding of massive cargo and tanker ships, it is analogous to taking 250–300 modules manufactured in workshops and assembling them like bricks in a drydock. For this report, “modularity” in shipbuilding refers to two separate but related methods, both of which have the potential to improve U.S. shipbuilding capacity. The first is advanced outfitting, or the construction of a ship by assembling pre-furnished modules, such as horizontally and vertically joining sections of a ship. The other method is the use of modular systems, or the integration of various components—from weapons systems to power plants—onto a hull using common standards for key interfaces, enabling different contractors to be involved in the manufacture of the ship and the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modularity is a key enabler of the distributed approaches that could bring in both international shipyards and U.S. subsidiaries of international firms. In the international context, therefore, possible complementary pathways for the United States to work with its allies include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;a business-to business distribution system in which U.S. shipyards subcontract or enter joint ventures to assemble ships from complete, pre-furnished hull modules and systems built by the United States and its allies;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;a government-furnished equipment system in which the U.S. Navy procures U.S.- and allied-built hull modules and systems directly and provides them to U.S shipyards; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;a system assembly approach in which U.S. shipyards integrate modular systems (such as weapons and propulsion systems) onto pre-built, complete ship hulls from South Korea and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each form of modular cooperation involves its own advantages and challenges. In general, the literature on the role of modularity in shipbuilding is overwhelmingly positive, with many studies highlighting how flexible and modular designs could reduce costs, enhance international cooperation, and support modernization and adaptability. Rains, for example, highlights the benefits of the potential reduction in ship size, while Malone and Rubeša, Fafandjel, and Kolić emphasize pre-outfitting in modules in workshops to minimize the work that must be done in dry docks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, three types each of modularity and flexibility are identified as having potential for the modernization and adaptability of the U.S. Navy. For modularity, these include common modules, self-contained modules, and modular installations. For flexibility, types with potential include ship infrastructure, additional space, and additional ship services. The U.S. Navy could additionally benefit from a more optimized and comprehensive approach to modularity, for example by integrating standardized components and standardized weapons systems into a collection of ready hull designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies of recent shared-build warship programs in the United States, France, and the United Kingdom identify risk reduction areas, key costs, and potential benefits of international modular shared-build programs. These studies highlight the conditions and circumstances under which multi-shipyard, modular-build strategies can be adopted. In addition, the works of Friedman, Lombardi, and Rudd, who outline recent challenges faced by the United Kingdom with joint shipbuilding, become particularly useful for understanding how the United States might leverage international partnerships to fill in its aforementioned gaps in production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One international shipbuilder thought it could potentially subcontract to U.S. shipbuilders to provide either modules produced in a U.S. subsidiary yard or generators built in other inland facilities. The business-to-business path was seen as a low-margin but nevertheless appealing opportunity to generate revenue and build trust with other shipbuilders who might be otherwise inclined to see new entrants primarily as competition. Modularity, referred to as “federated shipbuilding” or “nation as a shipyard,” has also been proposed as a solution to domestic U.S. shipbuilding constraints. If these approaches are adopted, allied firms could plug into these domestic modular approaches as suppliers, leveraging workforces and materials not just in the inland United States but across allied nations as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skeptics of modularity, however, point to inefficiencies in the field that can counterintuitively lead to higher procurement costs and delayed timelines. This is due to the high degree of skill that complete modularity requires and is evidenced by the case of the U.S. Littoral Combat Ship, where design for mission modularity is one of many contributors to the program’s high cost and other challenges. As an additional challenge, some of the efficiency of high-productivity shipyards comes from the equipment they employ to move the largest of modules, so additional capital investments may be required for some U.S. producers to take advantage of offsite module production, particularly across the long distances involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;us-purchase-of-ships-from-allied-yards&quot;&gt;U.S. Purchase of Ships from Allied Yards&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final pathway identified by this work is that of the U.S. Navy purchasing ships that are produced in allied yards. There are numerous sub-pathways for this form of cooperation, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;allied yards building licensed U.S. designs;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;allied yards building a new codeveloped design; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the United States buying allied-built and allied-designed ships.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the existing literature on such approaches is sparse due to the limited political support for this idea throughout U.S. shipbuilding history. The U.S. has a long history of protectionist policies towards its shipbuilding industry, most often characterized by the Jones Act, a law designed to ensure that cargo being shipped within the United States is aboard U.S.-built, -owned, -registered, and -crewed vessels. These same protectionist tendencies apply to naval shipbuilding, and many on the Hill and in the Navy may be reluctant to see U.S. naval ships be built abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is perhaps the most difficult and unlikely pathway explored in this paper. For instance, although reusing the existing designs for foreign ships would likely offer the most cost effective and rapid solution to at-sea capacity gaps, these ships might not meet the U.S. Navy’s specific operational requirements, including full interoperability with U.S. systems. Past experience in trying to adapt foreign designs shows that the U.S. Navy’s tendency to “gold plate” design requirements can cause scope creep, raising costs and time frames. Moreover, its standards and procedures are not shared by other navies, requiring a major rework of allied designs to be acceptable for domestic use. The Navy’s attempt to have the existing Italian design of the European multipurpose frigate (FREMM) quickly converted into the U.S. Navy’s Constellation class, for example, has resulted in a final U.S. design that reportedly bears less than a 15 percent similarity to the FREMM, down from a planned 85 percent, at great cost of time and money to the United States government. Some allied designs are similar to existing U.S. designs, such as South Korea’s KDX-III Batch I Aegis destroyers, which are said to be based on the DDG-51 Arleigh Burke–class of the U.S. Navy. Use of these mostly shared designs could potentially ease the compatibility issue. Alternatively, cooperation on building fleet auxiliaries or support ships may encounter less difficulties with requirements and political sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new codeveloped design could take advantage of partner shipbuilding expertise to incorporate manufacturability in the design phase. However, designing new ships is a notoriously hard and slow process. Modern warships are incredibly complex machines; even a single amphibious assault ship contains 4.7 million parts from over 700 companies. The lengthy process of designing and building new destroyers means this approach would have a long time horizon, making it susceptible to changing political winds. While some experts float this option, linking it to potential export sales as a way to spread out production costs across more customers, its technical and political challenges are daunting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The approach of allies building U.S. ships alleviates many of these considerations but raises new challenges of its own. Designs will need to be licensed to allied yards, which will take time to negotiate, as will securing funding for intellectual property rights. It can take two years for even a comparatively expedited technical-assistance agreement to address export controls and the release of closely held U.S. weapons-system designs. However, the United States has managed to share its advanced capabilities with Korean shipbuilders before. For instance, HD Hyundai recently delivered the Republica of Korea’s Jeongjo the Great to South Korean Navy; it is the first of the new KDX III Batch II Aegis destroyers and the fourth domestically designed and built South Korean Navy ship to incorporate the U.S. Aegis system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These alternative approaches can all be used to build warfighting capability through the delivery of additional ships. It remains unclear, however, whether and how they might address core concerns about the capability and capacity of the U.S. shipbuilding industrial base—a broader strategic issue that needs to form part of any consideration of an alternative approach. While the United States has some partnerships with other nations on specific programs, relying on allies as a complete solution to capability gaps would be unprecedented. Moreover, given South Korea’s and Japan’s location close to China, U.S. policymakers should also consider the possibility of damage to their shipyards during any active conflict. Finally, the health of the U.S. shipbuilding industry is not only a national security concern but also a political one given the well-documented impact of shipyards on their local economies and the interest of Congress in ensuring domestic capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications-for-policy&quot;&gt;Implications for Policy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is no secret that the United States has a shipbuilding problem. The U.S. policy community has long studied this issue and has produced a strong body of work exploring a wide range of possible domestic solutions. However, a continual lack of progress within the United States, the increasingly pressing threat of a naval war with China, and recent shifts in political support for more creative solutions means a window of opportunity is opening for the Navy to consider adopting novel strategies that leverage the United States’ strong and unique network of allies and partners. To date, policymakers lack a clear and comprehensive analysis of the options for industrial maritime cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security cooperation policy is difficult to get right, and industrial cooperation policy can be even harder due to its inherent complexity. For the United States to strike the right balance between leaning on its allies and partners to alleviate its shipbuilding problems and investing in its own capabilities at home, it will need to properly understand the advantages and challenges inherent to each kind of international cooperative activity in isolation and, critically, as they relate to one another. Recent history is littered with attempts at international cooperation that were partially or completely stymied by their starting conditions. For example, Constellation-class ships face three years of delays due to alterations to meet U.S. Navy requirements that lowered commonality with FREMM designs from 85 to 15 percent; both Australia and the United Kingdom have ratified technology-control treaties that go largely unused because industry is not confident in the regulatory implementation; and the F-22 fighter jet ended production rather than being exported because there were no initial investments in addressing technology-release concerns and the systems proved too expensive to retrofit. Policymakers pursuing any of the pathways would greatly benefit from understanding the prerequisites for success as early in the process as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Department of Defense will likely need to come to a decision on this key issue in the coming years, this paper aims to support policymakers as they grapple with these difficult but critical decisions. Future work will evaluate these pathways using various assessments of interest to policymakers, including time to implement, cost to government, economic viability for industry, political and regulatory viability, and creation of new U.S. shipbuilding capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The arrival of DeepSeek’s model exposes at least three fundamental developments in the U.S.-China tech race. First, it shows that it is possible to develop more efficient AI models with less advanced chips and with models training at a fraction of the cost. Second, it highlights that China’s tech ecosystem is capable of innovating and working around constraints from U.S. export controls on chip manufacturing equipment in the race for AI dominance. Third, it indicates that China has developed an open model that is catching up with the well-known OpenAI proprietary products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the pressure for both American and Chinese tech companies to deliver the latest AI breakthrough increases, they are asked to do so in an increasingly fractured global economy—fraught with a tech trade war, volatile protectionist policies, and ever-shifting supply chains. Just twelve days after DeepSeek’s launch, U.S. President Donald Trump introduced a fresh set of 10 percent tariffs on Chinese goods that were swiftly followed by China imposing 10 to 15 percent tariffs on American coal, liquified natural gas (LNG), crude oil, and agricultural machinery, as well as the launching of an antitrust probe against Google. The tech trade fight continues to quickly escalate, with the United States raising levies on Chinese imports to 145 percent and China retaliating by raising tariffs on U.S. goods to 125 percent in early April 2025. In sharp contrast with 2018, when Chinese tech giants ZTE and Huawei were the first companies brutally hit by U.S. trade bans, 2025 shows a more resilient and agile Beijing that has updated its laws and learned its lessons from the early tech trade war to now be able to respond in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the tech trade war and the case of DeepSeek has renewed national security concerns in the White House and Congress regarding economic and technological dependency with China. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt notes that DeepSeek “is a wake-up call to the American AI industry… The last administration sat on their hands and allowed China to rapidly develop this AI program,” and that the U.S. National Security Council was “looking into” the national security implications of DeepSeek’s model to the United States. The White House announcement came right after R1’s launch and was followed by Australia, South Korea, Italy, and the State of New York deciding to ban the app from locally hosted app stores due to privacy and “unacceptable” national security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As U.S. and Chinese industries grapple with measures to deter each other’s AI development, it is tempting to focus on government action and narratives in the tit-for-tat tech trade war. Ultimately, any response will rely on the capacity of these governments to effectively leverage and create the conditions for competition among private companies, which begs the following questions: How have companies in China and the United States responded to the “DeepSeek moment?” Are companies in China ready for the pressure of a post-DeepSeek push? What is Silicon Valley’s response—and is it at all coordinated? What are the implications of the tech trade war for other countries in the Indo-Pacific?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-pressure-of-renewed-optimism-in-china&quot;&gt;THE PRESSURE OF RENEWED OPTIMISM IN CHINA&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek has injected a renewed momentum and morale in Chinese industry amid the AI race. It has not only promoted a sense that China is no longer constantly lagging behind the United States, but also that DeepSeek’s cost-effectiveness could outmaneuver U.S. competitors. Since DeepSeek’s R1 launch, Beijing has pushed for a nationwide dissemination of the model’s use, which has led to at least 13 city governments, 10 state-owned energy companies, and three state-owned telecommunications operators deploying the AI model into their systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies in China now face renewed pressure to accelerate adoption of models such as DeepSeek’s while trying to develop equal or superior models and products. DeepSeek itself is in the frontline of innovation pressures. Less than a month after announcing its R1 model, the Chinese company had already indicated its ambition to release a new R2 model planned for May 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite DeepSeek’s domestic and international impact, China’s competitiveness will rely on how avidly the Chinese government decides to push other parts of the AI supply chain to deliver more rapidly. This includes meeting its ambition to become less reliant on Nvidia chips following U.S. export controls measures limiting access to high-end chips since 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The positive momentum in Beijing has also provided the stage for Huawei to more boldly promote their own Ascend chips and increase the yield—the percentage of functioning chips in the line of production to make them profitable. After the U.S. Department of Commerce blocked Huawei from accessing manufacturing that used U.S. technology in 2020, chipmaker TSMC had to stop producing Huawei’s Ascend chips, which led Huawei to partner with also-sanctioned Chinese Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) in order to relaunch Ascend. In February 2025, the chip achieved a yield of 40 percent, bringing it closer to the 60 percent yield of Nvidia. While Huawei’s progress is unlikely to change Nvidia’s prominence in the short and medium term, Huawei’s chips can boost competition in specific subfields of the market, especially inference chips that are usually used for lightweight AI applications in smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The accelerated pace from Beijing to narrow the U.S.-China gap on AI modelling also means that companies in China will compete among themselves for the spotlight with the government. Chinese companies benefit from government backing if they demonstrate they can overcome Washington’s export controls and help China enhance self-sufficiency in AI supply chains. Days before the R1 model was announced, Chinese premier Li Qiang invited DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng to represent the AI sector in a closed-door meeting with other businessmen. A year earlier, Baidu’s CEO Robin Li attended a similar meeting when Baidu was still considered a top Chinese contender to rival OpenAI’s ChatGPT model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, the post-DeepSeek moment has left the Chinese tech sector with renewed confidence that should be handled with caution. As they compete for their own DeepSeek-like moment in the sun, Chinese firms risk overselling potential and under delivering. That is the case of Chinese startup Butterfly Effect’s release of Manus AI in March 2025. Unlike ChatGPT, Manus AI has been described by its co-founder Yichao Ji as “the world’s first general AI agent,” meaning it could independently perform tasks without human prompts for every step. While some media outlets, such as Forbes, portrayed Manus AI as a breakthrough similar to DeepSeek, it has so far received mixed reviews. The Economist and Tech Crunch have criticized it for not delivering on its promise: “in releasing it, its makers have obviously prized a job done first over a job done well.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, DeepSeek’s open weights model has also provided a first-step opportunity for public and private services in China to use it as a baseline. While AI and tech companies will continue to develop their own models and become more competitive, many have nonetheless rushed to integrate DeepSeek as part of their existing products. This includes big tech companies such as Alibaba, Tencent, and Huawei, as well as electric vehicles companies such as BYD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Export controls have only delayed, not stopped, Chinese AI supply chain innovation, meaning that Washington will need to reassess its strategy. There are now three important trends for the United States to watch: First, with slightly optimistic Hong Kong market performance in the tech sector, foreign investors might look more favorably at the Chinese market. Analysts at Morgan Stanley note that DeepSeek’s rise has led investors to start further scrutinizing companies’ AI investments with the hopes that it will lead to more efficient and accountable spending from AI companies. Second, as argued by Tobias Feakin, former Australian cyber and tech ambassador, the emergence of cheaper high-performance models could redefine cost structures and lower subscription prices, making them more competitive in developing country markets. Moreover, Feakin argues that DeepSeek has shown that competitiveness does not rely solely on access to the high-end chips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;twisted-incentives-in-silicon-valley&quot;&gt;TWISTED INCENTIVES IN SILICON VALLEY&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek’s shock came only a few days after OpenAI, Oracle, and Japanese investor SoftBank Group lined up behind President Trump at the White House as he announced Stargate, a massive $100 billion joint private venture to develop data centers in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though such efforts indicate that companies are coming together to pursue a U.S. strategic advantage in the AI race, make no mistake: these companies are still market players who will seek to maximize their own gains—and that became clear in the different ways in which they reacted to the DeepSeek moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, stated on X that it was “legit invigorating to have a new competitor.” 24 hours later, the company stated that they were concerned that their proprietary model had been used to train DeepSeek’s model, thus raising fears of breaches of OpenAI intellectual property and terms of use. OpenAI’s terms of use note that users are prohibited from “using the Output to develop models that compete with OpenAI”—this section provides the initial basis for determining whether DeepSeek’s use of OpenAI’s service was inappropriate. However, in 2023, Twitter owner Elon Musk cut off both Microsoft and OpenAI for “illegally” using Twitter data and API to train its own AI technologies. The difference with DeepSeek is that, for OpenAI, it rapidly went from a “legit competitor” to being accused of intellectual property theft via distillation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other U.S. tech giants shrugged off DeepSeek’s achievements and impact, seeing them as a temporary blip. Two days after DeepSeek’s release, Zuckerberg dismissed the low-cost training efficiency narrative and announced that Meta would spend $60 billion on capital expenditure. Nvidia joined the “shrugging off” momentum by welcoming DeepSeek’s open model innovation only a few weeks after its market valuation plunge. Moreover, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang noted that R1 was an “excellent innovation” during an earnings call while also noting that this is a business opportunity for fewer chips to be used more efficiently. Anthropic’s CEO, Dario Amodei, also notes that even if the cost of training a specific model declines, the overall investments would be “eaten up” immediately to train other more sophisticated and efficient models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reactions from tech companies also make it clear that the benefits of the U.S.-China AI competition are not evenly distributed across Silicon Valley. Some tech companies benefit from stronger restrictions on Chinese tech while others benefit from the shock of Chinese innovation. As CEO of Tesla, Musk is potentially caught in the crossfire: tariffs and export controls on Chinese-made electric vehicles (EV) hurt Tesla’s Shanghai-based EV factory production—a key source for European supply of EVs. At the same time, U.S.-China competition creates opportunities for securing competitiveness in global markets for the Starlink satellite communications service—also owned by Musk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies such as Microsoft and Amazon Web Services have taken a more acquiescent approach and integrated DeepSeek’s R1 model into their cloud and AI platforms. These platforms provide developers with access to a library of AI models and environments to test them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple experienced the other side of the DeepSeek’s shock as it saw its shares rise right after the R1 release. Small and efficient models such as DeepSeek’s provide a glimpse at what could make Apple more competitive. By engaging not in a crowded market of Big Tech investments in capital expenditure, but as a distribution platform for smaller AI models in smartphones, Apple could become less vulnerable to any potential AI bubble burst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with any shock, DeepSeek’s market disruption is temporary but sends purposeful waves, and there are two clear messages resulting from DeepSeek’s conundrum. The first message is that models can be potentially developed at a lower cost. The second message is that if it can be done more cheaply, it raises concerns that investors—who have so far been generous—might wonder whether it is a question of when, not if the AI bubble might burst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The low-cost efficiency presented by DeepSeek has renewed concerns about the sustainability of continuous injections of capital into AI supply chains and infrastructure. Meta and Nvidia’s persistent investment show that there is no immediate change to the investment mantra. This continuous cash flow is important in maintaining the market perceptions about the value of these companies, but it is not necessarily driving actual results. As hedge fund investor Ray Dalio noted: “there’s a major new technology [AI] that certainly will change the world and be successful. But some people are confusing that with the investments being successful.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite Trump’s apparent support, his fluctuating trade policies have also significantly impacted the AI supply chain market, with some tech companies delaying going public due to expectations of tariffs and export controls. Since the first Trump term, export controls and tariffs—also tightened during the Biden administration—have forced companies to swiftly reshuffle supply chains while maintaining competitive prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many unicorns, such as OpenAI, have oddly been able to delay going public and continue receiving rounds of bigger investments—growing their speculative private valuation. This has also excused them from certain levels of accountability that come with the pressures and volatility of publicly trading in the open market. The trend of delayed initial public offerings (IPOs) has also meant that there might be a discrepancy between firms’ real value and the value set by the private market—which only feeds the speculative AI bubble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;implications-in-the-indo-pacific&quot;&gt;IMPLICATIONS IN THE INDO-PACIFIC&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the U.S. and Chinese markets have developed their own government-backed investment strategies. That is the case of China’s Digital Silk Road or groupings such as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) informally leveraging such fora to discuss AI. However, across the Indo-Pacific—as in other parts of the Global South—countries have continuously used hedging strategies to manage risks and avoid exclusive entanglements with the U.S. or China by being more opportunistic about Washington and Beijing’s offers. Strategic ambiguity and pragmatism is something that has also benefited tech development in the region. For example, Singapore and Malaysia have partnered with both OpenAI and Alibaba to boost domestic AI companies and local capacities, as well as with Nvidia to develop AI infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI models such as DeepSeek R1 can further stimulate AI innovation across the Indo-Pacific in at least two ways. First, the cost-effectiveness of DeepSeek’s R1 model training provides a benchmark against which companies in the region can further optimize and test at smaller scales through partnerships with U.S. and Chinese companies. Second, rather than being seen as national security threats, open weights models such as DeepSeek’s R1 can further stimulate innovation around other open models or innovative applications. Local and regional Large Language Models (LLMs) in Southeast Asian countries have been built on top of Big Tech LLM architectures. From 2020 to 2024, cross-regional and country-based initiatives in Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand have released 35 LLMs, with 21 in 2024 alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly, rather than solely taking foreign technologies from China and the United States, countries in the region have sought to develop their own models as well. AI companies in the region have been harnessing the potential to develop models more sensitive to other languages and dialects. That is the case of homegrown indigenous LLMs such as AI Singapore’s SEA-LION, VinAI’s PhoGPT, Mesolitica’s MaLLaM, and India’s Sarvan AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;calibrating-responses&quot;&gt;CALIBRATING RESPONSES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of 2025, all eyes were focused on understanding what the new Trump administration’s posture would be on the U.S.-China trade tech war. Trump started his second term by easing Biden-era regulations on the domestic AI industry before tightening on China. Then, starting on February 27, 2025, Trump announced an extra set of tariffs on Chinese goods, accounting for a total of 20 percent tariffs in less than two months since his start—all of which escalated following his reciprocal tariffs announcement on “Liberation Day” on April 2, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite DeepSeek-triggered turbulence, this context might be good news for tech companies working on AI. Growing competition will push innovation on both sides, with China more actively seeking to mainstream and test services such as DeepSeek and the United States promoting their own companies in conjunction with what could be further tariffs (and potentially export controls) at the heart of Trump’s strategy to economically and technologically deter China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is clear that China has been making the most out of its DeepSeek moment by emboldening private companies across the AI supply chain, encouraging local deployment of the model, and savoring advances in the semiconductor supply chain. The clock is ticking on how long the economic coercion tools in the U.S. toolbox can endure, or whether we are slowly reaching a tipping point where intended economic disruption has boosted innovation in China—making them rapidly more competitive than before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a regional perspective, the Indo-Pacific remains a dynamic arena where countries seek to balance opportunities and risks amid the U.S.-China tech rivalry. With DeepSeek’s model setting new benchmarks, Indo-Pacific nations will need to carefully assess their engagement with both U.S. and Chinese AI ecosystems. Whether through regulatory frameworks, investment incentives, or fostering homegrown AI innovation, regional players will be crucial in shaping the trajectory of AI development beyond the immediate contest between Washington and Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump’s second term also inaugurates another phase in the long-term power struggle between the United States and China, with economic deterrence at its forefront. However, both sides face risks that can critically affect the AI race: American protectionism stifling Silicon Valley growth and provoking and exodus of investors; economic coercion measures backfiring if they remain the primary tool for delaying Chinese innovation; China’s overconfidence in the AI race amid the DeepSeek moment leading them to favor rapid delivery over quality; and a lack of agility in adjusting and responding to growing tariffs and export controls inhibiting Chinese progress in the AI race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US Army announced a series of organisational and capability decisions on 2 May, with Chief of Staff General Randy George promising more to follow. It may be tempting to interpret these decisions as signalling what the US Army thinks about the future of war. In reality, they speak to a series of institutional reforms that the US Army believes are pre-requisites to being ready for war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;merging-command-headquarters&quot;&gt;Merging Command Headquarters&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The announced decisions fall into two categories. First are the merger of several US Army headquarters. US Army Training and Doctrine Command and US Army Futures Command will now revert to being a single headquarters. Meanwhile US Army Forces Command – responsible for the readiness of US Army units in the Continental United States, US Army Northern Command and US Army Southern Command, are to be merged into a Western Hemisphere Command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was some logic behind the separation of these functions. Designing how the force will fight in the future is different to assuring that it is properly trained today. Managing operations in South America is not the same operational problem as preparing to screen the Arctic approaches or managing units on training rotations throughout CONUS. However, with a directive to cut the size of the force, the US Army was determined to reduce the number of headquarters rather than combat units. While the mergers will create headquarters with large spans of command, they remain coherent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second category of announcements relate to the retirement of older UAV platforms, and halting procurement of Joint Light Tactical Vehicles (JLTV), Humvees, M10-Booker Light Tanks, and AH64D Apache attack helicopters. The thing to emphasise is that these are not cuts. On JLTV and Humvees, the US Army has thousands of these vehicles in the force. The decision to stop procuring more was a determination that there are enough vehicles available for the Army’s needs. When it came to the M10 Booker, it fell victim to having a significant logistical requirement while the Army already fields a large fleet of Abrams main battle tanks and wants to invest in improving the survivability of armour through systems deployed with them, rather than duplicating the sustainment burden through another armoured vehicle type. The judgement had little to do with the Booker’s merits as a platform and much more to do with the readiness of deployable units of action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-unified-apache-fleet&quot;&gt;A Unified Apache Fleet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision to retire AH64D will see the Army continue to operate AH64E Apache. Put simply, the Army is trying to move to a unified Apache fleet to make maintenance more efficient and cheaper, and to ensure that its attack aviation can integrate with other elements of the force. The US Army still believes attack aviation is part of its combined arms toolkit, albeit in a more limited role than during the high point of AirLand Battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Retiring some older UAV platforms speaks to the more fundamental changes that General George wants to see through his programme to Transform in Contact. He wants to move away from long acquisition timelines and protracted programmes of record with a high price per platform. Instead, learning from the rate of adaptation necessary to remain competitive in Ukraine, he wants to see the Army buy many different classes of UAV, empower units to upgrade and adapt them, and purchase new systems quickly. Critically the career path for UAV operators will move away from grading them as dedicated operators of defined platforms – Shadow or Grey Eagle – towards classing them as expert UAV operators competent on using different platforms and adapting them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the thrust of General George and his team’s thinking before the Trump Administration took office. Indeed, initial steps in this direction were underway in 2023. However, acquisition for the US Army is managed by the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology, who reports to the political leadership and not to the Army Chief of Staff. Before freeing up budget, therefore, the US Army wanted assurance that it could reallocate funds to key new priorities, but also spend money more flexibly to change the way it procures. It seems that progress is being made in this direction with the new Administration, though critics in industry would argue that little has actually changed as regards the bureaucratic processes they must follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That the US Army wants to make procurement more agile does not mean that it lacks the need for major programmes of record. Magazine depth of long-range strike munitions, next generation command and control, integrated air and missile defence including counter-UAV systems, and electronic warfare are all major priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;points-of-interest-for-uk-defence&quot;&gt;Points of Interest for UK Defence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those watching these decisions – and those that will follow – the question is not whether to replicate US Army decisions. The British Army, for example, has one Apache fleet at the AH64E standard. It lacks key equipment types rather than having a surplus of platforms in service. The decisions are therefore different. But the changes made to how the US Army is procuring, and the authorities it is seeking to accelerate procurement and make it more flexible, certainly chime with critiques of the UK procurement system as used in peacetime, compared with the demonstrated requirements in war. Chief of the General Staff General Roly Walker’s emphasis on increasing the lethality of British Army units is intended in part as a benchmark against which to change how the army acquires and introduces equipment. The question is whether the UK’s National Armaments Director and wider Defence Reform will deliver the institutional changes to make procurement match modern industrial and military needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge for both the US and British Army’s in this process is how little of the problem they control. General George may be able to free up some budget by cutting programmes, to move laterally. General Walker can use innovation funds to try and rapidly bring novel equipment into discrete units. But the dysfunction of military procurement in the US and UK reflects departmental policy, legal requirements, and political interference in what militaries keep and buy that are beyond the control of service chiefs. Army leadership are signalling that they are prepared for change. It remains to be seen whether the political leadership in either country are invested in the reforms necessary to make those changes ultimately successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scenario-1&quot;&gt;Scenario 1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;china-stalls&quot;&gt;China Stalls&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China faces serious headwinds, and it is possible that its economic challenges have begun to sap the energy behind its global rise. One headwind is not China’s fault: By their very nature, developing economies tend to grasp the low-hanging fruit early in their growth. As their economies grow larger and more complex, and as businesses begin to maximize efficiencies and streamline processes, economic growth inevitably slows. It is easy to grow swiftly from a low base, and it is nearly impossible to do so from a high one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is a high likelihood that China’s growth trajectory will flatten going forward. In addition to the factors noted in this scenario, China’s political system may be ill-equipped to respond to mounting headwinds. China’s political system is conservative by nature, making it less suited to deliver sharp course corrections.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;director-john-l-thornton-china-center-at-brookings&quot;&gt;Director, John L. Thornton China Center at Brookings&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another headwind for China is its demographic outlook. China’s adoption of the one-child policy in 1979 created a demographic dividend. In 1975, the United Nations estimated that for every 10 Chinese of working age, there were 8 who were too old or too young to work; by 2010, the number who were not expected to work was half that. Now, with Chinese fertility stubbornly low and the population aging, the trends are reversing. According to current estimates, by 2075, every 10 Chinese workers will be supporting 10 dependents, and by 2093, that number will rise to 13.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, China’s population peaked in 2021 at 1.4 billion people. It is set to sink to under a billion in 2070 and continue drifting down to 639 million by 2100. While these are still very large numbers by any measure, shrinking populations depress markets for everything from real estate to manufactured goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Will China prioritize tech dominance or rebalance toward household consumption and welfare? The former likely means expanded commercial and political tensions with much of the world; the latter would turn China into a net importer and lead to improved ties with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other headwinds are many: a burst real estate bubble, sagging productivity growth, growing tensions with the United States that restrict technology inputs, and a leadership that seems less willing than its predecessors to let entrepreneurs roam free. Government statistics are enjoying less trust amid suspicions that conditions are worse than the government is willing to admit. Businesspeople are concerned that the Chinese banking system is not only full of nonperforming loans but has also lost much of its dynamism. Local governments in China have been especially affected by deteriorating economic conditions, and they are cutting spending on infrastructure projects and other important initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Beyond tech and trade, U.S.-China security tensions are likely to intensify, particularly regarding Taiwan. It is possible that even as China’s economy stalls, Beijing may need to increase security spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While China has steadily expanded for four decades, it is worth considering what a steadily contracting China might look like in the future. In part, it would enjoy less soft power. China has earned widespread admiration for producing sharp economic growth uninterrupted by social upheaval. Economic stagnation maintained through authoritarian control is a less remarkable feat, and while it is not currently the Chinese calling card, it could be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When China experiences challenges, however, policy inflexibility becomes a liability. China’s leaders may also underappreciate the scale of the challenges on their horizon because they judge that the United States’ problems are larger than their own.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-ryan-hass-1&quot;&gt;— Ryan Hass&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If some in the United States have their way, the movement of manufacturing out of China and into countries that are closer to the United States—whether ideologically or geographically—would drop Chinese growth further. Whether one calls it “de-risking” or “decoupling,” a reduced U.S. export market for China, combined with restrictions on technology that China can import from the United States and its partners, would change conditions in China significantly. Arguably, that would advance U.S. interests at China’s expense, although how the United States would pursue it and how China would respond are open questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whichever way the United States pursues de-risking, it would likely put a further damper on foreign direct investment in China because it would create uncertainty about the prospects of exporting to the United States, the world’s largest market. While that alone would not force a contraction in the Chinese economy, it would contribute to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A contracting China would also spread less cash around the world. By 2017, China had become the world’s largest official creditor, with its loans exceeding the combined value of those of the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, and all 22 wealthy governments that constitute the Paris Club. The Belt and Road Initiative seized imaginations because of expectations about its scope and scale. Not only has the initiation of program projects slowed, but overall Chinese lending to developing countries has slowed as well. According to data from Boston University, China financed $87.0 billion of overseas development projects in 2016; by 2021, the total had dropped to $3.7 billion. The university also notes that over the last decade, Chinese lending to Africa has increasingly come from Chinese commercial banks rather than policy banks. The resultant loans are concentrated less on infrastructure and more in revenue-producing industries such as mining and financial services. They also have less favorable terms of repayment and can complicate sovereign debt burdens. In the last five years, Sri Lanka and Zambia have defaulted on past loans from China, and countries such as Pakistan have enacted draconian budget cuts to meet their Chinese debt burdens. Increasingly, China is appearing in the role of extractor rather than developer of resources in target countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China asserts that it spends $230 billion per year on defense; some in the U.S. government assert that the true number is $700 billion. While Westerners can debate the size of the Chinese military buildup, there is little question that the Chinese military footprint is currently expanding in Asia and around the world. China has the world’s largest navy, with more than 370 ships and submarines, and it is fielding a nuclear-capable refueled bomber. The Chinese navy paid 27 naval port calls in 2023, demonstrating its capacity to operate far from Chinese shores. In addition, China sent more than 2,000 troops abroad on peacekeeping missions, building goodwill and exhibiting a capability to deploy and operate far from Chinese shores. China is also rapidly expanding its military technology base, with advancements ranging from aircraft carriers to advanced fighter jets and autonomous systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A slowing China could still become more formidable militarily and technologically. China’s advantages in manufacturing are unlikely to disappear, and the military investments it has already made will continue to provide advantage in the future. The Soviet Union stagnated for decades before collapse, but it was perhaps increasingly formidable even amid that stagnation. The same may be true of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An economic slowdown would constrain China’s military growth. Facing a traditional choice between guns and butter, China’s leaders would have to be even more selective about what military capabilities they are willing invest in, what contingencies they will prepare for, and what locations they will protect. A tightening fiscal environment will narrow the choices China’s leaders have to exercise national power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;China may need to spend more on security to address external threats and internal unrest. It is possible that China may not be (more) selective about the military capabilities it invests in.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-bonny-lin-1&quot;&gt;— Bonny Lin&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Regardless, China’s diplomatic activism is likely to continue to gradually expand to other regions, while its military focus is likely to remain on its periphery, with primary attention on contingencies such as in the Taiwan Straits.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-scott-kennedy-1&quot;&gt;— Scott Kennedy&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its challenges, China is currently more economically, diplomatically, and even militarily dominant than Russia. Yet, over time, it may begin to fall behind India, which has already surpassed China in population and is exhibiting stronger economic growth (albeit from a lower base). India has attracted significant investment from the Arabian Peninsula, which has historic ties to the subcontinent. A growing India could hem in China’s rise in Asia, and it could squeeze out Chinese relationships in parts of the Middle East. Since the United States views India as a more benign power, the United States may abet India’s rise in a way that constrains China and gives the United States a relative advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The effectiveness of using a rising India to balance China depends on India’s internal constraints. It would turn heavily on whether India could finally overcome seemingly enduring internal political and ideological constraints and translate its economic and military potential into reality. Given China’s substantial head start, China will still be formidable in absolute and relative terms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-scott-kennedy-2&quot;&gt;— Scott Kennedy&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scenario-2&quot;&gt;Scenario 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;us-global-leadership-falters&quot;&gt;U.S. Global Leadership Falters&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has seen itself in a global leadership role for so long, it is hard for many to imagine how a retreat from that role would manifest itself. The United States leapt onto the global stage as the Cold War unfolded, abandoning decades of inward focus. It found both security and purpose restoring war-ravaged countries in Europe and Asia, as well as building the emerging postcolonial countries in Africa and the Middle East. For decades, the United States invested its overwhelming economic and military dominance into shaping a global system that others would feel a stake in sustaining. What many Americans have come to call the “rules-based order” certainly privileged the economic, legal, and governance patterns of the United States and its allies, but it was also constraining. It led to limits on U.S. action and lent a certain predictability to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are seeing a momentous change in world politics. What some termed the “liberal international order” was actually an “American-led international order,” which is not quite the same thing. The United States set certain rules of the game, promoted certain values, and maintained order not universally, but in selected areas.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-eliot-a-cohen&quot;&gt;— Eliot A. Cohen&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;arleigh-a-burke-chair-in-strategy-at-csis&quot;&gt;Arleigh A. Burke Chair in Strategy at CSIS&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for many Americans, and for the Trump administration, the United States has invested too much and reaped too little from subordinating U.S. interests to a so-called “rules-based order” that seemingly lets others take advantage of the United States. For them, the U.S. commitment to international affairs is an elite luxury, not a bedrock concern, and they perceive recent U.S. international efforts as expensive failures—not least multitrillion-dollar efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan in the wake of 9/11 whose results fell far short of expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid this international context, the U.S. government’s budget is under strain, and that strain will increase in the coming years. With $7.3 trillion in planned outlays in 2025 and only $5.5 trillion in receipts, the U.S. federal budget is far out of balance. A growing cohort of retirees entitled to government support, combined with promises to cut taxes further, will put increased pressure on government spending. The calls to focus on curtailing foreign engagement are likely to survive long beyond when the Trump administration’s term ends in January 2029.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The scenario assumes the United States can retain hegemony without global leadership, which seems unlikely. The United States can’t get to the tech restrictions or military scale necessary to manage China without allied assistance, the dollar will be a less recourse to safety, and without global leadership, the United States won’t be setting the rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effects of a U.S. pullback in international affairs would not be evenly distributed. Given a deep and bipartisan consensus that China represents the largest challenge to U.S. global interests, the United States will almost certainly maintain a strong if not growing military commitment to the western Pacific. India’s growing economy, combined with its increasingly agile diplomacy and its sometimes-strained ties to China, will draw increased U.S. attention in the coming years, too, as will rising economies in Southeast Asia. For countries in the Pacific, it may feel in many ways like the United States has not pulled back at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The credibility of that military commitment will be called into question by U.S. allies and partners across Asia. Deterrence is a combination of capability and will. The demonstrated U.S. willingness to transform (in a rather negative way) its relationships in Europe and pull back from being the guarantor of European security is already fomenting distrust and skepticism elsewhere—including in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for much of the rest of the world, the United States would likely be felt less. The voices of Americans who have argued for more than a decade that the United States has been overcommitted to the Middle East would rise, and the time and attention the United States pays to Africa and Latin America would fall. Not only would Europe be expected to fend more for itself, but the intra-European rivalries and tensions that had been blunted under three-quarters of a century of U.S. primacy would flourish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A U.S. withdrawal from its role protecting norms is likely to open up the way for greater international violence. Large states will attempt to assert spheres of influence and smaller ones will defend themselves in a variety of ways, including by the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-eliot-a-cohen-1&quot;&gt;— Eliot A. Cohen&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Europe is clearly going to have to do more for its own security. What we don’t know is whether this will lead to greater unity on the continent given that Europe now has to worry about three adversaries (China, Russia, and the United States) rather than just the first two or whether the absence of U.S. hegemony will lead to the greater intra-European rivalries and tensions that are cited here.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;professor-of-international-relations-at-american-university&quot;&gt;Professor of International Relations at American University&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia and China would seek to expand their ties further into regions that feel newly neglected. Even more importantly, a growing number of governments would seek to expand their own ties with Russia and China, partly to hedge against U.S. abandonment, but also to gain leverage against a newly hegemonic United States that feels less bound by international rules. Regional hegemons would almost certainly seek to fill the vacuum the United States has left in its wake, requiring regional states to make new accommodations to their interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The main “glue” of the Sino-Russian relationship is shared hostility to a U.S.-led order. How does the underlying strategic logic of their relationship evolve in a world where the United States is playing a much less active role in key arenas? China will still have good reason to contest the United States, assuming the United States’ presence in Asia remains consistent. However, there may be good reasons to expect Moscow and Beijing to feel less compelled to align and coordinate if the United States isn’t pushing as hard into domains of shared interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A United States that gives up global leadership will not necessarily sustain military forces in East Asia. A likelier move will be to reduce forces, shifting defense burdens onto regional allies and making U.S. security commitments more brittle or, at the extreme, a bargain with China that limits or withdraws U.S. forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-kori-schake-1&quot;&gt;— Kori Schake&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. commitment to international organizations could also shrink, which would be felt both in terms of diplomatic attention as well as budget support. The United States is the largest contributor to the UN system, paying just under a quarter of the organization’s expenditures. The United States spent more than $15 billion on humanitarian assistance in 2023 (including more than $10 billion in voluntary contributions to UN agencies such as the World Food Programme, UNICEF, and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees) and about $10 billion more on global health. The U.S. role supporting the orchestration of such assistance could also diminish, reducing the efficiency and effectiveness of aid missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Will NATO continue as an institution if the United States disengages or withdraws from it? Will the lack of U.S. involvement with NATO destroy the institution? If NATO survives without U.S. leadership, what will its relationship with the European Union be? The expectation that a U.S. withdrawal from Europe will lead to a flourishing of intra-European rivalries and tensions is warranted, but given the threats Europe faces, it might instead lead to greater unity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-james-goldgeier-1&quot;&gt;— James Goldgeier&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A commitment of military resources absent economic and diplomatic cooperation will appear halfhearted. This is due to the onslaught of tariffs and the degradation of Department of State resources. These sentiments will be felt even in Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-mara-karlin-1&quot;&gt;— Mara Karlin&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The broader economic effects of a more unilateral U.S. approach to international affairs are unclear. We should expect some slowdown in U.S. efforts to integrate global financial networks, and an increase in transparency is expected, combined with an increased effort by others to create parallel institutions. Trade would likely grow more regionalized as the security of sea lanes diminishes and the robustness of global free trade efforts languishes (or potentially withers under U.S. assault). The United States would also emerge as a more aggressive trading partner, using the size of its domestic market to win concessions for U.S. exporters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While none of this necessarily would lead to warfare, there would be a period of adjustment and volatility as the world settles into a new equilibrium. Throughout, and perhaps even afterwards, governments would need to put a premium on hedging and agility, and businesses would be evaluating their prospects in a higher-risk environment. Of course, returns would be higher for some, but probably not for all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We must expect a level of instability in international politics that we have not known since the 1930s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scenario-3&quot;&gt;Scenario 3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;trust-fails&quot;&gt;Trust Fails&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of technology’s relatively unappreciated qualities is that it has helped boost global trust. The internet has become an ecosystem whereby anyone can purchase goods from any seller anywhere in the world. Both the buyer and seller have relatively high confidence that the promised goods will be delivered and the seller will be paid, even if this is a one-time transaction where the parties have no connection to each other. Government identification documents have increasingly moved beyond photographs to include definitive biometric data. The global banking system mostly has abandoned paper documents that can be forged—or lost—and sends money around the world in a fraction of a second. Databases contain vast amounts of information that can verify almost any data point and make information available to any mobile phone user anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology’s ability to ensure that strangers can trust each other has accelerated and deepened economic activities, even in remote places. If one side or another fails to meet obligations, that will be recorded in some way in the vast depository of shared information: Credit reports will be hurt, online reputations will be tarnished, and platform access will be revoked. In that environment, individuals and firms need not limit their engagements to a small number of well-known entities, promoting efficiency, innovation, and agility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Encryption is the bedrock on which digital commerce is built. We trust it to protect sensitive information and validate digital identities. But quantum computing could render most existing encryption technology obsolete. Trust doesn’t just depend on how we use existing technology, but also on how new technologies impact existing digital foundations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, just as technology has boosted trust, there are increasing signs that technology can be used to diminish trust. One part of this dynamic involves disinformation and misinformation. Deepfakes—which use advanced technology to create visual and audio records of people saying and doing things they have not done—are just the beginning. Computing power can be used to create false records that either build or tarnish a reputation and can create entities and events that exist only in the imagination. Once corruption infects an information system, it compromises the presumed integrity of everything in that system. For example, if a hostile actor can change even a limited amount of information in a government employment database, every data point for every employee potentially becomes suspect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;U.S. adversaries already use technology to facilitate information operations aimed at undermining trust. This includes cyber-enabled info ops. Damaging reputation, usually a collateral impact of a cyber incident, can instead be the objective. Likewise, disinformation can magnify the consequences of a cyberattack—or any other attack or disaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have lived in a world where creating high-quality evidence of an event has been significantly easier than creating high-quality forgeries. The balance of cost and complexity has favored easy authentication. That was not true 150 years ago, and it may be less true going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There will be an arms race on creating and detecting fakes. It will take time for detection technologies to diffuse. Generating tech may spread faster than detection tools, creating windows where no credible verification tech exists.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;research-fellow-at-rand-corporation&quot;&gt;Research Fellow at RAND Corporation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disinformation can also reduce the perceived credibility of news sources, spreading knowledge of false stories and undermining the credibility of true ones. Citizens’ trust in institutions, in governments, and in those around them would diminish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Without journalists to do rigorous reporting, we risk losing reliable accounts of world events. We may be left with only anecdotes and conjecture as a source of information, degrading the quality of information everywhere and further undermining trust. A healthy information ecosystem is essential for trust, and depends on trust to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-will-carter-1&quot;&gt;— Will Carter&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Lack of trust complicates response activities and contributes to social unrest. It can ultimately erode the thin veneer of civilization.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-suzzanne-spaulding&quot;&gt;— Suzzanne Spaulding&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second way technology can diminish trust is through spreading disinformation through social media. Because social media’s algorithms are optimized for engagement, it tends to support material that evokes an emotional reaction. Under these circumstances, misinformation that elicits outrage becomes widespread, and information that corrects the misinformation is downplayed. In addition, malign actors’ own algorithms can create vast amounts of disinformation with relative autonomy, allowing those actors to experiment with a wide variety of products to see what works. While most social media platforms have a vetting process meant to curb the most serious excesses, critics have argued that they are insufficient. When it works at its best, social media connects people with shared interests and identities. But social media sometimes does so at the expense of larger, more heterogenous communities and can promote internal division. In addition, social media also allows for cyberbullying and anonymous attacks, diminishing social trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;AI companies, or at least actors with AI expertise, will build tools to detect AI-modified content. Trust may erode more quickly or unevenly if it relies on tech companies, especially internationally, where other countries may be quite suspicious of U.S. companies adjudicating what’s fake and what’s not.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-christopher-byrd-1&quot;&gt;— Christopher Byrd&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consequences of a collapse in trust over the next decade would be broad. Economically, it would reverse a trend toward global trade dynamism. It would likely result in increased tariffs, require increased inspections of shipments, and make arms-length trade connections more difficult. Digital platforms would be encumbered, and financial platforms would become less efficient. Reduced trust in supply chains, exacerbated by disinformation or fears of cyber sabotage, could disrupt global trade. The increased costs of identity verification within societies would also spread widely, and it would increase friction in commerce and slow growth. Small- and medium-sized enterprises, which lack the resources of larger corporations to manage these risks, would be particularly vulnerable, widening economic inequality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;AI digital forgeries may affect different countries differently. Highly developed economies will have better access to state-of-the-art verification technologies, and undeveloped economies may not be contract-intensive enough for forgeries of records to matter as much. We may have economies in the middle tier where records matter but forgeries are hard to detect.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-christopher-byrd-2&quot;&gt;— Christopher Byrd&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We’re entering a new era, when an auditable chain of custody of photo, video, and audio recordings matters far more than their mere existence. For now, technical means can still usually detect the presence of AI interventions, but this gets more difficult with each passing day. The human eye and ear are no longer enough.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-greg-allen-1&quot;&gt;— Greg Allen&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Politically, less trust would be likely to polarize societies, reducing confidence in governmental institutions and deepening a sense of pervasive unfairness. Because central governments are responsible for engaging with other governments, diminished support for governments would be likely to encumber international cooperation, especially on complex regulatory matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Even without a significant incident or disaster, trust in institutions can erode over time. This includes sources of information and can lead to despair and disengagement, robbing society of the informed and engaged citizenry necessary for democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-suzanne-spaulding-1&quot;&gt;— Suzanne Spaulding&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internationally, a decline in trust would diminish foreign direct investment and international loans, especially in countries that do not have a robust digital infrastructure to protect trust. Creating and supporting such an infrastructure would be an expensive proposition, and diminishing global trust would likely deepen the divide between wealthier and poorer states. In addition, perceptions that foreign governments are using their technological power to weaken adversaries could set off an escalatory spiral of attacks and counterattacks that further diminish trust within societies, making agreements between governments even harder to strike. That could promote a world that is not only less peaceful and less prosperous, but one with more robust criminal networks that can escape government control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ironically, more controls against malicious uses of technology often exist in countries with fewer protections against government intrusion. When companies are asked to police use of their technology, they face criticism for intervening too much and not doing enough. This trade-off is one of the great challenges of digital policy—enforcing norms of digital behavior that protect trust requires tools and authorities that can also enable serious abuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia is reportedly mobilising 160,000 new troops, ramping up its war efforts in Ukraine. Meanwhile, President Trump is eager to broker a peace deal, despite remaining obstacles and with limited US support for Ukraine. The burden of leadership is increasingly on the Coalition of the Willing – led by the UK and France and composed of states committed to supporting Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether current diplomacy succeeds, Russia will pose the central threat to European security. This requires a strong, coherent long-term strategy. Such a strategy must incorporate historical “tools” alongside other approaches. While policymakers in the field of international relations do recognise the importance of historical knowledge and skills, it is often lacking a structural integration in the onboarding processes for new diplomats and policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tool-1-understanding-russias-historical-narrative&quot;&gt;Tool 1: Understanding Russia’s Historical Narrative&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to gain a deep understanding of the Russian historical narrative. This narrative became more assertive from 2007/2008 onwards and centred, on the idea of reunifying different Slavic peoples within one holy Russian nation and protecting (ethnic) Russians (abroad). It reflects the Kremlin’s motivations on the international stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One cannot assess the value of a concession without a clear grasp of what drives Russia’s leadership. In parts of the West, the (naïve) belief persists that Russia’s imperial ambitions are limited to Ukraine. Yet Russia’s historical narrative is not rhetorical. It is used for political purposes and weaponised to justify the ongoing war. Russia’s historically informed agenda leaves no doubt about its ambitions on the international stage and the threat it poses to European security. Effectively communicating these insights to the public is important for sustaining public support for Ukraine and for broader investments in European security, particularly as these investments will compete with other spending priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s historical narrative must also be considered in the negotiations over a peace deal. Even if a deal is reached, the Russian perception of Ukraine as a hostile Nazi state is unlikely to disappear. This narrative – propagated through state media, the education system, and even a military-theme park near Moscow – remains deeply embedded. The Coalition of the Willing must reckon with this factor when shaping its longer-term strategy towards Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tool-2-learning-from-analogies-and-precedents&quot;&gt;Tool 2: Learning from Analogies and Precedents&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second historical tool is the analysis of analogies and precedents. In the context of the ongoing negotiations over a peace deal, it is relevant to examine how Russia has approached diplomacy in past conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, during the wars in Chechnya (1994-1996, 1999-2009), Russia used the interwar period to reorganise, and ultimately launch a renewed offensive. A comparable pattern played out in Syria, where Russia’s intervention from 2015 onwards was marked by strategic use of ceasefires, not as pathways to peace, but as opportunities to regroup before resuming military operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2016, Russia announced a withdrawal of its forces from Syria. In reality, this was a rotation of troops in preparation for a large-scale offensive. These examples are a recurring strategy: using diplomacy as a tactical opportunity rather than as a step towards lasting peace. The Minsk Agreements (2014-2015), which sought to halt fighting in the Donbas, similarly failed to produce durable peace and ultimately preceded Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the battlefield, Russia pursues a long-term objective to disrupt the European security order that has existed since the 1990s. While the US has repeatedly reaffirmed its continued support for NATO, growing indications suggest European reliance on American security can no longer be taken for granted. Telling signals include US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth’s statement that the US is no longer “the primary guarantor of security in Europe,” as well as President Trump’s remarks on potentially using military force to acquire Greenland from NATO ally Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, Europe must accelerate efforts to develop greater autonomy. Over the longer term, this calls for institutionalising the Coalition of the Willing into a more permanent European security structure. The EU, in its current configuration, is unlikely to serve as such a structure, given internal divisions and the problematic role of member states like Hungary. A new model is required. Historical precedents, including the Western Union (1948), the European Defence Community (proposed 1952), and the Western European Union (1954-2011), offer useful points of reference. The point is not to replicate these past models, but rather to examine what once existed, understand what worked and what did not, and draw relevant lessons for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, analysing analogies and precedents offers no certainty about what lies ahead. Events may unfold differently. However, history helps to identify which factors must be taken into account. By understanding the past, policymakers are better equipped to anticipate developments, and in some cases, even prevent certain scenarios from materialising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tool-3-contextualising-the-war&quot;&gt;Tool 3: Contextualising the War&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third historical tool is contextualisation. Contextualisation aids in elucidating Ukraine’s position regarding potential peace negotiations. A key reference point is the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, in which Ukraine relinquished its nuclear weapons in exchange for security assurances from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Russia. The lesson Ukraine has drawn from this experience is that written agreements offer limited protection. This insight helps explain President Zelensky’s reluctance to engage in negotiations and his persistent insistence on obtaining firm security guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;historical-tools-at-the-strategic-level&quot;&gt;Historical Tools at the Strategic Level&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historians, especially those working on international relations, typically emphasize history for policy: providing insights based on their scholarly research. Yet what is increasingly needed is a shift toward history in policy: the structural integration of historical thinking into the policymaking process itself. Where and how can historical tools be embedded? And what knowledge and skills do policymakers – particularly those within the Coalition of the Willing – need to meaningfully incorporate historical perspectives into their work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our research shows that many diplomats and policymakers already apply (some of) the historical tools we have mentioned, sometimes consciously, often intuitively. The real question thus is whether political leaders are willing and able to act on the insights history provides.&lt;/p&gt;

This paper provides a wider conceptual lens, looking beyond the UN debate and, to some degree, Western perspectives.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responsible cyber behaviour (RCB) refers to the collective expectations of state and non-state actors about how they should behave in cyberspace. “Behaviour” in this context comprises the values, norms, policies, practices and technologies that are meant to protect and secure cyberspace. These expectations are highly contested and vary across regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within cybersecurity debates – and specifically in the context of the UN’s Open-Ended Working Group on the security of and in cyberspace (OEWG) and Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) – “responsibility” has often been associated with “responsible state behaviour”. Within this context, the term “responsible state behaviour” mainly concerns the collective expectations of UN member states in meeting and observing their international commitments to norms and international law. The debate largely concentrates on how states should behave towards each other, rather than how they ought to act domestically. As these discussions are held at the UN First Committee responsible for international peace and security, dialogue on responsibility in cyberspace is restricted to those parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RUSI’s research, and this paper, takes a wider view, based on the premise that understanding RCB requires consideration of cultural values, regional alliances and domestic factors such as institutional or legislative setup. The objective of this paper is to provide a wider conceptual lens on RCB, looking beyond the UN debate and, to some degree, beyond Western perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper investigates two areas: states’ perceptions of what international responsibility entails; and how other multilateral bodies and initiatives have sought to frame responsibility. The research evidence, gathered via a series of semi-structured interviews and workshops, shows that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is widespread recognition that the UN framework alone does not enable a sufficient understanding of RCB: elements of a state’s strategic preferences (such as regional dynamics, foreign policy, economic status and domestic regimes) are equally critical to a state’s view of RCB.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beyond the UN framework, states view RCB in at least three ways: as an economic driver; as a set of tools that help them define and signal unacceptable behaviour; and as a multi-sited diplomatic strategy to advance a national interest.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most states emphasise a positive interpretation of responsibility, linking RCB to economic development and prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cyber capacity building is the most consistent theme associated with RCB, as it provides states with mechanisms and resources that help them act responsibly in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some states emphasise the usefulness of negative responsibility measures, such as “naming and shaming” tactics, but most states avoid publicly identifying bad actors, concentrating instead on condemning behaviour generically and responding with discreet diplomatic and technical measures.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given increasingly fragmented multilateral governance and growing geopolitical divides, states have progressively used non-UN forums to develop norms and shared views on irresponsible behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recommendations include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encourage diplomatic engagement with non-Western attribution narratives:&lt;/strong&gt; As non-Western states become more vocal in attributing behaviour, Western states should develop strategies to address emerging public attribution practices – especially by countries such as China and Russia – including by clarifying evidentiary standards and proactively communicating their own thresholds for public attribution. This can help manage the reputational risks of being named by adversarial states.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clarify expectations for private sector actors in cyber diplomacy and capacity building:&lt;/strong&gt; International organisations and donors should define clearer expectations around the involvement of private companies in cyber capacity building, particularly regarding transparency, conflict of interest and alignment with international standards of responsible behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support the development of national legal and policy frameworks that define operational cyber responsibility:&lt;/strong&gt; States, particularly in the Global South, should be supported in developing national policies that articulate their approach to cyber operations or the acquisition of cyber capabilities –including doctrines, thresholds for response and mechanisms for oversight – in line with international commitments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrate incident response practices into ongoing cyber norms discussions:&lt;/strong&gt; Multilateral and regional cyber forums should seek to leverage more insights from national computer emergency response teams and technical agencies in discussions on cyber norms, with a focus on how real time responses to incidents reflect or challenge evolving expectations of responsible behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Map how existing multilateral forums interpret and apply RCB principles:&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers and policymakers should continue to collaborate to further develop a comparative analysis on how different multilateral organisations or groupings seek to shape and/or operationalise RCB (for example, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, the BRICS, the International Telecommunications Union, ASEAN, and the OECD), even where the term “RCB” is not explicitly used. This will help identify overlapping expectations and areas of normative divergence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2015, UN member states agreed on 11 international norms to guide their behaviour in cyberspace. The norms establish general expectations for interstate interaction in cyberspace on topics such as cooperation, information sharing, respect for human rights, assistance with major cyber incident recovery, and the reporting of vulnerabilities. These norms are part of a two-decade set of dialogues conducted by the UN Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) and the UN Open-Ended Working Group on the security of and in cyberspace (OEWG), respectively. Successive resolutions from these processes have established what has come to be known as the UN framework for responsible state behaviour, comprising four main pillars that encompass the 11 norms (Figure 1): international law, cyber norms, confidence building measures (CBMs), and cyber capacity building (CCB).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/70GAyrv.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;

Edited by RUSI.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite geopolitical tensions between the US and China, the ongoing war in Ukraine, the crisis in Gaza and critiques concerning the erosion of the multilateral system, cyber has remained a slow but steady area of debate at the UN. Elements of the framework have been implemented regionally and domestically: since 2012, 32 countries have outlined their interpretations of international law’s application to cyberspace; public attribution of cyber incidents has become more frequent (albeit still limited to only a few states), CCB has gained prominence as a strategic investment area, and regional bodies have expanded their lists of cyber CBMs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, viewing responsibility in cyberspace solely through a UN lens is insufficient for understanding how responsible cyber behaviour (RCB) is perceived across different regions, and for identifying emerging state practices in this field, for a number of reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The UN framework provides only a partial picture of debates on responsible behaviour in cyberspace and can create a limited view of international expectations of state/non-state actors’ observance of emerging standards of responsibility, leaving out a much broader field of initiatives, practices and dialogues.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both policy and scholarly debates on responsibility and accountability in cyberspace have been led by a narrow interest in the international security dimension advanced by the UN, which has focused on questions about attribution and the consequences (or lack thereof) of non-observance of agreed norms and international law.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the UN framework is the outcome of consensus-based processes, the diplomatic power to shape the international agenda is concentrated in the hands of a few states. As a result, the consensus has, at times, been tabled and drafted by many, but meaningfully negotiated by only a select few.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;States have struggled to track how the UN framework is implemented and referenced domestically (beyond, that is, general acknowledgements from ministries of foreign affairs or other departments that might be more attuned to international security dimensions of responsibility in cyberspace).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These challenges raise important policy questions: how and (whether) the UN framework is socialised beyond diplomatic circles, and how states have sought to demonstrate their commitments to it domestically. The challenges also underscore the limitations of a UN-centric perspective, which conceals an equally important policy question: how have different views of responsibility so far emerged via other international dialogues and across regions and countries?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing on interviews, workshops, participant observation and a literature review, this paper responds to these and other challenges by taking stock of how notions of responsibility are socialised beyond the UN discussion in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investigating states’ perceptions of how to exercise international responsibility:&lt;/strong&gt; The paper provides an analysis of emerging state practices in response to the different components of the UN framework. It reflects on practical examples of how states have enacted international responsibility in terms of both positive responsibility (observance of rights, obligations and voluntary commitments) and negative responsibility (identifying or acting on lack of observance).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identifying how other multilateral or multistakeholder forums define RCB beyond the UN:&lt;/strong&gt; The paper offers a reflection of how RCB has been defined beyond the UN First Committee terminology, and provides a multi-sited perspective of international responsibility by analysing documents from other international organisations, multilateral groupings and regional bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If left unaddressed, these challenges could erode confidence in and observance of accountability measures by states. For Western governments, understanding the limitations as well as the perceived biases of a UN-centric approach can help them to identify blind spots and opportunities for engaging in constructive dialogue with developing and Global South countries in multilateral negotiations. For most states, and for those in the Global South in particular, having a clear grasp of the evolving state practices at the domestic, operational and international levels, and how they already connect to international commitments, can help them to identify areas of existing and potential implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most crucially, and as this paper shows, although states might not explicitly use the terms “responsible state behaviour” or “responsible cyber behaviour”, this does not mean that expectations of responsible behaviour in cyberspace are not being shaped in other multilateral, thematic or bilateral forums. Understanding and tracking forums beyond the UN can help states identify values, motivations and emerging interpretations of RCB – including those that might not always be aligned with the UN framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The structure and content of this paper were developed and collected throughout the duration of RUSI’s Responsible Cyber Behaviour project. The findings are based on a combination of different data collection methods that were used to map states’ views on RCB and the implementation of the UN framework (albeit not restricted to the latter). Data collection took place from July 2023 to October 2024, during which the author engaged with approximately 70 governments and other non-governmental experts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The methodology used for data collection and analysis as part of this project included a set of primary sources (workshops, participant observation, interviews) and secondary sources for data collection (and literature review). Together, these sources cover the UN, other multilateral forums, national policies and scholarly analyses of RCB-related topics covered in this paper:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Literature review:&lt;/strong&gt; A review of literature from the past decade including (but not restricted to) academic papers, policy documents, official statements, resolutions and news pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interviews:&lt;/strong&gt; Semi-structured interviews with 15 government representatives from different regions. These interviews took place either as follow-ups to workshops or alongside participant observation. Their primary purpose was to fill gaps in information. Interviewees 1–7 were from the Indo-Pacific, interviewees 8–10 from Europe, interviewees 11–12 from the Middle East and Africa and interviewees 13–15 from Latin America and the Caribbean.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Participant observation:&lt;/strong&gt; The research team participated in cross-regional events held in London, New York, Accra, Santiago, Singapore and Kyoto. Participant observation included workshops in each of these locations, RUSI’s inaugural Securing Cyberspace Conference, and attendance at multilateral negotiations within the UN OEWG process and region-specific meetings. Data collection involved field notes documenting interactions and conversations at these events. Combining international and regional dialogues allowed the research team to engage with a broader range of stakeholders and identify emerging areas of RCB beyond the UN framework.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workshops:&lt;/strong&gt; Research involved organising seven workshops, primarily for data collection. Two workshops addressed cross-regional topics, while five focused on gathering national perspectives on RCB within specific regions. Each workshop hosted 30–40 government representatives, along with 3–5 non-governmental participants on average. Given that states do not always publicise their positions or interpretations of cyber norms implementation, the workshops were designed to focus on specific cases and practices (for example, incident response, regional norms guidance, principles for responsible cyber operations and ransomware) to facilitate information sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-defining-responsible-behaviour-beyond-the-un-framework&quot;&gt;I. Defining Responsible Behaviour Beyond the UN Framework&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As “responsibility” is a multifaceted term that conveys notions of morality, values, ethics and legal obligations, cybersecurity debates have incorporated both the ambiguity and challenges that accompany it. Some researchers have opted for alternative concepts, such as “accountability”, shying away from responsibility for a number of reasons. First, “responsibility” evokes strict notions of legal obligations – complying with regulations or international law, for example. Second, both binding and non-binding obligations are often framed as a negative responsibility, that is, focusing on ensuring that actors are held responsible for inaction/non-observance or violation of international commitments, rather than addressing the structure of incentives for them to engage in positive observance in the first place. The over-emphasis on a negative view of responsibility, combined with the absence of an international, legally binding instrument specifically dedicated to cybersecurity, often leads to a third challenge: the view that responsibility is values-driven and thus deemed less objective in calling out or defining “bad” or “irresponsible” behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, responsibility is shaped by other factors beyond the UN framework and a state’s culture – that is, the ideas (shared beliefs and assumptions), norms, historical experiences and behaviours that inform a state’s approach to strategy, security, military affairs and cybersecurity. This paper seeks to better understand how cultural values shape and signify RCB – even if they are not aligned with or are broader than the UN framework. And while the UN framework has narrowed the scope of what analysts look for when seeking to understand views of responsibility, nonetheless it cannot and should not be neglected. This is why this paper assesses state practice in implementing the UN framework while simultaneously incorporating the views of responsibility articulated in other multilateral, regional and theme-specific forums. In so doing, this paper provides state and non-state actors with a clearer analytical lens through which to view the UN framework in a broader landscape of RCB, providing a practical means by which to identify interests, possibilities for convergence/divergence, and strategies for engaging in bilateral and multilateral cooperation – UN or otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-concept-of-responsible-cyber-behaviour&quot;&gt;The Concept of Responsible Cyber Behaviour&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the narrow nature of the concept of responsible state behaviour as it relates to the UN framework, this paper proposes an auxiliary concept to support present and future research on state practice and strategic preferences: responsible cyber behaviour. Countries such as the US, Australia and Canada have referred to “responsible state behaviour” as part of their cyber strategies. Other countries, such as the UK and Greece, have used the term “responsible cyber behaviour” in some of their national documents; the latter term does not restrict responsibility to state actors only. As research by RUSI and the Australian Strategic Policy Institute has shown, policy terminology varies across regions, but nevertheless the concept of RCB can enable a better understanding and tracing of state practice and strategic culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word “responsible”, in this case, invites a reflection on the responsibilities of a range of actors (state and non-state) within the global cybersecurity governance regimes, as well as on the positive (incentives) and negative (obligations and expectations from the international community) responsibilities that they bear. The word “cyber” indicates the realm of that responsibility – that is, in or through cyberspace. Finally, “behaviour” deliberately focuses on practices and conduct that are seen as responsible/irresponsible, acceptable/unacceptable or lawful/unlawful in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A summary of this paper’s working definition of RCB is therefore:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;RCB refers to the collective expectations of how actors should or should not behave in cyberspace. It is composed of the values, norms, policies, practices and technologies that inform/are articulated by stakeholders, including with the purpose of protecting and securing cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not assumed here that countries have explicitly used the term “responsible cyber behaviour”, nor that they necessarily need to have done so for their cyber behaviour to be considered “responsible”. In this regard, this paper represents a multi-sited approach to international responsibility: that is, it investigates how other multilateral and thematic forums (as well as middle-ground and non-Western governments) have framed the idea of “responsibility” in this context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;responsible-cyber-behaviour-beyond-the-un&quot;&gt;Responsible Cyber Behaviour Beyond the UN&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the start of 2022, the RCB project has mapped 12 case studies of how RCB is regionally and nationally defined and/or influenced by a country’s culture. These examples, in conjunction with the present research data, have highlighted that there are numerous themes associated with states practising responsibility that transcend the UN framework. This is the case, for example, with the association between RCB and government control over media content or free speech (due to government concerns about political and social instability), or RCB and the existence of tools and legal frameworks to effectively combat cybercrime (regardless of whether it remains unclear how intrusive cyber-intrusive tools might be and what their “legitimate use” means in practice).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside the UN framework and the realm of the First Committee on disarmament and international security, there is a vast patchwork of views on what defines RCB. As noted by one of the interviewees, “We try to follow the UN cyber norms and framework, but like any other international issues [sic], it’s quite complicated. We cannot outright say that [we agree with the consensus document and that is] what we want. We can only say that there are no objections”. Another interviewee said, “We are adamant that responsible state conduct starts with the eleven norms, but also recognise that the norms and framework don’t cover everything that everyone might consider as responsible behaviour. These are negotiated outcomes – and there are norms that we feel more strongly about than others”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all the states’ representatives interviewed and for most of those present in the workshops, RCB is primarily about having policies (for example, national cybersecurity strategies, cybercrime legislation and data protection legislation) and institutions (for example, national computer emergency response teams (CERTs) and cybersecurity agencies or centres) to enable the country to respond to and/or prevent incidents in accordance with their international commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter presents three snapshots of interpretations concerning RCB beyond the UN: RCB as an economic driver; RCB as an evolving set of practices to determine unacceptable behaviour; and RCB as a multi-sited diplomatic strategy to advance national interest. In so doing, it reflects on states’ responsibilities to develop their own capacities, in the context of different perceptions about economic development as it relates to cybersecurity; looks at how states have sought to identify malicious cyber activity without necessarily having to name and shame state-based/-affiliated/-sponsored cyber actors; and examines how the UN First Committee, rather than being an initiator, is only one of many sites through which a proposal for a legally binding instrument has been advocated for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;rcb-as-an-economic-driver-the-responsibility-to-develop-capacities&quot;&gt;RCB as an Economic Driver: The Responsibility to Develop Capacities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrary to the predominantly negative view of responsibility being focused on calling out bad behaviour and deploying other “sticks” to deter malicious cyber activity, most developing countries favour a positive view of responsibility: one that is centred around the development of economic capacities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question of developing economic capacities has only been tangentially covered in discussions in the GGE and OEWG, and through CCB. In 2021, states agreed, within the context of the UN OEWG, on principles that should guide CCB. These principles are: process and purpose, partnerships, and people. However, as one of the interviewees noted, for a minister or a decision-maker in a state capital, RCB is as much about the “ability to have and establish the proper mechanisms to act responsibly” and assess how to effectively spend money as it is about the UN framework, adding, “responsible state behaviour [as postulated by the UN framework] should not be seen in a vacuum [given that] CCB is a fabric for [a state’s] development”. As this suggests, not only does the relationship between RCB and CCB extend well beyond the remit of the UN First Committee within the UN, it also takes different shapes and forms in other multilateral groupings, raising the questions: what are states’ responsibilities to develop capacities to tackle cyber threats and how do they perceive them? The following points describe some of the ways in which RCB relates to CCB and cyber capacity development within and beyond the UN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capacity building enabling observance of international commitments:&lt;/strong&gt; First, states have committed to implementing the UN framework. In this context, “capacity building” refers to the enablers and constraints for state observance of their collective commitments to the framework. Examples include initiatives that seek to enable states to develop their national position on how international law applies to cyberspace. Global Affairs Canada (GAC), for example, supported the AU with capacity building sessions to enable the development of a common African position, which led to the AU being the first regional body to publish a joint position of this kind.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Moreover, according to international law, states need to have the capacity to observe, respect and enact – whenever appropriate – their international commitments. CCB is not only an enabling element of the implementation of the framework but also an integral part of the state’s capacity to observe international law. Due diligence refers to a state’s obligation to not knowingly allow its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other states. It constitutes an obligation of conduct where states commit to pursuing their best possible efforts to prevent, respond to or terminate malicious cyber activities. However, if a state is unable to determine who is responsible for a malicious cyber activity because, for example, it does not have the capacity to identify, mitigate or discern from where such activity emanates (jurisdictionally speaking), then it cannot attribute and affix responsibility to another state, making it inviable for them to undertake countermeasures – thus illustrating the critical relevance of CCB in mitigating existing observance shortfalls and in elevating attribution.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capacity building as state building:&lt;/strong&gt; Interviews and workshop discussions showed that even though states might observe the UN framework, this does not guide the domestic RCB discussion. Rather, it is primarily led by development-related concerns such as CCB, economic prosperity and/or resilience, regardless of whether they are directly linked to the framework or not.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Policymakers and ministers at the national level are much less concerned with the international law and norms dimensions of CCB. Capacity building is, first and foremost, an economic and development agenda directed at helping states respond to and/or prepare for a more digitally connected society. As one of the interviewees highlighted: “In the end, our cybersecurity agency’s focus is not cybersecurity but prosperity. To have that, you need to take risks – and we want to make sure we can manage those risks. Security is not the only thing that our nation needs, but the growth of [the] economy and safe and secure cyberspace are the main things”. It becomes clear that the economic prosperity narrative guides cybersecurity investment and not necessarily national security.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, most states that engaged in this research associated RCB with developing core state functions for a more digitally-connected government – that is, with how capacity building enables the state to respond more effectively and proactively, and with the adequate legal and institutional resources. Unless a project explicitly relates to the OEWG (as is the case with the above-mentioned AU–GAC partnership, or with the Women in International Security and Cyberspace Fellowship), the connection with international commitments is often made ex-post in an attempt by the ministry of foreign affairs to translate existing initiatives into the OEWG agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As highlighted in the different workshops and interviews, the development of a national cybersecurity strategy, a national CERT and/or a cybersecurity agency can provide more transparency and predictability about a government’s action and mandate to act in cybersecurity-related areas. Such predictability is essential for creating an environment of stable development within which donor organisations such as international development banks know what they can expect in terms of implementation and returns.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;However, workshop participants from some states also noted that while organisational, institutional and policy measures that demonstrate RCB are important economic enablers, in the final analysis, one of the biggest challenges for them is ensuring they have sufficient budgetary resources to adequately purchase and renew licences for specific incident response and vulnerability management tools (as well the skills to effectively implement them).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regional bodies as catalysts for RCB:&lt;/strong&gt; In recent years, regional organisations have started to play a key role in the implementation of the UN framework and beyond. Participants in the workshops highlighted how such organisations can: help track the implementation of international agreements; support the development of common positions on the applicability of international law in cyberspace; and develop further confidence building measures to enhance regional collaboration, and play a role as hubs for CCB.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Both the AU and the EU have now published their respective common regional positions on how international law applies to cyberspace, boosting expectations that regional bodies can help strengthen RCB. During one of the workshops, participants discussed this matter and highlighted that:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Not all regional organisations should be expected to support the development of a common position. On the one hand, organisations such as the OSCE might not be well placed to advance a common position (due to geopolitical tensions regarding Russia’s membership), but will continue to work on CBMs and other forms of capacity building. On the other hand, the Organization of American States (OAS), under the auspices of the Inter-American Judicial Committee, facilitated a multi-year project from 2018 to 2022 which included a survey to identify areas of convergence and divergence on how international law applies to cyberspace. Even though the OAS produced five reports on the topic this has not produced a common position, due to varying degrees of political appetite and maturity to engage in the discussion. The level of political appetite is also influenced by a degree of historical and institutional unease among Latin American countries with the OAS as a regional organisation. This is partly because rather than focusing on specific subregions such as Latin America, South America or even Latin America and the Caribbean, it includes the US and Canada under the broader umbrella of “the Americas”. However, such dynamics have not stopped countries in the region from progressively publishing their views, as in the cases of Brazil (2021), Costa Rica (2023), Cuba (2024) and Colombia (2025).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regional approaches to RCB&lt;/strong&gt;, such as the common positions on international law, do not supplant individual national action, and can occasionally provide a stepping stone for states to develop the capacity and confidence to establish their own national positions. Diplomats in the workshops noted that common positions provide them with a reference document that they can use to articulate the importance of their national position within their respective government departments/ministries. The risk, however, is that governments with less capacity might settle for the common position and, in so doing, not progress with developing their own understanding – and consequently fall short of a progressive development and codification of international law.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;rcb-as-identifying-unacceptable-behaviour-beyond-public-cyber-attribution&quot;&gt;RCB as Identifying Unacceptable Behaviour Beyond Public Cyber Attribution&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the discussion on unacceptable behaviour in cyberspace has revolved around a negative view of responsibility: that is, the ability of states to call out bad behaviour whenever necessary. The UK, the US, Canada, Japan, the EU and others have increasingly used sanctions, indictments (in the US), joint attributions and démarches to put pressure on state-sponsored groups from China, Iran, Russia and North Korea. The challenge, however, is that most countries do not publicly and politically attribute cyberattacks to other states, begging the question of how states can draw the lines of unacceptability if they are not inclined to politically and publicly attribute responsibility for perceived misdemeanours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research for this paper has identified at least three ways that states can signal (and have signalled) unacceptable behaviour, beyond public attribution:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Technical attribution and/or indirect endorsements/references to other technical reports.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Via other non-UN forums that seek to facilitate state convergence around a new norm targeting a specific unacceptable behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Through thematic initiatives that seek to better understand the problem and the non-state actors’ stake in it so as to devise norms for the group.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/yBaBknr.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: State Practices in Signalling Unacceptable Behaviour Without Publicly Attributing Responsibility.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: The author.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the states that participated in the RUSI/GP-RCB workshops, as well as other government representatives who were interviewed as part of this project, noted that a lack of public political attribution should not be equated with a posture of complacency or absence of political will with regard to calling out unacceptable behaviour. Some interviewees stressed that they are more concerned with rejecting a certain type of behaviour than with discrediting the actor behind it – especially in the case of a state-sponsored or state-affiliated cyber incident where they are unwilling to take the risk of facing a political or economic backlash. While such a strategy arguably seeks to manage the risk of interstate cyber escalation, the actions it produces are insufficient to deter state-linked actors from conducting malicious cyber activity; this is a trade-off of which most states are conscious. Moreover, these actors might also be less inclined to attribute as a consequence of their cultural background, strategic preferences and/or regional dynamics. As one interviewee put it, “I think it is easier for the EU and NATO to take sudden actions against Russia. But for countries in Southeast Asia, it might be harder, or perhaps not so convenient to take certain actions [such as public attribution]. What you fundamentally do is you preserve your space. … Culture is important, and it shapes our way of communicating our grievances. We might not do it publicly, but in the background, there is considerable action”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In cases such as this, where there is no political will to name and shame state actors, the national cybersecurity agency or CERT often plays a significant (yet tricky) role in navigating between technical and political attribution. For example, Switzerland – the foreign policy of which has been characterised by a posture of neutrality – has not sought to publicly attribute. However, in 2024 the Swiss National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) mentioned for the first time that a “presumed pro-Russian” group called “NoName” had claimed responsibility for launching a distributed denial of service attack against multiple websites of the Swiss Federal Administration in protest at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s attendance at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos. The word “presumed” here is important, as it is an attempt to cautiously restate the self-affiliation of the NoName group to Russia while not explicitly ascribing responsibility to Russia. The Swiss NCSC’s role on this occasion illustrates the fine line between technically and politically attributing an incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other countries might not even come so close to making a technical attribution but would rather use subtler strategies to indicate concern. For example, following the 2022 Russian attack to disrupt satellite communications provider Viasat’s services to Ukraine just a few hours before the full-scale invasion took place, Singapore referenced the cyberattack in a series of public statements from ministers at the end of 2022, and in 2023 the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore included a reference to the operation in its 2022 annual report, explicitly referencing the attribution to Russia made by the US, the UK, Australia and others. Interviewees and workshop participants noted that their governments have used consistent referencing as a tool for articulating unacceptable behaviour, while controlling for risks. Such a practice, which refrains from politically joining a broader coalition to attribute but refers to the attribution, favours signalling over punishing or shaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The factors that can prompt states to shift their posture towards making public attribution vary, and many of them have remained focused on the behaviour rather than the perpetrator (if state-sponsored or -affiliated), even after large-scale incidents. After 27 government bodies in Costa Rica were targeted by Russia-affiliated ransomware group Conti in 2022, the government was the first to declare a “national state of emergency” due to a cyberattack but did not go so far as to publicly associate the group with Russia. This example, as also highlighted during our GP-RCB regional workshop, shows that rather than seeing attribution as the ultimate tool to signal unacceptable behaviour, a country’s response to an incident can accelerate its maturity in defining red lines. In Costa Rica’s case, this was manifested through practices such as the government publishing its view on how international law applies to cyberspace, approving its national cybersecurity strategy (2023–27), strengthening the national CERT’s role as national cyber security coordinator, and receiving financial and capacity building assistance from the US to enhance recovery and response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estonia provides a contrasting example. The country had been a target for Russian state-sponsored cyber operations for nearly two decades, and yet in that time had decided not to publicly and politically attribute any cyberattacks. This approach changed in 2024, with the country naming, for the first time, Russia’s military intelligence service (the GRU) as responsible for a 2020 cyberattack targeting Estonian ministries. While scale might not have been as decisive a factor as it was for Costa Rica, the Estonian attribution was the outcome of a years-long build-up of their appetite for engaging in such practice. While no single trigger for the change in posture has been confirmed privately (as part of this research), or publicly, a number of factors can be seen to have created the enabling context for the change in posture: the fact that since Russia’s 22-day cyber campaign against Estonia in 2007 the EU had developed a cyber diplomacy toolbox encouraging the practice; more countries having signed up to joint cyber attributions; and the context of Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine and and targeting neighbouring countries with cyberattacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regional organisations or groups of like-minded countries can progressively enable an environment of trust wherein states that are disinclined to attribute individually can align themselves with existing public attributions without overcommitting. This is the case with the EU’s Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox (CDT). The CDT was established in 2017, and two years later was adopted by the Council of the EU as part of the EU’s Common Foreign and Security Policy, enabling sanctions to be imposed in line with the CDT’s provisions. In 2020, the Council imposed sanctions against cyberattacks for the first time. While it cannot be categorically stated that the CDT directly influenced Estonia’s shift in posture, these developments do illustrate that the existence of shared frameworks embedded in regional bodies can foster an environment of trust wherein member states can build upon and develop their national approach to cyber attribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are still multiple reasons why a country might not seek to publicly attribute a cyberattack, including: avoiding exposure to potential retaliation from the state to which the malicious cyber activity is attributed; lacking the capacity to respond to and/or identify the origin of the malicious cyber activity; and/or expecting more information to be shared by countries that are trying to recruit support for specific public attributions. The tendency to use public attribution often shifts only after large-scale incidents: as seen in Albania after the Iranian group HomeLand Justice targeted Albanian government public services and government websites, or in the UK after the 2017 WannaCry ransomware attack attributed to North Korea’s Lazarus Group. Whether such trend is consistent across regions and cases remains uncertain. As shown in cases such as in Costa Rica, for example, the inclination to publicly attribute after a cyber-enabled national or diplomatic crisis is not a universal pattern. Additionally, countries embroiled in ongoing border disputes or facing persistent threat-actor clusters, such as India and Pakistan, have shown little inclination to publicly attribute cyber incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to technical attribution or government reference to private companies’ threat intelligence reports or alerts, some states also signal unacceptable behaviour by leveraging like-minded forums to build consensus on other potential norms for RCB. This is the case with the G20 and G7 advocating for a norm against cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property (IP). This norm has not been explicitly recognised by UN processes, although it would fall broadly under the norm on not knowingly allowing a territory to be used for internationally wrongful acts. The G20 and G7 discussions about the norm emerged after the Obama–Xi agreement in 2015 – following comments from General Keith Alexander, former head of the US Cyber Command, describing China’s IP theft as “the biggest transfer of wealth in history”. The initial 2015 momentum also meant that the norm managed to gain traction in other groupings: the G20 leaders’ communique recognised state-sponsored economic cyber espionage as a risk to long-term economic growth in 2015, and a year later G7 member states also stressed their commitment “that no country should conduct or knowingly support ICT [information and communications technology]-enabled theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets or other confidential business information, with the intent of providing competitive advantages to its companies or commercial sectors”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, not all commitments persist over time. Current US–China relations and broader geopolitical context could not be more different from those in 2015, amid increasing international tensions involving Russia and between the US and China (especially after the discovery that the Chinese Ministry of State Security and the People’s Liberation Army were conducting cyber espionage and pre-positioning of malicious software in US critical infrastructure). While the G7 has continued and expanded its efforts in the cybersecurity domain, the G20 has become an ever-more contentious forum given the lack of a common position condemning Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and in the context of the trade war between the US and China – all of which has rocked the prospects for further norms diffusion and implementation across G20 member states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;States also engage in defining unacceptable behaviour by promoting or participating in exploratory discussions and groupings that seek to enable norms emergence. That is the case, for example, with the Pall Mall Process (PMP), an initiative set up by the UK and France in 2024 to discuss the proliferation and irresponsible use of commercial cyber intrusion capabilities, and with similar US-led efforts to control proliferation of commercial spyware via the Summit for Democracy, and the resulting joint statements. The topic of commercial cyber intrusion had not been referenced in UN GGE or OEWG resolutions prior to the PMP or the joint statements. Probably the closest reference to it was the norm that notes that: “States should [seek to] prevent the proliferation of malicious ICT tools, techniques or harmful hidden functions”. Despite the Summit for Democracy focusing exclusively on the most intrusive type of commercial cyber intrusion capability and the PMP focusing on getting less like-minded countries and companies on board to discuss irresponsible use of other tools (while recognising that there are legitimate uses), both initiatives arguably spurred momentum for the topic to be recognised for the first time in the UN OEWG 2021–25 interim annual progress report, in mid-2024. While the report did not add a new norm on the topic, it did recognise the threat that commercial cyber intrusion poses to ensuring state responsibility in cyberspace:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;States noted the growing market for commercially-available ICT intrusion capabilities as well as hardware and software vulnerabilities, including on the dark web. States expressed concern that their ready availability to State and non-State actors was increasing the opportunity for their illegitimate and malicious use and making it potentially more difficult to mitigate and defend against the threats they pose, while emphasizing that such capabilities could be used in a manner consistent with international law. States further expressed concern that the dissemination of ICT intrusion capabilities by State and non -State actors could contribute to unintentional escalation and threaten international peace and security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cases above highlight a few examples of the practice of RCB beyond the UN, demonstrating: how consensus and signalling concerning irresponsible cyber behaviour need not start at the UN; that successful dissemination of a norm of unacceptability may or may not result in it being incorporated in UN resolutions; that the fact that a norm has not been accepted by UN processes does not mean that other countries might not take it up as a national commitment; that domestic motivations and demonstrations of condemned behaviours vary, yet still signal unacceptability (albeit through different means and practices); and that there is much more to learn about countries’ views of RCB – and consequently the demarcation of irresponsible behaviour – from incident responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;rcb-as-a-diplomatic-strategy-the-quest-for-a-legally-binding-instrument-for-cybersecurity&quot;&gt;RCB as a Diplomatic Strategy: The Quest for a Legally Binding Instrument for Cybersecurity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether a treaty or convention on cybersecurity is required has been the subject of a long-time contentious debate at the UN – and not without reason. With the exception of the AU’s Malabo Convention, the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime and the UN Cybercrime Convention, there is no “special” law for international security in cyberspace. And, as highlighted by different states, the absence of such lex specialis for cyberspace means that general rules of state responsibility and customary international law apply in the cyber context. While states remain divided into three camps regarding the development of special law – “no need”, “maybe later”, “urgently needed” – in UN OEWG and GGE negotiations Russia has sought to advocate for a treaty (special law) through other multilateral organisations and in bilateral dialogues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2013, the BRICS (Brazil, China, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, India, Russia, South Africa and the UAE) summit declarations have included mentions of espionage, cybercrime and international cybersecurity. The specific topics might have changed slightly over the years, but some notable examples include, in 2014, committing to “the negotiation of a universally legally binding instrument” for combating the criminal use of ICT. Subsequent years have seen the recognition and emphasis of “the importance of an open, secure, peaceful, stable, accessible and non-discriminatory environment for information and communications technologies”, in addition to “the importance of universally agreed norms, rules and principles, under the auspices of the UN, for the responsible behavior of States in the realm of ICTs, and uphold the centrality of the United Nations in their development”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some might question how closely summit declarations reflect states’ views, it remains the case that such declarations do illustrate how these states publicly, deliberately and politically endorse a particular narrative about RCB. These kinds of statement have also been accompanied by the establishment of cybersecurity-specific mechanisms under the auspices of the BRICS. This includes the Working Group on Security in the Use of Information and Communication Technologies and the BRICS Roadmap of Practical Cooperation on Ensuring Security in the Use of ICTs. These and other mechanisms provide a specific space for socialisation of norms and understandings of what RCB means within the BRICS, albeit with limited public visibility of the frequency of meetings, activities and outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite such limitations, two key references to RCB have emerged publicly from the BRICS Summit declarations. The 2023 Johannesburg II Summit Declaration reintroduced a reference to the leading role of the UN in “developing a universal legal framework” on international ICT security after a six-year gap between it and the first time it had been mentioned in a BRICS Summit Declaration. The reference re-emerged at the same time as the UN Ad Hoc Committee on cybercrime was conducting its own negotiations for a global cybercrime treaty and was published less than two months after Russia, Belarus, North Korea, Nicaragua, Syria and Venezuela had submitted a concept document to the OEWG proposing a Convention on Information Security. While Russia was not the main sponsor for the latter – despite having historically been the country tabling the proposal for a convention on the topic – the reference shows that in settings such as the BRICS, there are specific leads pushing for RCB-related proposals such as a legally binding treaty on cybersecurity. Moreover, when this development is considered in the broader context of concomitant negotiation processes, it becomes evident how Russia advocates for similar agenda items across UN and non-UN forums. That is the case, for example, in Russia–Africa summits, where Russia has not only pushed for representatives from African states to “work towards legally binding norms” on the security of ICT but has also referred to it during OEWG negotiations in order to pressure African states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The announcement of the expansion of the BRICS in August 2023 raised numerous questions as to what BRICS+ negotiations would deliver on cyber-related issues – if anything – given the increasing disparities of views among members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) has also been addressing cybersecurity issues. According to the 2023 SCO Deputy Secretary General, cybersecurity has been part of the SCO’s dialogues since 2006, when the group’s foreign trade ministers established the Ad Hoc Working Group on ICTs. In 2009, SCO member states signed an Agreement on Cooperation in Ensuring International Information Security, which provides a list of common threats, terms and concepts, and lists areas for future cooperation in cybersecurity and cybercrime. Notably, the document also includes a list of general principles, agreeing that “[cooperation and the activities in the international information space should meet] the conventional principles and rules of international law, including the principles of peaceful settlement of disputes and conflicts, non-uses of force, non-interference to internal affairs, respect of the rights and fundamental freedoms of the person, and also to the principles of regional cooperation and non-interference to national information resource.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the 2022 Joint Communiqué following the 21st Meeting of the SCO Council of Heads of Government (prime ministers) shows, initiatives in this field have continued. The document refers to the Concept of Cooperation of the SCO Member States in the Field of Digitalisation and Information Communication Technology (Bishkek, 14 June 2019 – not publicly available). Also in 2022 the SCO released a statement on the diversification of supply chains, noting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We emphasise the devastating impact of unilateral economic measures, which run counter to the general principles and rules of the WTO, and of measures regarding the financial systems of the SCO member states on the security and stability of supply chains, as well as on the multilateral trading system and all its participants. We reaffirm our desire to ensure the resilience, reliability and stability of international supply chains, and maintain the openness and transparency of cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While not cyber-exclusive, the discussion does relate to views on the responsible use and development of technologies. On a similar topic, since 2022 the Samarkand Declaration and the New Delhi Declarations have iteratively stressed SCO states’ categorical opposition to the militarisation of ICT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SCO member states have also reinforced their support for the “development of universal rules, principles and norms of responsible behaviour of states in this area, and in particular, welcome the development under the auspices of the UN of a comprehensive international convention against the use of ICT for criminal purposes”, while also reiterating the central role of the UN in countering threats in the information space by “creating a safe, fair and open information space, with respect of principles of state sovereignty and non-interference”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;risks-to-enactment-of-international-responsibility&quot;&gt;Risks to Enactment of International Responsibility&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notions of responsibility or responsible behaviour are not always explicitly referred to within a UN First Committee but, as this section shows, they are nonetheless portrayed, encoded and exported in documents produced across multiple sites and by many types of actors. It is vital that scholars and policymakers track and reflect on how UN debates unfold not only in New York but also in other multilateral and multistakeholder discussions. This is because states might seek to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Advance and consolidate norms in smaller groupings on specific topics and then resocialise them in key processes such as the UN OEWG and its future regular mechanism for institutional dialogue. Ongoing ad hoc initiatives such as the PMP serve as an example of spaces where states, private sector actors and civil society collaborate to shape emerging norms before bringing them to multilateral forums such as the UN.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ensure complementarity of the different mandates of these organisations and processes whenever possible. This is the case, for example, with cross-referencing or enabling participation of International Telecommunications Union (ITU) representatives in OEWG dialogues with the purpose of understanding broader CCB initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Identify areas of contention around or divergence from evolving international views on RCB. Despite the GGE and OEWG resolutions, as well as the restated commitment to the UN framework, other multilateral groupings or initiatives might share different values or concerns. This directly influences whether they will concentrate in areas such as development rather than deterrence, or on the development of a legally binding instrument rather than customary international law.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, throughout the interviews, workshops and participant observation in multilateral negotiations, the following challenges to the effective operationalisation of states’ international commitments to RCB – whether the UN framework or others – have been identified and need to be further investigated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenges in tracing norm implementation and political will:&lt;/strong&gt; Despite widespread agreement among member states on voluntary commitments, implementing and monitoring adherence to international norms remains problematic. Efforts such as checklists created by Mexico, Australia and ASEAN have aimed to provide frameworks for assessing cyber norms, yet awareness and practical application are often lacking. This gap underscores the difficulty of translating commitments into measurable actions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risks of a predominantly negative accountability framework:&lt;/strong&gt; A negative approach to responsibility often concentrates on the consequences and reparations arising from wrongful or irresponsible actions. This state-centric, punitive view has notable shortcomings:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It marginalises non-state actors, despite their significant role in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It overlooks non-malicious actions that inadvertently cause harm.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It fails to account for variations in understanding and enacting responsibility, even within the context of international agreements.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Over-reliance on public attribution by a select few:&lt;/strong&gt; Public attribution and practices such as “naming and shaming” remain key tools for signalling unacceptable cyber behaviour. These actions highlight prohibited targets, methods and effects, serving as a deterrent for some states. However, this approach is not universally embraced – most states refrain from public attribution, which in turn hinders the development of more comprehensive and strategic responses beyond a limited coalition of like-minded states.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disparities in national capacities and their impact:&lt;/strong&gt; The absence of clarity regarding whether states are unwilling or unable to effectively respond to malicious cyber incidents (or adhere to international commitments) complicates the assessment process. This uncertainty can lead to an over-reliance on assumptions, further impeding efforts to accurately evaluate state capabilities and willingness to address emerging cyber threats and norms implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-widening-the-lens-on-responsible-cyber-behaviour&quot;&gt;Conclusion: Widening the Lens on Responsible Cyber Behaviour&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has demonstrated that RCB extends beyond the parameters established by the UN. While the UN framework continues to play a critical role in shaping international discussions on cyber responsibility, it is only one part of a broader evolving landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following key insights emerged from this study:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RCB as a multidimensional concept:&lt;/strong&gt; Responsibility in cyberspace is not confined to legal obligations or diplomatic commitments within UN-led processes. Many states perceive responsibility through the lens of economic development, national resilience and CCB. The UN framework provides a foundation, but state practice indicates that cybersecurity is often framed in terms of economic security and domestic stability rather than purely in terms of international law.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The role of alternative norm-setting bodies:&lt;/strong&gt; Multilateral organisations such as the G7, the BRICS and ASEAN and regional cybersecurity frameworks play a crucial role in defining and reinforcing cyber norms. These organisations provide alternative venues for states to engage in cyber diplomacy, shape expectations around responsible behaviour and develop cooperative mechanisms outside the UN framework. The diversification of norm-setting spaces reflects both geopolitical realities (in other words renewed minilateralism) and the need for more flexible, context-specific approaches to cyber governance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operational responsibility and emerging norms:&lt;/strong&gt; Beyond the high-level diplomatic discourse, states demonstrate RCB through national policies, incident response practices and engagement with technical communities. While some states prioritise deterrence and attribution, others focus on discreet diplomatic and technical responses to cyber threats. The emergence of new policy discussions – such as pre-positioning cyber capabilities, commercial cyber intrusion and the role of private sector actors – illustrates the evolving nature of challenges facing RCB.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications-for-policymakers-and-researchers&quot;&gt;Implications for Policymakers and Researchers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As geopolitical dynamics continue to shift, tracking and analysing RCB beyond the UN will remain an essential task for ensuring diplomats and policymakers are equipped to negotiate diverging views on RCB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding RCB beyond the UN framework is crucial for both policymakers and scholars. Western governments must recognise the limitations and perceived biases of a UN-centric approach to cybersecurity, which may not fully capture the concerns of developing nations. For non-Western states, especially those in the Global South, acknowledging their own cyber practices and aligning them with broader international commitments can enhance their strategic positioning in global cyber governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, further research is needed in the following areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-Western perspectives on cyber responsibility:&lt;/strong&gt; More studies should explore how different cultural, economic and political contexts shape state approaches to RCB. This includes investigating how regional and national security policies integrate cyber responsibility in ways that differ from dominant Western perspectives in key areas including attribution, institutional setup and incident response. Examining how Global South nations define and implement cyber norms within their own strategic priorities will be key to fostering a more inclusive and representative cyber governance framework. However, there are thornier policy challenges ahead that merit further research: as countries such as China, Russia and others become more comfortable in conducting public cyber attribution against the US, for example, Western governments will need to reflect on how publicly naming and shaming – usually used as a negative accountability measure – can be instrumentalised against them. The emergence of non-Western attribution will put renewed pressure on the expected level of information shared in those attributions and the kinds of behaviours that are deemed unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The role of private sector actors:&lt;/strong&gt; Given their influence on cyber norms, the responsibilities of private companies to ensure international cybersecurity should be further examined. Many global technology firms play a dual role as both enablers and enforcers of cybersecurity measures. Their involvement in CCB, threat intelligence sharing and incident response demands greater scrutiny. Future research should focus on how private entities can be held accountable for their role in cybersecurity governance, shape the political economy of cybersecurity, and contribute to fostering RCB at an international level.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operational cyber responsibility:&lt;/strong&gt; A deeper assessment of how states justify and conduct cyber operations, including legal and ethical considerations, will be crucial for shaping how RCB is applicable to the design, conduct, approval and assessment of cyber operations, for example. This includes an exploration of how states define acceptable thresholds for cyber defence and retaliation, the legal frameworks governing cyber operations, and the impact of emerging cyber capabilities on national security. Additionally, research should examine how cyber operations intersect with human rights obligations and the role of oversight mechanisms in ensuring compliance with international law. Moreover, emerging practices such as pre-positioning – increasingly seen on the part of state-affiliated groups linked to China – pose a challenge to RCB, as they explore the fine line between tacitly acceptable practices (espionage) and cyber operations. It remains uncertain whether a norm will develop in this sphere or whether there will be a growing consensus rejecting the practice of pre-positioning. However, developments in this area will continue to present relevant tests to defining operational responsibility as it relates to states’ international commitments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incident response and cyber norms as RCB in practice:&lt;/strong&gt; While much of the existing research focuses on diplomatic and legal frameworks, there is a growing need to investigate how states respond to real world cyber incidents. Understanding how national CERTs, intelligence agencies and law enforcement bodies interact in the wake of cyberattacks will provide valuable insights into how cyber norms are operationalised. Future research should assess how best practices in cyber incident response contribute to broader international expectations of responsible behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The evolution of cyber norms in multilateral forums:&lt;/strong&gt; Beyond the UN, various international and regional organisations continue to shape discussions on RCB. Further research should examine how alternative forums – such as the OECD, ITU and regional cybersecurity initiatives – influence cyber governance. Investigating how these organisations establish new norms, enforce existing agreements and facilitate capacity building efforts will be essential for understanding the future trajectory of global cybersecurity cooperation in RCB, even if they do not employ the same terminology.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia’s drone campaign utilizes inexpensive Shahed drones to saturate Ukrainian air defenses and erode civilian morale through persistent nightly attacks. Originally Iranian made, these drones are now mass produced in Russia using Western electronics and essential Chinese components.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ukraine urgently requires layered, cost-effective air defenses, including high-energy laser systems, to counter drone saturation. Targeted long-range strikes on drone production and launch sites and disrupting China’s supply of critical electronics to Russia are essential steps.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia’s relentless use of low-cost drones signals a broader shift toward attrition warfare based on overwhelming air defense systems with sheer numbers. Western governments must innovate in economical defenses and tackle Chinese technology flows fueling Russian drone production.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia is using a punishment strategy to force Kyiv into negotiations designed to end the war and hamper Ukrainian sovereignty for the next generation. This approach increasingly relies on a single weapon: the Shahed drone. Originally imported from Iran but now mass produced in Russia using a mix of smuggled Western electronics and important Chinese parts, these low-cost attack drones cause millions of Ukrainians to wake up to the sound of air raid sirens every night. This terror campaign has lasted longer than the infamous Blitz aerial bombing of London during World War II and shows no signs of letting up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intensive use of these low-cost drones highlights the need to help Ukraine discover additional low-cost countermeasures that limit the ability of Russia’s punishment campaign. Specifically, European states and U.S. firms should work together to test new approaches to air defense that build on Ukrainian wartime innovations (e.g., acoustic sensors, an integrated air defense network, and improvised surface-to-air missiles) and emerging approaches that use electronic warfare and even high-energy lasers. Second, the U.S. military should catalogue these efforts and use them to accelerate its own thinking about layered air defense in future conflicts, which will almost certainly see a mix of cruise missiles and ballistic missiles attacking alongside waves of one-way attack drones. In these fights, point airfield defense and mobile counter–unmanned aircraft systems will not be enough to counter drone saturation designed to break air defense systems and open attack lanes for more exquisite weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brief proceeds by analyzing Shahed attack trends during the Ukraine war. Understanding these trends highlights three policy options for both helping defend Ukraine and reducing the ability of Russia’s punishment strategy with low-cost drone attacks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Testing and fielding new high-energy lasers to add an additional layer to Ukraine’s air defense network.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Increasing long-range strikes against Shaheed production, supply, and launch points.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Countering the flow of Chinese electronic components to Russian weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;drone-saturation-cost-effective-attrition-warfare&quot;&gt;Drone Saturation: Cost-Effective Attrition Warfare&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s dependence on Shaheds is based on attrition logic: Each drone costs approximately $20,000–$50,000, whereas even a single modern surface-to-air missile (SAM) battery or interceptor missile can cost several hundred thousand dollars. Russia has tolerated high loss rates—often losing more than 75 percent of its drones—in an effort to gradually overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses. Conversely, Ukraine’s ability to scale up interceptors, radar networks, and point-defense systems has helped maintain a favorable cost-exchange ratio, although this has depleted expensive Western-supplied interceptors. Consequently, Ukraine has increasingly relied on electronic warfare tactics, prioritizing reducing drone accuracy rather than direct interception owing to the sheer number of Shaheds launched each night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The net result is drone saturation. It doesn’t matter if an individual Shahed hits its target. What matters is the compound effect the terror weapon has on civilians and the stress it places on air defenses. By saturating the skies with low-cost weapons, Moscow wages an attritional campaign targeting both the will of the Ukrainian people and the readiness of its air defense network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting in September 2024, Russia significantly ramped up its use of Shahed drones, increasing from approximately 200 launches per week to more than 1,000 per week by March 2025 as part of a sustained pressure campaign. Initially designed in Iran, Shahed drones are now manufactured by Russia using engines from various sources, including China. The Russian company Alabuga has contracted with Iran for Shahed drone deliveries. Recent reports indicate that Russia significantly increased its manufacturing capability, particularly at the IEMZ Kupol facility, and has developed an advanced version of the Shahed drone: the Shahed-238 Loitering Munition. These versions likely include a mix of software-defined radios and other guidance systems that make them more difficult to jam. Russia has also started to explore methods for increasing the “punishment” value of each Shahed strike, including adding tungsten balls and lacing components with toxic agents to maximize civilian harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also indications that Russia is set to expand its mass production of low-cost, long-range attack drones and add new variants. There are reports that China is manufacturing Garpiya-3 drones for Russia, which have a 2,000 kilometer (1,200 mile) range with a 50 kilogram (110 pound) payload. Moscow has also started production of a jet-powered variant of the Shahed, the Geran3, which has a range of 2,500 kilometers (1,533 miles) and can travel at speeds up to 550–600 kilometers per hour, making it much harder to intercept. These systems will allow Russia to increase its number of attacks while at the same time making it harder for Ukraine to shoot down every attack drone. Absent additional support to Ukrainian air defenses and new approaches to cutting off the flow of components used to mass produce attack drones, the net result could tip the war in Moscow’s favor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shahed-launches-in-ukraine-war&quot;&gt;Shahed Launches in Ukraine War&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to data released by the Ukrainian Air Force, Shahed drone launches have intensified significantly throughout the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/v20Ioea.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data reveals notable patterns:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting in September 2024, Shahed drone launches escalated sharply. Before this period, the average weekly launch rate was around 130. Within six months, the rate peaked at approximately 1,100 launches per week. This indicates that Russia effectively scaled both launch and production capacities within a short time frame.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite Ukraine’s continued success in intercepting or neutralizing these drones with electronic warfare methods, the relentless pressure of Shahed attacks constitutes a clear attrition strategy. The weekly number of successful drone hits reached approximately 110, nearly 10 times higher than the previous year’s average. This indicates that increased launch intensity directly contributes to heightened damage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/fKAf0DQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: Launch Locations of Shahed Drones.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Ukrainian Air Force; CSIS Futures Lab.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Primorsko-Akhtarsk in Krasnodar Krai is the primary launch site (312 launches), underscoring the strategic importance of the southern front and the Black Sea corridor targeting infrastructure in the Odesa region. Crimea’s Chauda airfield (160 launches) complements this southern axis, allowing drones to circumvent Ukraine’s western air-defense systems. Additionally, oblasts bordering Ukraine—Kursk (248 launches), Bryansk (113), and Oryol (130)—serve as proximate launch points targeting the Donbas and Kharkiv regions, while Millerovo (100) and Yeysk (37) reinforce pressure on eastern targets. The extensive range of launch locations complicates Ukrainian air-defense targeting efforts, forcing allocation of scarce precision-strike and electronic warfare resources over a wide area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past seven months, there has not been a single uninterrupted three-day period without a Shahed drone launch. Salvos have occurred nearly every other day. Overall, 75 percent of Shahed launches have occurred on consecutive days (see Table 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-strategy-of-constant-pressure&quot;&gt;A Strategy of Constant Pressure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s Shahed drone campaign illustrates the changing nature of aerial warfare in an era dominated by inexpensive, mass-produced unmanned systems. For most of the twenty-first century, the focus of aerial attack has been on precision. States use integrated global battle networks to find, fix, track, target, and assess strikes. Entire concepts of joint fires and targeting have evolved, largely driven by a mix of U.S., Russian, and Chinese military theory that emphasize waves of precision strike. In Russian writing, these ideas have tended to include more of a focus on striking critical infrastructure that speaks to a counter value (e.g., civilian targets) and not just a counter force (e.g., military targets). This approach is consistent with what Robert Pape referred to as a punishment strategy in his seminal book Bombing to Win. Seen in relation to competitive strategy, the logic is one of cost imposition, albeit focused more on civilian pressure points than critical military targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, nightly waves of Shaheds produce a secondary effect of military value. Even if the low-cost attack drones are easy to intercept, they force the defender to spend limited defense resources to intercept them. That is, the attacks impose costs not just on Kyiv’s leaders through popular pressure but also through attriting air defense assets. The net result is that Ukraine and its backers must find a way to change the cost calculus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key insight for defense analysts and strategists is that survival against large-scale drone saturation attacks requires a comprehensive, multi-layered defensive approach. This involves balancing the economic costs of attrition warfare with adaptable defense strategies. In other words, the theory of victory is lowering the cost of intercepting long-range, cost-effective attack drones like the Shahed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To a large extent, Ukraine has developed ingenious solutions, many of which are linked to wartime innovation efforts run by its Digital Ministry, that lower the cost of intercept. First, Ukraine has fielded a network of tens of thousands of acoustic sensors to detect and track drones. Second, Ukraine has effectively built a common operating system called DELTA that allows it to track attacks and coordinate responses. By fusing data on attack drones with radar coverage and what frequencies systems are using, Kyiv can better allocate a mix of defense measures ranging from deploying mobile anti-aircraft teams to electronic attack and even aerial intercepts using light attack propeller planes. Other measures have included releasing small attack drones from high-altitude balloons and even custom, low-cost interceptor drones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, for all the battlefield innovations, the rate of Shahed attacks keeps increasing. As a result, new methods to combat drone saturation are needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-test-and-field-new-defeat-measures&quot;&gt;1. Test and Field New Defeat Measures&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the sheer volume of low-cost, long-range attack drones, Ukraine needs to develop new approaches to protecting its skies. To complement its existing command and control system and network of mobile defense teams, Kyiv should work with partners in the United States and Europe to test and field high-energy lasers to counter drone saturation attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are large number of high-energy lasers on the market. RTX makes a 50-kilowatt laser mounted on U.S. Stryker combat vehicles (DE M-SHORAD) as well a smaller road mobile 10 kilowatt laser called the H4. This system would align well with the mobile air defense teams Ukraine already uses to hunt Shaheds. There are also palletized options, like BlueHalo’s LOCUST, that can be quickly moved to adapt to Russian targeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also larger systems that could be integrated with urban power grids. Lockheed Martin manufactures the HELIOS, a 60-kilowatt laser that can be installed on ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other countries also have candidate high-energy weapons that could support defending Ukrainian cities, including the United Kingdom, Turkey (through Aselsan), and Germany (through Rheinmetall), the latter of which has successfully tested a 50-kilowatt laser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine presents a win-win opportunity. These firms need battlefield tests of their systems to further refine them. Every Russian low-cost, long-range attack drone shot down with a high-energy laser makes Ukrainian cities safer and sends a clear message to other coercive states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-increase-long-range-strikes&quot;&gt;2. Increase Long-Range Strikes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best place to destroy a Shahed is on the ground. From factories where the drones are assembled to storage and launch facilities, there are multiple points Ukraine could hold at risk to decrease the number of Shahed attacks. Ukraine has demonstrated its ability to conduct long-range strikes against Russian logistics networks and airbases. These attacks could be complemented by cyber operations that reduce the rate of production, creating, in effect, virtual attrition. They can also involve covert action against the supply chain, a technique recently tried against Russian first-person view (FPV) drone components. In other words, Kyiv needs a campaign for targeting the entire system that produces, launches, and targets Shahed attacks daily that links kinetic and non-kinetic effects as well as conventional and unconventional methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-counter-the-flow-of-components&quot;&gt;3. Counter the Flow of Components&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a role for economic policy. The United States can work with European states to finally hold Chinese firms accountable for their support to Russia’s war machine. Earlier in the war, Moscow used sanctions-evading networks of shell companies and third-country trading to import the electronics needed to build long-range precision strike systems. Now, that market has shifted to China. The Main Intelligence Directorate of Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense has identified 200 component parts made in China that fuel Moscow’s punishment campaign. These include critical Controlled Reception Pattern Antennas (CRP) in the Shahed as well as onboard computers used for multiple classes of drones and Kinzhal ballistic missiles. Furthermore, since late 2023, Russia has been using Chinese technology for engines in its long-range attack drones. While the United States and European states cannot stop the flow of technological components, they can take steps to make it more costly, including launching investigations, levying sanctions, and freezing assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-weaponized-cost-imposition-and-the-future-of-air-defense&quot;&gt;Conclusion: Weaponized Cost Imposition and the Future of Air Defense&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s Shahed campaign is more than a series of drone strikes—it’s a warning shot about the future of war. In this new battlespace, coercive states don’t need precision to win. They need volume, velocity, and the willingness to deploy cheap systems to break expensive defenses and the will of a populace to resist. The Shahed is not just a drone—it is a coercive instrument in a broader punishment strategy aimed at draining Ukrainian resolve and testing the limits of Western support. It’s a slow grind, a war of wear and will, where the cost of each intercept slowly shifts the burden from offense to defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For defense planners and policymakers, the lesson is clear: Surviving drone saturation attacks in the age of autonomy and attrition requires more than exquisite systems and intermittent aid packages. It requires a full-spectrum approach—high-energy lasers for point defense, deeper strikes against production nodes, and a concerted campaign to cut the technological lifelines that connect Chinese components to Russian launch rails. Ukraine’s battlefield improvisation has bought time. What’s needed now is a strategic shift—one that builds layered, resilient, and economically sustainable air defenses while targeting the industrial ecosystems that power drone warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, every Shahed in the sky is a signal. They signal a new phase of military competition—one defined not by singular decisive blows, but by the persistent erosion of capacity and will. The challenge for democracies is to adapt faster than their adversaries escalate. Because if war is ultimately a test of systems—political, economic, and military—then the side that learns faster, fields smarter, and fights cheaper will shape the future battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

As allies shoulder a growing conventional burden, they want to ensure US extended deterrence commitments remain.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, several U.S. allies have expressed a growing interest in developing independent nuclear programs. This trend could reflect a combination of factors, such as geostrategic uncertainty, growing regional tensions, and questions about the credibility of U.S. security guarantees over time. The United States has dedicated significant effort to preventing the spread of nuclear weapons to new possessors for much of the nuclear age and has successfully utilized extended deterrence to dissuade allies from succumbing to proliferation pressures. While U.S. allies have expressed interest in developing their own nuclear weapons before, the United States has historically gone to significant lengths to prevent allied proliferation. Today, U.S. allies in Europe are once again experiencing regional security pressures and fears of U.S. abandonment, both of which have historically motivated interest in proliferation. Yet, by and large, allied leaders have still caveated public preparations for a revised transatlantic relationship with the sentiment that the status quo of cooperation with the United States is preferable to its alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To explore this phenomenon, CSIS’s Project on Nuclear Issues (PONI) gathered a range of views on allied priorities and preferred outcomes for U.S. extended deterrence, modernization, and arms control efforts across a series of workshops with both U.S. and European experts during the winter of 2024–25. The workshops utilized an alternative futures methodology, developing four scenarios that covered a range of adversary capabilities and cooperation along with variations in NATO cohesion. Accompanying the four core scenarios were two “black swan” scenarios, one in which Russia used nuclear weapons and another where there was a change of political leadership in Moscow. The workshops captured strategic objectives and arms control priorities for U.S. allies across the scenarios, providing a robust look at what U.S. allies want and why the current transatlantic relationship is a more desirable outcome than other options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some allies feel compelled to consider alternatives to U.S. extended deterrence, they do not want to pursue nuclear proliferation unless they feel there is no choice. Instead, allies prefer a continued close relationship with the United States underpinned by the guarantee of U.S. extended nuclear deterrence while Europe assumes a greater burden for conventional deterrence. Continued U.S. extended deterrence commitments mean European defense investments can focus on complimenting, rather than replacing, U.S. capabilities, allowing Europe to maximize the efficiency of its investments and avoid accidentally convincing the United States it can afford to withdraw from Europe entirely. At the same time, some allies feel domestic pressure to support and pursue nuclear disarmament, which has stark implications for how these states balance arms control and deterrence priorities. On the one hand, many allies welcome continued U.S.-Russia engagement on arms control and nuclear risk reduction; on the other, arms control agreements or negotiated ends to the war in Ukraine that indicate rapprochement between Washington and Moscow or otherwise undermine the security of Europe could be strongly discouraged. Workshop participants were broadly in agreement on these two key points. It is important to caveat at the outset that allies are not monolithic and that views on specific issues vary across the alliance and within the states themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper will proceed in three parts, considering in turn the three defining categories of the transatlantic nuclear relationship: extended deterrence, nuclear modernization, and arms control. While allies are exploring options for taking on greater responsibility for deterrence, maintaining close military and political ties with the United States remains a top priority. Increased European strategic autonomy should not be mistaken for a breakdown in transatlantic relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;extended-deterrence&quot;&gt;Extended Deterrence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clearer U.S. signaling is on extended deterrence in Europe, the more confident Europe can be in shouldering a higher conventional burden for regional defense. European strategic stability is dependent on NATO having a coherent force structure. NATO allies have spent much of the last several years discussing where the deterrence gaps in the current nuclear force structure are. These gaps have both nuclear and conventional dimensions. NATO allies have continued to debate how NATO’s nuclear mission could be modestly expanded and improved. Meanwhile, the war in Ukraine has accelerated posture adaptations to plug conventional deterrence gaps. For example, the public release of NATO’s Integrated Air and Missile Defense Policy in early 2025 builds on previous statements from the Vilnius and Washington summits and indicates the alliance’s prioritization of air and missile defense, particularly on its eastern border. If the United States is to enact its goal to empower Europe to take ownership of conventional deterrence, Europe will need clarity regarding U.S. nuclear commitments in order to commit to owning most of the conventional deterrence burden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearer, more consistent political signals and renewed U.S. extended deterrence commitments will give Europe more flexibility in allocating resources toward its own defense. Strong U.S. extended deterrence engenders confidence in assessing what future European capabilities will need to achieve and allows states to more authoritatively specialize and maximize comparative advantages across the European defense industry. Continued diplomatic signaling that the nuclear powers of Europe, France and the United Kingdom, want to retain the transatlantic partnership with the United States, combined with acquisition plans that generate a European ability to enhance, rather than replace, U.S. extended deterrence in the region, would give the cooperative, enhanced status-quo approach the greatest chance for success. This approach carefully balances the risk of prompting U.S. disengagement—whether from insufficient burden-sharing on one side or from signaling that U.S. assistance is no longer needed or wanted on the other. European politicians leaning into abandonment fears to motivate defense spending will need to balance such statements with signals favoring transatlantic cooperation. The current approach taken by Paris and London, which have both signaled readiness to bear a larger defense burden while supporting U.S. involvement in a negotiated settlement to the war in Ukraine, may prove to be an ideal model for other allies to emulate. For example, the 30-plus members of the coalition of the willing could serve as the ideal vehicle to demonstrate that Europe is “willing to step up and support the U.S. and Ukraine to achieve a just and lasting peace.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until the Trump administration begins to publish strategy documents like the Nuclear Posture Review, allies may base their perception of their relationship with the United States, and therefore the United States’ credibility as an ally, on statements from members of the administration. These statements—such as Vice President JD Vance’s comments at the Munich Security Conference in February 2025 or the widely publicized Signal exchange in which several administration officials accuse Europe of free riding on defense issues—have generated anxiety among members of the alliance, leading to growing speculation in Europe that U.S. extended deterrence commitments are unreliable. Ambiguous U.S. political commitments have already had tangible effects beyond the political uncertainty they have generated, with France spending €1.5 billion to reopen one of its nuclear air bases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European allies therefore want a clarification of U.S. extended deterrence commitments for more than just a feeling of security: Without knowing what capabilities, personnel, and policies will stay and which will disappear, Europe cannot develop a coherent strategy regarding which U.S. capabilities to compliment and which to replace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;modernization&quot;&gt;Modernization&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alliance needs to follow through on defense improvements, and failure to execute modernization plans across the alliance risks inflating adversary confidence regarding capabilities to survive retaliation or giving the perception that aggression might go unpunished altogether. In the nuclear realm, allies want the United States to follow through on its nuclear modernization programs, and major discrepancies between what is proposed and what is acquired sends the wrong signal about U.S. commitment to the alliance. Furthermore, failure to augment the nuclear posture of the United States or NATO may invite aggression by adversaries. Strategic planners must assume that adversaries see allied modernization plans and develop their own systems accordingly, meaning significant delays in U.S. nuclear modernization may invite the perception among adversaries that U.S. capabilities or commitments are lacking or not credible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, U.S. modernization efforts are directly linked to allied capabilities in certain instances. Nuclear weapons cooperation between the United States and the United Kingdom fostered by the 1958 US-UK Mutual Defense Agreement (MDA) will continue in the next generation of ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs), with common launchers, missiles, and aeroshells and separate but parallel warhead designs under development for the Columbia (United States) and Dreadnought (United Kingdom). The 2024 indefinite extension of the MDA included an amendment that ensured the sharing of information, nuclear material, or equipment would continue in the event the United States or the United Kingdom decided to terminate the agreement. While this largely insulates the agreement from political challenges, it is less reassuring in the event of modernization delays or failures. While these challenges have prompted some allied experts to consider alternatives, cooperation with the United States remains a more favorable path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States, and the alliance more broadly, would benefit from widening the variety of nuclear options available to the alliance in order to further complicate Russian strategic planning. U.S. allies recognize an imbalance between Russia and NATO in theater-range systems and encourage U.S. modernization efforts to play a role in filling that gap. Similarly, allies could undertake modest expansions of their nuclear arsenals to complement existing capabilities, such as the reintroduction of an air leg to UK nuclear forces. Several capabilities were repeatedly mentioned in workshops as priorities to develop and integrate into the alliance: an improved standoff capability, intermediate-range ground-launched ballistic missiles in the European theater, and an expanded number of countries participating in the NATO Dual-Capable Aircraft (DCA) nuclear-sharing mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alliance-wide modernization will similarly need to strike the balance between two extremes: On the one hand, it must go far enough to plug critical deterrence gaps; on the other, it must avoid overcorrecting to the point that it manifests the very credibility concerns it looks to solve. A modest expansion of UK and French nuclear forces to supplement U.S. extended deterrence may strike this balance. Such an expansion could take place within existing structures and would not need to be accompanied by a complete overhaul of the software that governs the alliance’s nuclear weapons. Furthermore, this expansion could be much smaller in number and more tailored in purpose, avoiding the perception that Europe may no longer need to rely on U.S. extended deterrence guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;arms-control&quot;&gt;Arms Control&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one participant noted, arms control exists to codify the strategic balance between its parties through limiting destabilizing activities and systems and promoting confidence in the balance through monitoring and verification practices. European allies largely do not find the current nuclear and conventional balance on the continent comfortable, citing the expanding Russian defense industrial base and Russia’s existing advantage in theater-range nuclear systems. Indeed, some find repeated Russian violations of its arms control commitments evidence that it is sprinting toward a new strategic balance tilted in its own favor. For that reason, some European allies would likely not support an arms control agreement that they believe limits the credibility of U.S. extended deterrence commitments to Europe or Europe’s ability to execute an independent nuclear deterrent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European attitudes on arms control are consistent with their historical positions: Eastern European states are deeply skeptical of the value of negotiating with Russia more generally, Northern European states are more supportive, and the United Kingdom and France largely welcome arms control so long as it does not infringe upon their sovereign nuclear forces. Regarding conventional forces, some European experts favored either delaying any pursuit of conventional arms control until its conventional rearmament is sufficiently complete or pursuing an agreement that allows a controlled ramp-up of conventional forces. Conventional arms control was met with mixed enthusiasm. Some experts believed Europe’s pursuit of specific conventional systems Russia has expressed concerns over, like missile defense and conventional long-range precision strike, would be a boon for arms control in Europe. Other participants noted that those systems are too valuable to Europe and that many allies would not be comfortable negotiating limits on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the workshop discussions, there was a general aversion to an agreement on nuclear arms control that harmed the credibility of U.S. extended deterrence guarantees or otherwise froze the nuclear balance in a favorable way for Russia, even if that arms control allowed for further allied buildup. For example, some European experts in the workshops cautioned against such “performative arms control” that would impose a warhead ceiling higher than New START limits, as it would likely not limit Russian nonstrategic systems that threaten Europe, nor would it likely contain rigorous verification mechanisms that generate confidence in the alliance about the size, distribution, and makeup of the Russian arsenal. Workshop participants were relatively unanimous in the perception that any nuclear arms control agreement must take Russian nonstrategic nuclear weapons into account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some European allies see the collapse of arms control in Europe as a symptom of Russia’s war in Ukraine, in turn weakening their desire to entertain a return to arms control out of concern that it will not prevent future Russian aggression. This has generated skepticism in the utility of arms control as a tool and Russia’s reliability as an arms control partner in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has also demonstrated the military value of weapons limited by arms control agreements, such as antipersonnel mines and cluster munitions, forcing some participants to consider whether Europe needs to leave arms control agreements to maximize its ability to resist Russia in and around Ukraine. Since the conclusion of the workshops, a number of Baltic states have announced their intention to no longer comply with the Ottawa Convention banning antipersonnel landmines, and Lithuania has withdrawn from the Cluster Munition Convention, indicating this challenge is no longer purely hypothetical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workshop participants were split on whether arms control, in its current form, has a future. Arms control still plays a valuable role in preventing the further expansion of the war in Ukraine; Russia’s decision to provide the United States with advance warning of its use of Oreshnik ballistic missiles in Ukraine demonstrates that there are still slivers of the existing nuclear order that all parties find valuable and worth protecting. Furthermore, some allied countries contain large and vocal publics that consistently apply internal arms control and disarmament pressures, meaning the preservation of existing arms control structures may be more politically appealing to some allied governments than others. At the same time, some participants feared that demonstrating an attachment to those remaining pieces of the nuclear order would simply signal to Russia where it still has leverage over the West and that the nuclear order was worth sacrificing if it meant Europe and the United States could deter Russia free of political constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. allies in Europe face a paradox. While the United States has signaled that it remains committed to NATO and its partnerships in Europe “full stop,” those same assurances have recently come with caveats that the United States “will no longer tolerate an imbalanced relationship which encouraged dependency.” At the same time, Europe must find a way to strike a balance between shouldering an increased burden while making sure it does not go so far as to enable a self-fulfilling prophecy of a total U.S. withdrawal from the region. While allies may possess different visions for how to best achieve this balance, continued cooperation across the Atlantic is still widely preferred to its alternatives. Discussions on how to ensure this cooperation continues in the face of political and security pressures has renewed debates within the alliance about the future of arms control, nuclear modernization, and U.S. extended deterrence commitments, and while there remains a great deal of debate regarding the specifics of each, there also remains significant trade space for cooperation and compromise before allies begin to consider alternatives to transatlantic cooperation. Nevertheless, incentives for continued cooperation cannot be taken for granted, and listening to and considering the priorities of its allies remains in the national security interests of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea is a middle power in the Indo-Pacific region that has been seeking to articulate a global role through partnerships with like-minded countries, including the UK. In November 2023, South Korea and the UK signed the Downing Street Accord (DSA) that promised to raise their bilateral ties “to the highest level of strategic ambition, to endure for this century and beyond”. The relevance of the UK–South Korea bilateral partnership is clarified by common challenges to the rules-based international order as manifested by the growing influence of illiberal states and their undemocratic behaviours, such as Russia’s aggression against Ukraine. Such developments have further led to the strengthening of illicit ties between Moscow and Pyongyang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against such a backdrop, the political turmoil in Seoul that began in December 2024 with the short-lived martial law declaration by ousted president Yoon Suk Yeol creates uncertainties not only for its domestic politics, but also for its foreign policy projection. The purpose of this Policy Brief is to situate UK–South Korea ties in the context of Seoul’s larger strategy and outline the implications of South Korea’s global vision for its relationship with the UK. Despite South Korea’s political embroilment, enhancing the UK–South Korea partnership is important because the two countries complement each other – Seoul’s aspirations to increase its capacity as an important global stakeholder remains unwavering, while Westminster continues to expand its engagement with the rising Indo-Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Policy Brief examines South Korea’s foreign policy trajectory and its relevance for the UK. The research is based on a review of key official documents and speeches released by former South Korean administrations to understand Seoul’s global vision. It briefly outlines the historical development of South Korea’s ambitions as a growing middle power and how Seoul pursues its goals. It goes on to argue that the UK should extend its efforts to strengthen the bilateral ties that will also promote its own global status in the Indo-Pacific. The brief concludes with practical policy recommendations for enhancing UK–South Korea cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;south-korea-as-a-global-middle-power&quot;&gt;South Korea as a Global Middle Power&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea’s goal of globalisation was set in the 1990s after achieving democratisation and economic development. Since then, every successive South Korean government, regardless of political complexion, has endorsed the mission to put itself forward as an active global stakeholder. From the 2000s, South Korea’s policy began to be branded as a “middle-power” diplomacy seeking an enhanced role in the world. By the early 2020s, Seoul described its heightened global status as “standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the G7”, with reference to two G7 summit invitations in 2020 and 2021. These narratives illustrate South Korea’s enthusiasm to play a role in global ordering institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most recently, the Yoon administration carried this mission further and actively promoted the vision of South Korea becoming a Global Pivotal State (GPS) and set this as one of six key policy goals. Compared to the previous middle-power diplomacy, Yoon’s GPS concept projected Seoul’s aspiration to be not merely a “middle” power but a “pivotal” one, carrying greater global influence. Prior to assuming office, Yoon’s presidential transition committee announced its 110 key policy tasks, of which one was to strengthen a role as a GPS that befits a country’s elevated status, thus becoming an “influential power rather than one being influenced by others”. To this end, the Yoon administration released two policy documents (the Indo-Pacific Strategy and the National Security Strategy), elaborating Seoul’s revitalised global ambitions and the strategic objectives required to play such roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GPS goal was pursued through a two-track approach. First, it enhanced strategic partnerships with like-minded partners based on shared values. As an Asian democracy with a developed economy, South Korea strengthened ties with those who share such values – the US, Australia, Japan and European countries. Second, Seoul increased its engagement with the Global South by enhancing its development assistance capacity. In recent years, its official development assistance budget each year has been the largest on record, marking $3.94 billion in 2025. South Korea aims to become a top 10 donor country by 2026 and is reaching out to different corners of the world, including Africa, Southeast Asia and the Pacific, seeking to play a global role extending beyond the scope of its traditional foreign policy, which was limited to the Korean Peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;seouls-indo-pacific-strategy-more-than-a-regional-framework&quot;&gt;Seoul’s Indo-Pacific Strategy: More than a Regional Framework&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When its region began to be reframed from “Asia-Pacific” to “Indo-Pacific”, South Korea was initially hesitant to embrace the new concept. Although it had been advocated by the first Trump administration and others in the region since the mid-2010s, the administration of then-president Moon Jae-in maintained an ambiguous position as the idea of the free and open Indo-Pacific began to imply a growing US–China rivalry. Instead, Seoul sought to walk a fine line between its ally and largest trading partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While acknowledging the regional developments based on the new framework, South Korea laid out its own New Southern Policy (NSP) aimed at enhancing ties with Southeast Asia and India. The NSP allowed Seoul to continue its Asia-Pacific rhetoric and cooperate with regional stakeholders on its own terms. It was only in May 2021 that the term “Indo-Pacific” was officially endorsed by Seoul at the US–ROK summit under the Biden presidency, when the two countries agreed to “work to align the ROK’s New Southern Policy and the United States’ vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a political change from a progressive to a conservative government in May 2022, the Yoon administration announced Seoul’s Indo-Pacific Strategy (IPS) during the ASEAN–ROK Summit in November 2022, and the official document was published a month later. In accordance with the NSP, Seoul indicated its mindfulness of ASEAN centrality as emphasised in the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific when embracing the Indo-Pacific. Similar to other countries in the region, such as India and ASEAN member states, South Korea’s new strategy noted China as a cooperation partner, rather than framing the Indo-Pacific as part of an anti-China narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What differentiated Yoon’s IPS from Moon’s NSP and the Indo-Pacific strategies of other countries is that the IPS was a global rather than a regional strategy. It was at the centre of Seoul’s GPS ambitions and stretched beyond the geographic scope of the Indo-Pacific, promising to “work closely with Europe and Latin America”. It also embraced the universality of liberal values, vowing to “uphold international norms and strengthen a rules-based order built on universal values including freedom, democracy, the rule of law, and human rights”. This was central to Yoon’s foreign policy as its emphasis on values featured prominently in the country’s diplomatic overture towards like-minded states and organisations such as the UK, the G7 and NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-value-based-diplomacy-and-uksouth-korea-partnership&quot;&gt;A Value-Based Diplomacy and UK–South Korea Partnership&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea finds liberal democracy to be one of its defining national identities. Despite polarised domestic politics, liberal values such as freedom, democracy and human rights are embraced across all political spectrums. The Yoon administration took this a step further by placing such values at the heart of its foreign and security policies. In addition to the IPS, its National Security Strategy also placed significant emphasis on values. It pinned value-based diplomacy as one of the five “core strategic tenets”, and two of six strategic tasks laid out in the document were related to this theme: “conducting diplomatic cooperation grounded in freedom and solidarity” and “defending liberal democracy and contributing to global prosperity”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on such notion, Seoul has been strengthening its foreign and security relationships with like-minded partners, most notably the US and the UK. These relationships are enhanced through several bilateral and multilateral meetings, bolstered by new cooperation frameworks such as the Washington Declaration with the US and the DSA with the UK that have laid out cooperation in various sectors where South Korea has a competitive edge, such as cyber, economy, energy and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The partnership with the UK is of particular significance as the DSA is the only major framework that Seoul has established besides Washington, its only treaty ally. This illustrates the importance of the UK in Seoul’s foreign policy thinking, which deserves greater recognition and reciprocation. While cooperation with other regional like-minded partners, such as Australia and Japan, are deemed important and necessary, South Korea’s prioritisation of enhancing ties with the UK demonstrates its ambition to step up as a global actor, forging a “global strategic partnership” with a P5 (permanent UN Security Council member) and G7 member.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underscoring such significance, the UK should set out the areas of bilateral cooperation with South Korea that would assist the UK’s outreach to the Indo-Pacific, as well as accommodating Seoul’s engagement with Europe and NATO, which has expanded over recent years. Since 2022, when NATO began to increase its ties with like-minded Indo-Pacific countries amid deepening Russia–China ties, South Korea took part in every annual NATO summit and NATO–South Korea cooperation has rapidly developed. Seoul signed the Individually Tailored Partnership Programmes in July 2023, indicating a more concrete security cooperation. Moreover, South Korea became NATO’s first Asian partner to sign an agreement on mutual recognition for military airworthiness certification, and joined the Science &amp;amp; Technology Organization Partnership with the aim of enhancing military interoperability and collaborating in defence research. These developments are significant as Seoul deepens its defence engagement with Europe as a partner for defence manufacturing and procurement, as well as a model of maintaining powerful and efficient military power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;internal-and-external-challenges&quot;&gt;Internal and External Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK–South Korea partnership is faced by shared challenges both from within and outside. Yoon’s abrupt martial law declaration jeopardised both South Korea’s status as a mature democracy and its future policy orientations. While democratic processes that nullified the martial law – followed by Yoon’s impeachment – demonstrated the country’s democratic resilience and the rule of law, the future trajectory of Seoul’s foreign policy is still in question, particularly given the diverging foreign policy outlook held by different political groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too often Seoul lacks bipartisan foreign policy as political groups take different stances on its relationships with key partners such as the US, China and Japan. Under such circumstances, Yoon’s value-based diplomacy has been criticised by opposition parties. The first impeachment bill against Yoon drafted by the oppositions criticised Yoon’s value diplomacy, saying that it had “ignored geopolitical balance, provoked North Korea, China, and Russia, and pursued an unusual pro-Japan stance”. Instead, the oppositions argue that South Korea’s national interest is served best by pragmatic diplomacy that seeks to balance between the great powers, given geopolitical realities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his speech at the Korean Council on Foreign Relations, Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul argued, in defence of Seoul’s value diplomacy, that it is imperative for Seoul to “strengthen our solidarity with democratic nations to uphold universal values and the rules-based international order – both of which have helped the Republic of Korea come as far as it has today”. While acknowledging the internal foreign policy debate, Cho asserted that South Korea “must reduce swings in our foreign policy and be steadfastly consistent in our vision and our goals”. However, as the diverging views stem from fundamental differences in attitude towards the country’s important neighbours, questions remain regarding policy sustainability, as a leadership change is often followed by a dramatic turn in the country’s foreign policy orientation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A change in policy direction following a political change is also a feature of UK politics. The most recent change of government brought uncertainty about its engagement with the Indo-Pacific. In the Labour Party’s manifesto, there is no mention of the term “Indo-Pacific” and its primary prescription for “rebuilding [external] relationships” is with the EU, while the AUKUS partnership and the UK’s relationship with China are only briefly noted. It should be remembered that there had been scepticism over the sustainability of Britain’s Indo-Pacific tilt even during the Conservative government that initiated it. For the UK to strengthen its global relevance, particularly in the Indo-Pacific, the Labour government needs to reassure its regional partners that its engagement with the region will continue to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea and the UK are also faced with greater external challenges, particularly the prolonged effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which has led to a convergence of Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific security theatres. Since the outbreak of Russia’s aggression, Seoul has been providing humanitarian support to Ukraine, equipped other supporters of Ukraine with munitions and joined international sanctions against Russia. In turn, Moscow has sought external support, reaching out to Pyongyang. Since the signing of mutual military assistance from the Putin–Kim summit in June 2024, North Korea has deployed troops and munitions to the battlefront. Such illicit development of the alliance between the two illiberal states jeopardises the security of both Europe and the Korean Peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-recommendations-for-the-uk&quot;&gt;Policy Recommendations for the UK&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the UK, South Korea has become an emerging economic and security partner. The UK’s services exports to South Korea have more than doubled in current prices to £3.8 billion in 2023. According to the UK’s Department for Business and Trade, the two countries ranked as the 25th-largest trading partners to each other in 2024, indicating that there is potential for improvement. To this end, the ongoing negotiations to upgrade their free-trade agreement, signed shortly after Brexit in 2019, will help strengthen their economic interdependence. Their partnership has also been growing in the security realm, with increased joint military exercises and cooperation in the defence industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a major Indo-Pacific partner alongside other like-minded countries, such as Australia and Japan, Seoul’s rise as a middle partner capable of playing a greater global role is beneficial for the UK. South Korea will support upholding the rules-based international order, in which the UK’s national interests also lie. As the US now challenges the traditional international norms it had set since the end of the Second World War, cooperation with the Indo-Pacific is needed more than ever to uphold Britain’s regional and global interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, UK–South Korea cooperation supports the UK’s engagement with the Indo-Pacific by developing another key partnership that links Europe and the Indo-Pacific. Enhancing ties with regional partners helps to ease the region’s scepticisms over the UK’s interest and commitment, as well as answering calls for a more constructive engagement. It is therefore in the UK’s interest to continue supporting South Korea’s vision to play such an expanded role, with the UK as a key partner. Several practical policy recommendations can be made in this respect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the UK should be more proactive in developing the bilateral partnership with the South Korean government. It is therefore necessary for the UK to take the initiative in setting out a more ambitious bilateral agenda. In this respect, the UK’s response to Seoul’s political turmoil was adequate to reiterate the UK–South Korea global strategic partnership. To further these efforts, the UK should reappraise the DSA and take concrete steps to follow up on implementing promised cooperation frameworks that would prompt Seoul to reciprocate the commitment. The signing of the DSA demonstrated South Korea’s recognition of the UK as an important partner for its global ambition. Despite Seoul’s temporary leadership vacuum, the UK’s lead in reappraising the bilateral cooperation will reiterate the significance of the partnership and allow the UK to set priorities for bilateral cooperation with the next South Korean government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the UK should hold an ASEAN or Indo-Pacific Policy Dialogue with South Korea to pursue its cooperation mechanism with Southeast Asian countries in a more effective manner. When pursuing diplomacy with ASEAN member states, the UK should work with other regional partners to efficiently manage resources and maximise policy goals. South Korea serves as an ideal cooperation partner in this area as it has experience in holding these dialogues with like-minded partners such as Australia, the US and France, as well as trilateral dialogues with Australia, Japan and the US (US–Australia, US–Japan and Australia–Japan, respectively) to map out their respective Southeast Asia and Indo-Pacific policies and find areas of collaboration with each other and with ASEAN countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussing ASEAN and Indo-Pacific policies with Seoul will be a constructive channel for the UK to effectively distinguish areas where it can make a visible contribution without overlapping agendas with other regional stakeholders, which could overshadow the UK’s role, and continue its engagement with Southeast Asia as anticipated. Most countries in Southeast Asia are developing countries and thus a collaboration between the UK and South Korea can complement each country by bringing together their development cooperation experiences. The UK is a prominent donor nation, but its top aid recipients are mostly in Africa and the Middle East with only one Southeast Asian country in its top 20 destinations. On the other hand, South Korea’s top aid recipients in 2022 were ASEAN member states, with five of them listed in its top seven beneficiaries. Therefore, cooperation between the UK and South Korea in development assistance would be mutually beneficial as the UK’s knowhow in designing and implementing development programmes can be complemented by South Korea’s regional expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the UK can sponsor Seoul’s membership of an expanded G7. Since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, the G7 has become the most active and influential international organisation promoting democracy, freedom and a rules-based international order as the world becomes increasingly challenged by a bond between authoritarian governments and ongoing major conflicts in Europe and the Middle East. At a time when the UN Security Council is losing its effectiveness due to veto powers held by Russia and China, the stakes have become higher for the G7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea is a capable like-minded partner for G7 members and has participated in two of the most recent four G7 meetings – in the UK in 2021 and in Japan in 2023 – upon invitation by the host countries. Its failure to be invited in 2024 was criticised by South Korean opposition parties, indicating bipartisan aspirations to join the club. As seen in NATO’s increasing collaboration with Indo-Pacific partners, Seoul is ready to play a more constructive role in promoting a rules-based international order. As the solidarity of the group faces internal challenges following the return of the Trump administration, South Korea remains an ideal partner for alternative partnerships that could help leverage the possible internal friction within the G7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last, the UK should carefully consider the ways to involve South Korea in the AUKUS partnership. Whilst the pact remains a trilateral cooperation mechanism, working with other regional partners is essential as its goal is regional security. The joint statement from the 2+2 meeting between South Korea and Australia in 2024 noted that Seoul expressed its interest in the project as it “welcomed that the AUKUS countries are considering cooperation with additional partners on Pillar II”. The possibility of involving key regional partners including not just South Korea but also Japan, New Zealand and Canada in AUKUS Pillar 2 was confirmed in the third anniversary joint statement in September 2024. Up to now, rather than creating a constructive discourse, the lack of information on expanding the AUKUS partnership has caused confusion, with speculations and calls for JAUKUS (Japan) or CAUKUS (Canada). A more controlled dialogue with the existing AUKUS members will help to maximise the benefits of the partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea has attempted for decades to define itself in various ways on the global stage. In recent years, its bilateral and multilateral relationships with like-minded countries, and with the developing world, have deepened – demonstrating Seoul’s capacity to live up to its global goals. During this process, its elevated partnership with the UK has become a key anchor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the UK, its ambiguous stance on engagement with the Indo-Pacific concerns regional stakeholders as to whether its actions will follow its words. While the challenges in Europe may take priority, its overtures in the Indo-Pacific should not be overlooked. Moreover, supporting South Korea’s global vision can be constructive for European security, as Seoul increases its defence ties with the UK and other European partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its continuing political upheaval, South Korea is still an important global stakeholder. The UK should take advantage of this opportunity to step up its partnership with South Korea, even though there remain challenges from internal and external factors that hinder realising its full potential. The perennial challenge of North Korea’s nuclear and missile capabilities development, as well as its deepening ties with Russia, is alarming not only for South Korea, but for the global liberal international order. As Seoul seeks to enhance its global profile, the limitations to its domestic and international capacity could be supplemented by support from like-minded states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against such a backdrop, it would be in the interest of partners such as the UK to endorse and support Seoul’s quest to play a greater role on the global stage. In turn, South Korea’s enhanced global status and the increased responsibilities it will assume can complement the UK’s efforts to sustain the liberal international order.&lt;/p&gt;

This report distills 10 insights that will shape the next war.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine was the most violent seizure of sovereign European territory since World War II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the spring of 2025, CSIS military fellows worked with top resident defense experts to produce nonpolitical, actionable takeaways from the Russia-Ukraine War. Ukrainians, academics, industry leaders, and military professionals who have experienced and studied the war were brought together for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insights from this regional war have critical global relevance, as they will likely inform large-scale combat operations between great powers in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s nuclear threats impacted both the speed and scale of Western military support to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the invasion in February 2022, Putin readied strategic Russian nuclear forces and threatened the use of nuclear weapons to defend its territory (including Ukrainian territory captured during the invasion). Within this context, Western nations methodically provided Ukraine with more advanced and long-range systems, one system at a time. For example, British Storm Shadow missiles were not employed until May 2023, while U.S. Army Tactical Missile Systems were not provided until October 2023. U.S.-made F-16 aircraft were supplied to Ukraine in August 2024. By some accounts, nuclear war was only avoided by stern warnings from the U.S. national security advisor and a message from President Biden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russia-Ukraine War provides a successful model of how incremental military aid can keep warfare at the conventional, nonnuclear level. Incremental escalation—providing support and then pausing to gauge the Russian reaction before providing more advanced support—contributed to the absence of a nuclear detonation in this conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Innovation is about cycles. The speed at which adversaries complete cycles of gap detection, innovation, production, and testing impacts which side has a competitive advantage. The Russia-Ukraine War is a laboratory of such innovation and adaptation, especially in drones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the air, Ukraine’s use of cheap, expendable drones delivered precision weapons at scale. Costing several hundred to several thousand dollars each, Ukraine produced 1.5 million aerial drones in 2024, with a goal to triple that total in 2025. These drones provided surveillance and artillery adjustment, delivered kamikaze attacks on personnel and equipment, and even shot down other drones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine, a state without a navy, denied sea terrain access to a great power. Unmanned surface vessels like the Magura V5 were a game changer in the Black Sea. Built from modified jet skis, the Magura V5 sank or damaged several Russian warships. These sea drones, along with Ukrainian-built cruise missiles, contributed to Kyiv’s ability to export its agricultural products after Russia withdrew from the Black Sea Grain Initiative in July 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian forces matched Ukraine’s ingenuity on the battlefield. Their ability to adapt to new Ukrainian technology or tactics has improved remarkably since the war began and can now be measured in mere weeks. One example was their introduction of fiber-optic controlled drones, which circumvented Ukraine’s radio jamming advances while still matching their predecessors’ range and speed. As with most advancements in the war, this innovation was quickly adopted and subsequently improved by Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite rapid advances, the use of unmanned sea and aerial drones today is still an evolution, not a revolution, of warfare. Judged through the lens of defense offset strategy, a revolutionary advance would gain and maintain a significant advantage over adversaries over long periods of time. While innovative, the technological advancements gained through iteration provided battlefield advantage measured in days or even hours before the opponent adapted, thus making it evolutionary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future warfare will feature innovations that adapt as technologies evolve. Encrypted AI software in drones allowed Ukraine to maintain a technological advantage, as a simple firmware upgrade could provide enhanced capabilities without the need for new hardware. Gaining advantages without updating hardware speeds the cycles of innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the countless videos of drones destroying tanks in Ukraine, Ukrainian military leaders are adamant that tanks remain crucial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tanks with infantry do what air power, indirect fires, and drones cannot do alone: seize and hold terrain. This is often the chief objective of land warfare. Ukrainian Army Lieutenant Colonel Volodymyr Dutko noted that his soldiers “ignore tanks at high risk.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The skill of employment shapes the value of tanks. When Ukraine or Russia has committed tanks without infantry support, they became easy targets for drones and anti-tank weapons. During the 2024 invasion of Kursk, however, Ukrainian commanders used armored formations as part of a combined arms maneuver and held sovereign Russian territory for several months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For future warfare, tanks provide what future tech needs most: power. The Russian “Turtle Tanks” demonstrate how future tanks could offer a mobile and survivable platform that supplies power for electronic attack, electronic protection, and drones. The tanks of the next war might contribute to success as a mobile protected supporter that is difficult to stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scale of artillery exchanges in this war has exposed global shortages in conventional munitions. Getting limited resources to the front lines has impacted battlefield performance. At the beginning of the war, Ukraine’s state-owned defense agency, Ukroboronprom, was not able to deliver the equipment and supplies needed to effectively sustain military operations. War demands forced the rapid incorporation of foreign state and private industry equipment and technologies into the Ukrainian fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evolving tactics on the front line have required quick changes to increasingly expendable and autonomous unmanned system designs. This necessitates rapid, large-scale production of cutting-edge technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To maintain a technological and logistical edge, Ukraine has disaggregated drone maintenance and refitting into agile workshops dispersed across the frontline and embedded unmanned system engineers and technicians there. This has enabled rapid acquisition based on feedback and requirements directly from warfighters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very short design, construction, combat testing, and hardware/software revision cycles of dynamic acquisition create a competitive edge. Authorizing these decisions at lower levels and with less oversight incurs accountability and program sustainment risks but is necessary to innovate at the speed of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supplying the front lines is only possible if logistics systems are secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Russia has been able to employ munitions from North Korea and drones from Iran, Ukraine has received support from the United States, Europe, and other nations. Transportation infrastructure, including railways, roads, and ports, is vulnerable to kinetic and cyber threats. Commercial providers’ willingness and capacity to operate in conflict zones has proved unpredictable. Cross-nationally, customs and hazardous materials transport regulations, along with infrastructure limitations, also has impeded supply between allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional nodal concentration—large supply centers and transportation hubs—has proved vulnerable to long-range precision strikes. Ukraine’s cyber defense efforts, however, including a volunteer “Cyber Army,” have safeguarded logistics networks, while the rapid expansion of Ukraine’s “Army of Drones” has highlighted the potential of integrating commercial, military, and civilian innovation in wartime logistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future success in contested environments will depend not only on moving supplies but on mastering data, defending networks, and leveraging innovation across all domains. Future military logistics must also adopt a strategy of disaggregation—distributing assets to avoid targeting while maintaining the capability to rapidly reaggregate at the point of need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has leveraged AI-enabled software and data platforms to enhance its decisionmaking speed for warfare and governance—leading to lessons for kinetic, non-kinetic, and governance operations. Whoever has data superiority will gain an advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the battlefield, a powerful trio of AI-enabled software, satellite communications, and overhead imagery analysis has enabled the Ukrainian military to efficiently target and deliver kinetic fires. Rapid adaptation of data analysis has enabled rapid evolution in battlefield decisions for warfighting and logistics sustainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State, society, industry, and military units can now be connected directly and at speeds and scales previously unimaginable. Ukraine has created data tools to share tactical data from citizens and military units that bypass traditional government hierarchies. These tools visualize logistics, kinetic fires, emergency response, and even the scope of war crimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies have used radar imagery and data from commercial satellites to help Ukrainian civilians find evacuation routes and map power grid damage for restoration without dangerous surveys. The Ukrainian application Diia’s digital identification and passport system has helped displaced Ukrainians cross borders when physical documents are inaccessible. The Ukrainian tech industry recognizes it possesses several key niche capabilities for future warfare and foresees export opportunities in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russia-Ukraine War previews the future role of AI and data integration in warfare. Militaries gain advantages by creating a common platform for intelligence, operations, logistics, and planning functions; developing user-friendly systems to minimize training load; and granting authority to frontline forces to rapidly evolve tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Near-real-time commercial space capabilities have enabled a new level of battlefield transparency that is forcing changes in tactics on the ground. The Russia-Ukraine conflict has seen unprecedented integration of dual-use commercial space capabilities in warfare. These technologies have enabled Ukraine to gain an asymmetric advantage against Russia—evolving from strategic intelligence resources to critical tactical enablers. As Giorgi Tskhakaia noted, every six months, a new “game-changer” technology is presented on the battlefield, requiring adaptation and countermeasures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new elements of space warfare also have led to cross-domain implications. Russia has struggled to integrate space operations effectively and has been unable to deny Ukraine’s satellite communications. The failure to achieve spectrum superiority also has hindered Russia’s network-centric warfare capabilities and underscored the importance of resilient communications and electronic warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the collaboration between Russia and China in space operations, including sharing commercial imagery, signals a growing challenge to U.S. space security. Over the last 30 years, U.S. space domain superiority has allowed the United States to reduce its army, navy, and air force significantly. If neither side can secure the space domain in future wars, we can anticipate attritional trench line warfare like the Russia-Ukraine War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has persevered for over three years against a larger and more powerful adversary because of an outsized will to fight. When offered safe evacuation, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky replied, “The fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “will to fight” refers to the synthesis of psychological resilience, physical capability, and ideological conviction of a given side in conflict. While it is challenging to assess the will to fight before conflict, its effects have enormous repercussions on the course of warfare. Analysts underestimated the Ukrainian will to fight in 2022 and had been predicting rapid capitulation. Instead, Ukrainians have demonstrated profound psychological and ideological resilience, amplified by the reality of an existential threat to their homeland. The ability to sustain this will to fight depends on maintaining material support from the West and optimizing its few recruitable citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian soldiers’ will to fight has suffered repeated blows throughout the war, rooted in the failure to secure what seemed like a quick, guaranteed victory. Despite generous recruiting incentives to families in Russia’s struggling economy, Russia has needed to secure prisoner labor and North Korean soldiers to bolster its meatgrinder assaults. In 2024, desertion and drug use in the Russian military reached unprecedented levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All things being equal, the side with a stronger will to fight will persevere and succeed. But all things are not equal in warfare. Ukraine’s will to fight has compensated for shortfalls but might not last forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ongoing Russia-Ukraine War highlights the competitive advantages possible by integrating women into combat and support roles. Women possess unique skills and networks in society that can drive innovation and mobilize resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian women have been more active than Russian women in supporting and fighting the Russia-Ukraine War. As of 2023, more than 42,000 females were serving within the Ukrainian Army, compared with 1,100 Russian females on the front lines that same year. This disparity is shocking due to the demographic differences between the countries (Ukraine’s population is less than one-third of Russia’s) and because both militaries share a common Soviet heritage. During World War II, the Soviets gained a comparative advantage in population mobilization by integrating women into combat and support roles. This bolstered its population advantage against Nazi Germany, whose rigid ideology on gender roles precluded women in combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has embraced innovative changes to body armor and uniforms to optimize protection, functionality, and dignity for women serving in the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond serving as soldiers, Ukrainian women have contributed as humanitarian actors, community leaders, and providers for their families. Their effort contributes to a whole-of-society resilience that creates a deterrent effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Women in the armed forces and beyond enhance defense capability. For future warfare, nations that demonstrate a unified will to resist present a stronger deterrent against aggressors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has attracted international goodwill as the underdog, appealing to a diverse array of donors. This goodwill has led to support in many forms, from weaponry from Western nations to volunteers at the grassroots level. In contrast, following the opening days of the invasion, the UN accused Russia of war crimes, and the International Criminal Court indicted six Russian officials for war crimes in Ukraine. This created a general international view of Russia as the villain in the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western sanctions on Russia have limited the ability of Russia to sustain the war. Since 2023, Russia has expanded its outreach to China, Iran, and North Korea, trading unknown capabilities for additional war resources. Meanwhile, Ukraine has gained support due to a commonly held narrative that they are the victim of an invasion who refuses to give up. This has provided Ukraine with soft power. This dichotomy in the war narrative has resulted in Ukraine having additional options and Russia being constrained. The global equipment, money, and munitions support to Ukraine has enhanced its ability to fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In future warfare, the commonly understood story, supported by facts and events on the ground, will impact the amount of tangible support (or constraints) a side will receive from the international community. The way the United States is regarded by its allies and partners will influence the level of international commitment to future campaigns and impact the chances of success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insights from the Russia-Ukraine War are crucial lessons, but each war’s character differs based on the participants, along with their technology and political objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future conflicts will continue to be a contest of wills and skilled campaigners who use all tools at their disposal to achieve a relative and lasting advantage. Some of these insights can contribute to that advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2025, the Sanctions and Illicit Finance Monitoring and Analysis Network (SIFMANet), led by RUSI’s Centre for Finance and Security (CFS) and supported by the National Endowment for Democracy, held a roundtable workshop in Bucharest, Romania. The event explored the evolving challenges posed by sanctions implementation, economic security and state-driven threats. Hosted by Her Majesty Margareta, Custodian of the Romanian Crown, the event was organised in partnership with 45 North.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This meeting formed part of a wider series of country-specific engagements that SIFMANet has conducted since early 2022. The workshop brought together a diverse and highly engaged group of public and private sector stakeholders, academics, and financial specialists, including participants from the Romanian Financial Supervisory Authority, the National Authority for Management and Regulation in Communications of Romania (commonly known as ANCOM), and the Romanian National Agency for Public Procurement. The workshop also brought together Romanian banks, such as Banca Transilvania and UniCredit Bank, along with VISTA Bank (a Texas-based bank), and GARANTI BBVA (a Turkish bank). Financial agencies and academic institutions, such as the National Agency for Fiscal Administration (ANAF), Romania’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), the Romanian Customs Authority, and the Bucharest University of Economic Studies (ASE), also attended, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report presents insights and reflections from the Bucharest workshop, as well as side meetings, including a discussion with a group of members of the Romanian parliament. The report offers a grounded overview of Romania’s progress and challenges in navigating sanctions, illicit finance and economic security. While none of the discussions at the event are attributable, the lessons drawn from them contribute to a growing body of knowledge on how smaller EU economies can respond effectively to the threats posed by hostile state actors and financial exploitation, and respond to the changing European sanctions landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sanctions&quot;&gt;Sanctions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;background-romanias-evolving-sanctions-framework&quot;&gt;Background: Romania’s Evolving Sanctions Framework&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, Romania has undergone a significant legislative overhaul to modernise its sanctions framework. The reforms aimed to address enforcement challenges and align the legal system with the operational needs of both regulators and the private sector. A key milestone was the adoption of a revised legal package in December 2024, which introduced clearer mandates, more structured coordination and improved enforcement mechanisms. According to a representative of the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), additional amendments are underway to transpose the EU Directive on the criminalisation of sanctions evasion into national law by the May 2025 deadline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need for reform became particularly urgent after 2022, when the complexity and volume of sanctions outpaced Romania’s existing institutional capacity. Previously, implementation responsibilities were distributed based on authorities’ broader legal mandates. As noted by a representative of a Romanian public authority, this decentralised and implicit approach became increasingly untenable, as sanctions enforcement required cross-sectoral coordination and timely decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response, the Romanian government formally designated 18 competent authorities across different sectors, each with clearly defined responsibilities for sanctions implementation and enforcement. Particular attention was given to the management of derogations, one of the most technically and legally challenging areas of sanctions enforcement. In situations where jurisdictional overlap or disputes arise, the MFA can notify the Interinstitutional Council, a forum that reunites all implementing authorities as well as a series of other institutions providing support in their area of competence. Upon said notification, the interinstitutional council will designate the competent authority to issue an authorisation through a vote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This restructuring marks a shift towards a more rules-based and proactive enforcement model, aimed at enhancing Romania’s ability to meet EU standards and respond to emerging geopolitical threats with greater institutional clarity and coherence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the workshop, a representative from the MFA highlighted the continued relevance of sanctions as a critical policy instrument in the country’s response to Russian aggression. Instead of introducing an independent national sanctions regime, Romania chose to promote its sanctions demarches at EU level by playing an active role in shaping EU restrictive measures. The MFA has seen notable changes in its responsibilities, reflecting the growing complexity of sanctions enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ministry’s current mandate spans three primary functions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Policy leadership:&lt;/strong&gt; The MFA acts as Romania’s representative at EU-level negotiations on restrictive measures. In this capacity, it promotes Romania’s interests and proposals directly in Brussels, shaping the design of the EU sanctions framework, given the absence of a domestic sanctions regime. Romania’s experience with the sanctions regime in the Republic of Moldova illustrates this approach: Romania has actively supported and helped operationalise EU measures targeting Russian influence in the Republic of Moldova, an area of strategic importance given the cross-border security implications.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secretariat of the Interinstitutional Council:&lt;/strong&gt; A representative of the MFA confirmed that, until December 2024, the MFA served as the national coordinator for sanctions implementation, overseeing Romania’s network of national competent authorities. This coordination role is now led by a representative of the Chancellery of the Prime Minister, signifying a strategic effort to centralise and strengthen national-level oversight, while the MFA kept the role of the interinstitutional council’s secretariat.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementation authority:&lt;/strong&gt; The MFA is still responsible for managing export controls of dual-use and military products and the enforcement of visa bans associated with EU sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;private-sector-reflections-on-sanctions-enforcement-and-due-diligence-challenges&quot;&gt;Private Sector Reflections on Sanctions Enforcement and Due Diligence Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sanctions Enforcement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representatives from Romania’s financial sector, including the Romanian Banking Association (RBA) and representatives from individual banks, shared the considerable impact that sanctions enforcement has had on their operations. These effects extend beyond the Romanian context to include affiliated entities in Moldova. Since the introduction of EU sanctions in 2022, Romania’s banking system has faced intense pressure, particularly in relation to transaction screening and compliance processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While direct transactions with Russian entities have significantly decreased, the more complex challenge lies in monitoring indirect transactions. In particular, it is difficult to monitor transactions routed through intermediaries, or involving entities in jurisdictions such as the UAE and certain EU member states. These indirect links often trigger scrutiny by sanctions authorities, significantly increasing compliance workloads and stretching institutional resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private sector representatives noted that customer dissatisfaction has become a growing issue. Clients are often unaware of the complexity and time required for comprehensive due diligence processes, which can extend over several days. As a result, there is a noticeable decline in patience among clients whose expectations for rapid processing clash with regulatory obligations. From the financial sector’s perspective, economic interests tend to take precedence over geopolitical concerns for many clients, further complicating efforts to build understanding of and support for sanctions compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants agreed that adapting to the new compliance environment requires sustained investment in technology and training. A representative from UniCredit underlined that implementing robust technological systems typically takes a minimum of three years. Although the regulatory landscape has improved – particularly through clearer designation of competent authorities – challenges remain. Banks emphasised the need for greater information sharing and guidance from public institutions, especially to support smaller actors within the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another persistent issue relates to the unrealistic expectation that banks can implement sanctions immediately upon publication in the Official Journal of the European Union, the bloc’s primary mechanism for publishing sanctions. Participants argued that these lists are often unstructured and difficult to operationalise without delay. This challenge is compounded by the fact that political announcements often precede official listings, creating ambiguity and leaving institutions underprepared. Some participants noted that the departure of the UK from the EU removed a previously relied-upon source of clarity and best practices, which has left a noticeable gap in guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Significant concerns were also raised about the current state of EU-level data infrastructure. Participants specifically highlighted that the Official Journal of the European Union is poorly structured and not easily machine-readable, delaying sanctions implementation. Often, more usable documentation emerges only 20 days after initial listings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A particular concern is the trend towards reduced transparency in beneficial ownership data across the EU. Romania’s own beneficial ownership register was described by workshop participants as underdeveloped and unreliable. Without rigorous validation and monitoring, the register fails to serve its intended purpose as a cornerstone of sanctions enforcement. It was noted that other countries, such as Latvia, are considerably ahead of Romania in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Data Transparency and Due Diligence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In discussions on data transparency and enforcement tools, participants underscored the importance of integrating official business registries with investigative journalism resources and third-party data platforms, such as the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP). Integration between business registries, investigative journalism resources and third-party platforms can aid in improving the identification of beneficial owners, particularly in high-risk or opaque corporate structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative from 45 North emphasised that effective sanctions implementation fundamentally depends on the ability to ascertain who ultimately owns and controls a company. In many cases, ownership structures are deliberately obscured, often masking connections to Russian oligarchs or other sanctioned actors. To address this, the speaker advocated for the development of a robust, transparent and accessible ultimate beneficial ownership (UBO) register that enables both public authorities and private entities to carry out comprehensive due diligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a practical example, the representative explained that many companies routinely incorporate investigative journalism sources – such as OCCRP resources – into its client onboarding processes. These platforms offer critical insights that go beyond what is available in official registries, illustrating the value of open source intelligence and the importance of public–private cooperation in uncovering hidden ownership networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Romanian FIU noted its dual role in both enforcing sanctions and training reporting entities. Institutions are provided with legal provisions and digital tools to identify potential sanctions breaches. While these systems support compliance, FIU officials acknowledged the need for stronger international information-sharing mechanisms, which are essential given the cross-border nature of illicit finance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the onset of the sanctions regime, financial institutions in Romania reported a significant decline in transactions involving Russian clients. During the workshop, representatives from the banking sector noted that the risk appetite for engaging with Russian-linked entities had dramatically decreased. This shift, driven by a strong disincentive to risk exposure, led to a high degree of self-regulation within the sector. Perhaps as a result of this, participants reported that there were very few – if any – sanctions violations or penalties issued in Romania during this initial phase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as sanctions evasion tactics evolved and became more sophisticated, new challenges emerged. A former prosecutor and former FIU official highlighted that Romanian authorities have struggled to keep pace with enforcement demands. Concerns were raised about delays in asset freezes and the lack of timely suspicious transaction reports (STRs), which are critical for detecting and investigating potential violations. The absence of STRs has left authorities effectively blind to illicit financial flows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compounding these concerns, one of the participants pointed to the 45 North publication which reported that from the total number of Russian-linked companies registered in Romania from 1990 to 2023, 57% were registered in the 10 years between 2013 to 2023, after the Crimean annexation, with Russia ranking as the country’s eighth import source in 2022. Without systematic efforts to verify beneficial ownership, many of these connections remain obscured, hampering effective enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The speaker advocated for urgent reforms to Romania’s company registry and enforcement mechanisms, warning that superficial legislative improvements without enforcement would render the system ineffective. By comparison, the speaker attributed Latvia’s success in sanctions enforcement in part to the centrality of its beneficial ownership registry, offering a model for Romania to consider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Academics from the ASE argued that Romania must shift from a checklist-based approach to a more strategic, risk-based sanctions model. While the private sector has increased its resource allocation towards compliance, the state has not kept pace. Public institutions remain under-resourced, lacking the agility to match the growing sophistication of money laundering networks, including alternative payment systems and non-bank financial channels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Decentralised Sanctions System and Risks to Unity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representatives from the MFA acknowledged that while Romania’s sanctions system remains decentralised, efforts have been made to improve coordination through the Chancellery of the Prime Minister, which now oversees interagency cooperation. However, information-sharing forums and coordination mechanisms still face capacity limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private sector representatives raised concerns about broader EU-level cohesion. They emphasised that sanctions enforcement is not only a question of capacity but also political will. If one member state fails to implement EU sanctions consistently, it creates a systemic vulnerability. As one participant put it, “the chain is only as strong as its weakest link”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lack of a national sanctions regime in Romania – contrasted with other EU countries that have adopted one – has led to greater implementation complexity for private actors and has limited Romania’s ability to highlight domestic sanctions evasion concerns to its private sector. Participants also raised the spectre of further political fragmentation, particularly if member states such as Hungary choose to block new EU sanctions packages. In such cases, as a participant representing the private sector noted, the emergence of a “coalition of the willing” might become necessary to sustain meaningful enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, European cooperation also strengthens sanctions implementation in Romania. A representative from Romania’s ANAF reported that asset freezes have increased significantly. The agency collaborates with counterparts in other EU member states to trace and verify beneficial ownership data, sometimes uncovering information absent from Romania’s own registry but available in jurisdictions like Cyprus. The upcoming EU Anti-Money Laundering (AML) package is expected to improve data accessibility across borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;moving-beyond-a-merge-pe-burtă&quot;&gt;Moving Beyond A Merge Pe Burtă&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Romanian expression a merge pe burtă (literally, “to go on one’s belly”) is often used to describe a strategy of survival through discretion – keeping a low profile, avoiding visibility, and not drawing attention to oneself during uncertain or high-risk situations. In the context of sanctions enforcement, it was used during the workshop and sideline conversations to characterise how some actors or institutions may choose to quietly comply or minimally engage, prioritising self-preservation over proactive enforcement or transparency. The phrase suggests a cautious, even evasive, posture in the face of complex regulatory or geopolitical pressures. Participants at the workshop consistently highlighted the absence of a whole-of-society approach to sanctions enforcement in Romania. While government institutions and the banking sector have made measurable efforts to strengthen compliance, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) often remain underinformed or structurally unprepared to meet the same standards. As one participant noted, “even if the state does its job and banks fulfil their obligations, SMEs may still choose to engage with sanctioned entities due to a lack of awareness or incentives”. The current system lacks the capacity to conduct granular, transaction-level checks across these smaller market actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One potential solution identified was the expansion of data-collection capabilities to increase visibility into financial flows and identify high-risk actors. However, participants also cautioned against overreach: enhanced surveillance mechanisms – if poorly communicated or lacking oversight – could face public resistance or even be misused in ways that undermine democratic accountability. For example, concerns were raised about how enforcement mechanisms might operate under political pressure, particularly if the EU were to impose sanctions on countries such as China, where identifying beneficial ownership is especially opaque.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These technical and governance challenges are further compounded by weak public communication. Despite generally pro-European and pro-Ukrainian public sentiment, Romania’s government has maintained a low profile on the issue of sanctions. Workshop participants noted that public messaging remains limited and often reactive, making it easier for populist or anti-European political actors to exploit the narrative and question the relevance or legitimacy of sanctions. Some warned that without effective communication strategies, sanctions risk being perceived not as protective tools of economic and national security, but as externally imposed burdens that harm domestic interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was broad consensus that Romania must engage a wider array of societal stakeholders – including SMEs, journalists, academia and civil society – in building public understanding of sanctions and their objectives, and Romania’s role in supporting EU policy and regional security. This effort should not only inform, but actively involve these actors in implementation and oversight, reinforcing both the transparency and credibility of sanctions policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;insights-from-parliament-political-ambiguity-and-public-disengagement&quot;&gt;Insights from Parliament: Political Ambiguity and Public Disengagement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop discussions were complemented by a meeting with members of the Romanian parliament, which provided additional context on the political and public dimensions of sanctions policy. Several MPs acknowledged that sanctions are rarely a topic of active debate within the legislature. While some Russian-owned companies have drawn scrutiny – particularly in sectors such as aluminium – there has been little sustained pressure for robust national enforcement. Early resistance to sanctions was driven largely by concerns about job losses and economic fallout. Over time, however, discussion around these issues has diminished, and political messaging remains cautious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, anti-European rhetoric has emerged only recently within certain political factions. Before 2022, pro-Russian narratives were largely absent from mainstream politics, and there were no parties openly opposed to sanctions. Today, however, as noted by one member of the parliament, some political actors argue that the economic consequences of supporting Ukraine are too high, reflecting a gradual shift in the public discourse. Romania’s official position on the European stage has also remained relatively muted. As one MP noted, a general stance has been to “quietly support Ukraine” without overt political campaigning or bold public positioning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reluctance is mirrored in the general public’s limited awareness of Romania’s sanctions obligations. As one participant noted, this might be due to a significant institutional confusion and a lack of clear responsibility for sanctions implementation. The participant added that, before December 2024, authorities routinely passed responsibilities from one institution to another, creating a perception that the government was more concerned with appearing compliant than with delivering substantive enforcement. Transparency remained minimal, leaving both the public and private sectors unsure of the actual measures being applied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recurring theme in the parliamentary discussion was the underutilisation of Romania’s beneficial ownership register, which was – reflecting the earlier workshop – described as unreliable and lacking proper oversight. While banks are conducting Know Your Customer checks and screening politically exposed persons (PEPs), the central company registry functions primarily as a procedural database for incorporation, not as a strategic enforcement tool. MPs acknowledged that no agency systematically verifies beneficial ownership data, undermining the register’s role as a pillar of financial transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these gaps, there is strong societal resistance to Russia’s influence, and Romania’s population remains broadly pro-European and pro-American. However, concerns are growing about external interference, including credible reports of Russian meddling in domestic elections. Participants pointed to the Călin Georgescu campaign as a case study in long-term strategic influence operations, underscoring the vulnerability of Romanian democratic processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, questions remain about the sustainability of EU sanctions consensus, especially if member states like Hungary block new measures. As one MP warned, “if unity breaks down, every country will begin negotiating on its own terms”. The prospect of a return to transactional politics – exemplified by speculation that the current US administration could use troop deployments as leverage against European sanctions – was viewed with unease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some participants concluded that the EU itself requires structural reform to preserve unity and coherence. Without it, the risk remains that adversaries like Russia will exploit fragmentation and weaken collective responses. Romania, given its strategic position and vulnerability to influence, may increasingly serve as a testing ground for these dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;finance-as-a-vector-of-national-security-and-electoral-integrity&quot;&gt;Finance as a Vector of National Security and Electoral Integrity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants across both public and private sectors agreed that finance is now inextricably linked to national security. The role of financial systems has expanded beyond traditional concerns of AML and counterterrorism financing, encompassing hybrid threats such as foreign interference, sanctions circumvention and electoral manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representatives from the private sector emphasised that the starting point for effective financial resilience must be local collaboration. Enhanced public–private partnerships, improved UBO transparency, and deeper international cooperation were identified as key pillars. Both organisations stressed the urgency of reinforcing cross-border information sharing, especially in regions vulnerable to illicit finance and influence operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A think tank representative noted the case of Moldova, where hybrid warfare is increasingly underpinned by illicit finance. According to this analysis, Russian influence in Moldova is largely orchestrated through a financial ecosystem centred around a single oligarch. Following Romania’s successful advocacy for an EU–Moldova sanctions regime, new circumvention patterns emerged. Russian actors began shifting funds through non-traditional channels – notably via cyber networks and through Transnistria, a breakaway region where transactions are processed exclusively through Russia’s Mir payment system. Because these transactions never enter the conventional banking sector, they become untraceable. Funds are withdrawn in cash within Transnistria and are then redirected to fuel destabilising activities on the ground. This phenomenon illustrates a broader pattern: while formal financial systems implement sanctions, a parallel creative infrastructure has emerged to circumvent them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conversation then turned to electoral integrity, with multiple speakers highlighting the financial dimensions of political interference. One participant argued that while legal safeguards against electoral meddling are essential, threats constantly evolve, requiring proactive and adaptive strategies. The EU, it was noted, has not responded with the necessary speed and flexibility in this domain. The MFA shared that it had recently launched a forum on public–private collaboration, which had proven valuable in surfacing such threats. The MFA noted that this forum would be repeated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RBA provided concrete evidence of electoral risk exposure, noting that some attempts to redirect funds for the purpose of electoral influence had already been detected. Although banks are mandated to report only suspicious transactions, their internal systems allow them to discern broader patterns in financial flows that may be politically relevant. However, banks face increasing burdens in compliance and monitoring; these burdens can cost millions of euros. Despite this, the responsibility remains largely on the private sector, with insufficient state support for expanding financial monitoring infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on this point, several participants noted a surge in alternative financial channels, particularly through China, alternative payment systems and high-risk jurisdictions such as Venezuela. These platforms, often involving state-linked entities or petrodollar revenues, are significantly more difficult to monitor and regulate. Without enhanced detection mechanisms, these flows represent a growing blind spot in the sanctions and AML architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A RUSI representative argued that mindsets must evolve. Whereas AML efforts were once focused narrowly on criminality, they now sit at the intersection of financial integrity and national security. Accordingly, both private institutions and governments must invest in long-term capability building. “This is not just compliance – it’s strategy”, he observed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workshop participants also highlighted blurred lines between financial and political risks. Not all PEPs are laundering money, but many are entangled in corruption cases or reputational controversies that create institutional risk. Screening clients against sanctions lists is no longer sufficient; onboarding procedures must now incorporate anti-bribery and corruption frameworks alongside traditional AML measures. The EU’s Whistleblower Directive, although adopted with difficulty in Romania, was cited as a positive development. Participants called for stronger implementation: not only within private firms, but also within public institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MFA concluded this segment by noting that recent legislative reforms in Romania provide a foundation for improved implementation and enforcement in the coming year. If effectively operationalised, these changes could enhance resilience across the financial sector and bolster defences against both domestic and transnational threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bucharest workshop highlighted Romania’s adaptation to the evolving European sanctions landscape and in responding to the broader nexus of finance, security and geopolitical threats. As discussions revealed, recent reforms to Romania’s sanctions framework mark a significant step forward by introducing a decentralised model with clearer coordination, spearheaded by the Chancellery of the Prime Minister. However, implementation challenges persist, particularly around inter-agency accountability, resource constraints and the capacity to detect complex patterns of sanctions evasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants noted that Romania’s capacity to track UBO remains limited by persistent data gaps. Strengthening the reliability and use of the national UBO register will be crucial for both enforcement and private sector compliance. Although public–private collaboration is improving, collaboration must be expanded to include SMEs and civil society actors who are not yet fully engaged in the sanctions enforcement ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recurring theme throughout the workshop was the need for a whole-of-society approach. While Romania’s financial institutions are adapting to a more complex risk environment, public communication on sanctions remains underdeveloped. Without a coherent narrative around Romania’s role in supporting EU sanctions and protecting regional security, the risk of public disengagement and populist exploitation increases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Romania’s strategic engagement in promoting the EU–Moldova sanctions regime was cited by participants as constituting a notable success. However, the response from adversarial actors has been equally adaptive, with illicit financial flows increasingly routed through informal networks – including cyber platforms and regional grey zones such as Transnistria – thereby evading formal banking oversight. These developments reinforce the need for vigilance and improved cross-border monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, discussions underscored that Romania must deepen its cooperation with European partners, particularly in addressing regional maritime threats such as Russia’s shadow fleet activity in the Black Sea. Multilateral frameworks like the Joint Expeditionary Force offer a pathway to enhance port security and infrastructure protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agility, coordination, and international partnership will be essential as geopolitical risks continue to evolve.

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deterioration of European security since the start of Russia’s 2022 war on Ukraine has driven the recent strengthening of defence and security cooperation between the UK and Germany. However, the second Trump presidency is arguably more challenging as the primary source of instability is the commander-in-chief of their mutual pre-eminent ally, not the aggression of their principal foe. As the two largest European defence spenders in NATO and the top two European supporters of Ukraine in absolute financial terms, the UK and Germany will have to shoulder far more of the European security burden. They must do this together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 28 August 2024, the prime minister and chancellor announced that a new bilateral cooperation treaty would be negotiated by their respective foreign ministries. On 23 October 2024, the UK and German defence ministers signed the “Trinity House Agreement”, which has established defence cooperation as a key pillar of this new Treaty-based relationship. The Treaty will include several additional policy areas, including foreign policy, justice and law enforcement, economic growth, resilience, science and technology, energy and climate, and the environment. There is broad cross-party support in both countries for the Treaty and it is likely that it will be signed soon after the new German government takes office on 6 May 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Policy Brief examines how the UK and Germany can maximise the new relationship to ensure that it delivers the most value to each of them and to European security. The brief argues that the political desire to broaden the UK–German relationship across multiple policy areas simultaneously poses a risk to delivering on progress made in defence and security cooperation. The rapid deterioration of Euro-Atlantic security as a result of Trump’s early rapprochement with Russia – at the expense of Ukrainian security – will immediately stress-test the new relationship and there will be pressure to deliver immediate value. Consequently, the Treaty must focus on building mutual political commitment and creating effective governance structures, so that the strategic partnership becomes more than the sum of improved cooperation between Whitehall departments and their respective German federal ministries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research for this brief is drawn from two main sources. First, a review of official UK, German, NATO and EU policy documents, alongside expert and media commentaries. Second, an expert-led roundtable discussion – held in London on 25 November 2024 – which was attended by a member of the German Bundestag, academics, and representatives from the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and the German Embassy in London. The brief is supported by Konrad Adenauer Stiftung’s London office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brief is structured in three sections. The first section assesses the intensification of the relationship since the Labour government took office. The second explores the shared political opportunities and risks and the third focuses on developing coherence through strong governance structures. The conclusion identifies the priorities for establishing a value-based relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;defence-and-security-cooperation&quot;&gt;Defence and Security Cooperation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 23 October 2024, the defence ministers of the UK and Germany signed the “Trinity House” defence agreement. Signed just 111 days after the Labour government was elected, the agreement covers strengthening defence industries, reinforcing Euro-Atlantic security, enhancing interoperability, addressing emerging threats, supporting Ukraine, and working together on future “Deep Precision Strike” capabilities. Moreover, the defence agreement created several “lighthouse projects”, including German maritime patrol aircraft operating from RAF Lossiemouth, and established new governance structures to accelerate delivery. Demonstrating the centrality of the defence partnership, a German military planner is currently embedded in the UK Strategic Defence Review team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Claudia Major and Nicolai von Ondarza concluded, it is “politically noteworthy” that “Labour has chosen security and defence as the main angle for their ‘reset’ with European allies and the EU”. Therefore, the significance of Trinity House goes beyond a bilateral defence agreement and should be considered as both a framework and a model for closer UK cooperation with Europe and the EU. However, in the haste to finalise the agreement, two important elements were omitted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, export controls – a previous point of friction – were absent. Joint capability development proposals under Trinity House, especially Deep Precision Strike, will have significant export potential with Ukraine, exposing Russia’s vulnerability to such systems. An agreement on export controls will be crucial for building confidence and maximising the benefits from future joint procurement opportunities. Export controls are not led by the defence ministries in either country and will therefore need more political focus from ministers responsible for trade and industry, requiring greater political trade-offs to gain alignment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, since the agreement was signed, both countries have strengthened their respective defence industries. Germany has published its National Security and Defence Industry Strategy and the UK has announced a new Defence Industrial Strategy to be published in the spring. The UK wants to use defence (as one of eight priority sectors) to pursue growth and prosperity by onshoring a higher proportion of defence industrial capacity, whereas Germany is focusing more on pan-European cooperation. The external situation has also changed, as the US acts more unpredictably and raises concerns in Europe about overdependence on the US and buying American manufactured arms covered by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) in the future. This stands alongside strained transatlantic relations over trade tariffs. As both the UK and Germany buy a significant amount of US equipment, this shift will be a strategic challenge jointly felt by both parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the situation is also an opportunity to strengthen UK–German and European joint procurement, especially as the EU adopts its €800-billion ReArm Europe defence package. Creating closer alignment between UK and German industrial strategies would be a quick win and an effective precursor to UK–EU defence industrial collaboration to hedge against the unpredictability of the US. Moreover, the UK should immediately lobby the new government in Berlin to help gain access to the new EU €150bn rearmament fund ahead of the UK–EU summit on 19 May 2025, where an agreement on defence and security is expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;opportunities-and-risks&quot;&gt;Opportunities and Risks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although defence cooperation is most advanced, economic growth and illegal migration are both higher joint domestic joint political priorities. Keir Starmer has made “economic stability” and “secure borders” (alongside national security) the “foundations” for his “Plan for Change” and mission-led government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Strengthening our relationship with these countries (Germany and France) is crucial, not only in tackling the global problem of illegal migration, but also in boosting economic growth across the continent and crucially in the UK – one of the key missions of my government,” he said during the announcement of the bilateral treaty negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The political imperative to boost mutual economic growth is stark. Germany is the UK’s second-largest trading partner, accounting for 8.5% of UK trade. The German government has struggled to pass federal budgets, limited by the “debt brake”, leading to a loss of confidence in economic stability and responsibility – a traditional German strength – and also leading to calls for major fiscal and economic reform to stimulate growth. The fiscal necessity has already driven significant reform ahead of the new government taking office as, on 18 March 2025, the Bundestag voted to exempt defence spending from Germany’s strict debt rules and create a €500-billion infrastructure fund. Simultaneous political deadlock in France has slowed the Franco-German economic and integration motor at the heart of the EU, with confidence in the traditional leaders diminishing. Furthermore, the economic outlook could worsen as a looming tariff and trade war between the US and China will also negatively impact the EU. Starmer has already rejected making a binary choice between closer ties with the EU or US, but that was before Trump’s imposition of global tariffs and the leaked Signal discussion between key national security members of the US administration that made their feelings towards Europe well known. In this more challenging situation, closer alignment with key economic players in Europe will benefit the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, immigration is high on the political agenda. It is also a clear area of cooperation, as the governing parties are challenged by anti-migration parties. However, neither are priority partners for addressing illegal immigration: with the UK prioritising working with France, and Germany addressing southern migration with Italy and Greece. Therefore, explicitly highlighting closer working could create unrealistic expectations of delivery. In the UK, Reform has gained 12 percentage points as of March 2025, since the 2024 general election, putting them ahead of Labour for the first time. Meanwhile, the Alternative for Deutschland (AfD) – which based its electoral campaign on immigration rhetoric – became the second-largest parliamentary group after securing 20.8% in the federal election. Both the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the AfD took strong anti-immigration stances which clearly contributed to their electoral success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 10 December 2024, the UK Home Office and the German Federal Ministry of the Interior and Community set out a “Joint Action Plan on Irregular Migration” agreement to target small boat crossings. The plan commits Germany to clarifying its law to make it a specific criminal offence to facilitate the smuggling of migrants – many boats are procured in Germany – and aims to make it harder to cross the English Channel. Moreover, it welcomes more involvement from Europol, which will likely feature prominently in a future UK–EU security deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economic growth and immigration control can be domestically politically volatile. Public disagreements between the UK and German governments on immigration could easily derail greater cooperation on defence and security, or wider UK–EU cooperation, as difficulties in one policy area could easily impact the other. This makes insulating defence and security from the political weather more important. Finally, each government might also find it difficult to directly attribute successes on growth and migration to these agreements. To mitigate these risks, the UK and Germany should design effective governance structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;creating-coherence-through-effective-governance&quot;&gt;Creating Coherence Through Effective Governance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expanding the policy areas for a Treaty to manage risks the UK–German relationship becoming imprecise and unwieldy, which only achieves better department-to-ministry cooperation but fails to deliver a coherent strategic partnership. Adding additional policy areas means that cooperation could touch as many as 13 of the 34 UK ministerial departments and 10 of 15 German federal ministries (including the Office of the Prime Minister and the Federal Ministry of the Chancellery) and more non-ministerial departments, agencies and public bodies. The UK and Germany should learn from their 2021 Joint Declaration, which covered a vast range of policy areas and global regions, and was too unwieldy for the foreign secretaries to deliver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designing and implementing an effective governance structure could mitigate this risk and is an opportunity to consolidate and streamline legacy arrangements. This governance structure should focus on three key objectives: maximising political direction and buy-in, reducing duplication and intensifying integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the structure should maximise political direction and buy-in. The prime minister and chancellor must be directly involved to ensure high-level political attention, to maintain momentum, to hold ministers to account and ensure delivery of the full agenda, through regular consultations and joint Cabinet meetings. While Trinity House – both the agreement and the speed at which it was signed – was a Labour-SPD social democratic deal, it is important that better political linkages are now made with Labour and the CDU. To build cross-party consensus, parliamentary dialogues should increase and move away from organising on party political lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the structure should reduce duplication. Ministerial diaries are already too demanding, and more bilateral minister-to-minister interactions within each policy area could become cumbersome. Instead, it would be beneficial to open the extant strategic dialogue between foreign ministers (established in the 2021 Joint Declaration) to also include defence and home secretaries, to have a more comprehensive security focus. Opening dialogues between foreign, defence and home secretaries would enable greater political interest, accountability and the ability to develop integrated policy responses to complex security challenges. However, the substance of the discussions must make these more substantial dialogues worthy of ministers’ time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the structure should intensify UK–Germany integration. Both the UK and Germany operate an integrated approach to security and some functional areas – for example, intelligence cooperation – sit across multiple ministerial departments. The range of conventional and hybrid threats both countries face, from foreign election interference to incendiary DHL Parcels, and Russian military aggression against the Baltics (where the UK and Germany lead NATO’s Forward Land Forces), requires greater integration across departments and their associated agencies. The new CDU Chancellor Friedrich Merz wants to revisit the establishment of a German National Security Council (NSC) within the Chancellery after the previous coalition was unable to agree on such a machinery of government change. Creating a German NSC would establish a new and important link between UK and German national security advisers, which could foster greater integrated intelligence cooperation. Intelligence cooperation is currently underused – it was not covered in Trinity House – and falls between the seams of foreign, defence and security policy. Moreover, the UK has operated a NSC for 15 years, which has undertaken multiple reforms to remain valuable and can offer advice to Germany on establishing the office (given previous difficulties in agreeing how it would operate and where it would best be housed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Externally, the new bilateral Treaty will impact other European relationships, which will need managing, and which are working in overdrive since Trump’s re-election. These include the E3 (the UK, Germany and France), the Weimar Triangle (Germany, France and Poland), the “Weimar Plus” (Poland, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the UK and the EU’s High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy) and the newer E5 format (the UK, Germany, France, Poland and Italy). Within this system there is too much duplication, and each meeting must add value in a fast-paced environment. The UK and Germany are common denominators in many of these formats and by working together and harnessing the momentum of the bilateral they could level up these formats and revitalise them. As European defence and security leaders, they should combine their influence to prioritise and focus energy into progressing policy within one strong group. Bringing the E3 together with the Weimar Triangle would develop the strongest new European quad of powers, which could jointly lead in the absence of the US on European security and bridge NATO and the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stronger government-to-government relationships should be reinforced by sharpening non-governmental structures which advocate for closer ties across foreign policy, economics, education, cultural exchanges and youth groups. Some groups are specifically referenced by the 2021 Joint Declaration as “key fora for outreach and feedback, and an opportunity to maintain a strong and close relationship”. Therefore, there is no need to establish new structures. Rather, more impetus should be placed into breathing new life into the existing ones. As examples, the annual Königswinter Conference, and its Defence counterpart, have been operating yearly since 1950 and 2010, respectively, and the British-German Association since 1951. Multiple attendees have expressed a view that these groups have become stale, procedural and have not kept pace with changes in policy. These groups should be reinvigorated, through revitalising the attendees, securing fresh partnerships, and inviting them to establish working groups which match the areas for further UK–German policy development. Moreover, German Stiftungen (political foundations) are a key advocacy group for closer cooperation and should be allowed to operate on a more substantial footing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;establishing-a-treaty-based-relationship&quot;&gt;Establishing a Treaty-Based Relationship&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2021 Joint Declaration was an important starting point for rapprochement after Brexit, but it was not legally binding. Therefore, the Treaty has the opportunity to develop stronger political buy-in and form a joint agenda on strengthening European security. Merz reportedly has an affinity with the UK and his campaign commitments and public announcements align closely with UK defence and security objectives. There are three priorities to seek alignment on: creating a strong leadership bond and mutual leadership positions in NATO; sustaining Ukraine’s defence; and elaborating a unified European position on China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, UK and German objectives within NATO align closely as committed Atlanticists and they will be particularly vulnerable to significant US changes in policy towards Europe. The UK and Germany will need to fundamentally re-evaluate their defence and security approaches and doctrines, which have been developed over decades. Therefore, the Treaty must hedge against this and create a strong leadership bond at the heart of NATO that can best address the threat posed by Russia. Increasing their mutual leadership positions in NATO could also help to keep NATO in as close to its current form as possible, in the face of changing US policy towards the Alliance, which is a joint strategic interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The June 2025 Hague Summit is the most immediate challenge. As the top two European defence spenders, creating a harmonious position will be critical, especially as Germany is the target of Trump’s frustrations with European allies – despite currently being the second-highest spender in NATO, after decades of underspending relative to its economic size (and with questions remaining about the sustainability of its defence spending increase). Trump wants Europeans to spend 5% of GDP on defence. While such a figure is unrealistic, it creates certain US expectations. Pre-empting the debate, in his first major speech the new NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said “to prevent war, NATO must spend more” and believes the NATO target should be raised from 2% to 3%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, sustaining Ukraine’s defence should be a priority. As an immediate win, Merz has personally committed to supplying Ukraine with long-range Taurus missiles – which Chancellor Scholz has repeatedly refused to do – and will likely seek US and French support. Delivering such a system to Ukraine would bring Germany in line with the UK, France and the US in the provision of long-range strike assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more immediate and risky challenge is the potential deployment of European reassurance forces in Ukraine to secure any negotiated ceasefire. Thus far, the UK and France have taken the lead in assembling a potential 30-strong coalition of the willing that could deploy to Ukraine in the right circumstances. German officials have also worked with their UK and French counterparts to help the US and Ukraine reach a ceasefire deal which can be presented to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This presents both a dilemma and opportunity for the new German government. Chancellor Scholz had ruled it out, only for his foreign minister to suggest it might be necessary. Therefore, Germany might be pressured into an early decision on the deployment of German troops outside NATO borders, which has traditionally been politically sensitive, and must be supported by both the UK and France. However, it would also be an opportunity to show that Germany is ready to step up and lead on European security and that the Zeitenwende is not just about more money for the Bundeswehr, but also a mindset change in the deployment and employment of military force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, Trump is expected to focus on China, making it more important for a unified European position. Last year, the German government published a Strategy on China which states that “China is simultaneously a partner, competitor and systemic rival for the Federal Government. Our Strategy on China is firmly rooted in the common policy on China of the EU”. Derisking and diversification rather than economic decoupling became the policy, but with derisking left as an individual business decision, rather than a Federal diktat. The UK government is currently undertaking a “China audit”. The 2023 Integrated Review Refresh defined China as an “epoch-defining and systemic challenge”. The extant “3Cs” China policy approach of “compete, challenge, and cooperate” is similar to the simultaneous and overlapping German positions. Moreover, the new UK government has already changed its approach to get closer to China on trade, which is also closer to the current German position. As both governments seek to balance trade and security in their individual and collective approaches to China, cooperation is important. Furthermore, while these policies are being developed, external factors will also shape what is possible – NATO explicitly called out China as a “decisive enabler of Russia’s war against Ukraine through its so-called ‘no limits’ partnership” at the NATO 2024 Washington Summit. Trump is also likely to apply pressure to allies who strengthen their economic links with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Treaty will elevate the relationship and will be binding under law – going beyond the Trinity House Agreement. But the Treaty itself will not deliver the value required. Rather, the mutual political buy-in to the relationship, along with the shared challenges that the UK and Germany will face in the future, will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-maximising-the-new-relationship&quot;&gt;Conclusion: Maximising the New Relationship&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK–German bilateral relationship will be maximised in the context of the broader UK–EU relationship. The Labour government has stated that “The new UK-Germany treaty will be a key pillar of the UK’s wider reset with Europe”. Some analysts have calculated that a successful “reset” with the EU could raise UK GDP by 0.3–0.7% and the German relationship will be integral to achieving this. However, Brussels is likely to want movement on fisheries and a youth mobility scheme in return for a defence and security deal. Through improving relations with Germany – a central EU power – the UK has put itself in a stronger negotiating position. However, the UK must be realistic and accept that while this might support future negotiations with the EU, it will be no panacea, and these negotiations are likely to be challenging and could strain growing UK–German cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK and Germany – individually and collectively – will be severely impacted by external shocks across most policy areas. Both also have growing internal challenges. The new UK government is already realising how difficult it is to govern, even with a large majority. The new German government might not have the strength to lead Europe and will need to rely on partnerships with other countries. Domestic political considerations on the economy and immigration, coupled with the challenge of populist parties, will take priority, even as international security problems mount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With reduced US leadership in Europe, no one country can fill the vacuum. However, a group of leading European countries – including the UK and Germany – can mitigate this to a certain degree and keep European security together in something close to its current form. By increasing bilateral partnerships, the UK and Germany can be in the best position to shape the future to their advantage and set UK–EU relations on the right path. Here, the real value is less about what is written within the various agreements and communiqués that govern the partnership, but rather how they are used, developed and driven by political leaders on both sides, regardless of the parties to which they belong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For over a century, military professionals have treated operational fires as the backbone of modern campaigns—shaping the battlefield, degrading enemy formations, and setting the conditions for maneuver. But what happens when that logic breaks down? What if long-range strikes become less about shaping operations and more about shaping narratives—used not to support a ground advance but to terrorize civilians and coerce political outcomes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is the story emerging from Russia’s war in Ukraine. Despite inheriting a military doctrine steeped in deep battle, reconnaissance-strike complexes, and precision noncontact warfare, Russia has consistently failed to employ operational fires in a way that reflects this legacy. Instead, firepower has become unmoored from maneuver. Russian missile salvos and loitering drone attacks increasingly appear to serve a punitive, strategic coercion logic rather than a campaign to dislocate Ukrainian defenses or synchronize effects across domains. Chaos reigns along an extended front line defined by human wave attacks, thousands of small first-person view (FPV) drones, and artillery fire vectored by strike and reconnaissance unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing on an original dataset compiled by a Ukrainian researcher, the CSIS Futures Lab wrangled, cleaned, transformed, and augmented the raw data to use for analysis. This analysis critically evaluates the alleged disconnect between Russian operational fires and battlefield intensity. Using daily estimates of Russian personnel losses as a proxy for combat tempo, the Futures Lab analyzed their relationship with three types of firepower activity—(1) ballistic and cruise missile salvos, (2) strike and reconnaissance UAVs, and (3) Shahed drone attacks—to test whether Moscow was using fires to set conditions for ground advances. The findings are striking:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is no statistically significant relationship between Russian cruise and ballistic missile strikes and increased battlefield intensity three days later.&lt;/strong&gt; In fact, the data shows the opposite: Larger missile salvos are associated with lower Russian personnel losses—suggesting that fires are either poorly targeted or employed for reasons unrelated to frontline outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reconnaissance and strike UAV activity, on the other hand, is strongly associated with battlefield intensity&lt;/strong&gt;, supporting the idea that the security zone remains an active and lethal domain of modern war—a space where human-machine teams fight for information and survival.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, Russia’s widespread use of Shahed drones appears associated with rising battlefield intensity.&lt;/strong&gt; Our model shows an increase in Russian personnel loss but this is likely a spurious effect explained not by operational integration of firepower in fighting but likely by material constraints—such as shortages of precision-guided munitions—and a shift toward a desperate strategy focused on punishment rather than achieving tactical breakthroughs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together, these findings point to a dangerous evolution in modern war: the rise of coercive fires unlinked from operational design and increasingly aimed at civilian populations. The war in Ukraine is not just a land campaign—it is an algorithmic war of attrition, fought with drone swarms and missile salvos designed as much to terrorize as to degrade military capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To meet this challenge, four policy recommendations emerge:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sustain and expand air defense support for Ukraine, including both kinetic interceptors and enhanced intelligence sharing to reduce sensor-to-shooter timelines.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Disrupt the global supply chains enabling Russia’s long-range firepower, especially dual-use components from Iran, North Korea, and China.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reimagine NATO’s concept of operational fires, integrating lessons from Ukraine into new doctrines that reflect dynamic targeting in the security zone and that leverage human-machine teaming.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Develop a counter-coercion playbook, preparing allied societies for an era of low-cost strategic strike campaigns designed to break will, not win battles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s failure to employ fires operationally should not invite complacency—it should serve as a warning. The tools of war are evolving faster than the doctrines that guide them. It is time the United States caught up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;operational-fires-in-historical-perspective&quot;&gt;Operational Fires in Historical Perspective&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In military doctrine, fires traditionally support maneuver: Armies use everything from artillery fire to long-range ballistic and cruise missile strikes to set conditions for ground forces to close with the enemy. In modern war, this concept of fire in support of maneuver extends to multiple domains and includes everything from space-based sensing to cyber and electronic attacks alongside a mix of aerial interdiction and close air support. According to U.S. joint doctrine, fires “assist air, land, maritime, space, cyberspace, and special operations forces to move, maneuver, and control territory, airspace, space, cyberspace, the electromagnetic spectrum, and key waters and to influence populations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this framework, longer-range weapons systems like ballistic and cruise missiles set conditions at higher echelons, usually associated with divisions and corps. The intent is to strike deep targets linked to command and control (C2), key logistics nodes (e.g., fuel and ammunition), and troop concentrations, often up to 72 hours prior to attacks along the front, and coordinate these activities with planned close and rear military operations. These shaping fires are designed to degrade the enemy’s ability to generate combat power. The result is that the targeted enemy force struggles to coordinate (i.e., principle of mass) at the right time and place while also stumbling to conduct counterattacks (i.e., principles of objective and maneuver).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This concept has extended across different military organizations since the advent of longer-range artillery and aviation fires in the early twentieth century. Furthermore, some militaries—especially the Soviet and now Russian formations—are built to be fire-centric and place a higher premium on killing with fires than closing with the enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In World War I, Russian military planners relied on related concepts like deep operations—a set of coordinated, long-range actions designed to shape where and how the enemy can respond, often by diverting, disrupting, delaying, or destroying key forces—as a solution to countering the firepower-intensive fronts of integrated trenches in World War I. That concept extended into the Soviet and even post-Soviet period, in which the integration of precision strike capabilities led to the rise of a reconnaissance-strike complex and noncontact warfare. In Russian military doctrine, the reconnaissance-strike complex refers to the “coordinated employment of high-precision, long-range weapons linked to real-time intelligence data and precise targeting provided to a fused intelligence and fire-direction center.” In turn, noncontact warfare is a Russian military concept describing battle waged by long-range precision fires. In both, the combination of depth and precision combine to hold the enemy at risk and set conditions for major operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;operational-disconnect-in-ukraine&quot;&gt;Operational Disconnect in Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this mix of enduring practice and strategic culture, one would expect to see operational fires playing a critical role in the war in Ukraine. Yet, a mix of battlefield anecdotes and statistical observations suggest the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia used operational fires only for a short, intensive window to open its invasion. In all likelihood, Moscow was targeting preregistered (i.e., fixed) installations designed to blind Kyiv but preserve the critical infrastructure needed for an occupation. Of note, this opening salvo included a large-scale cyberattack against Viasat designed to limit Ukrainian satellite communications. In addition, Russian planners appear in hindsight to have suffered from overconfidence, limiting their firepower strike campaign because they assessed the war would last days, not years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statistical observations reveal a more enduring disconnect between operational fires and ground combat that extends beyond the flawed military planning of the opening days of the war. The Futures Lab leveraged a mix of data from Ukraine on daily battlefield casualty estimates and firepower strikes. Firepower strikes reflect the mix of cruise and ballistic missiles alongside reconnaissance and strike UAVs and one-way attack drones like Shaheds that Russia uses to bombard Ukrainian cities daily. These attacks can be further divided between weapons systems associated with operational fires (e.g., cruise and ballistic missiles), daily tactical activity (e.g., intelligence and strike drones used along the front line), and more strategic weapons used to terrorize the population and pressure political leaders (e.g., Shaheds launched in daily salvos largely against nonmilitary targets).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1: Daily Firepower Strikes in UkraineFebruary 24, 2022–April 4, 2025.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Results tabulated by the CSIS Futures Lab. The data is compiled by https://github.com/PetroIvaniuk. The raw dataset is available at Kaggle. CSIS has verified that the data aligns with the official numbers published by the Ukrainian Air Force.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the start of the Russia-Ukraine War on February 24, 2022, an average of 10.64 cruise and ballistic missiles have been launched per day, with a median of 3 and a maximum of 127 in a single day. The use of other intelligence and strike UAVs (non-Shahed drones) is significantly lower, averaging about 2 per day with a daily max of 17, with some days seeing no launches at all. These lower levels reflect that these assets—likely larger drones used to support artillery fires, collect intelligence, and strike point targets—fly at higher altitudes than quadcopters and FPV drones. In contrast, Shahed long-range loitering UAVs are deployed in much greater numbers, with a daily average of 39.29, a median of 20, and a peak of 321 in one day. As stated previously, Russia appears to be using these systems following a strategic coercive logic of punishment designed to pressure Ukraine’s political leaders by holding the population at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closer examination also reveals interesting patterns that suggest Russia is not employing operational fires in the war in Ukraine. Rather, fires appear more dynamic and tethered to shifting conditions along the front line, indicative of a suboptimal attritional approach to joint fires and a separate strategic campaign of terror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Futures Lab evaluated Russia’s use of operational fires by introducing a time-lagged variable to capture delayed effects on battlefield intensity. If Moscow employed operational fires to set conditions for its ground campaign, one would expect to observe a positive relationship between increases in operational fires and increased intensity along the front line three days (i.e., 72 hours) later. This hypothesis suggests the type of sequence accounted for in doctrine, in which longer-range operational fires hit C2 and logistics targets in depth to set conditions for sequenced tactical actions along the front line. This sequencing of battles and effects is the essence of modern operational art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To measure combat intensity, the Futures Lab used official estimates of daily Russian causalities. These losses included soldiers who were killed in action or wounded. One would expect that major offensive pushes against fixed, fortified front lines like those seen in Ukraine would be accompanied by higher casualty levels. This assumption creates the logic of the dependent variable (i.e., daily Russian personnel losses).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To measure firepower strikes, the Futures Lab adapted its firepower strike tracker data, separating and recoding categories and weapons into three groups: operational firepower strikes (i.e., cruise and ballistic missiles); security zone drone activity associated with the reconnaissance/counter-reconnaissance fight (i.e., reconnaissance and strike UAVs, often Group 3 or above); and Shaheds (i.e., long-range, one-way attack drones). If Moscow is employing its operational fires, one would expect to see a 72-hour lag between increased operational firepower strikes (i.e., ballistic and cruise missiles) and increased intensity along the front line. For additional details, including regression formulas and a breakdown of variables and limitations, see the appendix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As seen in Model I from Table 2, there is no statistically significant relationship between operational firepower strikes using cruise and ballistic missiles and combat intensity three days (i.e., 72 hours later). In fact, the coefficient (-0.333) is negative and in the opposite direction than expected, implying that increases in ballistic and cruise missiles are associated with decreased Russian personnel losses three days later. This indicates that for each additional missile launched, daily Russian personnel losses are estimated to decrease by 0.333 three days later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OBVqkXK.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 2: Regression Models to Estimate Russian Personnel Loss.&lt;/strong&gt; Operational Firepower Strike contains the daily three-day lagged numbers of ballistic and cruise missiles reported launched. Other Recon/Strike UAV (Same Day) refers to the amounts of non-Shahed UAV drones reported launched. Shaheds (Same Day) refers to the numbers of Shahed UAV dones reported launched. Lastly, reverse causality was tested, and researchers did not find a statistically significant association of personnel loss driving operational firepower strikes, rather the relationships were negative. See appendix for Table 2’s model formulas.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To further test this relationship, the Futures Lab created a second and binary variable—large salvos—that only measured when a day’s combined cruise and ballistic missile strikes were over the first standard deviation. This measure acts as a robustness check but ends up yielding the same results. When analyzing operational firepower strikes above the first standard deviation, the model predicts an expected decrease in Russian daily personnel losses three days later. The negative coefficient runs counter to expectations. Specifically, days characterized by a large missile salvo (i.e., more than one standard deviation above the mean, approximately 20 missiles) are associated with a statistically significant decrease in battlefield intensity three days later, corresponding to approximately 212 fewer Russian personnel losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This implies that large salvos are not associated with an increase in the proxy measure of battlefield intensity. The negative relationship holds but loses statistical significance when controlling for other strike and reconnaissance UAVs (Model II) and Shaheds (Model III). An alternative explanation could be that the attacks are so effective that they act as a substitute for Russian use of ground forces—saving the equivalent of two infantry companies. However, this hypothesis is not supported by battlefield accounts of Russia’s continued use of human wave attacks and operational approach of constantly pressuring key sectors along the front to gain territory. These operational patterns are not captured in the model and are instead absorbed into the error term, as indicated by the models’ generally low explanatory power, apart from some improvement in Model III. Additional threats that affect and limit inference are discussed in the appendix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another finding from Model II in Table 2 is that there is a positive relationship between strike and reconnaissance UAVs intercepted and increased combat intensity on the same day. Each additional reconnaissance or strike UAV launched on the same day is associated with an increase of approximately 13 daily Russian personnel losses, and the result is statistically significant. This finding is consistent with the concept of a security zone fight, where smaller, mobile units—modern skirmishers, including UAVs—carry out a reconnaissance and counter-reconnaissance fight in front of any formation. Their struggle is a fight for information, with each side trying to blind the other so they can gain an advantage and preserve combat power. In legacy Russian and Soviet doctrine, the security zone extends between 15 and 50 kilometers in front of the main line of troops. As a result, the positive relationship makes sense, as one would expect to see increased losses of UAVs along the front associated with increased battlefield intensity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, Model III in Table 2 also shows that coercive, counter-value weapons linked to punishment strategies like the Shahed are associated with increased battlefield intensity. For each additional Shahed drone launched, Russian personnel losses increase by approximately three soldiers per day. The results are statistically significant. Here, the findings are likely spurious. The confounding factor at play is how Russia has had to adapt its warfighting strategy to material constraints and political imperatives to end the war. Both casualty levels and Shahed strikes have been increasing over time as a result of material losses and difficulty generating cruise and ballistic missiles at the same rate as low-cost one-way attack drones. In other words, Russia’s strategy by default explains the increase in both battlefield intensity and Shahed strikes in Ukrainian cities. Russia is desperately trying to break Ukrainian front lines and the will of its people to end the war on favorable terms. The result is daily human wave attacks and air raid sirens across Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-recommendations&quot;&gt;Policy Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analyzing battlefield data from Ukraine provides insights into policy options for countering Russia and strengthening NATO. In particular, four recommendations emerge:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sustain and expand air defense support for Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The United States and Europe should continue providing Ukraine with integrated air defense systems, combining interceptors with layered sensor networks and intelligence-sharing arrangements. This includes expanding counter-UAV capabilities and deploying mobile systems to protect critical infrastructure and civilian populations. If the United States reduces its footprint due to domestic political constraints, Europe must lean forward. Russia’s campaign of strategic punishment—manifested through relentless Shahed drone and missile attacks on cities—is unlikely to abate. Supporting Ukraine’s ability to defend its skies is both a moral imperative and a strategic necessity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Disrupt the global supply chains enabling Russia’s war machine.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The sheer volume of missiles and drones launched daily by Russia suggests a failure in existing sanctions regimes. Washington and Brussels must go beyond traditional sanctions and pursue targeted technology denial strategies. This includes cracking down on the transfer of dual-use technologies and components—especially microelectronics and drone parts—from Iran, North Korea, and China. These actors are now vital cogs in a distributed arsenal supplying Russia with the means to sustain its long-range fire campaigns. Export enforcement teams should be embedded with intelligence services to map and dismantle these networks in real time. This effort must also extend to third-party cutouts and shell companies acting as proxies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reimagine operational fires and human-machine integration for NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Ukraine war reveals that legacy doctrine linking fires to maneuver may be insufficient in modern war. NATO must invest in new operational concepts that reflect the evolving character of fires—where intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) drones, loitering munitions, and long-range strikes are used to shape battlefields, but in a manner that supports both operational maneuver and more dynamic targeting in the security zone. This reimagining should include red teaming adversary use of coercive fires, as seen in Russian strikes on civilian targets, and testing new fires—human-machine integration (HMI) constructs that blend machine reconnaissance, networked kill chains, and AI-enabled decision cycles. The security zone fight of the future will be a contest between drone swarms, decoys, jammers, and algorithmic kill webs. NATO must ensure it dominates this battlespace.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Build a counter-coercion playbook for strategic strike campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Russia’s daily use of Shahed drones points to the resurgence of an old form of warfare: punishment. Future adversaries—state or nonstate—will increasingly use low-cost, long-range systems to hold civilian infrastructure at risk and manipulate domestic political will. NATO should prepare now by developing counter-coercion strategies that include hardening infrastructure, distributing critical services, integrating national warning systems, and creating escalation management protocols. Strategic messaging must be part of the defense plan, helping shape public resilience under sustained aerial and psychological assault.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s war in Ukraine is not just a throwback to World War I trench warfare and Soviet deep battle—it is a live demonstration of how authoritarian regimes adapt old ideas to new technologies. Instead of using fires to support maneuver, Moscow uses them to punish civilians, shape perceptions, and degrade morale. This is a war of attrition by algorithm, where drone salvos replace doctrine and coercion substitutes for combined arms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and its partners cannot afford to watch this play out from the sidelines. Support for Ukraine is more than a moral cause—it is a strategic laboratory. Every Shahed intercepted, every sensor spoofed, every Russian tactic studied gives NATO an edge in tomorrow’s conflicts. But only if the United States and its allies act—fast, forward, and together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a1-challenges-in-making-inferences&quot;&gt;A1: Challenges in Making Inferences&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before drawing conclusions from the available data, several threats to inference must be acknowledged:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Changes in Russian Offensive Capabilities&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The analysis assumes relative consistency in Russia’s offensive capabilities over the study period. The analysis does not codify periods of offensives or counter-offensives. In addition, significant changes—such as shifts in procurement, production rates, technological upgrades, sanctions, or personnel—could confound the relationship between operational fire strikes and daily personnel losses. This dynamic is noted in the main analysis, where battlefield tactics like human wave assaults are assumed to contribute to unexplained variance captured in the error term.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Weather and Environmental Factors&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Weather conditions may influence the decision to launch missile salvos or initiate shaping operations. For instance, cloud cover and poor visibility can reduce the effectiveness of drone strikes and affect interception rates, thereby introducing variation in the timing and effectiveness of firepower employment not captured in the model.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Data Source Limitations&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The personnel loss estimates and firepower strike counts are drawn from official Ukrainian reports. In the context of ongoing conflict, reporting may be influenced by strategic communications objectives. Consequently, any inferences made from the data are contingent upon the accuracy, completeness, and potential biases inherent in these publicly available sources.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a2-multivariate-regression-models&quot;&gt;A2: Multivariate Regression Models&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Futures Lab designed three models defined below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian Personnel Loss = β0 + β1 (Operational Firepower Strikes) + β2 (Large Salvo) + ϵ&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian Personnel Loss = β0 + β1 (Operational Firepower Strikes) + β2 (Large Salvo) + β3 (Other Recon,Strike UAV) + ϵ&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian Personnel Loss = β0 + β1 (Operational Firepower Strikes) + β2 (Large Salvo) + β3 (Other Recon,Strike UAV) + β4 (Shahed) + ϵ&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these models, Russian Personnel Loss (denoted as our Ŷ ) is the dependent variable, measuring daily Russian casualties, including those killed or wounded; Operational Firepower Strikes represents the number of cruise and ballistic missiles launched but lagged by 72 hours to capture delayed battlefield effects; Large Salvo is a binary indicator equal to 1 if the daily number of missile launches exceeds one standard deviation above the mean (approximately 20 missiles), and 0 otherwise; Other Recon/Strike UAV captures the number of non-Shahed reconnaissance and strike UAVs launched on the same day; Shaheds refers to the number of Shahed one-way attack drones launched on the same day; and ϵ denotes the model’s error term, capturing unobserved factors affecting daily personnel losses.&lt;/p&gt;

This potential 40% of Russia’s ammunition has prolonged the war to a certain extent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysis conducted by the Open Source Centre (OSC), in conjunction with Reuters, and published on 15 April 2025 indicates that as many as 5.2 million rounds of 152 mm and 122 mm ammunition may have been supplied to Russia by North Korea since August 2023. This commentary will assess the extent of this contribution by estimating Russia’s total artillery expenditure since deliveries began in 2023 and examine how North Korean deliveries have surged to support Russia’s own offensives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shell-hunger&quot;&gt;Shell Hunger&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August 2023 Ukraine’s long-awaited counter-offensive was under way, Russian units were prepared and waiting behind dense minefields, armed with anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs), loitering munitions, and supported by large groupings of artillery and attack helicopters. This defensive posture proved too lethal for Ukraine’s brigades and the counteroffensive failed to secure any meaningful territorial gains, although it did bring Russia’s own offensive to a temporary halt. The Russian lines had held despite many deficiencies at that time. Amongst many challenges, the Russians lacked artillery ammunition after firing millions themselves, and Ukraine destroying thousands more through long-range strikes. This had constrained Russia’s artillery consumption with the result that ammunition and guns had to be concentrated in priority areas, leaving other areas of the frontline under-resourced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s defence industry was expanding to address this need, but at that stage of the war, it could not do anything quickly to properly resource the units on the frontline. The answer to this dilemma soon became clear. President Putin had met with Kim Jong Un in July 2023, and satellite imagery analysed by RUSI from mid-August showed the start of regular shipments between Russia’s Dunai military facility on the coast of the Sea of Japan, and Rajin Port in North Korea. Simultaneously, the 719th Artillery Ammunition facility close to Tikhoretsk underwent a dramatic expansion with new berms added for large quantities of ammunition. This would become the end location for millions of rounds of North Korean artillery ammunition, which have helped keep Russia’s forces in the war. Those new berms were filling up by the time that Ukraine’s offensive came to an end in November 2023, and the war entered a new phase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both sides have since faced a shell hunger that has shaped the war significantly. Russia quickly emptied some of its pre-war stores, and eventually had to adapt the way it used artillery, leading to a greater focus on guided and loitering munitions. However, Russian units have come to depend upon deliveries of North Korean ammunition, which may constitute as much as 40% of the 14 million rounds fired since August 2023. It is clear that without North Korean support, Russia’s shell hunger would have been far worse, which means that North Korea’s illicit activities may have extended the war, or even prevented Ukraine from achieving greater success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The OSC analysis used modelling and satellite imagery to estimate the number of 122 mm and 152 mm rounds that the identified Russian tankers could carry per journey. They were able to count and monitor 64 journeys by four vessels between Rajin and Russia’s Dunay and Vostochny ports since September 2023. It is estimated that these journeys delivered a minimum of 15,800 standard shipping containers. By modelling the size of Russian ammunition crates against the internal dimensions of ISO containers, the OSC arrived at a figure between 4.2 and 5.8 million munitions, including 122 mm and 152 mm artillery shells and 122 mm rockets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With 4 October 2023 as a start date - to allow for the transit of North Korean ammunition to the front - and 18 April 2025 as an end date, the OSC analysis indicates that North Korea may have supplied enough ammunition for Russian units to fire 7,400 rounds per day. It is also possible to assess these figures against the totality of Russian ammunition expenditure since August 2023; table 1 below summarises publicly reported daily expenditure figures. Using these figures arranged against the available time period, it is possible to estimate the number of rounds that Russia has fired since North Korean deliveries started. This will obviously be an approximate figure, but it provides a metric against which to assess the relative impact of North Korean support to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Y1zyvYe.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Reported Russian ammunition expenditure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This incomplete estimate indicates that North Korea has supplied between 29% and 40% (based on 4.2 and 5.8 million rounds respectively) of the total number of rounds that Russia has fired since deliveries began in 2023. These numbers do not allow for Ukraine’s strikes against Russia’s arsenals in September 2024, which destroyed large quantities of North Korean ammunition, leading to a temporary drop in rounds fired. For example, the strike on Tikhoretsk destroyed a train carrying an estimated 2,000 tons of ammunition, which could represent 24,000 152 mm rounds. There is no way of knowing how many rounds the Ukrainians managed to destroy, but it is unlikely that they have dramatically altered the overall picture given the scale of deliveries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If North Korea had not supplied any ammunition at all, and the estimated total expenditure reduced by 5.8 million rounds, Russia’s daily average expenditure would fall to 13,493 per day from the current estimate of 22,729. This is still more than Ukraine for a lot of the period in question, but not dramatically so. Firing at this rate would likely have made many of Russia’s offensives in 2024 much more difficult and costly. It may also have limited the scope of offensives that Russia could undertake. In fact, the tempo of shipments indicates that North Korean shipments were timed to support major Russian offensive operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The OSC analysis indicates that Russian ships have averaged three deliveries per month since shipments started in September 2023. However, October, November and December saw 18 total shipments with seven in October alone coinciding with the beginning of the large-scale offensive to take Avdiivka, and the end of Ukraine’s own counter-offensive. A surge of another 13 deliveries between January and March 2024 appear to have supported Russia’s advance on Chasiv Yar, as well as the reopening of the Kharkiv front. Continued deliveries likely supported some stockpiling in preparation for the summer battles of Toretsk, Pokrovsk, and countering Ukraine’s advance into Kursk. Four shipments were observed in February 2025, as Russia prepared for its Spring offensive, recently announced by Ukraine’s general staff. This was the largest number of monthly trips observed by the OSC since the same month in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;impact-assessment&quot;&gt;Impact Assessment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of North Korea’s ammunition supply to Russia is hard to fully appreciate. At the strategic level, it is apparent that the renegade country has contributed significantly to Russia’s overall ammunition expenditure, likely helping Russia to keep fighting and sustaining its advances. The timings of deliveries also indicate that they have been key enablers of Russia’s offensives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact at the tactical level has also led to important outcomes for the war. Ukrainian casualties more than doubled when the number of artillery rounds they could fire fell by half, a senior officer from Ukraine’s general staff told Reuters in July 2024. Manpower has since become a critical weak point for Ukraine as it struggles to hold ground and defend against Russia’s greater numbers. When Russia combined overwhelming firepower with higher ratios of troops, the Ukrainians have often faced defeat. This combination contributed to the fall of Avdiivka in February 2024; during the battle for Avdiivka, Russia had fired nine artillery rounds for every one the Ukrainians could fire back at times, and consistently outnumbered them in personnel. Avdiivka was quickly followed by the Russian capture of Krasnohorivka and Ocheretyne, and the expansion of Russian offensives through the Kharkiv front in May, further stretching Ukraine’s limited forces and ammunition. By October 2024 Russian forces had captured the city of Vuhledar after deploying some of the most intense artillery and glide bomb bombardments that Ukraine’s experienced 72nd Brigade had ever endured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As 2024 came to a close, Russia had captured an estimated 4,168 square kilometres of territory, some of it from pushing Ukraine’s Kursk incursion back, but much of it Ukrainian land, captured in offensives that increasingly used North Korea’s ammunition. Supplies from Pyongyang have become so critical that some Russian units are only firing North Korean ammunition. Ukraine’s manpower struggles were compounded by Russia’s ability to fire more and more rounds to sustain offensives in the face of mounting casualties, with the net result being an overall worsening of Ukraine’s position by the end of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, the available evidence suggests that both Russian and North Korean factories are working to churn out more rounds than ever, with new production lines established and their legacy factories operating at maximum capacity. There will likely be some emphasis on replenishing stockpiles, but it stands to reason that many of the rounds the two states produce will be used in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, North Korean ammunition has kept Russia in the war, and arguably helped change its trajectory. If the supply increases and can be sustained for months on end, Ukrainian casualties will climb and Russia’s will fall. More territory will be taken, and Ukraine’s position will become ever more tenuous.&lt;/p&gt;

The two sites are among those most likely to be supporting Chinese intelligence-gathering operations from Cuba.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bejucal&quot;&gt;BEJUCAL&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;22° 56’ 54.5”N 82° 21’ 46.29”W&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Situated outside of the capital, near the town of Bejucal, is Cuba’s largest active SIGINT site. The facility has a long history, and is near a site that housed Soviet nuclear weapons during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the end of the Cold War, Bejucal has been widely rumored to be part of China’s intelligence-gathering ambitions on the island. U.S. congressional testimony and unclassified government documents have suggested the site has ties to China, and reporting in English and Spanish-language outlets has also linked it to China. During the 2016 U.S. presidential primary debates, then-Senator Marco Rubio called on Havana to “[kick] out this Chinese listening station in Bejucal.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSIS analysis of satellite imagery from March 2024 showed that the site had undergone major updates over the past decade, indicating an evolving mission set. Multiple antenna fields were visible across the expansive complex, and entrances to underground facilities could also be seen on the southern end of the site. Adding to its capabilities, a new radome was installed within the complex in 2014, which may conceal a radar or other system for conducting electronic surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/4wdJpDC.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New satellite imagery from April 16, 2025, shows major developments at the site in recent months. At an existing antenna field on the northern side of the complex, the land has been excavated, and six pole antennas have been removed. In their place, work is underway to construct a large CDAA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CDAAs are used primarily for high-frequency direction finding, which involves pinpointing the origin of incoming radio signals from as far as 3,000 or even 8,000 miles away. A new CDAA at Bejucal could offer a significantly enhanced capability to monitor air and maritime activity in and around the United States. Interestingly, the Soviets also operated a now-abandoned antenna array just outside of the current complex at Bejucal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While work at this site is still ongoing, it is already easily identifiable as a CDAA by its circular shape. Satellite imagery shows pole antennas already erected in a circular pattern surrounding a movable trailer at the center. Trenches have been dug for the placement of cables connecting each of the antennas to the center, though the cables themselves are not visible. As work continues, a more permanent structure could be erected at the center to replace the trailer currently there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new CDAA will likely replace an older and smaller one that was previously located in a nearby field within the complex. The antennas of that circular array are no longer visible. Notably, the new CDAA is much larger. It comprises 19 antennas arrayed in a circle approximately 175 meters in diameter, whereas the previous array had 16 antennas in a circle spanning 85 meters in diameter, with a trailer in the center. This larger size likely offers greater precision in tracking signals at long distances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CDAAs were a staple of SIGINT during the Cold War. The United States and Russia previously operated extensive CDAA networks to help military and intelligence services track targets, but new technologies and an evolving mission set have made CDAAs less common for modern day SIGINT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/GdE0hTE.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ CDAA at U.S. Naval Base, Pearl Harbor, Naval Radio Station, constructed 1963&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, these capabilities remain relevant, even for highly capable forces like the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA). China has invested in new CDAA facilities at two of its militarized outposts in the South China Sea, on Mischief Reef and Subi Reef. Paired with other forms of intelligence, CDAAs there can provide China with information about naval and air activity near these contested islands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once completed, the new CDAA site at Bejucal could enable Cuba to collect similar intelligence on U.S. activities in the region—information that would also be valuable if shared with China or other U.S. adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;el-salao&quot;&gt;El Salao&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;20° 0’19.16”N 75°44’48.49”W&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roughly 500 miles southeast of Bejucal, on the opposite side of Cuba, is another CDAA facility, near El Salao. The site had previously gone unreported until CSIS published satellite imagery of it in 2024. At that time, imagery from March 2024 showed a new CDAA under construction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, more recent imagery from April 18, 2025, reveals that work at El Salao has largely ceased. Over the last year, workers continued some minor activities such as erecting roofs on two support buildings, but there has otherwise been little activity observable in available satellite imagery. Notably, the graded area within the CDAA’s rings is being reclaimed by grass and other plant life, suggesting a lack of activity and maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jdMoDp8.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is unclear why activity at this site has gone quiet in recent months. A CDAA site at El Salao could provide a useful vantage point for monitoring air and maritime traffic over much of the Atlantic Ocean. In particular, it could assist in monitoring U.S. military traffic around U.S. Naval Station Guantanamo, which is approximately 40 miles east of El Salao.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the unclassified space, there is no smoking gun linking China to any of these sites directly, and China has denied having any links to surveillance sites in Cuba. However, U.S. officials have repeatedly signaled that China has access to spy facilities on the island. These two sites are among those most likely to be supporting Chinese intelligence-gathering operations from the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should continue to monitor developments at these facilities. Major changes at Cuban SIGINT sites could indicate an escalation in Cuban—or Chinese—efforts to collect intelligence on the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russia-Ukraine war has emerged as a watershed moment in modern military history, fundamentally reshaping our understanding of contemporary warfare. This white paper analyzes five transformative domains that have defined this conflict: autonomous systems, information operations, electronic warfare, contested logistics, and evolving air defense strategies. By examining the practical applications and lessons learned from this ongoing conflict, this paper provides military planners, defense policymakers, and security professionals with actionable insights for adapting force structures, doctrines, and capabilities to meet the challenges of future warfare. The conflict serves as both warning and blueprint—demonstrating how technological innovation, organizational adaptability, and strategic resilience have become the defining characteristics of military effectiveness in the twenty-first century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 marked a pivotal moment in modern military history, opening new avenues for studying the evolving nature of warfare. What Russian leadership initially anticipated would be a swift campaign has instead developed into a protracted conflict, transforming the battlefield into a real-world laboratory for testing new military technologies, doctrines, and operational adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the most significant developments observed in Ukraine has been the transformative role of autonomous systems, particularly unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). These emerging technologies are revolutionizing battlefield dynamics, extending operational reach while minimizing risks to human forces and challenging traditional force structures. Simultaneously, the conflict has elevated the importance of information operations, electronic warfare, contested logistics, and innovative air defense strategies in shaping the military landscape of future conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This white paper provides a comprehensive analysis of modern warfare through five interconnected characteristics that have been prominently displayed throughout the Ukraine conflict:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rise of autonomous systems and their impact on force architecture&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The information domain as a critical battleground&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Electronic warfare and spectrum superiority&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The challenges of sustaining logistics in contested environments&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The evolution of air defense strategy&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By examining these dimensions, this paper aims to provide deeper insights into how military operations are adapting to contemporary challenges and what these adaptations portend for the future of armed conflict. The lessons derived from the Ukraine conflict serve as critical waypoints for military organizations seeking to navigate the rapidly changing character of modern warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis presented in this paper draws on firsthand insights from four senior defense experts interviewed by the author in March 2025: Austin Gray, former U.S. Navy intelligence officer and co-founder of Blue Water Autonomy; Major General Gregory Gagnon, deputy chief of space operations for intelligence of the U.S. Space Force; Lieutenant General (Ret.) Lance Landrum, former deputy chair of the NATO Military Committee; and Air Marshal Johnny Stringer, deputy commander of NATO’s Allied Air Command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-rise-of-autonomous-systems-and-their-impact-on-force-architecture&quot;&gt;The Rise of Autonomous Systems and Their Impact on Force Architecture&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;range-extension-and-risk-reduction&quot;&gt;Range Extension and Risk Reduction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unmanned systems are dramatically transforming the battlefield by extending operational reach while reducing risks to personnel. They enable longer-range engagement with adversaries while minimizing soldiers’ exposure to danger. It is generally recognized by military leaders that drones offer a significant advantage in modern conflicts due to their ability to strike at longer ranges with reduced risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Ukraine conflict, both sides have leveraged drones extensively for reconnaissance, target acquisition, and precision strikes—often beyond the effective range of conventional direct-fire weapons. This capability to project force across dimensional and operational planes while removing personnel from immediate danger has fundamentally altered tactical and operational planning considerations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;democratization-of-air-power&quot;&gt;Democratization of Air Power&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most significant strategic impact of autonomous systems has been the democratization of air power. Historically, air superiority was the exclusive domain of wealthy nations that could afford expensive aircraft and specialized pilot training. The proliferation of small, affordable drones has dramatically lowered these barriers. As Air Marshal Stringer observed in the CSIS interview series mentioned above, “you could conduct most if not all of the airpower roles for the price of a drone, a laptop, and some imagination.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This democratization raises profound questions for military strategy and force planning. Nations and non-state actors now possess means to contest airspace and project power previously considered beyond their reach. In Ukraine, this reality has manifested in a complex and contested aerial environment, despite Russia’s nominal advantages in conventional air assets. The dual-use nature of military and adapted civilian drones has further complicated the operational picture, blurring traditional distinctions between military and commercial technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;supply-chain-and-technology-accessibility&quot;&gt;Supply Chain and Technology Accessibility&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The accessibility of drone technology has significantly influenced drones’ battlefield proliferation. The hardware components essential for drone development—batteries, lightweight computing systems, and airframe materials—are readily available through commercial supply chains, with many components sourced from standard e-commerce platforms. Similarly, 3D printing capabilities have facilitated rapid prototyping and scaling of drone production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software development for drone operations has likewise accelerated, with advances in firmware, operating systems, and semi-autonomous functionalities. While full autonomy remains a developing capability, even basic remote control systems with limited autonomous functions have proved highly effective in combat conditions. This accessibility has enabled Ukraine to rapidly field large numbers of autonomous systems despite limited indigenous defense industrial capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;evolution-of-asset-categories&quot;&gt;Evolution of Asset Categories&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukraine conflict has revealed an evolution in military force architecture. Traditional military planning distinguished between two primary categories of assets: expendable (ammunition) and survivable (high-value platforms). The drone revolution has expanded this taxonomy to include four categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expendable assets:&lt;/strong&gt; Single-use, deployable systems like conventional ammunition&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attritable assets:&lt;/strong&gt; Low-cost systems whose loss poses no strategic consequences&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk-tolerant assets:&lt;/strong&gt; Medium-tier unmanned systems that commanders prefer to preserve but can afford to lose if militarily necessary&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Survivable assets:&lt;/strong&gt; High-value platforms and personnel that require protection&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This revised architecture creates operational flexibility that previously did not exist. Where commanders once faced a binary choice between risking high-value assets or foregoing operations entirely, they now have degrees of risk appropriate to different threat environments. This framework is particularly valuable for conventional forces structured around high-value platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-economics-of-modern-warfare&quot;&gt;The Economics of Modern Warfare&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukraine conflict has upended traditional cost-benefit calculations in military operations. The conventional emphasis on firepower-heavy forces built around expensive platforms—tanks, warships, and advanced aircraft—is being challenged by the effectiveness of low-cost attritable assets, particularly drones. According to NATO, Ukrainian drones have been responsible for more than 65 percent of destroyed Russian tanks, representing what many analysts see as a fundamental disruption in the economics of warfare. This dynamic extends beyond Ukraine, with similar cost asymmetries observed in other theaters where non-state actors have employed inexpensive drones against high-value naval assets. These developments validate a new perspective on the “cheap–expensive” and “targetability” matrix, wherein low-cost but precision-targetable systems produce outsized operational effects when deployed at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;tactical-versatility-of-autonomous-systems&quot;&gt;Tactical Versatility of Autonomous Systems&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conflict has demonstrated the remarkable tactical versatility of unmanned systems across multiple mission profiles. Some of these varied functions are listed below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All-seeing eyes:&lt;/strong&gt; Small, difficult-to-detect drones provide unprecedented situational awareness, enabling forces to identify enemy positions, activities, and vulnerabilities without risking human observers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targeting and battle damage assessment:&lt;/strong&gt; Drones play a crucial role in designating targets for indirect fire systems and assessing strike effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strike operations:&lt;/strong&gt; Armed drones ranging from weaponized commercial models to purpose-built military platforms have been employed against personnel, vehicles, and infrastructure with high precision.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electronic warfare and communications:&lt;/strong&gt; UAVs serve as platforms for electronic warfare, communications relays, and signals intelligence collection.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logistics support:&lt;/strong&gt; Unmanned ground vehicles enable resupply to isolated units or positions under direct fire, reducing risk to logistics personnel.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These applications demonstrate the flexibility of autonomous systems in maintaining and enhancing traditional military capabilities across numerous operational domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;vulnerabilities-and-mitigations&quot;&gt;Vulnerabilities and Mitigations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite their strengths, autonomous systems exhibit significant vulnerabilities. Drone operators have become high-value targets, as they are often easier to locate and neutralize than the platforms they control. This has accelerated the development of increased autonomy to reduce operator vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Ukraine and Russia have developed techniques to trace drone control signals to their source, enabling counter-battery fire or direct strikes against operators. This has necessitated frequent relocation of control stations and the development of more resilient command and control architectures, including relay systems and distributed control networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electronic warfare and cyberattacks reveal additional vulnerabilities. The Ukraine conflict has demonstrated that these threats can be mitigated through technological and operational approaches, such as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;mesh networks that maintain functionality even when individual nodes are compromised;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;multiple communications pathways, including satellite communications, airborne relays, and ground-based systems; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;local autonomy capabilities that enable operation when communications are degraded.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, these approaches have enabled autonomous systems to function effectively even in sophisticated electronic warfare environments, suggesting that while electronic warfare remains important, it may not be as decisive as some analysts had predicted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-information-domain-as-a-critical-battleground&quot;&gt;The Information Domain as a Critical Battleground&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-strategic-importance-of-information&quot;&gt;The Strategic Importance of Information&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fundamental lesson from the Ukraine conflict highlights the paramount importance of the information domain. As Major General Gregory Gagnon, Deputy Chief of Space Operations for Intelligence of the U.S. Space Force, observed in the CSIS interview series, “the information space became incredibly important in that conflict”—not only for military command and control but also for shaping strategic narratives that influence international support and domestic perceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s approach reflects its established doctrine of “informational confrontation,” which comprises two elements: the “information technical” (controlling the means of information) and the “information political” (shaping the message itself). This represents a continuation of Soviet-era tactics, adapted for the modern digital battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cyberattacks-and-space-assets&quot;&gt;Cyberattacks and Space Assets&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Viasat cyberattack executed immediately before Russia’s invasion exemplifies the “information technical” component of this doctrine. Though aimed at Ukrainian military command-and-control infrastructure, this operation had cascading effects that disrupted approximately 5,800 German wind turbines and internet services for thousands of European users. This incident demonstrates how cyberattacks targeting space capabilities can produce widespread, often unintended consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This episode underscores the importance of gaining cyber and space superiority over one’s adversaries as an early objective in ground campaigns—a principle likely to become foundational in twenty-first-century conflicts. Successful military operations increasingly depend on establishing control in these domains from the outset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;space-superiority-and-modern-warfare&quot;&gt;Space Superiority and Modern Warfare&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukraine conflict has highlighted the critical role of space assets in modern warfare, particularly for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR). Commercial satellite operators have effectively negated Russia’s potential space advantage over Ukraine, with the constellation of space assets contributing to Ukraine’s capabilities increasing from approximately 200 to 300 satellites during the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This democratization of space capabilities has profound implications for conventional forces, as “large mass conventional forces will have a hard time executing surprise in the future” due to the proliferation of commercial remote sensing capabilities, according to Major General Gagnon. During Russia’s pre-invasion buildup along Ukraine’s borders, commercial imaging companies published satellite imagery that enabled think tanks and analysts to accurately assess Russian force dispositions. As Gagnon noted, “the commercial remote sensing market in outer space is becoming rapidly an unblinking eye,” making it increasingly difficult to conceal conventional force movements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commercial satellite systems have also played a crucial role in providing communication links for autonomous vehicles when terrestrial networks are disrupted or jammed. Starlink’s services, for instance, have enabled Ukrainian forces to maintain control of drone operations despite Russian efforts to degrade communication infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;organizational-structures-and-information-integration&quot;&gt;Organizational Structures and Information Integration&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effective integration of information and space assets into operations depends less on technological capabilities than on organizational structures that can incorporate these capabilities into overall military operations. Russia’s compartmentalized military organization and lack of trust between units have contributed to its inability to fully leverage its information warfare potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organizational structure similarly affects professional military education and the role of non-commissioned officers (NCOs). Major General Gagnon highlights how Russia’s military is disadvantaged by its conscription model (11 percent of personnel are conscripted for one-year terms) and the absence of a professional NCO corps. Effective coordination among space, air, ground, and maritime forces in combined arms operations requires communication and empowerment at lower organizational levels—a capability that depends heavily on experienced NCOs. As Major General Gagnon notes, “The reason the American yardstick is the largest yardstick in the world is because of our NCO Corps.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;electronic-warfare-and-electromagnetic-spectrum-superiority&quot;&gt;Electronic Warfare and Electromagnetic Spectrum Superiority&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;return-to-contested-electromagnetic-environments&quot;&gt;Return to Contested Electromagnetic Environments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukraine conflict has revealed a return to contested electromagnetic environments after decades of Western dominance in this domain. Lieutenant General Landrum observes in the CSIS interview series that “the biggest stark difference is, as we fought in coalition warfare in Iraq and Afghanistan . . . we were really uncontested in the electromagnetic spectrum.” For three decades following the Cold War, Western forces allowed their electromagnetic operations capabilities to atrophy, creating a significant capability gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Russia, China, and other potential adversaries continued developing their electronic warfare capabilities and units. This development has created an electromagnetic environment in Ukraine where neither side has been able to establish clear advantage—a stark contrast to Western experiences in recent conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;impact-on-air-superiority-and-ground-operations&quot;&gt;Impact on Air Superiority and Ground Operations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most direct consequence of this electromagnetic contest has been the inability of either Russia or Ukraine to achieve air superiority—a factor that has contributed to the conflict’s positional and attritional warfare characteristics. The contested electromagnetic environment has severely restricted both sides’ ability to conduct rapid maneuvers, protect ground forces, and shield maneuvering elements from enemy fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reality contrasts sharply with Western doctrines of air power that evolved from the Gulf War, where air superiority was achieved and maintained throughout operations. The Ukraine conflict suggests that in contested electromagnetic environments, conventional applications of air power may face significant limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;specific-electronic-warfare-applications&quot;&gt;Specific Electronic Warfare Applications&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several electronic warfare applications have proved particularly significant in the Ukraine conflict:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GPS jamming:&lt;/strong&gt; Disruption of GPS signals has impeded navigation capabilities for autonomous systems and precision-guided munitions, forcing reliance on alternative guidance methods.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communications disruption:&lt;/strong&gt; Both sides have systematically jammed communications networks, degrading command and control capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Signals intelligence:&lt;/strong&gt; Electronic warfare operations have included signals intelligence collection critical for battlefield decisionmaking.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tactical jamming of autonomous systems:&lt;/strong&gt; Localized jamming operations have targeted UAVs to degrade both reconnaissance and attack capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frequency agility:&lt;/strong&gt; When facing successful Ukrainian jamming of small UAV operations, Russian forces have demonstrated frequency-hopping agility, creating brief windows of operational opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-dynamic-interaction-of-drone-operations-and-electronic-warfare&quot;&gt;The Dynamic Interaction of Drone Operations and Electronic Warfare&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability of autonomous systems to electronic warfare represents a defining characteristic of the Ukraine conflict. GPS jamming has proved particularly effective, as many autonomous systems rely on GPS for navigation. Large-scale jamming by Russian forces has forced Ukrainian operators to develop alternative navigation methods including inertial navigation and line-of-sight communications. However, these alternatives present their own vulnerabilities, as line-of-sight communications remain susceptible to electronic interception and further jamming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian forces have rapidly developed defenses and countermeasures to preserve operational effectiveness, including satellite communications, relay stations, and mesh networks that address vulnerabilities while maintaining reliable command and control capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;future-implications-for-electronic-warfare&quot;&gt;Future Implications for Electronic Warfare&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukraine conflict points toward a new set of characteristics for electromagnetic warfare strategies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modern, agile systems:&lt;/strong&gt; Future electronic warfare systems will be increasingly adaptable, software-defined, and capable of responding rapidly to changing electromagnetic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrated architecture:&lt;/strong&gt; Effective electronic warfare architectures will integrate military, government, and commercial domains.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public-private partnerships:&lt;/strong&gt; Managing shared spectrum requirements will require collaboration among industry, government, and military stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artificial intelligence integration:&lt;/strong&gt; Artificial intelligence and machine learning will be central to future electronic warfare, enabling cognitive electronic warfare platforms capable of sensing, analyzing, and responding autonomously at speeds beyond human capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These technologies will be essential as warfare accelerates, requiring decisionmaking at machine speed while preserving human judgment in critical areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-challenges-of-sustaining-logistics-in-contested-environments&quot;&gt;The Challenges of Sustaining Logistics in Contested Environments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;vulnerability-of-traditional-logistics-models&quot;&gt;Vulnerability of Traditional Logistics Models&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukraine conflict has exposed fundamental vulnerabilities in traditional logistics approaches. Lieutenant General Landrum emphasizes how the conflict has “brought reality to the vulnerability of supply chains, the vulnerability of logistics centers, and how we move and project force.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war has demonstrated the extreme vulnerability of large infrastructure nodes, supply centers, distribution facilities, and transportation networks including rail, roads, bridges, and ports. These vulnerabilities are magnified by adversaries’ long-range precision strike capabilities, non-kinetic attacks, and electromagnetic interference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-postcold-war-efficiency-trap&quot;&gt;The Post–Cold War Efficiency Trap&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A critical insight from analysis of the conflict is how Western militaries have systematically reduced their organic logistics capabilities over the past 30–40 years in favor of commercial outsourcing. While this approach delivered efficiencies through “just-in-time” delivery systems and elimination of redundancies, it also created strategic vulnerabilities. As Lieutenant General Landrum stated, “over the decades . . . [the U.S. military] became incredibly efficient. We outsourced and divested of military logistics capability, using commercial capability to get this service that we needed, because we had the luxury of planning well in advance for our operations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This model functioned effectively when operations were planned months or years in advance in uncontested environments like Iraq and Afghanistan. However, it is dangerously inadequate for rapid response in contested environments where commercial providers may be unwilling to operate in high-threat areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;hybrid-threats-to-logistics-infrastructure&quot;&gt;Hybrid Threats to Logistics Infrastructure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukraine conflict has highlighted emerging hybrid threats to logistics infrastructure, including targeted attacks against supply nodes, cyber operations, underwater infrastructure sabotage, and difficult-to-attribute asymmetric operations. These new threats compound traditional challenges such as infrastructure limitations (e.g., road weight restrictions, bridge capacities), rail gauge differences, port throughput constraints, and customs and border regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reimagining-logistics-for-contested-environments&quot;&gt;Reimagining Logistics for Contested Environments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conflict has catalyzed a new paradigm for logistics in contested environments based on the principle that Lieutenant General Landrum describes as “disaggregate to survive, reaggregate when necessary.” This approach relies on several key characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disaggregated logistics networks:&lt;/strong&gt; The distribution of supply nodes and capabilities enhances survivability against precision strikes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Command and control of dispersed assets:&lt;/strong&gt; The development of command and control systems capable of managing widely distributed logistics elements is essential for enhancing operational efficiency and coordination across complex supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid reaggregation capability:&lt;/strong&gt; The ability to concentrate logistics resources quickly based on operational requirements is crucial for ensuring timely support and mission success in dynamic environments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Renewed focus on stockpiling:&lt;/strong&gt; Accepting increased costs associated with maintaining larger reserves of critical munitions and supplies reflects a strategic shift, reversing the “just-in-time” paradigm in favor of enhanced readiness and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This transformation represents a fundamental shift from efficiency-driven logistics toward approaches prioritizing resilience and survivability in contested environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;logistics-innovation-through-technology&quot;&gt;Logistics Innovation Through Technology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukraine conflict has revealed several opportunities for technological innovation in logistics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additive manufacturing:&lt;/strong&gt; 3D printing capabilities reduce dependence on vulnerable supply chains for certain components.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interoperable systems:&lt;/strong&gt; Movement away from proprietary systems toward open architectures enables integration across platforms and nations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distributed command and control:&lt;/strong&gt; Development of robust communications networks allows for managing disaggregated logistics assets effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These innovations will be essential for creating logistics systems capable of operating in contested environments while maintaining the flexibility required for modern military operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-evolution-of-air-defense-and-strategy&quot;&gt;The Evolution of Air Defense and Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;historical-context-and-strategic-reset&quot;&gt;Historical Context and Strategic Reset&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two significant historical factors have shaped NATO’s current air defense posture, according to Air Marshal Stringer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post–Cold War disinvestment:&lt;/strong&gt; The three decades following the Cold War saw significant reductions in NATO air defense capabilities, creating vulnerabilities exposed by Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Counterinsurgency operations:&lt;/strong&gt; Counterterrorism and counterinsurgency campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan and against the Islamic State diverted resources and attention from developing capabilities against conventional or near-peer threats.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These factors created military structures optimized for specific types of operations while leaving NATO inadequately prepared for the hybrid warfare techniques deployed in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;expanded-threat-spectrum&quot;&gt;Expanded Threat Spectrum&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukraine conflict has highlighted a dramatic expansion in the range of threats confronting modern air defense systems:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low-cost threats:&lt;/strong&gt; One-way attack drones and first-person view (FPV) drones equipped with simple warheads that can be mass-produced at minimal cost&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High-end threats:&lt;/strong&gt; Advanced systems such as hypersonic air-launched ballistic missiles capable of extreme speeds and ranges&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asymmetric approaches:&lt;/strong&gt; Exploitation of social media, legal mechanisms, and disinformation to create favorable conditions for military operations&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This evolving threat landscape necessitates a fundamental reconsideration of integrated air and missile defense (IAMD) approaches, focusing on what Air Marshal Stringer describes as going “back to first principles.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;enhanced-sensing-capabilities&quot;&gt;Enhanced Sensing Capabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has demonstrated innovative approaches to air defense detection, including implementation of extensive networks of inexpensive acoustic sensors linked to create comprehensive recognized air pictures; diversification beyond traditional radar systems to improve situational awareness; and integration of multiple sensing modalities to establish resilient detection networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;command-and-control-transformation&quot;&gt;Command and Control Transformation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the face of evolving threats, modernizing command and control systems is critical. According to Air Marshal Stringer, this should be done through a renewed commitment to standardization agreements (STANAGs) that were neglected during the post–Cold War period; ensuring interoperability across national air command and control systems within NATO’s architecture; and shifting from monolithic software development toward modular, agile approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This transformation would not require “one big program to try and do everything,” but rather adopting smartphone-like models with intuitive interfaces and specialized applications, while embracing development, security, and operations (DevSecOps) principles to create an “intelligent, imaginative ecosystem” of suppliers. DevSecOps integrates security throughout the software development cycle, fostering collaboration while providing mechanisms for rapidly developing secure software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;force-posture-innovations&quot;&gt;Force Posture Innovations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukraine conflict has prompted military strategists to reconsider force positioning and employment, including by reimagining defense postures and alert states for enhanced responsiveness; drawing inspiration from Cold War integration models while adapting them to contemporary threats; and balancing offensive and defensive operations, recognizing that being “necessarily offensive to be defensive” as Marshal Stringer puts it, may be required against mass drone threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;drone-warfare-implications&quot;&gt;Drone Warfare Implications&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The widespread deployment of drones in Ukraine presents both challenges and opportunities, as outlined below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Democratization effect:&lt;/strong&gt; Even resource-constrained adversaries can now execute traditional air power functions including air superiority, strike, ISR, and transport.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mass vs. quality trade-offs:&lt;/strong&gt; Drones enable “high-low mix” strategies that increase effective force mass while maintaining capability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rethinking generations:&lt;/strong&gt; Military leaders can evolve beyond platform-centric definitions, such as fifth-generation aircraft, and embrace warfare-centric concepts that define the emerging paradigm of sixth-generation warfare, emphasizing integrated capabilities, information dominance, and multi-domain operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;air-superiority-in-modern-conflict&quot;&gt;Air Superiority in Modern Conflict&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Russia and Ukraine have experienced the consequences of failing to secure air superiority, resulting in a protracted, attrition-based conflict. This underscores that while warfare’s character evolves rapidly, certain principles—including air superiority—remain essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the concept of air superiority itself is evolving to encompass control of the electromagnetic spectrum, integration of kinetic and non-kinetic effects, and employment of autonomous systems. Future air operations will require this expanded understanding of air superiority to address increasingly complex and interconnected operational variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;deterrence-recalibration&quot;&gt;Deterrence Recalibration&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukraine crisis has reinforced the fundamental elements of effective deterrence:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical capability:&lt;/strong&gt; Ensuring forces possess necessary equipment and technology&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capacity:&lt;/strong&gt; Maintaining sufficient quantities of platforms and weapons&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Credibility:&lt;/strong&gt; Combining capability, capacity, and readiness to establish a believable deterrent posture&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experts emphasize the need to avoid a “cliff edge” between conventional and nuclear options, instead providing graduated deterrent options that offer political leaders flexibility in responding to escalation. An optimally balanced force structure should include capabilities across the entire conflict spectrum, from low-intensity operations to high-end warfighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-continuous-adaptation-as-the-new-military-imperative&quot;&gt;Conclusion: Continuous Adaptation as the New Military Imperative&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;beyond-static-solutions&quot;&gt;Beyond Static Solutions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A central theme emerging from the Ukraine conflict is the need for continuous evolution in military capabilities, doctrines, and organizations. As Air Marshal Stringer observes, “better never stops”—leaders should reject the notion of achieving perfect end states for military capabilities. Instead, military effectiveness increasingly depends on continuous testing, experimentation, and validation of approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mindset represents a significant departure from traditional military procurement and doctrine development, which seeks definitive solutions to military problems. In the rapidly evolving environment revealed in Ukraine, such static approaches quickly become obsolete against technological and tactical innovations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;realistic-training-for-complex-environments&quot;&gt;Realistic Training for Complex Environments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lessons from Ukraine underscore the importance of incorporating realistic conditions into military training and exercises, including electromagnetically contested environments, logistics challenges and disruptions, hybrid threats across multiple domains, and operations with degraded communications and command and control systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Lieutenant General Landrum emphasizes, “we have to practice, train, and exercise” these capabilities during peacetime to ensure their effectiveness in crisis or conflict. This approach requires directly confronting difficult operational problems rather than “wishing . . . [them] away” in training environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;alliance-coordination-and-public-private-integration&quot;&gt;Alliance Coordination and Public-Private Integration&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukraine conflict demonstrates the critical importance of collaboration between military, government, and commercial entities across multiple domains, including managing shared electromagnetic spectrum use, integrating commercial space capabilities into military operations, developing new models for public-private logistics partnerships, and leveraging commercial technology development for military applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These partnerships require innovative approaches that balance commercial efficiency with military resilience requirements, creating effective systems for both peacetime and conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The five dimensions examined in this paper—autonomous systems, information operations, electronic warfare, resilient logistics, and adaptive air defense—represent interconnected and mutually reinforcing aspects of modern warfare. Future success will depend on mastering these domains while developing organizational structures and doctrines that facilitate continuous adaptation to emerging challenges. The Ukraine conflict suggests that military forces must embrace perpetual evolution rather than seeking static solutions to dynamic problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As armed forces worldwide adapt their planning, acquisition, and strategic processes, the military organizations that internalize these lessons—embracing technological innovation, organizational adaptability, and operational resilience—will be best positioned to succeed in the complex security environment of the twenty-first century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russia-Ukraine conflict has captivated global attention, revealing a new chapter in the evolution of warfare—one defined by resilience, innovation, and multidomain engagement. From ground offensives to cyberattacks and the contested use of space, this war has challenged traditional military assumptions and reshaped strategic thinking. Conflict in Focus, a limited event series from CSIS running from February–March 2025, explored these developments through in-depth conversations with military fellows and expert guests. Each episode centered on a key domain—air, land, maritime, cyber, and space—drawing on firsthand experience to unpack the lessons of modern conflict and implications for future wars. This paper recaps these episodes and provides the main takeaways and conclusions from each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the conditions of the Russia-Ukraine War are unique, many of its features offer critical insights for anticipating future large-scale conflicts. The lack of clear air superiority, contested space access, and the widespread use of low-cost drones and defensive fortifications point to enduring trends in warfare. Yet, notable absences—such as U.S. stealth capabilities, nuclear deterrence, and expansive naval power—are a reminder that every conflict has its own character. For military professionals, policymakers, and strategists, understanding both the innovations and limitations of this war is essential. As future adversaries adapt and evolve, the enduring lesson is clear: ccess will belong to those who can integrate all instruments of power to gain and maintain the advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;land-domain-lessons-from-russia-ukraine&quot;&gt;Land Domain Lessons from Russia-Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This panel featured Colonel Roman Kostenko, Ukrainian member of parliament; Lieutenant General (Ret.) Ben Hodges, former commander, U.S. Army Europe; and Dr. Benjamin Jensen, CSIS senior fellow; and was moderated by Colonel Scott Pence, CSIS military fellow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-operational-context&quot;&gt;Key Operational Context&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion began with an overview of how the Russia-Ukraine conflict evolved from February 2022 through the end of 2024:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In February 2022, the Russian invasion was launched along multiple axes (north from Belarus toward Kyiv, east from Donbas toward Kharkiv, and south from Crimea toward Kherson).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Initial Russian advances were repelled around Kyiv by April 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ukraine recaptured territory in Kharkiv (September 2022) and Kherson (November 2022).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The war then settled into attritional trench warfare with relatively static frontlines throughout 2023–24.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ukraine launched a surprise incursion into Russia’s Kursk region in August 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current battlefield stretches approximately 1,000 miles, with 500 miles of active contact, where approximately 400,000 Russian troops face 250,000 Ukrainian soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;major-themes-and-insights&quot;&gt;Major Themes and Insights&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;UKRAINE’S STRATEGIC NEEDS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kostenko emphasized that while Ukraine requires a consistent and uninterrupted weapons supply, true victory will depend on diplomatic efforts as well as military strength. He stressed that Western partners must distinguish between “stopping the war” and “defeating Russia,” arguing that Ukraine needs strategic support to achieve victory, not merely to hold defensive positions. Hodges added that Ukraine’s greatest challenge lies in maintaining confidence that the United States and Europe will continue supporting them, rather than pressuring Kyiv into a settlement that sacrifices Ukrainian territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE KURSK INCURSION: A STRATEGIC MASTERSTROKE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The August 2024 Ukrainian incursion into Russia’s Kursk region was highlighted as a significant strategic success. Jensen noted that Ukraine demonstrated the ability to restore mobility on a static front by attacking a “gap” in Russian defenses rather than a heavily fortified “surface.” The operation showcased Ukrainian mastery of maneuver warfare principles, effectively combining drones, electronic warfare, and mobility corridors. Hodges emphasized that Ukraine achieved tactical surprise despite Russia’s advanced drone and surveillance capabilities, exposed Russia’s command and control weaknesses—particularly the friction between Federal Security Service (FSB) border forces and the General Staff—and created strategic dilemmas by forcing Russian resource reallocations. He argued that the operation not only provided Ukraine leverage for future negotiations but also challenged the narrative of Russian invincibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MODERN COMBINED ARMS AND TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Panelists discussed how the character of warfare is evolving. Jensen emphasized the need for “super soldiers” capable of rapidly adapting to new technologies, pointing out how Ukrainian civilians quickly transformed into effective fighters. He stressed the importance of building systems designed to adapt as multiple technologies emerge and highlighted the challenge of turning tactical innovations into operational advantages. Regarding armored warfare, both Hodges and Jensen agreed that while tanks remain valuable, they must be used differently: Poorly trained and poorly employed tanks have proven easy prey for drones. Future tank designs, they suggested, might feature unmanned turrets, lighter armor, and integrated electronic warfare capabilities, with Jensen envisioning tanks as mobile power platforms supporting electronic warfare and drone operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE TRANSPARENT BATTLEFIELD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kostenko described how drones and satellites have rendered the battlefield almost fully transparent to both sides, making rapid, large-scale advances—like those seen during World War II—nearly impossible. Surprise attacks are now feasible only at the scale of a few brigades or smaller units. Jensen and Hodges emphasized the critical need for deception operations and signature management (visual, thermal, and electronic) to maintain operational surprise. They warned that U.S. forces are currently undertrained in the use of decoys and stressed that while new camouflage technologies can reduce detectability, disciplined execution is essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;COMMAND AND CONTROL CHALLENGES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jensen highlighted Ukraine’s limitations in command and control. Ukraine currently lacks division- and corps-level structures, resulting in multiple brigades reporting directly to higher headquarters, which creates inefficiencies in resource use and coordination of combat power. In contrast, Russia maintains appropriate hierarchical command structures but struggles with leadership instability, corruption, and political interference, undermining its effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE NORTH KOREAN DIMENSION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panel also addressed the role of North Korean troops fighting alongside Russian forces. Kostenko observed that while North Korean soldiers are well-trained, they rely on outdated tactics from the 1960s and 70s, advancing in large formations that make them vulnerable to modern drone warfare. Jensen noted that this development signals an early stage of broader international conflict, suggesting, “We’re already in World War III.” He pointed out the difficulty of coalition warfare without interoperability and reported that heavy casualties have forced North Korean units to be pulled from the front lines. This situation, he argued, challenges traditional notions of lethality, as physically fit soldiers are now being killed by drone operators operating at a distance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;INDIRECT FIRES AND MANEUVER&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jensen discussed how modern warfare demands the integration of electronic warfare with both direct and indirect fires. He explained how Russia successfully neutralized High Mobility Artillery Rockets System (HIMARS) effectiveness through GPS jamming but continues to struggle with synchronizing operational-level fires. He emphasized that achieving breakthroughs remains costly without well-executed deception or synchronized fires capable of overwhelming enemy defenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ENDURANCE: THE PATH TO VICTORY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hodges stressed the importance of endurance for Ukraine’s ultimate success. While Ukraine does not face a manpower shortage, he explained, it does suffer from a shortage of trained soldiers. He suggested greater integration of women into military roles and emphasized the importance of ensuring families that their loved ones will receive proper training. Despite the challenges, he suggested Ukraine will remain strong, with over 60 percent of the population opposing any territorial concessions. Jensen concluded that the war is likely to end through a combination of strategic defense and creative offensive actions. He argued that sustained economic pressure on Russia—through measures like oil price manipulation and sanctions—is critical. Ukraine’s successful drone strikes against Russian refineries demonstrate the potential of such pressure. Ultimately, he said, the West must force Russia into a strategic dilemma: “Bleed in Ukraine or go broke in Moscow.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-takeaways&quot;&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panelists emphasized several crucial points for Western policymakers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Supporting Ukraine is not charity; it serves U.S. strategic interests and deters China.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Greater economic pressure on Russia should complement military support.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maintaining Western will to support Ukraine will be the decisive factor for a Ukrainian victory.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Future land warfare will require greater integration of traditional combined arms with electronic warfare, drones, and deception operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This conflict represents a watershed moment in the evolution of land warfare, with critical lessons about integration of technology, the importance of adaptability, and the enduring human role in modern combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;maritime-domain-lessons-from-russia-ukraine&quot;&gt;Maritime Domain Lessons from Russia-Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This panel discussion featured Rear Admiral Mike Mattis, director of strategic effects, U.S. Naval Forces Europe/Africa; Dr. Rebecca Grant, vice president, Lexington Institute; and Dr. Stacie Pettyjohn, senior fellow and director, Defense Program, Center for New American Security; and was moderated by Captain Quinton Packard, CSIS military fellow. The panel examined how Ukraine, a nation with virtually no navy, successfully challenged Russia’s formidable Black Sea Fleet through innovative asymmetric warfare. Despite Russia’s overwhelming naval superiority at the start of the invasion, Ukraine has denied Russia sea control and inflicted heavy losses on the Black Sea Fleet using unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), cruise missiles, and other asymmetric approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-black-sea-maritime-conflict&quot;&gt;The Black Sea Maritime Conflict&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mattis detailed the conflict’s maritime evolution: First, Ukraine used mines around Odesa to prevent an amphibious landing and deployed coastal defense cruise missiles (Harpoon and Neptune) to create an initial sea denial zone. After Russia terminated the Black Sea Grain Initiative in July 2023 and attempted to blockade Ukrainian ports, Ukraine responded with USV attacks against Russian warships, pushing the fleet further back. By January 2024, Ukraine had sunk multiple Russian vessels using USVs, including a Raptor-class patrol boat, a Ropucha-class landing ship, and a Bykov-class corvette. These losses prompted leadership changes in the Russian Navy and forced Russia’s fleet to retreat to Novorossiysk and create a defensive bastion around the Kerch Strait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mattis outlined Ukraine’s four maritime objectives and its success so far at achieving each:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prevent invasion from the sea. Ukraine has successfully achieved this objective through mines and coastal defense cruise missiles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prevent missile attacks from the sea. Ukraine has partially achieved this objective; Russian vessels can still launch Kalibr cruise missiles but must quickly return to port rather than remaining deployed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prevent a blockade. Ukraine has successfully achieved this objective; it now exports more grain than before the war.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prevent resupply ashore. Ukraine has been partially successful in achieving this objective; Russian naval logistics to Crimea and Syria have been severely disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s primary objective to protect Crimea has been partly maintained, but Russia’s armed forces have lost effective use of Sevastopol, their main naval base. Overall, Russia has failed to achieve most of its maritime objectives (amphibious invasion, effective missile attacks, and blockade), with its only success being the continued occupation of Crimea through land routes rather than maritime supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-technologies-and-tactics&quot;&gt;Key Technologies and Tactics&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Panelists outlined how Ukraine’s success has relied on several key capabilities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unmanned surface vessels:&lt;/strong&gt; Maritime drones such as the “Sea Baby” have proven effective in constrained waters, conducting kamikaze attacks and serving as platforms for other weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diversified drone capabilities:&lt;/strong&gt; Ukraine has developed modular USVs with various capabilities, including some equipped with air-to-air missiles (which have successfully taken down Russian helicopters), quadcopters for aerial reconnaissance, and cannons for surface threats.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coordinated multi-axis tactics:&lt;/strong&gt; Videos have shown USVs operating in coordinated packs, with some drones herding Russian ships into deeper waters where they could be engaged by other drone groups.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integration with deep strike capabilities:&lt;/strong&gt; When Russian ships retreated to ports, Ukraine shifted to attacking them with deep strike missiles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;evolution-of-the-maritime-battle&quot;&gt;Evolution of the Maritime Battle&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panelists emphasized that this is a dynamic contest of adaptation and counteradaptation. Early USV attacks exploited Russian unpreparedness and lack of effective countermeasures. In response, Russia increased air surveillance (helicopters and tactical aircraft) over the Black Sea, significantly reducing USV survivability. By mid-2024, Ukraine found it “10 times harder” to get USVs from Odesa to strike targets near Novorossiysk due to increased Russian air patrols.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine responded by developing USVs with air defense capabilities to target Russian helicopters, creating diversified drone groups, and exploring undersea drones for greater survivability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panel emphasized that this pattern of move and countermove will continue to evolve, with the advantage going to whichever side can innovate faster and stay ahead of its opponent’s defensive measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;transferability-to-other-theaters&quot;&gt;Transferability to Other Theaters&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panel discussed whether Ukraine’s maritime drone successes could transfer to other conflict zones. They pointed out that the Black Sea’s unique characteristics (enclosed sea with limited access through the Bosphorus, which Turkey closed to additional Russian warships) created advantages for Ukraine that could be relevant in other constrained waters like the Baltic Sea, Taiwan Strait, and parts of the South China Sea, but would be less effective in open ocean environments like the Philippine Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, USVs offer a relatively low-cost method for smaller powers to deny sea control to larger naval forces in restricted waters near their shores. Pettyjohn noted this approach could significantly enhance Taiwan’s “porcupine defense” strategy with layers of anti-ship cruise missiles supplemented by USVs and aerial drones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;implications-for-future-naval-operations&quot;&gt;Implications for Future Naval Operations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion highlighted several implications for naval warfare:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need for counter capabilities:&lt;/strong&gt; Mattis called the Black Sea conflict a “warning shot to conventional navies,” which must develop capabilities to counter threats from USVs and unmanned aerial systems (UASs).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost-imposing strategies:&lt;/strong&gt; Pettyjohn compared USV swarms to the Houthi campaign against shipping in the Red Sea, where inexpensive drones have forced adversaries to expend costly missiles and resources, creating favorable cost-exchange ratios for the attacker.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integration with air power:&lt;/strong&gt; Grant emphasized the unique conditions of the Black Sea conflict, where Russia and Ukraine have an “air power stalemate.” She questioned how USV tactics would work against a high-end air force able to establish air superiority.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All-domain integration:&lt;/strong&gt; Mattis stressed that unmanned systems alone are insufficient—the most effective approaches integrate hybrid effects across multiple domains (sea, air, land, cyber, space) to overwhelm an adversary’s defenses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proliferation risk:&lt;/strong&gt; The panel agreed that these capabilities will likely proliferate to various actors, including nonstate groups like Hezbollah or the Houthis, posing challenges for maritime security globally.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-takeaways-1&quot;&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panelists concluded with their most important takeaways from the Black Sea conflict:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The maritime domain is more conducive to drone-enabled strategic effects than the land domain, where defensive measures create “a drone hellscape.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is an action-reaction-counteraction fight requiring constant innovation and adaptation—there are no permanent solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States needs to accelerate unmanned vessel tactics and operations but integrate them with existing naval capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cost-effective counters to USVs are essential, as this technology will likely proliferate rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unmanned systems are not a complete solution but one piece of a larger puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Drones are not direct substitutes for conventional platforms like aircraft carriers, submarines, or destroyers—they complement rather than replace these systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Traditional capabilities like air superiority should not be discounted.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panelists agreed that the future of naval warfare will require effectively integrating unmanned systems within conventional force structures, developing both offensive capabilities and defensive countermeasures, and maintaining the ability to rapidly adapt as adversaries evolve their own approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;human-domain-lessons-from-russia-ukraine&quot;&gt;Human Domain Lessons from Russia-Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This panel discussion included insights from Lieutenant Colonel Volodymyr Dutko of the Ukrainian Army; Colonel (Ret.) Mark Cancian, CSIS senior adviser; Lieutenant General (Ret.) David Barno, professor at Johns Hopkins University; and Dr. Ben Connable, adjunct professor of security studies at Georgetown University. The discussion was moderated by Colonel Scott Pence, CSIS military fellow. The panel examined how this war—described as “the first epic land conflict of the twenty-first century”—offers crucial lessons about warfare’s human elements that remain constant despite technological advances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-human-toll-and-psychological-impact&quot;&gt;The Human Toll and Psychological Impact&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The immense psychological burden commanders and soldiers face in modern warfare was a central theme of the panel. Dutko described the emotional strain of leadership: “You are responsible for human life, and you need to execute the different types of mission[s] . . . to protect native land, homes, relatives, or people, and to minimize casualty.” He noted the emotional preparation required before missions, knowing people might not return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experts highlighted the war’s devastating casualty rates, with reports of approximately 430,000 Russian and 60,000 Ukrainian casualties—figures that dwarf recent U.S. military operations. This scale of loss creates tremendous psychological pressure that most Western militaries have not experienced in generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The constant exposure to danger presents a challenge unlike anything in recent U.S. military experience. Barno emphasized that unlike the episodic combat experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan, where troops could return to secure bases with amenities, the Ukraine war features “perpetual, continual, unending exposure to danger.” This sustained combat stress tests resilience in ways that U.S. forces, for comparison, have not faced since Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing on lessons from Ukraine and wargaming a potential conflict, Cancian offers a sobering prediction of what U.S. forces might face in a future conflict with China: troops arriving at bases surrounded by wreckage, with hundreds of destroyed aircraft, improvised cemeteries, and hospitals filled with wounded. “This is an experience that we have not had, really, for 70 years,” he noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;will-to-fight-and-adaptation&quot;&gt;Will to Fight and Adaptation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connable emphasized that despite technological changes, warfare fundamentally remains “a contest of two opposing, hostile, and irreconcilable wills.” He criticized how military planners often acknowledge this principle theoretically but fail to properly assess and understand it practically. This failure led to misjudgments about both Russian and Ukrainian will to fight at the war’s outset, continuing a pattern seen in U.S. conflicts in Afghanistan, Vietnam, and Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experts identified the importance of adaptation as perhaps the most critical lesson from the conflict. Ukrainian and Russian forces have demonstrated remarkable speed in adapting tactics, techniques, and technologies. Barno observed that both sides are “moving at a pace that I think any other military in the world would have great difficulty replicating, to include the U.S. military.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This adaptability extends to drone warfare, where both sides are continually developing countermeasures against electronic warfare tactics. Dutko described this ongoing evolution as “development and blocking since development,” referring to how quickly jammers adapt to new drone communication frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;drones-and-the-changing-battlefield&quot;&gt;Drones and the Changing Battlefield&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panel identified drone proliferation as a transformative element, though they differed on whether to call it a “gamechanger.” The experts noted that while drones will likely be important in future conflicts, larger systems like Predator and Reaper are expected to be more prominent than small, expendable drones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barno warned that the United States is “behind in drone warfare,” failing to learn from the realities that Ukrainians and Russians face daily. Beyond the technical challenges drones present, he also highlighted the psychological impact of “having a machine looking at you all the time that is devoted to killing you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panel discussed recent innovations like fiber-optic-controlled drones that cannot be jammed by electronic warfare systems. While not invincible, these drones represent the rapid technological evolution occurring on the battlefield. Connable provided important context, noting that drones have been part of warfare since World War II, with significant deployment since the 1980s. He cautioned against overgeneralizations, pointing out the unique conditions in Ukraine—a static 1,200-kilometer front line and industrial bases feeding endless drones—that may not exist in other conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;tanks-and-combined-arms&quot;&gt;Tanks and Combined Arms&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experts explored whether tanks still have relevance on modern battlefields. While Russian forces have suffered thousands of tank losses, Cancian noted that similar losses occurred in the Battle of Kursk during World War II without rendering tanks obsolete. Connable, citing his study of 423 modern battles, including 61 in Ukraine, asserts that tanks remain critical by providing “shock, speed, [and] mobile protected firepower up to the line of contact.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panel agreed that tanks are now “vulnerable but useful,” with their future effectiveness hinging on cost dynamics: How many multimillion-dollar tanks can militaries afford if they can be destroyed by swarms of thousand-dollar drones? Dutko emphasized that the psychological impact of tanks remains powerful, especially when used in coordinated assaults with infantry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;surprise-in-modern-warfare&quot;&gt;Surprise in Modern Warfare&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite claims about “transparent battlefields,” the panel affirmed that surprise remains possible at tactical and strategic levels. Cancian identified four types of surprise evident in this conflict: strategic (the war’s occurrence), technical (drone developments), political/diplomatic (NATO expansion), and battlefield (ongoing trench warfare resembling World War I).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experts agreed that while more sensors make hiding harder, deception and concealment remain important. As Dutko explained, forces now “try to conceal in different forests, buildings,” to hide as much as possible. Connable rejected the notion that technological advances will eliminate surprise, saying that “if it were [completely transparent] then nobody would be fighting anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;north-korean-involvement&quot;&gt;North Korean Involvement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panel discussed the 2024 addition of North Korean troops, whose human wave tactics have reportedly led to thousands of casualties, creating psychological challenges for defenders forced to kill large numbers of attackers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connable cited reports of Ukrainian machine gunners needing to be pulled off the line because they were killing so many North Koreans, echoing similar psychological trauma from the Iran-Iraq War. Barno identified this as an overlooked aspect of combat: “The psychological impact of killing is probably underestimated, especially killing masses of your adversary.” He questioned how militaries can prepare soldiers for this reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panel also noted that North Korea’s participation in this conflict marks its first battlefield experience since 1953, potentially making its military more capable for future conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-takeaways-2&quot;&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experts emphasized several key takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Surprise is inevitable in warfare—the focus should be on coping with it rather than avoiding it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Precision weapons face new challenges due to widespread jamming and countermeasures.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cyber warfare proved less decisive than many predicted.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;War remains fundamentally about people and physical control of territory, as summarized by Cancian: “If you really want to control it, occupy it, then you have to do it the same way the Roman legions did.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barno concluded by questioning whether the U.S. military is adequately preparing for adaptation: “How much time and energy and effort gets put into instilling a culture of rapid adaptation once you get in a battle where things don’t look like what you expected?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion emphasized that despite technological evolution, warfare’s human dimension remains paramount. The psychological burden of combat, the will to fight, and the capacity to adapt remain decisive factors that can determine victory or defeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;defense-industrial-base-lessons-from-russia-ukraine&quot;&gt;Defense Industrial Base Lessons from Russia-Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panel covered lessons for the defense industrial base and featured experts with firsthand experience in Ukraine’s defense innovation ecosystem: Dr. Phillip Karber, professor of military strategy and warfighting at the Eisenhower School; Mark Valentine, president and general manager of global government at Skydio; and Kateryna Bondar, CSIS fellow. The discussion was moderated by Captain Luke Slivinski, CSIS military fellow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;historical-context-and-industrial-base-transformation&quot;&gt;Historical Context and Industrial Base Transformation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PREWAR DEFENSE INDUSTRY CHALLENGES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the 2014 conflict, Ukraine’s defense industry faced systematic challenges. As Karber noted, approximately 43 percent of Russian weapon components came from Ukraine. The state conglomerate Ukroboronprom prioritized foreign military sales and employment over Ukraine’s own defense needs. Bondar highlighted that there appeared to be a targeted effort to weaken Ukraine’s defense industrial independence during President Yanukovych’s pro-Russia administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major prewar defense industry issues included underfunding of new developments, massive outflow of engineering talent due to lack of investment, and difficulties integrating Western technologies with Soviet legacy systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EVOLUTION AFTER THE 2014 CONFLICT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial 2014 conflict sparked the beginnings of transformation. Both volunteer groups and established defense entities began developing solutions to battlefield challenges. Software engineers created situational awareness and fire control systems when they recognized frontline troops lacked such capabilities. This organic response created the foundation for systems like Delta and Kropyva that were later formally adopted by Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;FULL-SCALE INVASION IMPACT AND RESPONSE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2022 full-scale Russian invasion dramatically accelerated transformation of Ukraine’s defense industrial base. Key developments included the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Civilian-military fusion:&lt;/strong&gt; Bondar described the development of “civil-military fusion in the Ukrainian way,” with IT professionals and engineers either joining the armed forces directly or providing technical support.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decentralized innovation:&lt;/strong&gt; Beyond formal defense industries, entrepreneurs and small groups emerged as significant innovation sources.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infrastructure damage:&lt;/strong&gt; Approximately 43 percent of Ukraine’s defense industrial facilities have been struck by Russian missiles. Karber highlighted one particularly devastating strike on a design bureau, in which 40 staff members who chose to continue working through air raid alarms were killed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Western equipment maintenance:&lt;/strong&gt; The Ukrainian defense industry pivoted to maintaining and modifying Western equipment, which often arrived with issues (dead batteries, missing reactive armor, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;rapid-innovation-cycles-and-field-testing&quot;&gt;Rapid Innovation Cycles and Field Testing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most emphasized insight from all the panelists was the unprecedented speed of innovation cycles in Ukraine. Karber observed that major changes in drone technology occur approximately every six months—dramatically faster than typical Western defense acquisition timelines. “We in the West, including the United States, are just not keeping up. It takes us six years to get it designed,” he noted. For software-based weapons systems, Bondar indicated the innovation cycle could be as short as one to two weeks, with immediate battlefield testing and feedback loops. Valentine highlighted how traditional U.S. acquisition processes rely on requirements developed years before contracts are awarded, often based on lessons from previous conflicts rather than emerging threats. He explained how Skydio’s drones, designed for U.S. military needs from the Iraq and Afghanistan era—where the United States controlled the airspace and spectrum—initially failed in Ukraine’s contested electronic environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;forward-deployed-engineers&quot;&gt;Forward-Deployed Engineers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A critical factor identified as enabling rapid innovation was the direct connection between developers and frontline users:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embedded development:&lt;/strong&gt; Valentine described deploying 20–30 multidisciplinary teams to Ukraine monthly, eventually establishing a permanent presence including Ukrainian engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organic process:&lt;/strong&gt; Bondar explained the process was not formally designed, but rather emerged naturally due to widespread mobilization—many engineers had friends or family at the front, creating direct feedback channels.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Combat experience:&lt;/strong&gt; Karber described seeing drones constructed in brigade workshops by scientists who were integrated into military units and taking direct feedback from combat operators.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;drone-warfare-evolution-and-challenges&quot;&gt;Drone Warfare Evolution and Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PROLIFERATION AND TACTICAL IMPACT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Karber detailed the progression from limited drone availability in 2014–15 to nearly company-level drone operations today. This proliferation has fundamentally changed battlefield dynamics, rendering previously survivable platforms like tanks highly vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ELECTRONIC WARFARE CHALLENGES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Russia and Ukraine rapidly developed electronic warfare capabilities. Early Ukrainian drones (like U.S.-provided Ravens) were vulnerable to Russian electronic warfare, sometimes being captured and turned against Ukrainian forces. Skydio had to transition from single-band radios to multi-band frequency-hopping capabilities to counter jamming. Visual inertial odometry technology also helped counter GPS jamming and spoofing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;FUTURE DIRECTIONS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panel discussed several emerging trends:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human-to-machine ratio evolution:&lt;/strong&gt; Valentine traced the evolution from MQ-1 drones, which require 60–70 personnel per drone, to one-to-one operator/drone relationships, to future concepts of one operator controlling multiple autonomous systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swarm development:&lt;/strong&gt; While true autonomous swarm capabilities remain experimental, multiple panelists identified this as a likely future direction. Bondar emphasized that effective swarms require sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) for autonomous decisionmaking and navigation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remote operations centers:&lt;/strong&gt; Valentine described an interim step between current operations and full swarm autonomy—operations centers where small teams could control hundreds or thousands of semiautonomous drones.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;supply-chain-and-production-scale-challenges&quot;&gt;Supply Chain and Production Scale Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SCALE REQUIREMENTS FOR PEER CONFLICT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Valentine highlighted the unprecedented scale of drone usage: “In certain phases of the war, the Ukrainians were going through 10,000 small drones a month.” He noted that existing U.S. stockpiles would only last about a month and a half at such consumption rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;STRATEGIC SUPPLY VULNERABILITIES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critical components like sensors, batteries, and chips often have international supply chains vulnerable to disruption. Valentine recounted how Skydio was sanctioned by China, cutting off access to battery components and forcing urgent development of Western alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;REGULATORY BARRIERS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several regulatory barriers were identified as hampering U.S.-Ukrainian cooperation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ITAR restrictions:&lt;/strong&gt; The International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) create significant challenges for technology transfer and collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Export control classifications:&lt;/strong&gt; Valentine noted that commercially available components (like thermal sensors available on Amazon) become highly restricted when incorporated into drone systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security classifications:&lt;/strong&gt; Karber mentioned difficulties providing Ukrainians with secure help due to classification restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;post-conflict-considerations-and-deterrence&quot;&gt;Post-Conflict Considerations and Deterrence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CEASEFIRE CHALLENGES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Karber emphasized that any potential ceasefire would face significant challenges. For one, Ukraine would need to maintain forces along a 2,000-kilometer potential front. Beyond that, Russia has historically violated previous agreements (Minsk I, Minsk II, Budapest, Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty). Without external enforcement, a ceasefire would be “inherently unstable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;REQUIREMENTS FOR LONG-TERM DETERRENCE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panel identified several requirements for sustainable Ukrainian security:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-sufficient defense industry:&lt;/strong&gt; Bondar emphasized the need for talent, funding, investment, and technology transfer to rebuild Ukrainian defense capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allied support:&lt;/strong&gt; Given the long-term nature of building defense industrial capacity, continued Western support is essential to “fill the gap.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Credible deterrence:&lt;/strong&gt; Valentine stressed that deterrence depends on demonstrating the capability to impose unacceptable costs on an adversary.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;policy-recommendations&quot;&gt;Policy Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panel offered several recommendations for U.S. policymakers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Streamline collaboration.&lt;/strong&gt; Reform ITAR and export control processes to facilitate faster U.S.-Ukrainian cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create strategic partnerships.&lt;/strong&gt; Establish formal partnerships to expedite technology transfers with key allies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secure supply chains.&lt;/strong&gt; Consider Defense Production Act authorities to establish domestic production of critical components and stockpile materials.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support knowledge transfer.&lt;/strong&gt; Establish deeper information sharing about Ukrainian battlefield innovations and tactical applications.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider production scale.&lt;/strong&gt; Reassess U.S. production capacity to meet the consumption rates demonstrated in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plan for the long term.&lt;/strong&gt; Support rebuilding Ukraine’s indigenous defense industrial capacity through investment and technical assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russia-Ukraine conflict has demonstrated dramatic changes in modern warfare, particularly regarding the speed of innovation cycles, drone proliferation, and electronic warfare evolution. The traditional Western defense acquisition model struggles to match the pace of battlefield-driven innovation seen in Ukraine. For the United States to maintain technological superiority and support allies, significant adaptations in regulatory frameworks, supply chain security, and innovation methodologies will be necessary. As Valentine succinctly stated, “It’s about deterrence. And if we can’t demonstrate that we have the capability to do something, that’s how deterrence fails and wars start.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;air-and-space-domain-lessons-from-russia-ukraine&quot;&gt;Air and Space Domain Lessons from Russia-Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Part One&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This panel, part one of two sessions, featured Austin Gray, cofounder of Blue Water Autonomy, and Major General Gregory Gagnon, deputy chief of space operations for intelligence at the U.S. Space Force. The event was moderated by Colonel Matthew Slusher, CSIS military fellow. Panelists discussed the impact of autonomous vehicles in warfare and the evolving role of space in modern conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;drone-warfare-evolution&quot;&gt;Drone Warfare Evolution&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gray, a former U.S. Navy intelligence officer with hands-on drone production experience inside of Ukraine, highlighted how autonomous vehicles have fundamentally transformed modern warfare thanks to several key characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extended range and reduced risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Drones allow forces to strike targets from greater distances while minimizing personnel exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accessible technology:&lt;/strong&gt; The hardware components for military drones are increasingly available through commercial channels, with many parts ordered from Amazon and Alibaba for Ukrainian production.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid development cycles:&lt;/strong&gt; Ukrainian forces update drone software nightly and hardware every few weeks, demonstrating agility that is impossible in traditional procurement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gray emphasized the importance of understanding cost and targeting dynamics through a framework where military assets are categorized along two axes: (1) cheap to expensive, and (2) easy to target versus difficult to target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This framework reveals the emergence of a critical middle category between expendable/attritable assets (like ammunition or infantry) and expensive survivable assets (like carrier groups). Autonomous systems like collaborative combat aircraft (CCA) occupy this middle space, where they are valuable enough to not be expendable but can take on dangerous missions without risking human lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gray argued that the U.S. defense procurement culture needs to shift toward a portfolio approach that embraces more risk-taking and competition between providers. He anticipates the main technological advancements will come not from breakthrough capabilities but from better integration of existing hardware and software, creating more resilient mesh networks and improved command and control systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;space-domain-insights&quot;&gt;Space Domain Insights&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gagnon offered critical observations about space operations in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which are summarized below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;INFORMATION CONFRONTATION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s Viasat cyberattack leading up to the invasion exemplified its “information confrontation” doctrine, which employs two types of control: (1) technical information, using cyber and electronic warfare to control communications; and (2) political information, controlling messaging and narratives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though intended to disrupt Ukrainian command and control, the attack had unintended consequences, affecting wind turbines in Germany and internet services across Europe. This demonstrated how gaining cyber and space superiority is an early objective in modern campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;RUSSIAN MILITARY FAILURES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being the world’s third most powerful conventional army prior to the invasion, Russia has failed to achieve space superiority in the conflict. There are a number of key factors for this failure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no professional non-commissioned officer corps capable of executing combined arms operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There has been an inability to integrate space assets into the “reconnaissance strike complex” due to organizational silos.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia has been unable to counter commercial satellite intelligence provided to Ukraine by Western partners.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CHINA-RUSSIA SPACE COOPERATION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conflict has accelerated concerning trends in Russia-China cooperation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chinese companies are providing commercial satellite imagery to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is growing economic integration between the two countries, including a 43 percent increase in bilateral trade in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China is supplying 90 percent of Russia’s microelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There has been increased joint military exercises including ground, maritime, and bomber operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;LOSS OF CONVENTIONAL SURPRISE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large conventional force buildups can no longer achieve strategic surprise thanks to the availability of commercial satellite imagery. Think tanks and news organizations could use satellite imagery to track and count Russian forces on Ukraine’s border before the invasion; Gagnon referred to this as the “commercial unblinking eye” that has the potential to benefit global security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;U.S. SPACE FORCE STRATEGY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. adversaries have increasingly weaponized space in recent years, and China is rapidly expanding its presence in space, adding 200 satellites per year in 2022 and 2023. In response to adversaries weaponizing space, the U.S. Space Force is taking steps to protect U.S. interests, including&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;moving from single, large satellites to proliferated architectures with increased resilience;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;increasing the number of U.S. satellites in space, with over 100 new satellites planned to be launched in 2025 alone;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;developing capabilities to protect U.S. assets and hold adversary assets at risk; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;countering China’s rapid space expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gagnon emphasized that the U.S. military’s reduced size—the Army is down from 732,000 personnel in 1990 to 445,000 personnel today, the Navy from 600 to 300 ships, and the Air Force from around 10,000 to around 5,000 aircraft—is only sustainable with space superiority. Without control of this high ground, a conflict with a peer competitor could resemble the stalemate in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-electromagnetic-spectrum-insights&quot;&gt;Key Electromagnetic Spectrum Insights&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both experts highlighted the critical importance of the electromagnetic spectrum in modern warfare. The electromagnetic spectrum is essential for targeting mobile assets from a distance and crucial for networking sensors, decisionmakers, and shooters. However, it is a domain in which the United States may have lost its edge after 20 years of fighting adversaries who didn’t challenge spectrum use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gray noted that despite electronic warfare and jamming attempts, drones continue to operate effectively through spectrum maneuver, resilient communications networks, and mesh networking principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-takeaways-3&quot;&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event highlighted several transformative lessons from the Russia-Ukraine conflict:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Drone proliferation is creating asymmetric opportunities for smaller forces and nonstate actors to challenge conventionally superior forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Space domain awareness has permanently altered the strategic calculus by eliminating the element of surprise for large conventional operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Force architecture evolution requires a spectrum of capabilities from expendable to survivable, with a critical middle zone of autonomous systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Human factors remain decisive; Russia’s failures have stemmed largely from organizational issues rather than technology gaps.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Space superiority is no longer optional but foundational to modern warfare, enabling smaller but more lethal conventional forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussions underscored the critical importance of investing in space capabilities, embracing autonomous systems, and developing professional military personnel who can execute combined arms operations in contested electromagnetic environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;air-and-space-domain-lessons-from-russia-ukraine-1&quot;&gt;Air and Space Domain Lessons from Russia-Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Part Two&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This panel was the second part of a CSIS event focused on air and space domain lessons from the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The discussion featured Lieutenant General Lance Landrum, former deputy chair of the NATO Military Committee, and Air Marshal Johnny Stringer, deputy commander of NATO Allied Air Command. The conversation, moderated by Colonel Matthew Slusher, explored critical insights about electronic warfare, contested logistics, air defense systems, drone warfare, and the future of NATO air doctrine in light of evolving modern warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;electronic-warfare&quot;&gt;Electronic Warfare&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE NEW CONTESTED ELECTROMAGNETIC ENVIRONMENT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Landrum emphasized that neither Russia nor Ukraine has achieved air superiority in this conflict, which has resulted in positional warfare and attrition. The contest for superiority in the electromagnetic spectrum is ongoing; unlike in Iraq and Afghanistan, where Western coalition forces operated uncontested in the electromagnetic environment, Ukraine represents a fully contested space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TECHNOLOGICAL REGRESSION AND ADAPTATION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Cold War, Western forces shed three decades of electromagnetic expertise, in both human capital and equipment modernization. Meanwhile, Russia formed specialized electromagnetic warfare units and developed capabilities that gave it superiority in certain areas. The conflict has demonstrated the vulnerability of GPS-dependent systems to jamming, forcing adaptation through alternative navigation methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;IMPACT ON MODERN SYSTEMS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly all modern systems rely on connectivity through the electromagnetic spectrum, making them vulnerable to interference. Specific examples include&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;jamming of GPS signals affecting autonomous systems’ navigation;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;disruption of communications networks;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;electronic eavesdropping and signals intelligence; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;tactical jamming of drone operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Landrum described how Russia initially operated small UASs in a specific frequency band. When Ukraine began jamming those frequencies effectively, Russia adapted by moving to different frequency bands, creating a temporary vulnerability window for Ukrainian forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;FUTURE DIRECTIONS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future systems will need to be “modern, agile, nimble, software-defined, and able to react and maneuver” within the electromagnetic space, as Landrum highlighted. Cognitive electronic warfare using machine learning and AI will be crucial for&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;rapidly sensing and analyzing the electromagnetic environment;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;automated decisionmaking at machine speed;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;deconflicting friendly systems from adversary jamming; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;managing the increasingly complex shared electromagnetic space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;contested-logistics&quot;&gt;Contested Logistics&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SUPPLY CHAIN VULNERABILITIES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukraine conflict has demonstrated the vulnerability of logistics centers, infrastructure, and transportation networks. Landrum noted that Western militaries have divested significant military logistics capabilities over decades, outsourcing to commercial industry for efficiency. This approach worked when operations had months of planning time in uncontested environments but is problematic when forces are facing contested spaces from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DISAGGREGATION FOR SURVIVAL&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key lesson is the need to disaggregate logistics and sustainment capabilities for survival while maintaining the ability to reaggregate them when needed. This presents significant command and control challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;INFRASTRUCTURE AND POLICY CHALLENGES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving forces across Europe faces numerous obstacles, such as road infrastructure and weight-bearing limitations, rail infrastructure and gauge changes in eastern Europe, inadequate port structures, customs regulations and border-crossing complexities, and the challenges associated with transporting hazardous materials across borders. Landrum emphasized that these procedures must be practiced and streamlined during peacetime operations to ensure smooth transitions during crises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;STOCKPILING AND SUPPLY CHAIN INNOVATION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russia-Ukraine conflict revealed inadequate stockpiling of critical munitions like artillery shells. With this in mind, future procurement strategies should&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;accept the cost of maintaining larger stockpiles;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;utilize additive manufacturing (e.g., 3D printing) for certain components;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;move away from proprietary systems toward interoperable solutions; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;improve command and control of disaggregated logistics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;air-defense-and-natos-adaptation&quot;&gt;Air Defense and NATO’s Adaptation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EVOLVING THREAT LANDSCAPE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evolving threat landscape has forced NATO to fundamentally rethink its approach to integrated air and missile defense. Stringer described how the modern battlefield now presents a dramatically expanded range of aerial threats, divided broadly into two categories. On the low end, inexpensive one-way attack drones and first-person view drones can be produced in the thousands, overwhelming traditional defenses through sheer volume. On the high end, advanced weapons like hypersonic missiles, including systems such as the AS-24 air-launched ballistic missile, pose existential challenges to existing detection and interception frameworks. This dual-threat environment demands a new level of speed, agility, and adaptability from NATO forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MULTILAYERED RESPONSE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response, NATO is developing a multilayered air and missile defense strategy built around several critical components. First, sensing capabilities must move beyond traditional radar systems, taking cues from Ukraine’s use of thousands of inexpensive acoustic sensors to detect incoming threats. Second, command and control structures must be modernized to facilitate faster, more flexible decisionmaking. Third, strategic force posturing and alert states must be recalibrated to reflect the dynamic threat environment, ensuring forces are ready to respond at varying levels of intensity. Finally, NATO must recognize that true defense requires a blend of both defensive and offensive actions—striking enemy launch sites and systems preemptively when necessary to blunt potential attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;AIR COMMAND AND CONTROL SYSTEMS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To support this evolving approach, NATO is making significant investments to enhance interoperability across its air command and control networks. This includes a renewed emphasis on standardization agreements to ensure common protocols and procedures across member states. Interoperability efforts also focus on bridging national air command and control systems, enabling seamless cooperation during joint operations. A modular approach to software development is replacing traditional monolithic systems, allowing NATO forces to rapidly integrate new technologies and tools. Additionally, intuitive user interfaces are being prioritized to reduce training burdens and increase system accessibility for operators. Supporting all of these initiatives is the cultivation of an agile development ecosystem that draws on multiple suppliers, fostering innovation and resilience across the alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;drone-warfare&quot;&gt;Drone Warfare&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DEMOCRATIZATION OF AIRPOWER&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stringer noted that drone technology has democratized airpower, allowing actors with limited resources to perform traditional airpower roles (air superiority, strike, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), and lift) at a fraction of the cost. This presents both challenges and opportunities for NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;HIGH-LOW MIX APPROACH&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While high-end military systems continue to grow more expensive, drones and related technologies provide opportunities for a “high-low mix” that can multiply effectiveness: Packaging cheaper drone systems with high-end weapons can reduce the number of expensive munitions needed, creating an effective increase in mass and weapons effectiveness&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BEYOND PLATFORM GENERATIONS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stringer argued that NATO should shift away from discussing generations of platforms (e.g., fifth-generation F-35) and instead focus on what sixth-generation warfare looks like—emphasizing integrated systems and combined capabilities rather than individual platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;future-of-nato-air-doctrine&quot;&gt;Future of NATO Air Doctrine&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;INTEGRATION AND UTILITY OF LEGACY SYSTEMS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both speakers emphasized that while new technologies are important, existing platforms can maintain utility through continuous upgrades of systems, imaginative employment strategies, and incorporation into broader, integrated force packages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CAPABILITY DEVELOPMENT THROUGH EXPERIMENTATION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO’s Allied Air Command is placing greater emphasis on capability development with new methods including weapons and tactics conferences (the first was held in 2023), high-end air exercises like Ramstein Flag, and synthetic training environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DETERRENCE THROUGH CREDIBILITY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effective deterrence requires forces with technical capability, sufficient capacity and numbers, and the credibility to win in a fight. Stringer emphasized integration across domains (multidomain operations) and providing a range of deterrent options that avoid a “cliff edge” between conventional and nuclear responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-takeaways-4&quot;&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Air superiority remains essential to prevent conflicts from devolving into costly attritional warfare.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Integration of kinetic and non-kinetic effects is becoming increasingly critical on the modern battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Greater use of autonomy and human-machine teaming is reshaping air operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Operating at machine speed through AI and advanced systems is now a necessity for maintaining an edge.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Continuous experimentation and validation are vital.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Stringer emphasized, NATO must relentlessly iterate and adapt to stay ahead of adversaries: “You’re never going to get to the place of perfection here. You have to be continually iterating what you’re doing so your opponents know that you are serious.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;space-and-data-domain-lessons-from-russia-ukraine&quot;&gt;Space and Data Domain Lessons from Russia-Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This panel discussion explored how space capabilities, data technologies, and commercial services have transformed warfare during the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Speakers were Giorgi Tskhakaia, adviser to Ukraine’s deputy prime minister and minister of digital transformation and innovations; Dr. David Gauthier, chief strategy officer of GXO Inc. and senior associate with the CSIS Aerospace Security Project; and Aaron Jaffe, senior vice president at Palantir. The discussion was moderated by Krista Auchenbach, CSIS visiting fellow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;digital-transformation-and-technological-adaptation&quot;&gt;Digital Transformation and Technological Adaptation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s Ministry of Digital Transformation has played a crucial role in the country’s resilience against Russia’s invasion. Established in 2019 to create a “government on a smartphone,” the ministry quickly adapted to wartime needs. The Diia app became essential for Ukrainians, providing digital passports that were recognized at international borders. The e-Enemy app allowed citizens to send valuable intelligence directly to the military, creating a crowdsourced intelligence network in the early days of the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the war began, Russia held superiority in conventional warfare aspects, including electronic warfare capabilities, ISR, artillery, and drone technologies. Ukraine compensated through technological innovation, moral superiority, and international support. Ukraine formed a cyber army of both professional and volunteer “ethical hackers” to defend critical infrastructure against Russian cyberattacks. Tskhakaia emphasized that “this is the war of technologies, of the minds,” noting that the character of the war continues to change dramatically every six months as new technologies emerge and countermeasures develop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;commercial-space-and-data-capabilities&quot;&gt;Commercial Space and Data Capabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war demonstrated how commercial satellite imagery could be effectively used for tactical battlefield operations rather than just strategic intelligence. Gauthier described how the U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency initially faced “bureaucratic challenges” and “cultural challenges” in providing direct, real-time satellite imagery to Ukrainian forces. The agency eventually established alternative dissemination paths through private industry companies, allowing raw imagery to flow directly to Ukrainian forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Radar imagery proves particularly valuable, enabling detection of Russian convoys through clouds and at night. Companies like Ursa Space use radar imagery to continuously monitor evacuation routes, check road clearance, and map damage to Ukraine’s electric grid infrastructure, supporting both military and civilian needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Radio frequency collection capabilities from firms like HawkEye 360 allow near-real-time mapping of GPS interference, helping Ukrainian forces identify and counter Russian electronic warfare activities. When Russia attempts to deny or attack remote sensing systems, private industry demonstrates remarkable resilience, finding ways to persist and adapt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;private-sector-partnerships-and-innovation&quot;&gt;Private Sector Partnerships and Innovation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panelists emphasized the critical importance of private sector partnerships in supporting Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jaffe highlighted how Palantir’s technologies, particularly AI features and computing power, significantly enhanced Ukraine’s capabilities. Palantir had to “evolve incredibly, incredibly quickly” to support changing on-the-ground conditions, he said, focusing on building meaningful common operating pictures by fusing disparate information, moving at the speed required by the dynamic intelligence and operational environment, and rapidly incorporating AI for imagery analysis and logistics automation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starlink’s deployment in Ukraine represented a “gamechanger” in the conflict, according to Tskhakaia. After Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov directly requested assistance from Elon Musk, the rapid response and deployment of Starlink terminals provided Ukraine with superior communication capabilities. This is one of the few areas where Ukraine has maintained a technological advantage over Russia, enabling reliable battlefield communications, coordination, and data flow throughout the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other companies like Amazon, Google, and Oracle have also provided valuable support. The panelists noted that private companies demonstrate greater flexibility and agility than government sectors in responding to Ukraine’s needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;technological-evolution-and-innovation-cycles&quot;&gt;Technological Evolution and Innovation Cycles&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One striking observation concerned the accelerated pace of technological innovation in Ukraine: From the onset of the war, Ukraine’s defense industrial base ballooned to over 500 companies producing various kinds of military equipment, including drones, unmanned ground vehicles, ammunition, and rockets. The Ukrainian government facilitated this growth by reducing regulatory requirements, creating tax incentives for military equipment producers, and enabling increased profit margins from 1 percent to 25 percent (above the 17 percent NATO average) to encourage risk-taking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tskhakaia noted that technological innovations in this conflict are typically replicated or countered within 6 to 12 months. This rapid cycle requires continuous innovation to maintain a battlefield advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;decisionmaking-and-the-ooda-loop&quot;&gt;Decisionmaking and the OODA Loop&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conflict has highlighted the critical importance of accelerating the “OODA” loop—observe, orient, decide, act. As Gauthier explained, commercial imagery and algorithmic warfare have significantly accelerated this cycle, allowing an “underdog” military to effectively counter a superior force relying on traditional doctrine and mass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jaffe emphasized that the primacy of decisions has shifted from incremental improvements to “one, two, three orders of magnitude faster” decisionmaking. Two key themes have emerged in this evolution:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integration:&lt;/strong&gt; Networks, warfighting functions, and supply chains are increasingly combined to bring stakeholders, information, and components together.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI incorporation:&lt;/strong&gt; AI is now used to improve detections, evaluate data, and make decisions at “the speed of relevance.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;shifting-the-power-dynamic-in-modern-warfare&quot;&gt;Shifting the Power Dynamic in Modern Warfare&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russia-Ukraine conflict has demonstrated that traditional military advantages like superior numbers of tanks or infantry are becoming less decisive. As Tskhakaia stated, “If you are not innovating constantly, you are going to be losing anyway.” The conflict has shown that technology and innovation are key factors in modern warfare, with data superiority providing significant advantages in decision quality and speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian experience of having a “transparent battlefield” has shifted the advantage from “hiders to finders,” creating a new dynamic in warfare. Drones, commercial satellite imagery, and advanced data analytics have fundamentally altered how military operations are conducted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;logistics-and-sustainment-are-warfighting-systems&quot;&gt;Logistics and Sustainment Are Warfighting Systems&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukraine conflict has underscored that logistics and sustainment systems are not merely administrative functions but critical warfighting systems. Jaffe noted that these systems directly constrain operational capabilities, making them “exceptionally integral” to operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Logistical networks challenges include&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;network interoperability issues across partner nations;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;disparities between advanced intelligence capabilities and basic sustainment systems;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;need for automation in logistics to enable “push” rather than “pull” models; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;importance of integrating the entire supply chain from frontline expenditure back to industrial base production.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-takeaways-5&quot;&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panelists concluded by sharing their main takeaways from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and implications for future wars:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information advantage and decision speed:&lt;/strong&gt; Commercial imagery and algorithmic warfare have enabled Ukraine to achieve tight decision cycles (OODA loops) against a superior military force. In future conflicts, systems designed to improve the quality and speed of decisions rather than simply processing information will gain an edge amid faster decision cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Direct delivery vs. curated intelligence:&lt;/strong&gt; Providing raw intelligence capabilities directly to frontline forces rather than curating solutions has allowed for innovative tactical use and adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Innovation cycles:&lt;/strong&gt; Technological advantages typically last at most a year before countermeasures are developed, requiring constant innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comprehensive integration:&lt;/strong&gt; Integration across networks, warfighting functions, and supply chains is essential and requires treating everything from the front line to the industrial base as one integrated system.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI as a force multiplier:&lt;/strong&gt; AI is transforming all domains from intelligence to logistics. Tskhakaia predicted that within a year, we’ll see “drones flying purely on AI” and AI-driven decisionmaking.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transparency and narrative control:&lt;/strong&gt; Commercial imagery helped Ukraine document Russian actions, bringing the reality of the conflict into living rooms worldwide and garnering international support. Despite technological shifts, the moral high ground remains a critical factor in sustained resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom-up innovation and user-centric design:&lt;/strong&gt; Providing tools directly to frontline forces enables innovative tactical solutions that would not emerge from top-down approaches, particularly when they can be easily adopted on smartphones with minimal training.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukraine conflict has become a testing ground for military technologies and operational concepts, accelerating innovation cycles and demonstrating how smaller nations can effectively counter larger adversaries through technology, adaptability, and international partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whole-of-society-resilience-lessons-from-russia-ukraine&quot;&gt;Whole of Society Resilience Lessons from Russia-Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This panel, which examined whole-of-society resilience lessons from the Russia-Ukraine War, featured Iryna Nykorak, Ukrainian member of parliament and founder of Arm Women Now; Kathleen McInnis, director of the CSIS Smart Women, Smart Power Initiative; and was moderated by Lieutenant Colonel Scott Murphy, CSIS military fellow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;bottom-up-resilience-the-foundation-of-ukraines-defense&quot;&gt;Bottom-Up Resilience: The Foundation of Ukraine’s Defense&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most significant insights highlighted throughout the discussion was that Ukraine’s successful resistance stemmed from a bottom-up approach rather than top-down government directives. Nykorak emphasized that Ukraine’s resilience came from its people, not its institutions: “This war has taught us many lessons, but perhaps the most important is this: Resilience is not built in institutions alone; it is built in people.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, thousands of Ukrainian civilians immediately volunteered for military service, while others supported the war effort as volunteers. Businesses donated supplies, and ordinary citizens found ways to contribute. This organic mobilization demonstrated a powerful will to fight that surprised many international observers who had predicted Ukraine would quickly fall due to Russia’s overwhelming military superiority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panelists noted that this grassroots, population-centric approach to national resilience represents a crucial lesson for other nations. Traditional security frameworks often focus on top-down, authority-directed preparations, but Ukraine’s experience suggests the importance of cultivating resilience at the population level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;womens-role-in-defense-and-the-evolution-of-military-equipment&quot;&gt;Women’s Role in Defense and the Evolution of Military Equipment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A substantial portion of the discussion centered on women’s contributions to Ukraine’s defense capabilities. Nykorak shared some remarkable statistics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ukraine has the largest number of women in combat positions globally.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over 70,000 women serve in the Ukrainian Armed Forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Approximately 50,000 women hold full combat positions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As of early 2025, about 25,000 women were actively serving at the front line (up from 5,000 in early 2024).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nykorak emphasized that “women are as capable as men of taking up arms and fighting” and have demonstrated high levels of efficiency across various combat roles, from combat medics to drone pilots to intelligence operatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion highlighted how women’s involvement is driving innovation in military equipment design. Nykorak demonstrated a specially designed female body armor that addresses anatomical differences and provides better protection while being lighter (weighing just 5 kilograms, compared to the standard 12-kilogram armor). This equipment is not just beneficial for women—it represents an advancement in human factors engineering for all soldiers, as male soldiers have also requested the lighter, more ergonomic equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This innovation also points to broader lessons about adapting military equipment to the evolving nature of warfare. As Nykorak explained, the war has transformed from traditional combat to a “war of drones,” where 96 percent of injuries come from shrapnel rather than bullets, necessitating different protective approaches for all soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;indigenous-production-and-economic-resilience&quot;&gt;Indigenous Production and Economic Resilience&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another remarkable achievement highlighted in the discussion was Ukraine’s ability to maintain and even grow its industrial base during wartime. In the face of the full-scale invasion, Ukrainian manufacturers have developed high-quality military equipment domestically, including uniforms, boots, and body armor, creating what Nykorak called a “win-win story”: These manufacturers employ internally displaced people, particularly women who have lost their homes and livelihoods due to the war. This approach simultaneously strengthens Ukraine’s military capabilities while providing economic opportunities for displaced citizens, demonstrating how whole-of-society resilience extends beyond military defense to include economic sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-arm-women-now-initiative&quot;&gt;The Arm Women Now Initiative&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nykorak described her organization, Arm Women Now, which advocates for equal opportunities and proper equipment for women serving in Ukraine’s defense and security sectors. The initiative has provided free equipment to more than 12,000 women defenders at the front line and works to amplify Ukrainian women defenders’ voices internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work demonstrates how civil society organizations can complement government efforts, especially in areas where bureaucratic systems may be slow to adapt. As Nykorak noted, as representatives of civil society, organizations like hers can move quickly to address immediate needs while advocating for systemic changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;implications-for-future-security-and-deterrence&quot;&gt;Implications for Future Security and Deterrence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion concluded with reflections on the broader implications of Ukraine’s experience for global security. McInnis emphasized that whole-of-society resilience should be considered a critical component of deterrence strategies: “When we’ve talked about deterring Russia, we talk about porcupine strategies, we talk about mutually assured destruction . . . whole-of-society resilience really does need to be a component of this broader suite of strategies necessary to convince Russia to not cross the line.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She noted that deterrence is fundamentally a psychological calculation, requiring a convincing demonstration of will and capability to resist. Ukraine’s experience shows that this will to fight—bolstered by whole-of-society resilience—can be decisive even when facing a numerically superior adversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nykorak added that “Putin understands only a language of power” and emphasized the need for both strong will and adequate military capabilities to deter future aggression. She characterized Ukraine as “a wall of security to all European countries,” suggesting that Ukraine’s resistance has broader implications for European security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-takeaways-6&quot;&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom-up versus top-down resilience:&lt;/strong&gt; Ukraine’s experience demonstrates that national resilience emerges from a population’s will to fight rather than solely from government or military directives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inclusive defense forces:&lt;/strong&gt; Integrating women into combat roles has significantly expanded Ukraine’s military capabilities, with tens of thousands of women serving effectively in frontline positions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human-centered equipment design:&lt;/strong&gt; The war has driven innovations in military equipment that account for human factors and anatomical differences, improving effectiveness for all soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Domestic production capabilities:&lt;/strong&gt; Even during wartime, Ukraine has maintained and developed its industrial base, producing high-quality military equipment domestically while creating employment opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Civil society complementing government:&lt;/strong&gt; Organizations like Arm Women Now demonstrate how civil society can address needs quickly while advocating for systemic changes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whole-of-society deterrence:&lt;/strong&gt; Ukraine’s experience suggests that whole-of-society resilience should be considered an essential component of deterrence strategies, complementing traditional military capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evolving nature of warfare:&lt;/strong&gt; The transition to a “war of drones” requires adaptations in equipment and tactics, highlighting the importance of flexibility and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This discussion offers valuable insights for other nations considering how to build societal resilience in the face of potential threats, emphasizing that military hardware alone is insufficient without the corresponding will to fight and whole-of-society mobilization capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike most Taiwanese Lunar New Years, which traditionally commence with quiet family gatherings, in 2025 the Year of the Snake started with nationwide mobilisation as citizens took to the streets. They began gathering signatures for petitions to recall as many as 50 lawmakers from a total 111 seats in the Legislative Yuan (LY)in a fight for the survival of the island’s democracy. The “Recall War”, led by Robert Tsao – a chip billionaire who forsook retirement abroad and moved back to Taiwan, staking his personal fortune to establish the paramilitary Kuma Academy whose sworn aim is to prevent the “Hong Kong-isation of Taiwan” – is the latest battle in the silent war for Taiwan’s future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stress-testing-the-legislative-yuan-power-grabs-budget-blocking-and-the-recall-war&quot;&gt;Stress-testing the Legislative Yuan: Power Grabs, Budget Blocking and the Recall War&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The immediate trigger for the Recall War was budget-blocking and swingeing cuts imposed by the LY. The cuts froze NTD 207.5 billion – equivalent to approximately £4.83 billion and comprising up to 34% of total Executive Yuan spending – without accounting for the total elimination of a $100bn subsidy. The subsidy, paid to the Taiwan Power Company was designed to shield consumers from a spike in prices caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The annual budget, which should have been approved by 30 November 2024, was hurriedly passed in politically fraught circumstances after only two days of review on 21 January 2025. Budget slashing was in turn preceded by an abortive attempt by the Kuomintang (KMT)-dominated LY to fundamentally reengineer the balance of power in Taiwan’s political system by passing legislation to arrogate vast powers from the executive and judiciary and dismantle checks and balances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking the cat even further back, that constitutional coup was launched in May 2024 a month after the KMT’s chief whip Fu Kun-chi led a 25-member delegation to Beijing to meet with Wang Huning, Xi Jinping’s ideologue-in-chief who, officially number four on the CCP hierarchy, heads the United Front and is in charge of Taiwan policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If polarisation between natives (benshengren) and the rump of the KMT that fled to Taiwan in the aftermath of China’s civil war (waishengren) is the root of almost all political disputes in Taiwan, the proximate cause of this constitutional crisis is the hung parliament delivered by the electorate in 2024. Despite winning the presidency and more votes than any other party in the LY elections, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) only won 49 seats in the LY, whereas the KMT took 54 with the balance of power being held by the Taiwan People’s Party’s (TPP) nine legislators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That result partly reflected Taiwan’s complex hybrid electoral system, disaffection with the DPP who have been in power since 2016, as well as established voting patterns whereby the electorate tends to vote according to national security considerations in the presidential elections and along economic lines in LY elections. Significantly, TPP supporters voting for Taipei’s techno-populist former mayor Ko Wen-je comprise a young demographic primarily motivated by economic factors such as house prices and job creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While divided government is not new for Taiwan’s resilient democracy – Chen Shui-bian’s two administrations from 2000-2008 mirrored the present insofar as the DPP and KMT respectively controlled the executive and legislature – then-leader of the LY Wang Jin-pyng was a consummate deal-maker who frequently reached across the aisle to find common ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In lieu of such a parliamentarian, today the incumbent Speaker is Han Kuo-yu, the former firebrand mayor of Kaohsiung whose credentials to run for President in 2020 were questioned by his own party members. They alleged alcoholism, gambling, womanising and a distinctly lacklustre work ethic. In that election Han enjoyed a large lead in the polls over Tsai Ing-wen until the brutal crackdown in Hong Kong, during which Han made a politically-disastrous, high-profile visit to demonstrate solidarity with the HKSAR government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other key difference is the subversion factor: during the KMT Administration of Ma Ying-jeou from 2008-16, comprehensive Cross-Strait engagement enabled the United Front Work Department (UFWD) and China’s intelligence services to comprehensively penetrate the ganglia of Taiwanese society, including political and military elites and right down to organised crime and grass roots organisations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the term “fifth column” is not currently used in PRC doctrine, it frequently appears in memoirs of underground CCP operatives who infiltrated the KMT and perhaps turned the tide in China’s civil war. More recently, former deputy director of the Taiwan Affairs Office and PLA Maj Gen (ret.) Wang Zaixi floated the “Beiping Model”, a reference to a month-long siege of Beijing in 1949 culminating in the encircled KMT commander’s surrender following secret talks that were facilitated by his wife and secretary, both of whom were underground agents of the CCP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allegations of subversion are necessarily difficult to prove. However, a report published by the National Security Bureau in January highlighted an uptick in convictions, increasing fourfold in as many years, two thirds of which were of retired and serving military personnel. Previously hypothesised links between politicians and the UFWD are now supported by evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, an undercover documentary exposing how Taiwanese influencers are targeted with junkets and hospitality in Xiamen included a visit to the offices of a UFWD newspaper adorned with personal calligraphy professing the wisdom of Han Kuo-yu. That documentary also revealed as many as 200,000 PRC passports had been covertly issued to Taiwanese; and informal conversations with intelligence officers confirm that there is active monitoring and investigations of LY members suspected of being agents of Beijing and holding PRC passports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is beyond any shadow of a doubt is deep-blue members of the KMT are following a deliberate strategy to paralyse the LY in their bid to undermine the Administration of Lai Ching-te. Thus there is a clear convergence of interest between elements of the KMT and China, which is the main beneficiary of legislative chaos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should be assessed in the context of well-known linkages between these elements and the Chinese Communist Party. Moreover after Xi jettisoned the ambiguity of the “One China Respective Interpretations” (yi zhong ge biao) formula in 2019, leaving space only for “peaceful reunification” under Hong Kong-style One Country Two Systems, the architect of the 1992 Consensus pivoted to become a key proponent of the “America Scepticism Theory” (yi mei lun) propagating “abandoned chess piece” narratives which insinuate the US cannot and will not defend Taiwan in event of a PLA invasion under any circumstance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-things-might-play-out&quot;&gt;How things might play out&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The KMT-TPP legislative power-grab has largely failed. In October 2024 the Constitutional Court ruled that most aspects of the reforms enacted were unconstitutional, including empowering the LY to summon the President to answer questions, conferring on the LY the power to set up “investigative committees” (beyond the scope of pre-existing legislative committees). These were endowed with vast powers to inquire into government agencies and impose criminal penalties on uncooperative witnesses and criminal sanctions for “reverse interpellation”, meaning government officials cannot express disagreement, request clarification or disagree with the interrogating legislator; and the power to extensively question nominees before approving or rejecting their nomination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The grounds cited by the Court for ruling the foregoing unconstitutional were the separation of powers. The subtext of this decision being that the proper way to drastically remake Taiwan’s political system would be through constitutional amendment (a mathematical and political impossibility at present). In response to the ignominy of defeat, the KMT has renewed rhetoric of “green terror”, refused to process the nominations for seven of the 15 grand justices whose term expired in November 2024 and passed (likely unconstitutional) legislation requiring a majority of 10 grand justices for all Constitutional Court decisions, effectively paralysing the Judicial Yuan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One interpretation of this spectacular overreach might be that a similar UFWD playbook was deployed successfully in Hong Kong to consolidate CCP authority over the legislature and courts. However, a key distinction – apart from the formidable capabilities of Taiwanese counter-intelligence – is that in Hong Kong after 1997 the PRC wielded a de facto veto power over the courts through article 158(3) of the Basic Law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This short-circuited the rule of law by vesting the power of final interpretation in the National People’s Congress Standing Committee, and through a judicial appointment system whose members included government officials and were legally gagged from discussing deliberations. Thus, a system was created that was ripe for infiltration, manipulation and abuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, PRC objectives in Hong Kong were limited by comparison. They merely sought to silence political dissent in a city over which Beijing already exercised military control. The maximalist goal of PRC grey zone activities in Taiwan is to take over an entire independent island with its own armed forces and backed by an international coalition of powerful allies. Besides, in Taiwan the ability of PRC agencies to infiltrate the fabric of society is manifestly not matched by their grasp of the niceties of constitutional law, hence the magnitude of this miscalculation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As regards the ongoing Recall War, the aim of which is for the DPP to clawback a legislative majority in the absence of a mechanism to dissolve parliament, this is unlikely to succeed due to procedural barriers that effectively require petitions signed by 11% of the relevant electorate, followed by a majority in a referendum with a turnout of at least 25%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outcome will probably not be known before September 2025, however, of the first 28 from 50 cases, 19 have passed, all of which were initiated by the DPP. Nine KMT petitions failed because too many signatures were invalidated. Notably, in New Taipei City hundreds of signatures were from dead people, most of whom had passed away before signing the petitions, implying forgery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications-for-cross-straits-stability-and-policy-recommendations&quot;&gt;Implications for Cross-Straits Stability and Policy Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While legislative brawls have been a feature more than a bug of Taiwan’s rambunctious democracy for almost three decades (to which political scientists have dedicated monographs), this latest twist has serious implications for Cross-Strait stability, perhaps no more so than in respect to budget cuts and freezes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against the backdrop of Trump Administration officials calling for Taiwan to spend as much as 5-10% of its GDP on Defence, pro-China groups within the LY have a coordinated strategy to drive a wedge between Taipei and Washington, the calculation being to impose a dilemma on the Lai Administration by making it impossible to increase defence spending. This dilemma could turn abandonment by the United States into a self-fulfilling prophecy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, despite proposing to continue the past decade’s increase of defence spending to NTD 647 billion (around 2.5% of GDP), in fact the LY cut spending by 3% in 2025. Substantively, several key programmes instrumental to the island’s defence are impacted: 50% of the Indigenous Defense Submarine programme has been frozen; as has 50% of the budget of the Aerospace Park in southern Taiwan, a private sector collaboration to manufacture dual-use drones; and the Ministry of Digital Affairs’ cyber resilience budget has been slashed by 56% to NTD 300 million, increasing Taiwan’s vulnerability to hybrid warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although fear of abandonment looms large in Taiwan’s public psyche following Washington’s switch of diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979, the strategy of strangling the LY may still backfire. Firstly, political support for the king-making TPP is collapsing following the jailing of its charismatic leader on corruption charges in December 2024. Ko Wen-je himself is a technocrat who never discussed Cross-Strait relations during his election campaign. His platform while presiding over the Shanghai-Taipei forum as mayor of Taipei was simply to have a good working relationship with Beijing so that Taipei could focus on the economic issues that younger voters cared most about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, in coalition with the KMT the TPP’s populist vote for Ko has been hijacked; and notably a number of TPP members had originally defected from the KMT going back to the 9-in-1 local elections in 2022, which raises questions about infiltration. It remains to be seen whether the TPP will continue to support the KMT, especially as the Lai Administration enhances counter-intelligence as through the recently announced17 measures; if the legislative tide turns, in addition to reintroducing military courts, Lai will likely heed calls from experts such asPeter Mattis to increase prison sentences for espionage-related offences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, Taiwan’sdefence spending is not low in absolute terms (in fact it is more than Singapore’s) or as a proportion of overall government spending (15% comparable to South Korea and Israel). There is significant scope to increase it further through taxation and borrowing; Taiwan’s tax burden is only 9.2% of GDP, which is very low by OECD and even Asian standards, and its borrowing is 24.2% with scope to increase up to 40.6% of GDP averaged over three years under the terms of the Public Debt Act. In other words, were the KMT-TPP coalition to continue its lawfare campaign in the LY until the next election in 2028, mechanisms exist to enable the Lai Administration to continue to fulfil the defence commitments it has pledged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is scope for like-minded partners and allies to shore up peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific through strategic communications pushing back against narratives of abandonment. Given the Trump Administration’s suspension of Voice of America and Radio Free Asia broadcasting, the BBC and DeutscheWelle could revive their dormant capacities. Diplomats can communicate to Washington the underappreciated impact of an attempted constitutional coup akin to Hitler’s 1933 Reichstag Enabling Act that snuffed out the democratic flame of the Weimar Republic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With respect to counter-subversion assistance, liaison relationships could be deepened by embedding Western officers in Taiwan’s national agencies who would be able not only to contribute deep professional expertise but also would stand to learn from frontline deployments about how to tackle CCP subversion at home. In the face of supply-side issues with US arms sales, like-minded partners and allies might consider selling weapons to Taiwan and there is significant untapped potential for thinking more creatively in terms of military assistance and financing structures for arms deals. Beyond the geo-strategic and economic implications of Taiwan being annexed by the PRC, ideationally, extinguishing the sole remaining beacon of Chinese democracy would feed the fallacy that China is unsuited to democracy and render the prospect of political liberalisation that could stabilise strategic competition even more remote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the period direct Iranian and Russian intervention in the Syrian civil war (2015-2024), evidence started emerging of less than frictionless cooperation between the two allies. There were reports of clashes between militias and military units aligned with Tehran and Moscow, and disagreements over the reform and restructuration of the Syrian armed forces. Researcher Mahmoud Alloush later talked of “competitive cooperation,” explaining that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is a strategic intersection of interests between the two countries in supporting the regime during the Syrian revolution, but competitive factors have become more dominant in shaping this relationship after the course of the war and military operations turned in favor of al-Assad…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, while friction between Russia and Iran, and between Iranian and Russian proxies and allies, was widely reported, the drivers of this friction were never analyzed in detail. That friction occurred at multiple levels – in the field, within the bureaucracy, within the diplomatic sphere, over economic affairs – and had multiple drivers. This paper focuses on Iran and Russia’s competition for influence in Syria as a major source of friction in security and economic affairs. Why is this important now that the Assad regime has collapsed? A granular analysis of that competition tells us a lot about the relationship between Russia and Iran, about their intervention strategies, about their strategic cultures and about their state-building approaches (or lack thereof).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper therefore seeks to answer two main questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why did Russia and Iran end up competing so much in Syria?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What factors hampered efforts to cooperate more smoothly?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper is organized into four sections. The first section details the evidence of friction between Iran and Russia over the Syrian military and the Syrian economy and discusses the two countries’ efforts to coordinate nonetheless. The following section looks at the impact (in terms of generating friction) of Iran and Russia’s favoring two very different approaches to fixing the crisis in the Baathist state in Syria. The third section discusses the struggle for influence over the Syrian armed forces. Finally, the fourth section looks at how this competition ended, with Iran emerging as dominant but ultimately lacking the resources to keep the Assad regime afloat at the end of 2024, when what turned out to be the final, victorious offensive of the opposition forces was launched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researching this topic required a number of methodological compromises, given that conducting primary research in Syria was extremely difficult until 2024. There are other obvious limitations to the research methodology adopted, with research by necessity mostly limited to oral sources, with support from the literature and news reports, but no access to primary written sources: the body of data collected is inevitably incomplete; gaps abound; and following up on specific themes was often impossible. The analysis contained in the paper inevitably reflects this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the oral sources proved to be quite approachable. The risk inherent in this type of research is not obtaining access. There are other risks as well: that interviewees might be affected by a social-desirability bias, resulting in overstating their achievements, capabilities and/or resources; or by reverse causation, leading them to provide prejudiced information about rival organizations. Mitigation measures are discussed below. The research methodology was a hybrid of investigative journalism and ethnographic interviews. The questionnaires were adapted to each interviewee; there were, in fact, as many different questionnaires as there were interviews. The questions evolved as knowledge of ongoing trends and developments expanded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interviews were commissioned to local researchers. All of them have a background in journalism and/or research, had participated in previous research projects with a similar typology of interviewees and were trained to undertake research with a similar methodology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The risk that respondents might use the interviews to influence external observers or misrepresent the facts, or both, was assumed from the start. It was mitigated by consulting different types of interviewees – such as government officials and military officers, Iranian and Russian officers and diplomats, and members of militias – who represented contrasting points of view; by interviewing individuals separately and without their being aware of other interviews taking place; and by inserting questions to which the answer was already known, in order to verify responses. It proved particularly helpful to present interviewees with information gathered from other sources. Public-domain sources, such as media reports and analytical studies, were also used, where available, to check the credibility of interviewees. Researchers were chosen who did not know each other to avoid the risk of researcher collusion to manipulate the content of interviews, for example, by inventing content to produce whatever they might have believed the project team wanted to hear. This is always a risk when interviews are carried out by field researchers as part of a remotely managed project. The field researchers were also informed that the purpose of the effort was simply to ascertain facts and that there was no premium placed on specific findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interviewees were told that their answers would be used in an open-access publication, the type of which was not specified. The interviews were carried out in part face-to-face and in part over the phone – some interviewees were in locations that were difficult to access. All the interviews have been anonymized and all data that could lead to the identification of interviewees has been removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In total, the paper relies on 48 interviews carried out between 2016 and 2024. Of these, 10 were with Syrian military personnel and militiamen, eight with members of foreign militias fighting for the Assad regime, eight with Syrian officials, seven with Russian diplomats and military advisors, and 13 with Iranian advisors from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and army or Iranian diplomats, plus one local notable in Aleppo and one journalist working for the Syrian regime’s media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;evidence-of-friction-between-iran-and-russia-in-syria&quot;&gt;Evidence of friction between Iran and Russia in Syria&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;armed-clashes-among-proxies&quot;&gt;Armed clashes among proxies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is significant evidence of serious friction between Iran and Russia in Syria. The media (largely hostile to the Assad regime) regularly reported clashes between different militias identified as proxies of Russia and Iranand even direct clashes between IRGC and Russian military police. The first reports of clashes between pro-Iranian and pro-Russian factions date back to 2015. In December 2015, for example, regime regular forces reportedly engaged in armed scuffles in Homs with fighters loyal to a fiercely pro-Iranian commander of Quwat al-Ridha, a group within the National Defense Forces (NDF) backed by Hizbullah and the IRGC. The media sources and foreign diplomats are not neutral, however, mostly sympathizing either with the opposition or with regional powers opposed to Assad. This section will focus on evidence from Iranian, Russian and pro-regime Syrian sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example involved the Tiger Force, which became Russia’s client militia of choice in the coastal area, due to the local NDF unit being too close to Iran. The Russians favored the expansion of the Tiger Force by offering generous pay deals to recruits, in the hope of counterbalancing the power of the militias linked to Iran and to favor the Force’s expansion. Friction between the Tiger Force’s leader, Sohail al Hassan, and President Assad’s brother Maher is confirmed by a Syrian intelligence officer, who put at 37 the number of those dying. The direct cause of the clash was Maher’s jealousy at al Hassan emerging as one of the towering military leaders on the regime’s side. As the Tiger Force grew, its commander al Hassan came into conflict with Maher al-Assad:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Maher al Assad, as all members of the al-Assad family, doesn’t like to see any strong and popular officer or leader who is not one of them. […] General Maher al-Assad wanted and still wants to destroy General Suheel and his Tiger Forces / 25th Special Task Division, but the Russians prevent this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sources aligned with the regime or with Russia confirmed that other armed clashes had happened. A Russian officer acknowledged that clashes between Iranian-backed groups and Russian-backed groups were relatively frequent and mentioned a major clash in Deir ez Zor between the Russian military police, the 5th AC and Liwa al Quds on one side and Iranian-backed groups such as Hezbullah and Fatimiyun on the other. He also mentioned other major clashes in Aleppo over Al Nayrab airport, in Daraa and in Al-Zuhra – always over territorial control. The clashes in Aleppo were confirmed by a source in Liwa al Quds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one point, according to a Russian officer, following a particularly bloody clash between militias linked to Iran (Hezbollah and Fatimiyun) and others linked to Russia (Liwa al Quds, Baath Brigades and Nosur al Zawbah), in which the pro-Iranian former lost 60 killed and after which the Iranians were about to end their relationship with Russia for good. The Russians, however, managed to get negotiations going to resolve issues and reportedly succeeded. This clash and the ensuing verbal exchanges show that direct clashes between armed formations were not the only form of friction and that clashes among Iranian and Russian proxies and allies did not leave the two powers indifferent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;direct-iran-russia-friction&quot;&gt;Direct Iran-Russia friction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russians used the leverage deriving from their air power quite ruthlessly. Already in the aftermath of fighting in Khan Touman in early May 2016, Iranian officers and media complained about Russia’s failure to deploy their air assets in support of IRGC units and pro-Iranian militias. According to one source, the Russian and Syrian air force allegedly refused to provide air support to the Fatimiyun Brigades and other militias operating under direct IRGC command even on later occasions. According to a Russian adviser, the Russians asked the Iranians to encourage at least the militias they did not directly control to merge into the Syrian army (SAA), but the IRGC refused. In retaliation, the Russians suspended any support not long before the war in Ukraine started, in particular close air support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russians also had financial and diplomatic leverage, which they did not hesitate to use. They were clear that they were ready to stop financial and diplomatic support to Syria if they lost too much influence over Damascus. The Syrian regime had to yield to Russian pressure. One IRGC officer confirmed that the regime, spurred on by the Russians, warned homegrown regime-aligned militias not to cooperate with Iranian-backed militias carrying out operations outside of the chain of command of the Syrian Ministry of Defense (MoD).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another IRGC officer believed that it was the Russians advising Assad to get pro-Iranian militias out of Aleppo and replace them with the Syrian army. This source was frank about the competition with the Russians: “We want to have our groups here in Aleppo and […] Russia did not win the war in Syria, Iran did. […] We are trying to override the Russians.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IRGC, meanwhile, put pressure on Damascus by pulling its militias back from the front line, forcing the regular SAA to take on the brunt of the fighting. The IRGC wanted to expand the ranks of the militias and get its friends appointed to senior positions in the government, in response to Russian pressure to marginalize its Syrian clients. It is unclear how effective this was in counterbalancing Russian pressure, but after the Russians deployed their air force to Syria, Damascus is likely to have been keener on keeping air power than Iran’s foreign militias.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2019 cooperation between the Russians and Iranians had become brittle. Significantly, the center for coordinating advisers, which brought together Iranians and Russians, was closed in March 2019. Moreover,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Some time ago, they were working jointly with the Syrian military, but now when one (i.e., either Russian or Iran) is there in training, the other is not joining them, and this clearly shows major differences between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The differences in approach between Russian and Iranian advisers affected planning and operations, according to a senior official of the Syrian government speaking in 2017:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;They have problems with and hostility toward each other, […] when one side is giving an opinion, the other side is showing opposition, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were also tussles over who would commander specific operations, Russia or Iran, such as in Deir Ez Zor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems clear that the military effort was negatively affected by this friction, even if the impact of Russian air power was so important that the trend remained largely positive for the regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two-models-for-syria-irans-parallel-network-and-russias-resurrected-central-state&quot;&gt;Two models for Syria: Iran’s parallel network and Russia’s resurrected central state&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What caused the high level of friction among nominal allies? One factor is that Iran and Russia intervened in Syria with very different military, strategic and state-building cultures. The Russians at the start thought the key to stabilizing Syria was rebuilding a strong Baathist state, starting with the SAA. In addition, the Russians were in favor of depoliticizing the SAA (at least to some degree) and, after reconciling elements of the armed opposition, incorporating them into the army. As the Russian approach has been described in some detail elsewhere, here the author will focus on the Iranian approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;irans-approach&quot;&gt;Iran’s approach&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IRGC saw clearly that the Russian advisers in Syria had a different conception of fighting, based on creating a maneuverable force as the centerpiece of the military strategy. The Iranians instead thought in terms of establishing an ideologically motivated force, essentially by building a structure parallel to that of the remnants of the old Baathist state. Initially the intent was to support the crumbling structure of the old Baathist state, but eventually the new parallel structure was to share power with it, similar to the Iranian model. The Iranians advocated the creation of an IRGC-, Basij- or Hezbollah-like structure alongside (or even in place of) the existing Syrian MoD forces, which they deemed to be beyond repair and incapable of being brought back to the strength required to save the regime. Getting their protégé militias to participate in the establishment of new, partially depoliticized and centralized armed forces, as advocated by the Russians, had no appeal to the Iranians. Quite the contrary, the Iranians even seemed to be preparing to create political parties based on the pro-Iranian militias, following the Iraqi model. The formation of SAA units out of reconciled rebels was so strongly opposed by the Iranians that the Syrian government feared there could be armed clashes between them and the new brigades of reconciled opponents, such as the 8th Brigade. The Iranians alleged that the former rebels were “Wahhabis” who still maintained relations with Turkey and the Gulf monarchies and thus saw them as competitors of the pro-Iranian militias.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the longer term, the IRGC did not hide its ambition to turn the Syrian Shi’a militias it sponsored into entities that could be deployed outside of Syria, as happened with Iraqi and Lebanese groups. As Mahmood Shoori has noted,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For Iran, of course, the government [of Syria] is not everything. The experience of working in the Middle East has taught Iranian leaders that playing an active role in regional developments requires multiple choices. Iran’s advisory presence in Syria over the past few years has provided an opportunity for Iran to engage effectively with various religious and social groups and build capacity to prevent the formation of threat centers against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An IRGC commander was even more explicit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As we brought people from Afghanistan as part of Fatimiyun and as we brought people from Pakistan as part of Zaynabiyun, we would do the same with Syrian militias if we needed them in a different country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Once complete victory was achieved,” said an Iranian diplomat in early 2017, “the foreign volunteer militias should be allowed to remain in Syria.” Iran also intended to settle Shi’a militiamen on land it bought in southern Syria. None of this appealed at all to the Russians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mutual-rejection&quot;&gt;Mutual rejection&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already in 2016, the Iranians were getting nervous that the Russian plans to fold the militias into the SAA were turning into a serious point of disagreement. According to an IRGC commander, the Iranians pushed back on the Russian plans, and the main argument they used was that the decay of the SAA was irreversible:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We told the Russians at the beginning that these policies would not work as most of the militias […] were not interested in being part of the regular army, so the Russians spent loads of money and physical energy reorganizing the army, but it was not enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another IRGC source called the militias the “Basij military,” referring to the Iranian paramilitary force controlled by the IRGC, and explained that “If they merge with the army, then the army will not fight very well […]. Separate is good.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IRGC did not just complain; it took action. After the plans to fold the militias into the SAA was approved by the Syrian MoD over Iranian opposition, the IRGC tried to sabotage the effort by strengthening its and Hezbollah’s control over the largest militias, such as the NDF and the Local Defense Force (LDF), and by severing the chain of command of many militias with the Syrian MoD. It also tried to blackmail the Assad regime by suspending its funding to the NDF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iranian criticism of the Russian effort to bring the militias under the chain of command of the MoD was not unwarranted. Anton Mardasov and Kirill Semyonov endorse some of the Iranians’ points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The failures accompanying the formation of the 4th Corps […] were also due to the Russian military having failed to take into account local specifics: few of the militia groups wanted to lose their independence and be incorporated into the organizational structure of the SAA as military personnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian-sponsored military reforms were hampered by Syria’s political and social realities. Mardasov further elaborated (with regard to folding militias into the SAA) that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Most militias were reluctant to lose their autonomy, abide by the personnel and organizational rules of the Syrian army and be integrated into it, with the militants to be granted the status of official servicemen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Syrian official spoke frankly, essentially endorsing the abovementioned arguments of Mardasov and Semyonov, noting that “most of these militias” were involved in criminal activities, while they enjoyed power locally and were benefiting from the Iranian presence in Syria, so they had no interest in joining the army and losing these advantages. While the Russians were highly skeptical of Iran’s approach and claimed that the pro-Iranian militias were in practice nowhere near as effective as the Iranians were touting, one Russian diplomat acknowledged that given the “state of affairs” and Iran’s active opposition to plans to rebuild the SAA, the chances of Russia’s plans succeeding were very low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, the Iranians argued, the IRGC- or Hezbollah-like structure that they proposed, based on hybrid forces that were to be adaptable and capable of fighting asymmetrically, would be more cost-effective and could also protect Syria from external challenges (read: Turkey and Israel). The Syrian government always openly rejected the Iranian plan. Syrian critics argued that the militias supported by Iran performed poorly on logistics and coordination, pointing out essentially that the Iranians never came close to forming anything resembling a Syrian Hezbollah or Basij and that the Syrian militias sponsored by Iran often suffered from the same issues as the SAA, including corruption. The regime remained formally committed to the rehabilitation of the SAA. It might have been worried about Iranian influence more than anything else. Meanwhile, even an IRGC commander acknowledged that Iran’s plans for creating a Syrian Hizbullah or IRGC were never very realistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Syrian government is not accepting that […] they have a weak army; they say we have a strong army, and they are totally against making an army like Hizbullah and Sepah Pasdaran, […] and they are saying that Syria will not let any kind of militia run part of the government now or in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-struggle-for-the-syrian-armed-forces&quot;&gt;The struggle for the Syrian armed forces&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran and Russia did not just subscribe to different concepts of the state and to different approaches to fighting and state-building. There was at least another and possibly more important source of friction between Iran and Russia in Syria: the desire to expand their influence within the Syrian armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russian-and-iranian-narratives&quot;&gt;Russian and Iranian narratives&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian narrative explaining the poor performance of the Syrian armed forces was that the Syrians had promoted “a lot of useless people in the army.” According to a Russian adviser, the Russians pushed for what they deemed to be capable military leaders from militias such as Liwa al Quds, Liwa Zainabiyoun, Mukhtar army, Liwa Abu Al Fadhal Al Abbas and Liwa Al Imam Al Hussein to be appointed to the army, but the Syrians refused to do so. Note that apart from the Palestinian Liwa al Quds, the other militias named are all Shi’a militias linked to Iran. The source therefore implies that the Russians were not trying to get their own cronies appointed but actually sought to promote meritocracy. Following growing Russian pressure, according to the source, the Syrians agreed to restrain the tendency to promote incompetent cronies, which to some extent they reportedly did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Iranians, by contrast, framed their resistance to expanding Russian influence in 2015-2019 in terms of the sacrifices made from 2011 onward, which entitled them to a dominant position:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Iranians believe that they were the ones who sacrificed a lot in Syria, and therefore, they are trying to take over the army and foreign affairs of the Syrian government. […] At the beginning, we had several meetings with the Iranian Sepah Pasdaran, and even the Russian authorities met Qasim Sulimani at that time. Even Qasim Sulimani […] used to say, “As long as I am alive, I will take as much advantage as possible of our sacrifices in Syria.” So, yes, of course, the Russian authorities are irritated by the attitude of the Iranians all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Iranian sacrifices were real. By March 2017, they had lost over 800 killed in Syria, including some senior officers. The total cost of the war up to that point was over $20 billion, causing discontent in Iran, where according to an Iranian diplomat “Except for the Pasdaran, no one else wants to be engaged in fighting in Syria, Iraq and Yemen. If Iranian Government does not stop fighting, big, big protests might start.” In February 2017, a Syrian delegation visited Teheran, asking for even more support. Not long before, another delegation, headed by Ali Mamlouk, had visited Teheran with the same aim. The Iranian government had granted an extra $2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Iranians clearly resented Russian demands as prevarication. In November 2017, an IRGC commander was so upset with the Russians that he stated&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If we had understood at the beginning that Russia would reach such levels, we would have kept them out. Russia is trying to […] make Iran weaker [in Syria], [and] this is not acceptable to us. We are talking to Russia to get them to decrease their influence in Syria and do not create any problems for our strategies there. If Russia does not agree, then we are ready to react against Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russians, however, rejected the Iranian narrative, as they felt that having been dragged into the Syrian conflict by the Iranians themselves, they were entitled to a dominant position due to the decisive role they had played.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-struggle-for-influence-beneath-the-narratives&quot;&gt;The struggle for influence beneath the narratives&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever the actual reasons for their efforts to maintain their influence in Syria vis-à-vis Russia, the Iranians clearly aimed to stay in Syria for the long term, no matter what Russia might say. The Iranians’ arguments against folding the militias into the SAA were not purely technical (see Two models above). Faced with the Russians’ insistence that the NDF should be integrated into the army (because NDF units had the tendency not to respond to the MoD chain of command and were involved in numerous ceasefire violations), the Iranians retorted that they had invested massive sums in getting the militias up to scratch and were not going to see that investment lost. Iran’s opposition to integrating militias into the SAA was instrumental to its ability to out-network the Russians (and Damascus). As a Syrian officer put it,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Iranians know that if [the militias] join the army, it would be hard for them to control them, and that will cause a lot of problems for them, even for them to lose their influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, an IRGC source openly acknowledged that the Iranians refused to have reconciled opposition fighters integrated into the NDF (as proposed by the Russians), for fear that they could dilute Iran’s influence. The Russians viewed the Iranians as disingenuous when they claimed that militias were the key to winning the war and that Iranian control over the militias was necessary to ensure their proper functioning. The Russians noted that the Iranians were also intent on building influence at the top level of Syria’s military and intelligence apparatus, and especially with Assad’s brother Maher, despite their claims that the SAA was doomed. Once complete victory was achieved, said an Iranian diplomat in early 2017, the Syrian militiamen linked to the IRGC would get jobs in Syria’s ministries and armed forces. This would translate into Iranian influence over the Syrian state as a whole. The IRGC undoubtedly was leaning heavily on the Assad regime to have Syrian officers promoted and demoted, as both Syrian army and IRGC sources acknowledged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas the Iranians were quite transparent about their priorities, according to Ambassador Michel Duclos, the Russians were saying off the record that reestablishing a strong Syrian army would be the best guarantee against Iranian influence and pro-Iranian militias. Mardasov wondered whether the entire stated Russian policy of building up the SAA at the expense of the militias was not rather an attempt to expand Moscow’s influence at the expense of Tehran. The fact that the Russians were also sponsoring some of the militias and continued to sponsor new ones well into the reform period would seem to undermine their “centralist” argument in favor of the SAA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;two-strategies-for-gaining-influence-and-a-turning-point-in-russias-favor&quot;&gt;Two strategies for gaining influence and a turning point in Russia’s favor&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the Russians deployed to Syria, Iran’s influence was predominant largely among the militias, by virtue of its early engagement with them, while Russia had stronger influence among SAA generals, most of whom were trained in Russia and Soviet Union, as well as over Syria’s air force, which the Iranians were not in a position to support. From the very start, when the Syrian Air Force Intelligence Directorate established the first Shabiha militias, Iran’s relationship with the entity was well developed. The Iranians also brought their own allied militias from Iraq, Lebanon, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Almost all the foreign militias were aligned with Iran, or at least not with Russia. Instead, Russia reportedly relied on Soviet-era contacts established within the Baath party and in the SAA for spreading influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to sources within the Syrian armed forces, the first turning point in the race for influence between Iran and Russia was around 2017-2019. As of October 2017 most of the Iranian military advisers were with the Shi’a militias, and their number was declining, due to relations with the Assad regime being in decline, while the number of the Russian ones was increasing. By May 2019, according to a Syrian intelligence officer,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Now the Russians have the upper hand in Damascus. I mean Russian influence increased significantly in Syrian government military and civilian institutions. The reason is that Iranians are feeling weak due to their financial crisis. They’re no longer able to provide funding to the people who were linked to them some time ago. Now those people are aligned with the Russians because the Russians are providing support to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The external perception was the same: the Russians were gaining influence in the military and security apparatus, managing to impose in 2019 a series of appointments of senior officers and officials of their liking. During this period, Assad followed Russian recommendations in making appointments, such as of Salim Harba as SAA chief of staff, establishing new units under its influence, such as the 5th Corps and 25th Division, and restructuring the Syrian army staff. There were also reports of arrests of pro-Iranian Syrian activists by Syrian security forces, “ordered by Russia.” Although there were Iranian advisers in the SAA, the Russians were absolutely predominant there after 2015. According to Russian military expert Semyonov, “There are Russian military advisors in almost every brigade and division of the Syrian army.” And although some Syrian army units were under stronger influence of Iran (4th Division, Republican Guard), even in the 4th Division and in the Republican Guard the Russians were said to have a “large say”: “The Russians interfere at the command level, in major security issues, and in major disputes between the army and the militias supporting it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By May 2017 the Russians had already reshaped the influence map considerably. Assad regime sources say that the General Intelligence Directorate was still under Iranian influence, as both its head, Mohammed Din Zaitoun, and his deputy Zouheir Hamad had close relations with Iran. The Military Intelligence Directorate was also under Iranian influence. Meanwhile, the Air Force Intelligence Directorate (the most powerful of the three intelligence directorates) had shifted closer to Russia. The Political Security Directorate was also somewhat close to Russia, despite Iran having some influence in it, as well. As of May 2017, the National Security Office was split between Russia and Iran, with six of its members (Ahmad Diyab, Abdel Fatah, Jawdat Salibi Mawwas, General Nasr Al Ali, Commander Mohammad Ibrahim and Ali Hassan Turkmani) considered to be linked to Russia and another five believed to be close to Iran (Ali Mamlouk, Lina Kenaya, Lula Al Shebal, Naji al Ahmad and Abdul Abdul).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russians did invest relatively significant human resources in training and advising militias: as of early 2018, a regime source counted 200 Russian trainers and advisers there. However, the effort looks puny when compared to Iran’s: 1,800 trainers and advisers, supported by 450 from Hezbollah. Russia’s influence among Syrian militias was limited to a few of them, such as the ISIS Hunters. Some Russian-sponsored militias were ad hoc and did not represent a long-term investment. For example, to reduce the risk of Iranian-sponsored efforts to disrupt new local reconciliation deals, the Russians sponsored the creation of a temporary militia known as the Armed Unified Command-Unit in eastern Qalamoun. The unit was meant to gather reconciled opposition members, until the time was ripe for the SAA to move in and take over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Iranians were sufficiently dominant at the local level that they could strengthen their influence by simply creating new militias. In early 2018 the IRGC sponsored the creation of new militias in southern Syria, possibly because it hoped to circumvent the ban on expanding the ranks of existing militias, exploiting Assad’s desire to consolidate his position in the south. At least three new militias were formed in the south, one with direct IRGC support (Battalion 313) and two with Hezbollah support (Companions of Imam Mahdi 313 and Katain Al Imam). The Iranians remained totally predominant among foreign militias, although Russia developed close links to the Palestinian Liwa al Quds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even after the first turning point in the competition for influence, there were always relatively minor fluctuations in the spheres of influence. For example, in later years, the General Intelligence Directorate and the Military Intelligence Directorate were reported to have edged closer to Russia. Similarly, Russia established relatively strong influence over 5th and 4th Assault Corps when they were formed in 2015-2016, but Iran and Hezbollah later managed to build up substantial influence within both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, the Iranians seemingly competed with Russia even for influence in the regular armed forces, while still pursuing its strategy with the militias. Similarly, the Russians focused on the regular armed forces but also sought to establish a foothold among the militias. The Russians committed limited resources (human and financial), while exploiting opportunities as they arose. For example, Moscow sought to exploit Iran’s rivalry with Israel by attracting militiamen into the Russian-controlled 5th Corps from pro-Iranian militias that had allegedly been weakened by repeated Israeli airstrikes on their positions. Local sources indicated that the risk of Israeli airstrikes was making the Iranians unpopular in Deir ez Zor. Similarly, it was reported that the Russians asserted control over the Damascus and Aleppo airports as Israeli strikes on IRGC positions there made Iranian control unpractical. Another example is that of Liwa al Quds. The Palestinian militia was initially supported by the IRGC and Hezbollah before falling under Russian influence, due in part to sectarian Shi’a-Sunni tensions, until Iranian influence started asserting itself again at the time of Russia’s deepening preoccupation with Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where the Iranian and Russian approaches differed was the type of Syrian counterparts they chose. Even when Iran and Russia were well past the peak of their presence on the ground, the Russians had more advisers to the regular Syrian forces than the Iranians, who only had 47 in total. Nonetheless, these few IRGC advisers were quite active, regularly visiting the MoD and being present at the tactical level as well, still taking part in operations in 2023-2024. In general, the Iranians seemed more determined than the Russians to work at the grassroots level. The Iranians main stronghold in the SAA was Maher al Assad’s 4th Division.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russians held the advantage in terms of access to the top levels of the MoD and of the state, as they were able to provide, in the words of one Syrian officer, “more competent” military advisers, who in fact ended up doing much of the SAA’s planning. The IRGC advisers were less able in this regard, which is not surprising given the IRGC’s specialization in asymmetric and nonconventional operations. This aligns with a comment by a Russian diplomat that “Iran is unable to advise the Syrian government on a global scale,” drawing a contrast with the Russians. The Russians focused on high-ranking officials, such as the president of Syria, heads of intelligence and high-ranking generals, while the Iranian advisers operated at lower levels. The Russian diplomat also agreed that “Most of the time, the Syrians feel more comfortable with the Iranians on a daily basis.” A kind of uneasy division of labor came to develop, at least as far as the work of the advisers was concerned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-ukraine-conflict-a-turning-point-in-irans-favor&quot;&gt;The Ukraine conflict: A turning point in Iran’s favor&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second key turning point in the competition for influence between Iran and Russia was in 2023-2024, when Russian influence collapsed, to the benefit of both the Syrian government, which took control of both 5th Corps and 25th Special Task Division (STD), and the Iranians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian presence in Syria declined after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. Russian support for the Syrian armed forces also declined, especially from the end of 2023, probably more due to the efforts of the Assad regime to assert its control over SAA units and militias previously patronized by Russia, than to the engagement in Ukraine. Inevitably this translated into reduced influence. Most of the militias once linked to Russia started turning to the Assad regime, which, however, lacked resources, and to the IRGC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Iranians saw Russia’s entanglement in Ukraine as an opportunity for further expanding their influence over the militias:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If the Russians do not support the armed forces, and if the Russians are not there for the militias, it is clear enough that the Islamic Republic of Iran would have a greater chance of [exerting] influence over Syria as the Syrian government and militias both would need our support. […] The decline of Russian influence is a positive development for Iran’s point of view. […] The Islamic Republic of Iran would be happy if the Russian influence in Syria declined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to one of its commanders, the IRGC in 2024 allocated an extra $100 million of funding to militias in Syria for this purpose. The IRGC even sought to establish its influence over such a key Russian client as the 8th Brigade, whose creation it had once so bitterly resisted. This did not come easy, but the IRGC reportedly managed to establish relations with some 8th Brigade commanders, having spent $10 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the Iranians, the militias remained the primary focus, as they remained distrustful of the capabilities of the SAA. However, during 2024 the IRGC was very active trying to get “their people” in the Syrian armed forces promoted, reversing years of Russian gains. Iran’s growing influence was confirmed by a Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs official:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While the Russians are busy carrying out the special operation in Ukraine and losing their influence in Syria, the Iranians, on the other hand, are getting closer and closer to the armed forces by providing funds and supplies, and at the same time, the Iranians are getting closer to the Syrian government, as there is enough of a gap now between the Russians and the Syrian officials. […] The Iranians are trying and doing more to influence the Syrian government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two Syrian military sources acknowledged that Iranian influence was growing as a result, especially among the militias. After the start of the Gaza crisis, moreover, the IRGC started reinforcing its own presence in Syria as well. Even a Palestinian militiaman, despite his group’s closeness to Russia, expected Iranian influence and power to keep growing as long as Russia was engaged in Ukraine, with the Gaza conflict only magnifying Iran’s role. One source regularly in contact with regime officials noted at the end of 2023 that around 10 different sources and interviewees all confirmed to him that Iran was expanding its influence and power among Syrian governmental forces, militias and security departments after Russia got involved in Ukraine. The Iranians also benefited from the fact that after the war in Ukraine started, the Russians gave up on lobbying the Iranians on behalf of Damascus, asking the Syrians instead to deal with the IRGC directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023 Russian sources were clear that there was resentment among the Russians that the Iranians were becoming very assertive in trying to advance their interests in Syria, even though Russia still contributed significantly more than Iran did to supporting the regime. This tension was reduced after the Russians, distracted by the war in Ukraine, largely gave up on Aleppo, which had been a focal point of intra-militia and Russia-Iran confrontation. In Deir Ez Zor, Russian influence was sustained after the war in Ukraine started, but in Aleppo it nearly vanished. As a Syrian official put it in late 2023, Russia accepted Iranian influence in Syria and was no longer trying to eradicate or contain it; the Russians were now seeing Iran as a key ally. As the Russians were no longer interested or able to compete effectively with the Iranians, cooperation between the two countries on Syria actually became easier (see Condemned to cooperation below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-the-long-struggle-for-influence-ended&quot;&gt;How the long struggle for influence ended&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;condemned-to-cooperation&quot;&gt;Condemned to cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of the Russian intervention in Syria, cooperation between Iran and Russia was described as good by Syrian and Iranian sources. A center was established to facilitate coordination between the Russian, Iranians and Syrians. There was also coordination between Russia and Iran at the ministerial level and operational level and among senior officials. Airstrikes were coordinated, as were logistics, operations and intelligence. An IRGC source confirmed in February 2016 that Russia was also providing arms and support even to Hezbollah in Syria. In early 2016 the assessment of an IRGC colonel claimed that “There is great coordination between Russian advisers, our advisers and Assad’s advisers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gradually, even Syrian and Iranian sources started acknowledging that the relationship had become more competitive. Relations between Russia and Iran and their proxies deteriorated as they competed for influence – on the ground and with the Syrian regime. However, efforts to foster collaboration between Russian and Iranian proxies and allies were never abandoned. A conflict resolution commission was set up by Syria, Iran and Russia to ease friction from within the ranks of the alliance. It was composed of special representatives appointed by each side. Coordinating was hard work, however. Liwa al Quds again provides an example of this. Tension over the group kept escalating for years. It was kept out of the LDF, although it cooperated closely with it for a period, under the coordination of the intelligence services. In 2016, however, the Russian advisers took over and told Liwa al Quds to stop cooperating with the LDF, presumably to keep the group away from the increasingly Iran-influenced LDF. A senior figure in Liwa al Quds pointed out that the Russians, Iranians and Hezbollah initially agreed in a meeting over the transition to hand control over to the Russians. However, this deal collapsed when the tension and conflicts between the Russians-backed groups, Iran’s IRGC and Hezbollah-backed forces emerged, centering on the partition of territorial control in Aleppo city and Deir Ez Zor in 2019. At that point, Maher al Assad had to mediate between the Russians, Hezbollah and IRGC. One commander in Liwa al Quds stated that the clashes with pro-Iranian groups were due to sectarian tensions, with Shi’a groups accusing Sunni ones of disloyalty, but he acknowledged that competition over territory was also a big issue. A new understanding was reached, according to a senior member of the militia, and by 2022 neither the IRGC nor Hezbollah objected anymore to Russian support for Liwa al Quds (weapons, funds or training). However, alongside the Russians, Iranian advisers were still posted with Liwa, as were Hezbollah’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian commentators criticized the August 2018 military cooperation agreement between Iran and Syria as bound to lead to more Syrian dependence on Iran and more direct Iranian influence inside Syria. These attitudes betrayed a high level of sensitivity about Iranian influence. In reality, as Mardasov and Semyonov noted, Russia’s influence over the “Syrian power apparatus” and its ability to replace Iranian influence with its own was “nothing more than an outright exaggeration.” Russia did not want to occupy a dominant position in the power structures in Damascus or contain Iran’s influence in Syria, because either option would be too expensive financially and politically. On the Iranian side, according to a commander in an IRGC-linked militia, it was acknowledged that it had been primarily the Russian advisers who worked to get the SAA back on its feet. The IRGC was the least keen to admit the degree to which the Russians and Iranians were interdependent – as late as March 2023 one IRGC representative stated that “We do not like the Russians at all, because they are bad for our future and our interests,”but even heacknowledged that the Russians were crucial to Syria: “They continue to assist the Syrian air and ground forces directly, offering better military strategy, better combat tactics and better political training to the army.” Iranian, Russian and even Hezbollah advisers often worked side by side in the same units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither Russia nor Iran aimed to crush each other’s influence and assert a monopoly over the Assad regime. The two sides were testing the opportunities for expanding their influence. According to a Russian military adviser, there was always the option of falling back to a partition of zones of influence between Russia and Iran, with the Russians focusing on the SAA and air force, and the Iranians on the militias.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conditions for fuller cooperation came into place when it became clear that Russia was deeply entangled in Ukraine, by 2023-2024. Indeed, despite all the competition and the frictions, the Russians, Iranians and Syrians tended to agree that the two allies of the Assad regime by 2024 were again working together, even describing each other as “good allies.” A Russian diplomat in January 2024 described Russia’s plans for the coming months as including cooperation and intelligence sharing with Iran. Another Russian diplomat agreed in October that coordination never stopped and explained that while the Russian and Iranian governments had different views, they were good allies with distinct objectives. A Syrian intelligence officer assessed that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;They still have arguments, and they both still have their own goals, but at the end of the day, they both have the same goal in Syria; they both have to win in Syria. Therefore, their relations are not that bad, and most of the time they are supporting each other and working together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Syrian army officer described the relationship as one of competition within Syria and of effective cooperation against external threats, with regular coordination meetings between the Iranians and Russians in Syria. The improvement in relations between the Iranians and the Russians was likely both due to the realization of the growing risk of instability and due to Russia’s pragmatism. It turned out, however, that Iran was not up to the task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;irans-failure-to-fill-the-gap&quot;&gt;Iran’s failure to fill the gap&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all of the IRGC’s optimism about expanding its influence in the wake of Russian downsizing in 2023-2024, the Iranians clearly did not have sufficient resources available. As a result, the Iranians had less success with the SAA than with the militias, and some units, like the 25th STD, remained impermeable to their influence, despite the Russians losing control over it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Russian diplomat, a Syrian military intelligence officer and an SAA officer all believed that the IRGC’s claims were overstated and that Russian influence, while declining, would not wither completely, noting that the Russians still had advisors and were still providing money and logistics. That was likely true, but mainly because the IRGC’s extra resources, as discussed above, were an order of magnitude smaller than Russia’s cuts. The Russians by 2024 had cut their financial commitments by $1.7 billion, while Iran, as discussed above, added $100 million. The Iranians did not deploy much extra manpower either. As the collapse of the regime approached, one year after the beginning of the Gaza crisis, the IRGC had only 1,500 men in Syria. Despite talks of remobilization of the foreign militias, as of July 2024, there were (according to a Syrian military source) 7,000 men in the ranks of Hezbollah, 3,000 men in the Afghan Fatimiyun, 1,000 in the Pakistani Zainabyun and some 2,000 Iraqis and Yemenis of various groups, for a total of about 13,000 men. This was a major reduction compared to the peak years of the civil war, when the foreign militias reached a peak manpower in Syria of 37,400 men in April 2018, according to a source within the Assad regime. The Iranians’ attempts to increase numbers were hampered by Hezbollah cutting its own numbers in Syria due to the confrontation with Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the rather unanimous assessment of Iran steadily expanding its influence at the expense of Russia did not signify optimism. The Syrians were doubtful about the regime’s ability to survive a crisis without extensive Russian support. Moreover, a Russian officer noted that some militias were behaving increasingly autonomously, not only in relation to Russia but also to Iran, and warned that problems should be expected in and around Latakia. As of late 2023, the Assad regime was already experiencing renewed friction with Iran and Hezbollah about the militias, since its leverage vis-à-vis Teheran had been reduced by Russia’s retrenchment. In the words of a Syrian general, we find signs of disappointment for Russia’s declining commitment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Russians have nothing to give, so they cannot gain ground among Syrian officers, particularly the Alawite ones. Two years ago, the Russians were talking about getting the Iranians out of Syria and control the country alone, but now the Russians need support and help from Iran and its militias in Syria and even in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Iran-Russia coalition in Syria appears to have been formed haphazardly in 2015. Its improvised character is apparent from the lack of agreement on any strategic plan beyond the commitment of Russian air power to the conflict. Perhaps this was inevitable, given the big gap separating the countries’ strategic, military and political cultures. The Russians arrived with their own state-building plan, centered around rebuilding the SAA. That might have been neither realistic nor sound, but the Iranian plan was no less dubious: it involved creating a network of armed groups that Iran would help mold into a kind of Syrian Hezbollah before forcing the Baathist state into a new ruling coalition, deeply reshaping the pre-2011 Syrian regime. By 2024, there was little sign that a Syrian Hezbollah was even at an embryonic stage of development. As one Russian interviewee noted, it would have been conceivable for Russia and Iran to agree on separate spheres of action so as to minimize friction. But that was not done until 2023-2024, and even then mainly because the Russians were dramatically downsizing their contribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russians showed greater pragmatism than the Iranians. Once it became clear that their original plan – pregnant with assumptions about what a proper Syrian state should and could look like – could not work, they shifted toward an approach that looked much like Iran’s, that is, building up a network of armed groups and military leaders. Unlike the Iranians, however, it does not appear that the Russians were under any illusion that this approach was a route to state-building of any kind. The Russians tried other routes to end the conflict, such as diplomacy and political reconciliation, which have not been discussed here. As all those seemed to falter, Moscow might have started seeing the Assad regime as a burden unlikely to yield more than the preservation of Russian bases in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran’s own plan for state-building failed rather dramatically in Syria. The Iranians proved quite effective at network building, which is not surprising given their past experience in Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen and given their arrival on the Syrian scene years ahead of the Russians. The Russians proved quite resilient competitors, however, not least thanks to their superior resources. When the Russians gave way from 2023 onward, the Iranians failed to make any progress toward their end goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know, of course, how it all ended. The Russians had virtually no assets on the ground at the end of 2024, but the Iranians and their foreign militias had almost 15,000 battle-tested men, not counting Syrian groups linked to the IRGC. The size of the attacking opposition force was by all accounts not much larger. Efforts to bring reinforcements from Iraq failed, and the Iranians and their allies gave up on the fights early on – during the fighting for Aleppo, which they had contested first with the opposition and then with the Russians for long years. Perhaps the lesson to be drawn is that while the Russians and Iranians spent a lot of energy competing with each other, their undoing was their failure to figure out a way to address the crucial weaknesses of the Assad regime.&lt;/p&gt;

With cyber products and services more in demand today than ever before, a combination of resulting factors has thrust the concept of Responsible Cyber Behaviour (RCB) further up government agendas.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Non-state actors – especially private companies – are a core part of cyber security services and infrastructure provision. As such, the need to understand and promote responsible behaviours (i.e. the production and selling of cyber capabilities for state use) has never been greater. But, despite the Cyber sector emerging as one of the fastest growing industries with broad capabilities that could risk national and shared interests, discussion of what it means to be a responsible industry player when developing cyber services and products is still relatively underdeveloped.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The necessity to understand and promote responsible behaviours within the Defence and Cyber sectors (i.e. the production and selling of cyber and defence capabilities for state use) has never been greater. The challenging global landscape coupled with the increasing velocity of modern warfare capabilities has highlighted a strong demand for responsibility in the production and distribution of both cyber and military services. Despite the Cyber Security sector emerging as one of the fastest growing industries with broad capabilities that could risk national and shared interests, discussion of what it means to be a responsible industry player when developing cyber security services and products is still relatively underdeveloped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Defence sector, including companies including BAE Systems, have integrated cyber security as a core part of the commercial offering. Additionally, Defence contractors are well-positioned to consider questions of responsible cyber behaviour, because they have historically had to deal with and reflect on many questions concerning responsible and irresponsible use of military, and more recently, cyber capabilities. These provide us with strong parallels in the potential for misuse, proliferation and harm to individuals, society and governments. While the possible harms of cyber are not as clear cut as military capabilities, the interconnectedness of the global landscape and reliance on digital products in everyday use presents a different opportunity, but just as vital for Defence primes, to develop and continue practises from the Defence industry into Cyber markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper also examines the use of legal and non-legal mechanisms in the Defence industry compared to the Cyber sector. Legal tools, including legislation and export control regimes, demonstrate the government’s role in ensuring strong regulation and enforcement of compliance through accountable measures: the backbone of responsible behaviour. Non-legal tools, including ethics and business standards, are also essential to ensure that the private sector can create common practices of good governance – along with increased transparency to eliminate ambiguity and reduce the risk of irresponsibility. Current discussions, including the Pall Mall Process, highlight an ambiguity around corporate responsibility that emphasises the need for collaboration across industry, government and academia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Definitions of responsible behaviour are likely to evolve and mature to reflect the times. Legal and non-legal mechanisms can promote robust concepts of responsible behaviour into cyber discussions and, in turn, codify into coherent and broadly applicable business practices.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-introduction&quot;&gt;1 Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;11-about-the-responsible-cyber-behaviour-project-and-publication&quot;&gt;1.1 About the Responsible Cyber Behaviour project and publication&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malicious activities by state and non-state actors in cyberspace present a continuous threat to international peace, stability and security. Geopolitical tensions often tend to favour a polarised view of what responsibility means in cyber and tech security, thus leaving out the important nuance as to how different regions and stakeholders perceive it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) launched the Global Partnership for Responsible Cyber Behaviour (GP-RCB) – a platform for research and dialogue comprised of over 80 scholars from countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, North America, the Middle East and Africa, and the Indo-Pacific. The GP-RCB is a global research hub designed to enable evidence-based action on cyber policy and cyber security issues within international multilateral organisations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better inform practical steps that unblock the international debate on the application of rules, norms and principles in cyberspace, the GP-RCB focuses on understanding and identifying the varying approaches to cyberspace and technology taken by states in an increasingly fractured geopolitical landscape. The network responds to a notable fragmentation and knowledge gap in the global research community on Responsible Cyber Behaviour (RCB), marked by an inconsistent understanding of mechanisms, concepts and interpretations of responsibility, alongside a lack of clarity on what RCB means in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;12-research-aim&quot;&gt;1.2 Research Aim&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The malicious use of information and communications technologies is far more complex than it was twenty years ago when the first set of cyber norms on responsible state behaviour were agreed by states at the UN. Non-state actors – especially private companies – have become a core part of cyber security services and infrastructure provision. Therefore, from both a multilateral and threat-based perspective, this is an appropriate time to consider how the debate about responsible behaviour in cyberspace not only extends beyond the remit of national governments and multi-lateral organisations but most importantly, how different parts of the industry understand responsible cyber behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This research paper investigates the potential role of Defence companies in shaping responsible behaviours as a complement to the behaviours of nation states. To support fresh policy thinking on RCB, specifically drawing on BAE Systems’ experience as a Defence prime, it seeks to identify parallels and lessons from the Defence sector that could inform both private sector and governmental approaches to responsible behaviours in the adjacent Cyber sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;13-approach&quot;&gt;1.3 Approach&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Defence sector offers a number of parallels to the Cyber sector – a term used in this paper to encompass the UK Cyber sector and includes businesses that provide products or services that enable the protection of internet connected systems and their users, as well as cyber capabilities that might be used by states in cyber operations that advance strategic interests. Defence and Cyber share several similarities, such as the use of advanced technology, common suppliers, customer markets, export regulation, and a need to control the use of goods and services due to the potential for misuse. Defence also offers Cyber the chance to learn from the far greater domestic and international history of reflection and codification of responsible behaviour across the Defence sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper draws on several data collection methods including academic literature review, desk-based research, and interviews with those working in the Defence and Cyber sectors, academia, and government. Those contributing did so on condition of anonymity and so remarks have not been attributed to any individual organisations. The views expressed, therefore, should not be seen as representing the position of any single entity or that of the Defence or Cyber sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper’s focus is limited to exploring the primary factors that drive responsible behaviour in the Defence industry – chiefly domestic and international legislation, regulation, and commonly agreed principles (such as military ethics) – when it comes to the development and sale of capabilities. To make the most meaningful comparison between Defence and Cyber, this paper does not explore the impact of military culture and its model of leadership or exercising as part of the definitions of responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the paper is not focused on how Defence firms promote cyber security governance and practices throughout the development of their military platforms and tools (i.e. product security). The paper focuses on the production and distribution of cyber and defence capabilities and seeks to provide insights into the Cyber-Defence industrial nexus that can inform future research and policy reflections on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Defence and Cyber share several similarities, such as the use of advanced technology, common suppliers, customer markets, export regulation, and a need to control the use of goods and services due to the potential for misuse.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-background&quot;&gt;2 Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;21-why-now&quot;&gt;2.1 Why now?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has been produced at an inflection point of Cyber’s evolution and its place in the current political domain. As the UN Open Ended Working Group on Cyber (OEWG) ends this year, and initiatives like the Pall Mall Process continue discussions on the proliferation and irresponsible use of cyber capabilities, it is timely to understand what Responsible Cyber Behaviour means for a range of actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cyber sector – including offensive and defensive capabilities – sits at a complex interplay of heightened geopolitical tensions and an increasingly challenging landscape. Cybercrime is projected to cost $13.82 trillion globally by 2028 and the proliferation of offensive cyber capabilities has increased the pressure on states to continue to invest and develop. Cyber capacities and capabilities provide an easy route for malicious actors to cause harm by exploiting vulnerabilities across organisations, supply chains, sectors and national borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s Defence budget rose to £59.8 billion in 2025/26, with plans to increase to 2.5% of GDP by April 2027. The UK also continues to build its vision as a global cyber power. The National Cyber Security Centre is playing a leading role in cyber security at home and overseas while the National Cyber Force provides cyber operations in support of national security interests, collaborating with allies to ensure strategic cooperation as well as designing principles for responsible cyber operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In parallel, under the Digital Europe Programme for the period 2021-2027, the EU committed €1.6 billion to cyber security capabilities and established the European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology and Research Competence Centre. This highlights a growing effort and investment to ensure that cyberspace can be secured, with regulation where appropriate, to manage the diversity of cyber capabilities not previously recognised. Now more than ever, it is useful to reflect on non-state actors, such as the Defence industry, to understand what responsibility means to the private sector, how it should be employed, and the intersection between military and cyber services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;22-the-defence-and-cyber-marketplaces&quot;&gt;2.2 The Defence and Cyber marketplaces&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has one of the world’s leading Defence industries with orders worth £14.5bn in 2023, dominated by aerospace products and services. The UK’s Defence industry is shaped by government priorities and military requirements. It includes large private sector contractors and manufacturers building equipment, hardware, advanced electronics, communications, surveillance and cyber security solutions – all underpinned by a global supply chain. Looking more broadly, the US is dominated by a handful of major Defence primes while, as an economic zone, Europe comprises a more diverse – albeit fragmentated – market with around 15 major Defence primes and thousands of small and medium sized enterprises. Barriers to entry into the Defence sector can be high, requiring significant capital investment, complex and lengthy development and procurement processes, strict national and international regulatory frameworks (primarily relating to export and compliance), and international collaboration. Firms tend to be large and well established; some have thousands of government security-cleared staff. With long-term contracts and dependence on government procurement cycles, growth tends to be stable; until 2022, UK exports were primarily destined for the Middle East. Now they are concentrated on Europe and likely to grow further in this region, which will shape the demand and production of future military platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many large companies straddle both sectors, providing defence and cyber products and services. In the UK, for example, this includes BAE Systems, Rolls Royce, Leonardo, QinetiQ, Thales UK, Atos UK, and Babcock International. The broader Cyber sector is more diverse, with a myriad of small and medium sized businesses. The sector has grown rapidly since the 1990s, with rising demand for digital services. Initially focused largely on cyber security (such as antivirus software and firewalls), the market has expanded significantly over the last 15 years in line with the mushrooming use of the internet, social media, cloud services, and the dynamic threat landscape to include intrusive and offensive cyber capabilities. That said, cyber security still dominates the UK market, representing roughly 65% of total UK security export revenue in 2023. Due to the similarities in relation to national security between cyber operations and defence products including developing capabilities in offensive cyber, this paper will focus on this subsection of the Cyber sector in order to establish a comparison of how responsible behaviour has and will continue to develop in this space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though highly competitive and dependant on access to scarce expert resources, entering the Cyber market is simpler than becoming a Defence company. Upfront costs are lower, technology development is faster, and as the market is wider than government there are fewer barriers to entry (at least when compared with the Defence sector, where legal prerequisites are required to obtain government contracts, such as the Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations 2011 (DSPCR). UK security exports have risen rapidly from £4.3bn in 2016 to £11bn in 2023. Similar to defence exports, the majority of UK cyber exports by destination region were for Europe and North America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;23-defining-responsible-behaviour&quot;&gt;2.3 Defining responsible behaviour&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responsible Cyber Behaviour (RCB), as defined in RUSI’s RCB guide, refers to the collective expectations of state and non-state actors regarding how they should behave in cyberspace. Behaviour comprises the values, norms, policies, practices, and technologies that are intended to protect and secure cyberspace. These expectations are highly contested and differ across the globe. RUSI’s RCB guide allowed a basis for comparing the Cyber sector with the Defence sector and the associated domain of armed conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Core principles relating to armed conflict have long been embedded in international humanitarian and human rights laws, treaties and conventions, given effect via national legislation and regulation to control the development, sale, export and use of military and dual-use goods. Underpinning these core principles is the importance of necessity, proportionality and need to minimise harm to civilians and civilian property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviewees engaged in our research highlighted that export control was one of the biggest drivers of responsible behaviour. Export control regimes and compliance offer a useful litmus test for what is deemed responsible practise in the development and distribution of capabilities, and what is deemed irresponsible and the appropriate penalties involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst export control is a key factor in defining responsible behaviour, this paper recognises that other factors are also relevant, and proposes that responsible behaviour in the Defence industry should be understood through the following mechanisms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regulation&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Rules that are robust and broad enough to outline what the Defence sector must do to be compliant, with distinctions for what is deemed irresponsible in relation to the national interests and international obligations capabilities are subject to.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enforcement&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Clear and proportionate enforcement of regulation, in which national governments set out penalties for non-compliance including the publication of fines and charges for violations of regulation that can include “consent agreements” covering remedial measures.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Transparency&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Defence contractors must operate with transparency when conducting their business, including in their operational frameworks and protection of sensitive information. This goes beyond simply compliance with regulation and includes ensuring accountability of all parties involved, such as the supplier, the customer and any third party.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Governance&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Ensuring that firms have robust internal frameworks to govern responsible behaviours – necessary to ensure both regulatory compliance and responsibility more widely, e.g. relating to ethical standards of conduct.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Collaboration&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To stay relevant in an environment of technological advances and geopolitical changes, high level multi-stakeholder collaboration (including government, industry and academia) is essential to grow the discourse on how customers, trade bodies, policymakers and contractors remain responsible in the product lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though recognised as an important issue at the turn of the millennium, international efforts to define cyber operations and establish common views on responsible behaviour only slowly gained traction after 2010. It took a series of cyber incidents against Estonia in 2007, the Republic of Georgia in 2008 and Iran (discovered in 2010) to demonstrate the destructive potential of cyber operations. It was at this point that the international community started to take the risk of cyber breaches and their consequent impact seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, discussion of Responsible Cyber Behaviour has grown in line with the development of cyber capabilities. Huge steps have been taken to codify thinking on this topic – notably via the UN framework of responsible state behaviour in cyber space, agreed in 2015, and via a swathe of international and national legislation that gave effect to norms designed to protect human rights in cyber space by placing increased protections on the privacy of personal information, such as the EU’s GDPR in 2016. A year after the devastating WannaCry ransomware attacks, the 2018 “Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace” represented the first major multi-stakeholder initiative that sought to involve private companies and civil society organisations in producing principles of expected cyber behaviour. Focused primarily on establishing a defensive posture (e.g. protecting intellectual property, supply chains, electoral systems, the domain name system, infrastructure and individuals) these initiatives also included calls to promote international norms and the non-proliferation of intrusive cyber capabilities – developed further by the 2024 Pall Mall Process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;24-responsible-behaviour-in-the-defence-sector&quot;&gt;2.4 Responsible behaviour in the Defence sector&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Challenges associated with defining responsible behaviour in the Defence sector have persisted despite extensive discourse and legislation. The Defence sector evolves with the development of modern warfare, producing more complex technologies and reflecting expenditure on land, maritime, air and cyber capabilities. The Defence sector has also increased in interoperability, reflecting the need to collaborate with other nations in theatre. The Defence sector today is heavily regulated and focused on compliance – concerning the production and exporting of military capabilities. This is not without reason. In relation to defence exports, violating regulations can lead to massive fines, reputational damage and even imprisonment for those found responsible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The core challenge of defining cyber responsibilities reflect similar trade-offs to those in the Defence sector historically: competing interests of the faster-paced private sector in meeting increasing market demands versus establishing robust governance of responsible practices over a longer stretch of time.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-analysis&quot;&gt;3 Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;31-how-the-defence-industry-embeds-responsible-behaviour&quot;&gt;3.1 How the Defence industry embeds responsible behaviour&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand how the Defence industry demonstrates key lessons that could apply to the Cyber sector, we must examine how this industry has embedded responsible behaviour. The Defence industry helps governments protect sovereignty and respond militarily to threats to national and international security. The volume of arms trade has increased throughout the 20th century. Public perception of the Defence industry is nuanced, influenced by global events and ethical dilemmas; sometimes garnering patriotic support during wartime or conversely public outcry, particularly over increasing advancements of capabilities and their potential misuse. Legal controls have grown in line with the landscape of war, in order to ensure appropriate constraints on how industry and governments are able to operate. Corporate responsibility has been supported by the close nature of Defence work between sovereign primes and their national governments – Defence contractors work within the authority of government-issued requirements. As a result, a breadth of precedents and regular practices underpin how the Defence industry can promote responsible behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irresponsible behaviours in the Defence industry can stem from non-compliance with export control regulations, supply chain risks, mishandling of sensitive information, and – in more severe cases – corruption or bribery. Though the US Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) does not often issue consent agreements, it nonetheless provides a significant route to highlight violations of the US International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and penalise defence companies. Consent agreements can be issued for unauthorised exports of goods and information, unauthorised selling and production without licences, or violation of classification and jurisdiction. They provide a means to hold companies to account for improper handling of contracts and are helpful in letting industry know what irresponsible behaviour looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the combination of the nature of the Defence industry, the harm to life that military capabilities can pose, and the processes to penalise irresponsible behaviour, industry and government have prescribed strong business practices that are ingrained into regular activities of both the customer and Defence supplier. In the UK, the Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations 2011 (DSPCR) outlines the special rules and environment in which contractors must align with national security interests and meet requirements for procurement. These regulations set a baseline for contractors in establishing robust business practices. If contractors fail to develop appropriate infrastructure to handle sensitive information, ensure compliance with legislation and licencing requirements, they may not be considered for future contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One interviewee judged that there were wider benefits to responsible behaviour that influence business behaviour. Ensuring compliance with legal requirements and contractual obligations is not just about maintaining a licence to operate, but is vital to maintaining shareholder and public trust while safeguarding international and national security. This is likely to be applicable to cyber companies as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following sections consider how legal and non-legal tools, as well as international cooperation, can influence and promote responsible behaviour in Defence, and – where possible – draw out potential implications for the Cyber sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;32-legal-approaches-to-influencing-responsible-behaviour&quot;&gt;3.2 Legal approaches to influencing responsible behaviour&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on how the Defence industry has been regulated and considers how the Cyber sector can be influenced by the same legal tools. Both Defence and Cyber regulations are underpinned by a breadth of legislation within the UK, as well as international norms and standards. This provides the foundations for defining what responsible behaviour looks like for government and industry. Much of the legislation extends responsibility to companies on misuse and non-compliance, adapting over time to broaden what is acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand how definitions of responsibility are promoted within the Defence and Cyber sectors, it is worth considering the range of major legislation and agreements, both in the UK and internationally:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/xaSydeJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding legislation across Defence and Cyber is important when determining the motivations for placing protections on developing and using capabilities. Legislation pertaining to Defence – namely the use and misuse and development and sale of defence capabilities – has evolved with the changing landscape of war (including the use of nuclear and chemical). Internationally, UN Security Resolutions have kept pace with the geopolitical landscape of capability development, while state-based policies have ensured that businesses develop and sell responsibly. As a result, there is a breadth of domestic and international legislation which underpinned the nature of military capabilities, seeking to reduce harm to civilians and oppression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK Cyber legislation is also multi-faceted. It is underpinned by the right to data privacy and, via regulations such as the NIS Regulations (Security of Network &amp;amp; Information Systems), the protection of essential services through the safeguarding of data confidentiality, integrity and availability. This drives both the requirement for robust cyber security on electronic devices and systems and the misuse of cyber tools to violate privacy, including ransomware and intrusion capabilities. Businesses are held to account for how they handle data and manage interactions across cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyber security regulation serves to mitigate risks on businesses and individuals in handling data, while misuse – such as unauthorised hacking – is prohibited under national law. The Computer Misuse Act 1990 serves as the foundation for preventing cyber intrusion in the UK. Firms operating in both sectors noted, however, that it is difficult to ensure Responsible Cyber Behaviour – in its broadest sense – through legislative means alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enforcement and penalties for non-compliance with Cyber regulation can also be costly and risk reputational damage to providers and services. Like Defence-related legislation, Cyber regulation is designed to protect the availability and integrity of technologies – particularly in critical sectors. In the UK, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) controls not just the use of personal data, but also the transfer of information and mishandling. Coupled with the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR), cyber service providers must ensure compliant security infrastructure. Fines for mishandling data, violations of network security laws and breaches of GDPR are not uncommon across all industries, with Meta topping the list with a $1.3 billion fine for illicit transfers of personal data from the EU to the US in 2023. Amazon also faced a $877 million fine for breaches of GDPR for using personal data to run targeted advertisements to users. While these were corporate violations of cyber regulation, these penalties serve as precedent for cyber services operating in the public sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other legal mechanisms also help us understand how states view Responsible Cyber Behaviour. One example from 2021 involved information gathering software called Pegasus, in which malware produced by the NSO Group was used to hack into smartphones resulting in the leak of personal data from 50,000 phone numbers. After a lengthy investigation, the NSO Group was found liable and subject to sanctions, including being placed on the US Commerce Entity List for acting “contrary to the foreign policy and national security interests of the US”, thereby restricting its access to US technology. The Pegasus case highlights how governments can enforce more severe penalties beyond fines, ensuring effective sanctions in absence of clear breaches of Cyber regulation. The Pegasus case, alongside the numerous penalties faced by larger service providers, highlights the necessity for clearer controls on the handling of cyber capabilities in line with those in the Defence industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While the impact can be severe, the enforcement of regulations serves to change behaviours and highlight the need to be transparent about both responsible and irresponsible behaviours as a precedent for the industry.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;33-the-role-of-export-control-in-driving-responsible-behaviour&quot;&gt;3.3 The role of export control in driving responsible behaviour&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One approach to understanding responsibility in the use, misuse, development and sale of cyber and defence capabilities is through an examination of export control regulation. Necessary to ensuring responsible selling, end use and destination of exported products and services, export control enables strict enforcement of compliance and clear penalties for misuse. The UK – like the US and EU – upholds an extensive set of export control regimes to ensure that the sale of capabilities (including dual-use items, weapons of mass destruction and other military equipment) does not violate international law or undermine UK national security. In 2017, global arms exports rose to $32 billion, the highest since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Critical to this is the issuing and monitoring of licences. Exporters must apply for licences to develop and export new capabilities and ensure they are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Preventing unauthorised exports of defence articles, including technical data&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Preventing unauthorised exports of sensitive information to foreign employees&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ensuring goods and services are supplied to their intended destination, for the intended end use&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Complying with international obligations, including foreign policy and diplomatic agreements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breaking export control licensing rules can result in serious penalties, including sanctions, consent agreements and fines. Interviewees for this paper noted that robust enforcement drives accountability and strong controls to prevent violation. They also noted that the loss of public reputation, financial repercussions and distrust with government stakeholders incentivise reforms by Defence companies to minimise the risk of future export control breaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US ITAR has been used to serve penalties for irresponsible trading in the Defence sector, which can include billion-dollar charges to resolve bribery and control violations. Such penalties centre accountability on sovereign states and create controls for industry in developing capabilities in line with international human rights laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development and distribution of cyber capabilities are also subject to a set of complex export control regulations. Cyber products can be utilised by a wider base of state and non-state end users, so ensuring that their export is legally underpinned is paramount for suppliers. The Export Control Joint Unit operates a “catch and release” process to support the issue of export licences for cyber products, where cyber products are subject to catch-all controls if they could involve breaches of international law. Exemptions are then issued to elements of capabilities that do not pose risk as the technology is consolidated, for instance, whether the physical goods the product is embedded in is subject to controls is dependent on its encryption and other factors. Furthermore, the robust regulation around CMA and its complementary regulation serves as a strong mandate for organisations to remain responsible in producing cyber products, and common practices for handling data on their infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;34-the-limitations-of-export-control-as-a-means-of-regulation&quot;&gt;3.4 The limitations of export control as a means of regulation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relationship between Defence companies and their customers is also dependent on export control regulations, especially for end use jurisdiction. Differing export control regimes present different jurisdictional requirements for firms to meet. Though clear on what can and cannot be exported and where, UK export licence controls do not include end use monitoring or approval for third-party selling once it has been exported. This presents additional considerations for Defence companies in developing and exporting a product, particularly concerning potential misuse. One interviewee noted that to manage the challenge of assessing risk posed by misuse and the likelihood of onward transfer, some Defence companies have established clear guidance to staff and an exceptions process that involves additional scrutiny in more complex cases (e.g. those involving a new capability or market) to help identify factors of international humanitarian law that might be affected by a new licence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By comparison, exporting cyber capabilities – including issuing of licenses – can also be complex when determining end use jurisdiction. One interviewee noted that determining the impact of a cyber capability can be uncertain, especially in transfers of technologies. To combat some of this ambiguity, one firm interviewed for this paper uses a distributor system to ensure localised awareness of end destination and end use, providing them with additional expertise to maintain compliance. This external support can help firms to manage multiple compliance regimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein, ambiguity surrounding jurisdictions is present within cyber export control. Navigating differing encryption and data handling requirements is key to maintaining responsible production of cyber capabilities. The approach of “catch and release” in cyber export control is inherently different to the Defence model, where there are clearer definitions of what is controlled from the outset. This approach is understandable given the speed at which cyber capabilities are developing. But nonetheless, it creates challenges in understanding what does and does not require an export licence. The private sector is regularly called upon to assist in placing export controls on cyber capabilities, utilising technical expertise to support judgements on licences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future of cyber export control is still largely undetermined, with questions of ambiguity around dual-use and open source technology. The problem of accountability across multiple jurisdictions is also present in Cyber. For example, relicensing software products creates some ambiguity over data protections and compliance checking. Consideration by the Pall Mall process of multi-stakeholder and multi-jurisdictional challenges associated with enforcing control over offensive cyber product sales should help bring much needed definition here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to reach the maturity of defence export control, the Cyber sector must have a defined scope of controlled services and capabilities, particularly in defining prerequisite security and controls for technology transfers that incorporate sensitive data. Ambiguity within cyber export control – namely for intrusive cyber tools – may lead to violations, whether intentional or unwittingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;To combat this ambiguity, effective stakeholder collaboration involving industry, government and academia can help to share learnings from the Defence industry to support responsible behaviour in cyber export control.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;35-non-legal-approaches-to-influencing-responsible-behaviour&quot;&gt;3.5 Non-legal approaches to influencing responsible behaviour&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethics, transparency measures, and collaboration play central roles in responsible behaviour in the Defence industry. These approaches have been shaped by historical events, non-legal doctrines, politics and public sentiment. As societal standards continue to evolve, ethical considerations increasingly influence how the public view the actions and ethos of both private and public Defence organisations. Change can be driven through unwritten cultural perceptions or through socially accepted standards such as war theories, military doctrines and international agreements, as well as the risk to organisational reputation. While the legal system reflects ethical viewpoints which delineate Defence industry conduct, it does not remove grey areas that divide public opinion, regardless of legality. In addition, organisational standards, policies and guidelines within the Defence sector can be utilised to address gaps in the law. As a result, organisations use non-legal tools beyond legal requirements to uphold transparency and accountability of Defence contractors, to maintain responsible behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following table captures some non-legal tools discussed within this paper:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ZUSVuEO.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;the-role-of-ethics&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The role of ethics&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Theories and doctrines have evolved over the course of history to define moral conduct in traditional warfare. Though cyber operations are relatively new compared to kinetic tools, their impact is being considered with reference to a similar set of ethical principles. In Defence, Just War Theory addresses “the justification of how and why wars are fought,” in which the rules of just conduct are assessed through the “two broad principles of discrimination and proportionality.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Similarly, the British Army has developed military doctrines which codify “best practice, based on enduring principles (…) from history and validated lessons from experience and operations” highlighting the importance of applying ethical values through lessons learned. In relation to cyber operations, the UK’s National Cyber Force determines that the “strict adherence to robust legal and ethical frameworks” is also vital. NATO’s Doctrine for Cyberspace Operations requires Law of Armed Conflict principles of “military necessity, humanity, proportionality” to be applied, with “interference with critical infrastructure or functionality, severity and reversibility of effects” considered. This parallels traditional warfare ethical standards of proportionality and legitimacy.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;collaboration-across-industry&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Collaboration across industry&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Research conducted through interviews for this paper suggests that large Defence organisations typically do not distinguish between defence and cyber tools when considering aspects of responsible behaviour. Some industry interviewees questioned whether firms without a long history of export control compliance followed the same approach. Potential reasons that were posited for differences in approach might include company size and experience – with larger Defence firms arguably able to access more resources to invest in regulatory expertise, compliance functions, and company-wide training and oversight than smaller Cyber start-ups. Others questioned whether international regulators had the capacity to drive consistent standards and noted that some firms could use the disparity in common practices to their commercial advantage, such as by operating from national jurisdictions judged to have more permissive export control regimes. One approach to support smaller firms is the use of trade bodies and sharing of best practices. TechUK has created a network of Cyber and Defence firms to connect and discuss practical solutions to barriers in the industry, going as far as establishing committees to build common frameworks of corporate responsibility.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;This valuable initiative highlights how the private sector can work collaboratively to establish common practices that engrain responsibility across the industry – with more experienced organisations willingly sharing their learnings to benefit the sector as a whole.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;the-importance-of-transparency-and-public-opinion&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The importance of transparency and public opinion&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Brand reputation is crucial in an age when “86% of consumers believe authenticity is vital in deciding which brands they like and support.” While government-to-government agreements underpin the international Defence industry, and investors typically care about where companies are based and who they sell to, reputations built on responsible practices can set an organisation apart. Linked to this, Defence companies are aware that a product ending up in the hands of an unintended or controversial third-party can lead to irresponsible use, damage company reputation and impacting share prices in an already specialised market. While defence capabilities are not sold to the public, public and investor perceptions of the Defence industry impacts share price. As well as influencing government policy and investor sentiment, a reputation for ethical conduct also has a significant impact on recruitment and retention – vital to long-term commercial success.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Events shape public perception, both for the Defence and Cyber sectors. For Defence companies, conflict may heighten awareness of what capabilities are developed and their end use. Whether this perception is positive or not, the Defence sector remains vital due to the necessity of a strong defence versus potential human rights violations. For the Cyber sector, much of public perception is intertwined with the impact of cyber and digital capabilities in global civil society. Following the Pegasus case, the NSO Group’s share price was deemed “valueless” by investors, highlighting the public reaction over irresponsible use of cyber capabilities. This presents an interesting comparison, wherein the growing Cyber sector may seem more volatile to shifts in public opinion, however it reflects the societal value shifts present in defence too. As the Cyber sector and public understanding of its capabilities continues to grow, similar discourse surrounding the critical role of Defence in national security interests may be reflected into Cyber.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;embedding-standards-in-business-operations&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Embedding standards in business operations&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While legal requirements define business activities and conduct in the Defence sector, such as the export of military platforms and capabilities, organisational standards, policies and guidelines address gaps in the law and reduce potential ambiguity and confusion for individuals who work under the remit of laws regarding the Defence sector. Interviewees noted that creating and maintaining clear and accessible standards, policies and processes that reflect societal ethics and organisational values provides clear expectations for staff. Supported by training, individuals can utilise these tools to embed responsible behaviour and accountability in daily operations.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;As well as complementing legal requirements, organisational processes and policies also help address staff expectations of their employer; with a more ethically aware workforce many employees do take into consideration the impact their work has on the local community and wider public. Company processes and guidance are also relatively simple to update and so can also help firms adjust dynamically to changes – e.g. to accommodate technological advancements within company policies – more quickly than regulation.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;a-structural-approach-to-responsible-behaviour&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A structural approach to responsible behaviour&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Defence organisations also use resources like collaboration groups, ethics committees and end-destination assessments to guide their approaches to capability development and exports. Through assessing the risks associated with end use and destination, ethics committees can evaluate potential misuse and reputational concerns before conducting sales. Lawful products may be rejected if they breach ethical principles, regardless of whether the sale is lawful and requested by the customer. Defence organisations interviewed as part of this paper utilise export control committees or governing bodies to review how trading principles are applied, to both comply with legal requirements and to abide by ethical principles set out by the organisation.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Companies may utilise second-party distributors to ensure export control requirements have been met. This is especially critical considering the challenge Defence organisations face with differing ethical perspectives and freedoms across the international landscape. National and international collaboration fosters responsible behaviour; transparency between industry partners through knowledge sharing and open communication with the aim of developing the Defence industry in turn encourages the adoption of new practices and ethical changes. Training and awareness events with small to medium enterprises, whose users are twice more likely to encounter threats than at large organisations, promote knowledge exchange between organisations of various sizes – each serving different perspectives by managing different customer types.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Finally, Defence organisations collaborate closely with government, notably the Export Control Joint Unit (ECJU) and wider government bodies such as the Department for Business and Trade (DBT).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Incorporating experts from industry, policymakers and academia to create a forum to share best practice may encourage more meaningful dialogue and collaboration to understand what it means to be responsible.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-what-lessons-can-we-learn-from-defence&quot;&gt;4 What lessons can we learn from Defence?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development of principles and processes in the Defence sector to govern the sale of military capabilities has been largely influenced by legal and non-legal mechanisms, setting the precedent for Defence contractors to establish concepts of responsible behaviours. While this process is not perfect, the large and evolving discourse and the high barrier to entry to secure business in this sector have influenced the concept of responsibility over time. These influences can be adopted into a wide framework of responsible cyber, particularly in offensive cyber, and to tackle proliferation of cyber intrusion capabilities that violate national and international privacy laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Significant work has been invested in defining cyber norms at an international level, and – in the UK – making clear that Responsible Cyber Behaviour means avoiding indiscriminate harm in cyberspace, building public trust through effective cyber security practices, transparency, and safeguarding data, and working collaboratively to build a global consensus. Despite this, it seems likely that further effort is required to help firms understand how to create business governance and structures that embed responsible behaviour to support the responsible production and sale of capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through our review of the Defence sector, this paper suggests that the following lessons relating to the mechanisms that define responsible behaviour are worth considering in the cyber context:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regulation&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;International agreements have shaped common principles of responsible behaviours, but ultimately domestic legislation is vital to enforce accountability. The industry experts engaged as part of this research are aware of the potential impact of cyber goods and services, their potential for misuse, and the value of controls, but cautioned that the nature of cyber means the fast-paced changes raise questions as to whether export control regulation covering cyber is agile enough to keep pace. Ambiguity could easily create scope for intentional or unwitting violations, and so guidance must continue to be updated to ensure regulation remains aligned. Incorporating Responsible Cyber Behaviour into education and training could help to build understanding of potential violations, and how to capture the correct controls into technologies. A sharing of common irresponsible actions could support the growth of industry code of practise.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enforcement&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Through the continuing enforcement of regulations – including fines, sanctions and consent agreements – commercial understanding of responsible behaviour will continue to grow. As well as publicising violations, which have both a deterrent and educational effect, enforcement bodies could collect and publish statistics on the nature and frequency of violations. This could help firms prevent common avoidable mistakes and grow understanding of the nature and extent of cyber capabilities covered by export regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Transparency&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As a consequence of enforcement action, public and parliamentary scrutiny, and an awareness of the value of public, academic and third sector engagement, numerous Defence firms publish details of their business practices. As well as building confidence, this helps firms understand and reinforce commercial norms. From examining the frequency of consent agreements issued for Defence firms in failing to control the movement of goods and sensitive information, we conclude that ensuring transparency through operational and business practice is key. Building transparency so that users and industry understand regulations and misconduct is an important lesson for Cyber, including through responsible cyber capacity building and cyber security infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Governance&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Effective governance structures are key to conducting responsible business. Stakeholder interviews noted that larger firms have more capacity to build these governance structures that embed due diligence. Smaller organisations potentially have less capacity to build a suitable corporate ecosystem through training, compliance and auditing. The integrated nature of the Cyber sector and larger firms’ inevitable reliance on smaller Cyber firms, creates a mutual incentive to increase the cross-pollination of best practice across established players and younger organisations. This can be supported by industry bodies able to facilitate sharing and the development of strong governance mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Collaboration&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Standardisation of responsible behaviour beyond legal compliance has yet to be established within the Cyber sector. Positive steps have been made – including through recommendations in the Pall Mall Process. Setting standards for conduct within industry through utilisation of a wide arena of actors is essential for building an open, peaceful and stable cyberspace. Recognising that Responsible Cyber Behaviours contribute to the health of civil society, it is necessary that regular collaboration across the multi-stakeholder landscape – involving industry, government and academia – continues to keep up with the evolution of Cyber. Academia can help evaluate emerging risks and provide ongoing analysis, while industry has real-world experience of the current threat landscape and government owns the operational requirements. The creation of a forum for the sharing of challenges and exchange of good practice within and across both the Defence and Cyber industry could further contribute to the development of appropriate corporate norms for each sector. Amidst increased geopolitical tensions and competing interests, significant impact could be achieved through the adoption of a common framework developed by and agreed upon by the above parties to define responsible corporate behaviour in this arena.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engagement with industry experts as part our research showed that while some firms have defined responsible behaviour in their business policies, others have not. The summary below attempts to capture common factors that can help drive responsible behaviour raised in interviews and identified during research for this paper.&lt;/p&gt;

To capitalize on this opportunity, the United States should continue to support RISC-V for future chip innovation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RISC-V architecture is an open, international standard governing how software interfaces with hardware in a computer. It serves as a shared language that sets the parameters for communication and interoperability. Open standards provide a means for industry participants to collaborate and develop technological solutions that can help accelerate innovation and limit misuse of intellectual property (IP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some policymakers fear an open standard could threaten U.S. national security and competitive advantage. However, the openness of the standard does not by itself pose a risk. Indeed, RISC-V does not contain sensitive IP, nor does its cooperative development require firms to divulge IP. Firms compete on technologies developed using this platform, not on the platform itself. RISC-V enhances the competitiveness of U.S. chip design firms by creating a flexible, low-risk, and low-cost platform for collaboration. To capitalize on this opportunity, the United States should continue to support RISC-V for future chip innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;risc-v-in-the-isa-landscape&quot;&gt;RISC-V in the ISA Landscape&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, there are two leading semiconductor instruction set architectures (ISAs) covering most of the market: x86 (from U.S.-based Intel/AMD) and ARM (from United Kingdom–based Arm Holdings, which is majority owned by the Japanese SoftBank Group). There are two primary kinds of ISAs—complex instruction set computers (CISCs) and reduced instruction set computers (RISCs)—which are organized differently and operate at different efficiencies; x86 is based on CISC principles, and ARM is based on RISC. x86 ISAs are used in most laptop and desktop computers, while ARM has almost complete market share in the mobile world. ARM and Intel/AMD ISAs are proprietary standards, so other companies and designers can license ARM IP or buy and use processors based on Intel/AMD IP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/wCiAe9j.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, the newest entrant to the field is RISC-V (pronounced “risk five”), an open-standard ISA based on RISC principles that chip design teams can access and implement for free across various use cases without restrictions on licensing. In other words, RISC-V allows for easy customization with a royalty-free license and no license restrictions on modifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Global Platform:&lt;/strong&gt; Initially developed at the University of California, Berkeley’s Parallel Computing Laboratory in 2010, RISC-V is now managed by the Swiss nonprofit standards body RISC-V International. The nonprofit attracts a diverse community of 4,600 members across 70 countries, and includes firms, universities, community organizations, and individuals who collaboratively develop the RISC-V ISA and its extensions. RISC-V International’s Technical Steering Committee includes U.S. entities (e.g., Google and Qualcomm), as well as Chinese organizations (e.g., Alibaba and Huawei). Of RISC-V International’s 24 premier members, which span startups to VC firms to hyperscalers, 12 are based in China, 9 in the United States, and 1 each in Taiwan, Brazil, and Spain. The board and overall membership composition is split among the United States, China, and Europe, with the United States slightly leading in numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexibility and Accessibility:&lt;/strong&gt; RISC-V’s flexibility and accessibility make it an attractive ISA with growing momentum. Early use cases are in the embedded system market, with potential applications in high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI), as well as consumer electronics and wearables. There are currently over 2 billion RISC-V-based chips, a number that is projected to grow to 20 billion by 2031. RISC-V International, which has grown in membership from 236 members in 2019 to over 4,600 in 2025, seeks to capitalize on this support. In late 2019, escalating geopolitical tensions prompted the RISC-V International governing body to move from Delaware to Switzerland, citing its mission to ensure that universities, governments, and companies outside the United States could access and develop its technology. Since then, the nonprofit has been building out tools and opportunities for collaboration in the ecosystem, with 68 new specifications and over 80 working groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Low-Cost, High-Control Platform:&lt;/strong&gt; Many firms that currently buy x86 or license ARM ISAs are helping to develop RISC-V so that they can have another option for semiconductor architectures without incurring expensive licensing fees. This allows engineers to build their own implementations on top of the ISA, enabling them to maintain greater control over their technology and take advantage of software compatibility across the RISC-V ecosystem. For example, Nvidia began transitioning away from its proprietary microcontrollers to RISC-V-based cores in 2015, just five years after the open-standard ISA was introduced. Other industry giants such as Google, Qualcomm, and Samsung have made similar moves. A customizable, low-cost ISA option is also attractive for smaller firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Secure IP Environment:&lt;/strong&gt; It is important to note again that RISC-V does not contain sensitive IP, nor does its cooperative development require firms to divulge such IP. RISC-V standard-setting does not require U.S. firms to share confidential information with other firms. Corporations’ sensitive IP is only used in their implementation of RISC-V, not shared through the RISC-V platform itself, and firms can license their RISC-V implementation. Startups like SiFive and Tenstorrent, for example, use the RISC-V ISA and then license their implementations of it as IP. Furthermore, some argue that open-source ISA designs are more secure than closed designs because they allow members of the technical community to locate vulnerabilities collectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;RISC-V standard-setting does not require U.S. firms to share confidential information with other firms. Corporations’ sensitive IP is only used in their implementation of RISC-V, not shared through the RISC-V platform itself, and firms can license their RISC-V implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-business-case-for-risc-v&quot;&gt;The Business Case for RISC-V&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid Industry Adoption:&lt;/strong&gt; According to BCC Publishing, market revenue for RISC-V technology is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 33.1 percent from 2022 to 2027. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) supported RISC-V multicore processor development in 2018. As of 2025, many U.S. firms are rapidly investing in RISC-V-based software implementations, from microcontrollers in GPUs from Nvidia to 5G mmWave RF in Samsung and HDD controllers in Seagate. Indeed, in May 2023, industry leaders and startups cooperatively launched the RISC-V Software Ecosystem (RISE) Project, which intends to expedite the incorporation of RISC-V software into consumer electronics, data centers, and automotive products. RISE’s 13 premier members and 10 general members include Google, Intel, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Red Hat, Rivos, SiFive, Ventana, Samsung, Mediatek, Bytedance, and Tenstorrent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large industry players have also publicly described the expanding role of RISC-V architecture in AI applications and scaling. In 2018, Google helped found OpenTitan with the aim of developing an open-source, root-of-trust chip, which has been enabled by community members and partners in industry and academia. Qualcomm uses RISC-V cores in some of its Snapdragon processors and has shipped over 650 million such cores in its devices. Nvidia revealed in October 2024 that its custom CUDA cores rely on the RISC-V ISA standard. The company has developed at least three RISC-V microcontroller cores so far and, as of October 2024, expected to ship a billion across its products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greater Technical Flexibility:&lt;/strong&gt; Why are so many firms investing in RISC-V? The answer comes down to flexibility and cost, primarily in terms of supply chain and customizability. Licensing requirements are expensive and limiting, not to mention legally complicated. Furthermore, RISC-V is currently more flexible on the technical side than earlier ISAs. x86, for example, has been iterated upon for a long time, accruing extensions and complications, making it hard to work with for new applications. RISC-V-based cores do not have legacy issues from prior generations, and they can be more easily tailored for performance benefits or higher computation densities. As a spokesperson for Ventana Micro explained, “Addition of an instruction in RISC-V is a relatively straightforward process of coming up with an instruction definition, providing the needed justification for the instruction and driving it through the RISC-V International Technical Steering Committee.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the recent growth of RISC-V offers advantages, its newness also means that it does not have the same technical and customer support network as proprietary ISAs. While ARM’s proprietary technology comes with support and liability coverage, RISC-V International is currently trying to build up that ecosystem. As a spokesperson for Ventana Micro explained, “The goal is always to drive all new instructions/extensions through RISC-V International to prevent fragmentation in the industry. That said, you can always quickly blaze ahead to incubate an acceleration idea on top of the common base if you really need to get something done. That is what is bringing a lot of AI applications to RISC-V.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;growing-adoption-of-risc-v&quot;&gt;Growing Adoption of RISC-V&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RISC-V is not just a competitor to x86 and ARM but rather represents a breakthrough alternative in chip design for a wide range of current and potential applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Applications:&lt;/strong&gt; So far, RISC-V has been adopted mostly in embedded tech, with market possibilities in the wearable, global automotive, and HPC/AI industries on the horizon. Chips from the fabless company SiFive, an early proponent of RISC-V high-performance chips, are found in Google data centers and NASA’s High-Performance Spaceflight Computer. RISC-V has also been tapped to build flexible chips that could power wearable healthcare electronics, smart package labels, soft robotics, and other inexpensive items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future Applications:&lt;/strong&gt; While RISC-V won’t be competitive with x86 and ARM in mainstream consumer electronics applications for at least 10 years, leading firms are already using RISC-V to develop future capabilities. Alibaba is developing RISC-V chips for edge computing, and Hong Kong–based DeepComputing has released the world’s first RISC-V laptops, though their performance currently lags behind that of laptops using proprietary ISA counterparts. In 2024, engineers from Intel’s Advanced Architecture Development Group established AheadComputing Inc., a startup focused on developing RISC-V core IP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need for Infrastructure:&lt;/strong&gt; Crucially, for RISC-V to become a major force in mainstream devices, there needs to be a robust ecosystem of tools, support systems, and resources built to attract chipmakers and manufacturers. One key sign of progress was RISC-V International’s October 2024 ratification of the RVA23 profile, a standardized set of ISA extensions compatible with RISC-V, though much remains to be done to support its development ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-international-risc-v-landscape&quot;&gt;The International RISC-V Landscape&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The United States&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the United States is the leader in chip design, meaning that U.S.-designed chips lead the global market in performance, energy efficiency, sophistication, and market share. The emergence of RISC-V—as an alternative platform that allows all countries, firms, and individuals to design chip architectures—raises concerns about the ability of U.S. firms to sustain this leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enabling China’s Progress?&lt;/strong&gt; In late 2023, some members of Congress expressed concern over the national security implications of Chinese firms’ involvement in developing RISC-V. These policymakers worry that Chinese firms will use the RISC-V architecture to bypass U.S. export controls, potentially using RISC-V in high-performance chips in the future. Those who urge caution point out that open-source software helped enable the rise of Chinese companies like ByteDance and Tencent, and that RISC-V could similarly aid Chinese firms in the hardware space. In this regard, Serge Leef, a DARPA microcontroller product manager, has argued that it is “not unlikely” that RISC-V could be “giving China a leg up on all these technologies because they can now save 20 years of engineering and catch up to Western technology overnight.” In response to such concerns, the Department of Commerce announced in April 2024 that it was reviewing the national security implications of RISC-V.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Or an Opportunity for U.S. Innovation?&lt;/strong&gt; In contrast, major semiconductor firms see RISC-V as a significant opportunity for innovation. Many are considering basing future designs on RISC-V, reducing dependence on ARM, and expanding their markets. For example, last year, Business Korea reported that Samsung Electronics established an Advanced Processor Lab in Silicon Valley dedicated to RISC-V-based AI chip design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Excluding U.S. firms from the standards process would likely not stop global development, however, which means U.S. firms would be forced to develop technologies that fit different ISAs, license expensive proprietary standards, or adopt less efficient technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limited Options:&lt;/strong&gt; Whatever concerns some U.S. policymakers may have, regulatory options over RISC-V are limited because RISC-V International operates outside the United States. In fact, the organization moved overseas to avoid potential breaches of U.S. sanctions against Huawei and other Chinese companies, which are RISC-V members. This means that the United States cannot restrict the publication of RISC-V standards or determine which other countries participate in the process. The only immediate, but not necessarily effective, option would be to restrict U.S. firms from participating in RISC-V standards development. Excluding U.S. firms from the standards process would likely not stop global development, however, which means U.S. firms would be forced to develop technologies that fit different ISAs, license expensive proprietary standards, or adopt less efficient technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;China&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In seeking greater technological autonomy and self-sufficiency, China is looking to RISC-V as an alternative to licensing IP blocks from Western firms such as Intel and Arm. As one Chinese media article puts it (translated by the authors), “You cannot build a house on someone else’s foundation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflecting a longstanding commitment to reducing dependence on U.S. technology, the Chinese government is incentivizing the use of RISC-V architecture in chip design, primarily among firms based in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen, and more recently in Wuhan. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The RISC-V Industry Alliance convened local startups in a collaboration that had grown to 173 companies by mid-2023.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2023, nine leading chip design firms, including Alibaba’s chip unit (T-Head) and Baidu-backed StarFive, formed a patent alliance for RISC-V to enable the sharing of IP and licensing to third parties to promote a “healthy” (i.e., Chinese centric) open-source environment and the “rapid development” of RISC-V technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2023, Alibaba’s chip design subsidiary, T-Head, launched a RISC-V-based controller chip, Zhenyue 510, for applications in artificial intelligence training, online transactions, and big data analysis. A T-Head executive said that his company was launching an initiative to encourage 150,000 developers to learn about and secure international credentials with respect to RISC-V.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Beijing Open-Source Chip Research Institute, a group of research centers that includes members from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and hyper-scalers Tencent and Alibaba, is developing indigenous chip design architecture based on RISC-V. Scientists at the academy released a RISC-V-based processor called XiangShan and aim to produce a commercial version in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alibaba’s research arm, Damo Academy, launched the next generation of its RISC-V XuanTie processors for applications in 5G communications, robotics, and financial services in February 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China has invested heavily and incentivized engagement in standards-setting processes, seeking to exert more influence over the development and use of technology standards—raising important questions about its impact on the broader networks of innovation, competition, trade, and security. Reflecting its strong endorsement, in March 2025, there were reports that China plans to issue guidance to encourage RISC-V chip use.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Europe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the European Strategy and Policy Analysis System, the European Union’s share of global chip revenue dropped from about 20 percent in the 1990s to less than 10 percent in the 2020s. The European Processor Initiative (EPI), launched with European Commission and, later, European Chips Act support, seeks to reduce Europe’s foreign-chip dependence and grow its own processor industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even as these initiatives aim to reduce Europe’s reliance on U.S. and Asian suppliers for critical technologies, RISC-V has “opened the possibility for anyone in the world, including Europe, to make processors,” according to Mateo Valero, director of the Barcelona Supercomputing Cluster. Aiming to create a “Design Valley” in Spain, the Barcelona Supercomputing Cluster has worked on RISC-V technology since the 2010s. In 2023, the cluster presented Sargantana, the latest generation of open-source indigenous chips. Other smaller European firms using RISC-V include Gaiser, Esperanto Technologies, Semidynamics, and Codasip, with growing momentum in the embedded systems market. The Barcelona Supercomputing Cluster is also helping coordinate the new Digital Autonomy with RISC-V in Europe (DARE) Project, which brings together 38 tech players to try and create three chiplets. The six-year project is backed by €240 million from the EuroHPC public-private partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some European stakeholders caution against unrealistic expectations of complete chip sovereignty and, as in China, call instead for strategic collaboration within the RISC-V framework. Indeed, the EE Times reported in early 2024 that Nordic Semiconductor, Bosch, NXP, Agile Analog, and Semidynamics are among the European semiconductor industry players contributing to the rise in RISC-V-centered collaborations to reduce dependencies on other firms: “the community is anxious not to repeat the mistakes made with Arm.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;new-entrants-are-investing-in-risc-v-based-systems-due-to-speed-of-development-and-lower-costs&quot;&gt;New entrants are investing in RISC-V-based systems due to speed of development and lower costs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;India&lt;/em&gt;: The Indian government is investing in developing a series of indigenous processors, with significant work from the Shakti program at IIT-Madras. National investment programs, such as the Digital India RISC-V Program in academia and industry, aim to support the development of a RISC-V-centered innovation hub in Bengaluru.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brazil&lt;/em&gt;: The Brazil Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation is a premier member of RISC-V International. Institutions like the Eldorado Institute and the Wernher von Braun Advanced Research Center are focusing on RISC-V projects, including an international collaborative partnership with the Barcelona Supercomputing Center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;risc-v-as-strategic-opportunity-for-us-standards-innovation-leadership&quot;&gt;RISC-V as Strategic Opportunity for U.S. Standards Innovation Leadership&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the rapid adoption of the RISC-V platform and its benefits for enhanced interoperability and collaboration, what are the options for U.S. policy? Recent analyses have highlighted RISC-V policy considerations for U.S. policymakers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Need for a Better Understanding of RISC-V:&lt;/strong&gt; A 2024 commentary pointed out that RISC-V has not been well understood by policymakers—in particular the fact that chip competition occurs at the implementation level, not at the standards level. This means that each firm implements the ISA uniquely, adding their proprietary innovations independently. In short, RISC-V does not involve transfers of sensitive technology, and companies typically do not give away their IP during standards discussions—so, in principle, China’s participation in RISC-V does not grant access to advanced semiconductor technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Importance of Continued Engagement with RISC-V:&lt;/strong&gt; Efforts to force U.S. firms out of RISC-V would be dysfunctional in that they would not stop the use of RISC-V by Chinese and other firms but would in fact cede innovation to Chinese firms. Indeed, some U.S. firms would still need to use RISC-V but would lose influence over its development. This could lead to a fragmented RISC-V ecosystem, potentially disadvantaging U.S. firms that would have to develop multiple RISC-V systems without being able to influence the ecosystem’s trajectory. Moreover, there are good commercial and technical reasons for U.S., European, and other firms to support RISC-V. It enables them to avoid dependency on a single proprietary standard and to benefit from a low-cost, adaptable, widely adopted standard that continues to improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Constraints on Regulatory Approaches:&lt;/strong&gt; A 2024 CSET article highlighted how U.S. regulatory options over RISC-V are limited because RISC-V is managed by a Swiss standards body; the only real possibility would be to restrict U.S. involvement in RISC-V standards. But such a move would be counterproductive for U.S. firms (which may leave the United States so that they can use RISC-V in other countries) and could harm U.S. tech leadership and competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A major advantage of RISC-V is that it is a low-cost standard that can be leveraged by researchers, taught and used in universities, and adopted by small startups as well as large companies. . . . Importantly, RISC-V is a means to bring the innovative ideas of a new generation of researchers to the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “The Promise and Paranoia of RISC-V” section of a 2021 Foreign Policy Research Institute report takes a longer-term view: RISC-V presents a lot of opportunities in terms of its adaptability and implementation, the report asserts, and the United States must invest in RISC-V at home to ensure that it is positioned to lead the field of open-source hardware. The report notes that though some fear the rise of this new standard, the United States has much to gain from it. While RISC-V would lower the price of chip design and lead to commoditization in some areas of the chip industry, it would also shift the key point of competition from capital to design creativity. This would play to the United States’ current strengths in design and underscores the need for more production (or acquisition) of high-end engineering talent and matching it with a supportive business environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly and challengingly, RISC-V has already begun to be embedded across the U.S. innovation ecosystem in projects throughout the public and private sectors in applications such as spaceflight computing at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Nvidia’s CUDA cores. A major advantage of RISC-V is that it is a low-cost standard that can be leveraged by researchers, taught and used in universities, and adopted by small startups as well as large companies. It represents a more easily accessible, low-cost path to new innovative products and greater competition. Importantly, RISC-V is a means to bring the innovative ideas of a new generation of researchers to the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-the-united-states-can-progress-toward-standards-leadership&quot;&gt;How the United States Can Progress Toward Standards Leadership&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, U.S. leadership in global standards-setting has promoted growth and innovation across technologies and their supply chains, with attendant advantages to U.S. firms. In recent years, this attention has waned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China now recognizes the value of active participation in standards-setting in developing its long-term competitive advantage. As highlighted in the China Standards 2035 plan, China is prioritizing investment and engagement in standards-setting bodies with an eye to gaining a competitive advantage for Chinese companies in a broad range of emerging technologies. It would not be prudent to cede standards leadership. In this context, the United States should move toward exerting active leadership in international standards-setting opportunities—including that posed by RISC-V. This will require both policy attention and greater resources for U.S. participation in standards bodies. The United States must recognize that China has changed the nature of the competition in standards, and the United States needs to adopt a constructive, but affirmative, response together with likeminded countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To progress toward standards leadership, the United States can leverage existing programs and mechanisms in the semiconductor innovation ecosystem. To support a pipeline of professionals fluent in RISC-V, the United States can further embed RISC-V training into engineering curricula and workforce development, such as the Research Scholars program funded through the Semiconductor Research Corporation. RISC-V can also be emphasized in federally funded regional initiatives like the Department of Defense Microelectronics Commons and Department of Commerce Tech Hubs, in cooperation with universities, startups, and industry. Specifically, government-supported projects provide an opportunity to support the physical infrastructure necessary to accelerate RISC-V development and validation across the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government needs to ensure that the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) can take an active role in the international standards process, including support for U.S. firms in standards-setting bodies such as RISC-V International. NIST can also promote standards education through workshops for government agencies and by convening industry leaders to better understand their interests and challenges. Stakeholders need to be provided the resources to collaborate internationally and develop strategies for standards that would best serve the interests of the United States and like-minded countries. NIST’s efforts need to be adequately funded and supported to ensure that U.S. firms, viewpoints, and citizens are represented in this ongoing, international standards-setting effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To meet this challenge, the United States should promote standards education and encourage research and development in this area, including in engineering curricula, and adequately fund U.S. participation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Encourage active engagement in standards-setting by U.S. firms in international standards bodies and support NIST with the federal resources necessary to balance China’s engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adopt programs to support RISC-V-based work in universities and industry, especially for students to be introduced to and trained in RISC-V. Invest in the physical infrastructure necessary to support RISC-V development, including R&amp;amp;D labs and testing facilities for validating RISC-V-based hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use existing mechanisms, such as proven programs from the Semiconductor Research Corporation, to support a pipeline of RISC-V-fluent professionals and programs, including RISC-V electronic design automation tools. Talent development will be key.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Emphasize RISC-V use and development in federally funded projects, such as the Department of Defense Microelectronics Commons and other Tech Hubs, as a means of connecting researchers from industry and academia with tools and training to grow RISC-V leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RISC-V presents a key strategic opportunity for the United States to exercise leadership and influence in the global chip design landscape in the decades to come, but the measures needed are immediate. The standards process is a moving train, and the United States need to build a coalition to help guide it by continuing to support the domestic design industry as a whole and support both investment and participation in RISC-V development.&lt;/p&gt;

The UK should support its likeminded ally and put the question of Canadian membership to the JEF at its Leaders’ Summit in Oslo on 9 May.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 28 March 2025, Mark Carney – a strong candidate to become the next Canadian Prime Minister today – declared that Canada’s old relationship with the US, “based on deepening integration of our economies and tight security and military cooperation, is over”. Just three months into his second term, President Trump has made unprecedented and repeated demands that Canada becomes America’s 51st state, even refusing to rule out the use of force to achieve this. Similar threats to acquire Greenland from the Kingdom of Denmark have shattered NATO harmony. His “Liberation Day” tariffs have directly challenged the North Atlantic Treaty’s Article 2 (Economic collaboration). For Canada, NATO’s protections are now less certain, and the country should look to Europe for alternative security and trade arrangements. Joining the Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) would be a valuable start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-now&quot;&gt;Why Now?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2013, Canada was among the first group of countries invited to join the JEF. The UK and Canada are closely linked, with a shared history, monarch, values and political system. Canadian soldiers fought alongside the UK, Denmark, Estonia and the Netherlands in NATO’s Regional Command South in Afghanistan – the hard fought experience which became the genesis of the JEF. However, Canada declined the offer of membership at the 2014 NATO Wales Summit and thought the door closed during Britain’s post-Brexit positioning and Danish concerns around traditional rivalries over Hans Island and Arctic cooperation. These issues have since eased and Trumpian pressure has reopened the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canadian, European and UK defence policy is increasingly aligning north to shore up the Arctic and High North to Russian challenge. Canada is a major actor in the JEF core regions of the Northern Atlantic, High North and Baltic Sea Region. It is also the lead NATO framework nation in JEF member Latvia, alongside JEF members Iceland and Sweden as contributing nations and thus is committed to defending the Baltic States through NATO’s new hardened defence posture. Therefore, Canada joining the JEF would enhance political and military cooperation in the north and make the JEF a true Euro-Atlantic framework, thereby increasing its presence, operational effectiveness and deterrence credibility. Moreover, the offer of Canadian membership can regain the lost momentum on JEF since the new UK government came to power and give the framework a new impetus in a deteriorating security environment. The situation is so extraordinary that some have even suggested that Canada join the EU. Joining the JEF could be a valuable stepping stone to closer European integration, just like Finland and Sweden joining the JEF in 2017 eventually helped them into NATO in 2023 and 2024 respectively and setting Canada on a different path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategic-shocks&quot;&gt;Strategic Shocks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration’s hostility towards Europe and rapprochement with Russia has galvanised NATO and EU countries to increase defence spending, revise economic strategies, and consider organic alternatives to US leadership. Fundamental shifts in Euro-Atlantic security are expected which will push Europe and Canada closer together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, NATO faces multiple challenges from US reprioritisation away from the Europe. There are reports that the US may choose to leave elements of the NATO command structure. Moreover, Trump, and multiple US Cabinet members, have suggested a new Alliance spending target of 5% of GDP. Creating stronger linkages between Canada and Europe will help bind NATO together as a Euro-Atlantic framework as US policy towards Europe evolves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, climate change in the North is rapidly enabling geopolitical change, with melting sea ice opening up more reliable – and valuable – trade and security routes between the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific. These emerging sea lines of communication could have significant geoeconomic benefits for Europe, Japan, South Korea and other Indo-Pacific partners. These changes will affect – and potentially benefit Canada and the JEF countries most. Canadian security and viability of the Northwest Passage would be a valuable alternative for European shipping to risk relying on Russia for safe piloting and navigation of the Northern Sea Route to Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These shorter trade arteries will need to be secured. With limited benefit to US wealth generation and growing demands for increased burden sharing from Washington, DC, these new sea lanes will likely have to be protected by Canada, European Allies and Indo-Pacific partners without US support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin has acknowledged that Trump was serious about Greenland and that the Arctic was, “a springboard for possible conflicts.” As Russia seeks new resourcing opportunities, whilst opening new bases across the Arctic, the US rhetoric towards long-term allies threatens traditional patterns of generating consensus through NATO, the Arctic Council and international maritime law. More concerning, the US and Russia might collude to create a duopoly in the Arctic as a way of stabilising the region and coming to a grander bargain on Euro-Atlantic security, than just peace in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, uncertainty – and shock – over US leadership has pushed Europe and Canada to consider novel options to finance rearmament and defence resilience. Rebuilding Europe’s defence industrial base is seen by some in Brussels as a prerequisite to ween the continent off US security, while cooler heads point out that the US is still critical for the defence of Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with significant increases in defence spending, it will take 15-20 years to replace the US nuclear and conventional deterrent in Europe. Therefore, Europe and Canada’s own liberation day from US leadership is a long way off. However, alternative groupings of likeminded nations are needed to step up in the meantime to bolster assurance and burden sharing. Complementary groups such as the JEF are therefore becoming more important for regional cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strength-in-numbers&quot;&gt;Strength in Numbers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canada is not the only NATO ally that has attracted Trump’s ire. Denmark – a founding member of NATO, the Arctic Council and the JEF – finds itself in a similar position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite criticism from the US Vice President, Denmark has already expanded its potential defence and economic investment into Greenland and its naval forces in the north. Denmark’s pragmatism has paid off already through EU support. Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, pushed the Danish government to hold a referendum on reversing the 30-year-old opt-out clause relating to defence initiatives under the EU’s Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) – that hosts its own mutual defence clause (Article 42.7 of the Treaty of the European Union). Two-thirds of Danish voters backed the government to reverse the opt-out and fully cooperate on EU defence. But it needs more support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Denmark bridges every defence club and has a well-established Joint Arctic Command 2-Star Headquarters in Nuuk, Greenland, which is available for national, JEF, CSDP, or NATO operations. JEF operations do not always need to be UK-led and the UK can plug into other JEF member command and control structures - something that would appeal to Canada too. Moreover, belonging to the JEF provides access to UK strategic enablers, extended nuclear deterrence, and the UK’s own pragmatism in trans-Atlantic diplomacy. The opportunity to embrace these pragmatic bridges to Europe and the US must be appealing to Canada, particular as the Danes assume the 6-month EU Council Presidency in July 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stepping-up-on-defence&quot;&gt;Stepping Up on Defence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canada would need to significantly step up on defence to match the JEF members and be a net contributor. Canada currently spends just 1.37% on GDP defence - well below the current NATO target of 2% - placing the country 27th of 31 allies (Iceland are not included in NATO spending figures). In 2024 Canada’s spending profile represented a real terms increase of 57.75%. In the same timeframe, the JEF members have delivered an average real-terms increase of 150% and are continuing to rise rapidly. Membership would help Canada position its spending on capabilities which are optimised for the High North and would bring 10 NATO allies to its side when renegotiating NATO Planning targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fund the required increases, Canada should follow Europe in exploring new financial mechanisms, such as the Defence Security and Resilience Bank (DSRB). This new institution is complements developing EU initiatives and can be accessed by all of Europe (including UK and Norway as non-EU nations) as well as democratic partners across the world, including Canada, Japan and South Korea. It expands access to Canada, not clearly covered the non-paper recently circulated by the UK, which looks like an attempt to help fund a purely UK-EU Defence Pact. The UK can help enable Canada’s economic and security bridging in to Europe by helping it join the JEF and by hosting the DSRB in the City of London, providing a win for the new Canadian leadership who are already noting the DSRB as one tool for financing Canadian rearmament. Countries that commit capital to join the DSRB can use this overall national balance sheet asset as part of their overall GDP contributions to defence spending and would be the quickest way to get Canada to 2% and higher as the target increases to match American expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept is also attractive to JEF countries who would make ideal initial members of the DSRB that has – in part – it origins in the idea of establishing a “JEF Bank”. Therefore, JEF members - alongside Canada – are in prime position to present the concept for agreement at the JEF Leaders Meeting in Oslo in May 2025, a few weeks ahead of the June 2025 NATO Summit in The Hague, which would allow a third of NATO members to collectively position themselves ahead of facing expected additional demands from the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oslo provides the first opportunity for Canada to join the JEF and embrace a highly innovative new way of funding defence for all European nations and Canada. Finally, Canada holds the Presidency of the G7, the DSRB could conceivably make it onto the agenda at the next G7 Finance Ministers meeting in Alberta on 22 May 2025, ahead of the G7 summit is mid-June. A suitable reciprocal act in May from a likeminded JEF ally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;oceans-11&quot;&gt;Oceans 11&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canadian membership of the JEF makes geopolitical, geoeconomic, and defence regeneration logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has a critical role to play, through encouraging Canada’s rearmament and re-emergence as a North American power who wants to lead and rapidly enhance Canada’s defence credibility in a more dangerous world. However, the UK must also step up. King Charles – as Canada’s Head of State – warmly received Carney as his first overseas visit since taking over leadership of the Liberal Party. However, Sir Keir Starmer and his government have been near silent on support for Canada and Denmark under Trump’s increasing pressure. French President Macron and outgoing German Chancellor Scholz have been far more vocal in their support for Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will also vastly strengthen Arctic security – a key UK interest – making six of eight members of the Arctic Council part of the JEF, frustrating Russia who will face a vanguard of JEF and EU CSDP security beneath the steel of NATO deterrence, underpinned by US and UK nuclear capability – creating another valuable layer of assurance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canada is therefore set to become the most important ally the JEF never had. The JEF enables Canada’s move towards northern European cooperation and interoperability, and in turbulent economic times, puts Canada on point as a good ally towards likeminded nations. The time is right for Canada to join the JEF as a full member. It should be offered in May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the 2025 Space Threat Assessment by the Aerospace Security Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). This resource for policymakers and the public leverages open-source information to assess key developments in foreign counterspace weapons. Drawing on eight years of collected data and analyses, this series describes trends in the development, testing, and use of counterspace weapons and enables readers to develop a deeper understanding of threats to U.S. national security interests in space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the publication of the 2024 Space Threat Assessment, there have been few headline-grabbing counterspace developments. No nation was known to have tested or used kinetic anti-satellite missiles, commonly called direct ascent anti-satellite (DA ASAT) weapons. There was no public indication that any nation tested or used counterspace weapons such as laser dazzlers or directed energy weapons. While Russia’s pursuit of a nuclear anti-satellite capability topped the news last year, no information has publicly surfaced revealing how close Russia might be to launching this system, though the United States and its international partners remain concerned that Russia could decide to deploy such a weapon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a closer look reveals that the past year, from the perspective of counterspace developments, has been anything but uneventful. Rather than entirely new developments, the past year mostly witnessed a continuation of the worrisome trends discussed in prior reports, notably widespread jamming and spoofing of GPS signals in and around conflict zones, including near and in Russia and throughout the Middle East. Chinese and Russian satellites in both low Earth orbit (LEO) and geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) continue to display more and more advanced maneuvering capabilities, demonstrating operator proficiency and tactics, techniques, and procedures that can be used for space warfighting and alarming U.S. and allied officials. Finally, U.S. companies providing a commercial space service to government users, particularly defense and military ones, remain squarely in the crosshairs of nation states, with Russia in particular vocal about its intention to consider commercial assets used by the U.S. military as legitimate targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past year also saw the growth of commercial and military dual-use technologies that could be modified to serve a counterspace purpose. Companies working on in-space servicing and debris removal reached important milestones, demonstrating their ability to conduct rendezvous, proximity, and docking operations, techniques that could be used by anti-satellite weapons. The behaviors of commercial satellites pursuing in-space servicing, inspection, debris removal, and other business use cases could easily be confused for counterspace operations, creating risks of misunderstandings and possibly unintended escalations in a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though this report has not historically covered U.S. counterspace capabilities, it would be difficult to assess the global counterspace landscape without noting the evolving U.S. posture toward counterspace weapons and operations. In response to China’s rapid buildup of military space capabilities in all orbital regimes, U.S. Space Force senior leaders have repeatedly emphasized over the last year that the United States is prepared to conduct offensive and defensive space operations and intends to field more counterspace capabilities. This report also does not typically address unintentional debris creation in orbit, but this year the assessment includes a discussion on the latent risks to space operations posed by accidental debris-causing events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a common thread throughout this year’s report is how space fits into the future of warfare. The normalization of space as a military operational domain and its integral role in joint operations mean that space is fair game during conflict. Warfighting will happen in, through, and from space, meaning that a future peer-on-peer conflict may very well bring disruption and destruction to space on the same scale that it would bring to other places closer to Earth. Counterspace threats should be viewed within the broader context of efforts by adversaries to degrade the ability of the United States and its allies to fight and win a war and disrupt the economy and day-to-day life on Earth, not merely as efforts to degrade a space capability. Overall, space is likely becoming a more dangerous place and woven ever more into both peacetime and wartime activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;counterspace-weapons&quot;&gt;COUNTERSPACE WEAPONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter provides an overview of different types of counterspace weapons and a useful taxonomy to classify and differentiate them. Counterspace weapons vary significantly in the technical methods they use to create effects against space systems, in how they are deployed, and in the level of technology and resources needed for their development and fielding. For the purposes of this report, counterspace weapons are organized into four main categories: kinetic, non-kinetic, and electronic weapons and cyber operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kinetic weapons are defined here as those using physical, material means such as bombs, bullets, missiles, and other munitions. All kinetic weapons are considered as meant to destroy or damage. This category includes weapons that target spacecraft, such as DA ASAT missiles outfitted with conventional warheads, and projectile attacks launched from one on-orbit satellite to another. It also includes weapons that target terrestrial space infrastructure, such as ground stations, launch sites, rocket and satellite factories, and space monitoring infrastructure. Orbital grappling satellites are another form of kinetic weapon. Such a grappler physically handles a target spacecraft to do it harm or attaches itself to a spacecraft and maneuvers it to another location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-kinetic weapons are defined as those that use radiated energy to destroy, damage, or interfere with space systems. This energy can be directed, such as with laser or microwave energy, or distributed through nuclear detonations or electromagnetic pulse (EMP) events. High-powered lasers and dazzlers and high-powered microwave ASAT systems are included in this category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/XMn3SMd.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: COUNTERSPACE WEAPONS OF CHINA, RUSSIA, IRAN, AND NORTH KOREA AS OF MARCH 2025&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dazzlers are intended to temporarily blind an optical satellite, although they may also unintentionally damage targeted satellites. Nuclear detonations in the upper atmosphere or space are included in this category because these attacks primarily damage electronics through the resulting EMP and lingering radiation that gets trapped by Earth’s magnetic field. Other nonnuclear weapons that create EMP events in space would also be included in this category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electronic weapons use the electromagnetic spectrum to deny or interfere with a target’s ability to use space services and capabilities. These weapons cannot destroy; they only impart temporary effects for as long as the electronic system engages its target. This category includes jamming and spoofing of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and satellite communications (SATCOM) signals. Spoofing, sometimes also called signal hijacking, is a form of electronic attack where an attacker tricks a receiver into believing a fake signal produced by the attacker is the real signal it is trying to receive. Also included in this category are any electronic attacks to jam space-based radar and the reception of radio frequency (RF) signals by the user of a satellite service on Earth, the satellite itself, or the ground station of a space system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final category, cyber operations, includes any offensive activity in cyberspace that targets space systems, including ground infrastructure, satellite terminals, spaceports, and spacecraft. Cyber operations can destroy or permanently disable a targeted system, although they can also be used to temporarily disrupt it or to conduct espionage, including gaining access to proprietary or sensitive technical information on a target network. A network exploitation can be a beachhead for any of these purposes, as a cyber operation’s intent is often ambiguous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of these counterspace capabilities depend on robust space situational awareness (SSA) and intelligence information from both terrestrial and space-based platforms to target space systems and verify attack success. In order to attack a satellite on-orbit, an aggressor would need to know its precise location and where it is moving. The aggressor will also want accurate battle damage assessments. For example, if a satellite is targeted through a cyberattack that allows the attacker to disable its controls, SSA or intelligence insights will be necessary to determine if the attack was successful by monitoring the satellite’s movements and network activity. Although this report tracks counterspace weapons trends, it is important to acknowledge the critical data needed to develop and employ many of these weapons against their targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;china&quot;&gt;CHINA&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing’s actions over the last year point to an ever-increasing emphasis by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) on the military use of space. Since the publication of the last threat report, continuing past trends, China demonstrated dual-use, highly maneuverable satellites in orbit and the tendency to maneuver and use fuel seemingly without regret. These activities point to growing operator proficiency and maturing space tactics, techniques, and procedures. Beijing also reorganized its armed forces, creating a specific force oriented around space operations. Though China has continued its aggressive cyber operations, few seem to specifically target space systems. Additionally, PRC officials and academics are more willing to publicly criticize U.S. behaviors in space, pointing to examples of where they claim the United States engages in the same space activities for which it criticizes China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last year, the most concerning development to U.S. observers should be the launch and operation of increasingly advanced Chinese satellites. China continues to launch and operate highly maneuverable satellites, demonstrating an advanced level of technological and operational acumen that, if not already deployed for such purposes, could enable a formidable on-orbit counterspace arsenal. Through the use of these satellites, Chinese operators are gaining experience in developing tactics and procedures that can be used for space warfighting, to include both defensive and offensive advanced space operations. Additionally, China is dramatically increasing its space launch capability, with several commercial providers coming online in the next few years. Each year, the PRC is launching more and more satellites, making characterization of those satellites more challenging year after year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CHINA CONTINUES TO LAUNCH AND OPERATE HIGHLY MANEUVERABLE SATELLITES, [WHICH] COULD ENABLE A FORMIDABLE ON-ORBIT COUNTERSPACE ARSENAL.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/tXT5o3U.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 3: CHINESE SATELLITE SERIES THAT OFTEN EXHIBIT RPOS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing trends described in prior editions of Space Threat Assessment, U.S. experts and military officials expressed concerns in December 2024 about unusual and potentially threatening behaviors of Chinese satellites in GEO. According to an expert at ExoAnalytic, these behaviors demonstrate China’s proficiency in conducting sophisticated satellite maneuvering and willingness to expend fuel to conduct rapid maneuvers. To emphasize these points, the expert also noted that the Chinese satellite TJS-2 was tracked during the last year maneuvering at 44 meters per second, which is unusually high and uses significantly more fuel than the more standard range of 0.5–1 meters per second for repositioning satellites in GEO. The expert further described how another satellite, TJS-4, maneuvered to position itself between a U.S. space surveillance satellite and the Sun, creating a disadvantageous geometry for imaging the Chinese satellite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following three Chinese satellite programs usually feature prominently in each edition of Space Threat Assessment, and this year is no exception. There is often little public information about these spacecraft capabilities or specific missions, outside of official Chinese government statements, which are almost certainly designed to conceal the true purposes of military satellites. Most public information about the activities of Chinese satellites in GEO, documenting the sophistication and frequency of Chinese satellite maneuvers, was provided by SSA companies sharing their observations on social media platforms. Integrity ISR, a space and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) training company, and LSAS Tec, a company providing support services for space operations, released a video on YouTube documenting several TJS-10 maneuvers in May 2024 that eventually brought the satellite to within 25 kilometers (km) of another Chinese satellite in GEO, TJS-3, on May 16, 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2025, China launched SJ-25, which official sources claim will be used for testing satellite fuel replenishment and life extension service technologies. After launch, according to analysis from COMSPOC and Integrity ISR, SJ-25 entered a coplanar orbit with SJ-21, a satellite which in 2022 attached to and moved a defunct Beidou satellite from its position in GEO to a graveyard orbit, suggesting SJ-25 may intend to refuel SJ-21. Additionally, in January 2025, suspected Chinese GEO inspector satellite TJS-3 moved to within one degree latitude of SJ-21, possibly suggesting a supporting role for TJS-3 in an upcoming refueling attempt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On two occasions in the last year, Integrity ISR published an analysis on the behaviors of SY-12-01 and SY-12-02, a pair of satellites launched in December 2021 whose purpose is described by Chinese media as “spatial environment exploration and related technical tests.” At the time of publication for last year’s Space Threat Assessment, these satellites had been drifting in opposite directions across the entire GEO belt. They continued to drift this year. According to the Integrity ISR assessments, in November 2024, SY-12-02 reached its turnaround point of 17.3 degrees east (over central Europe) and began a new eastward journey. In September 2024, SY-12-01 reached its turnaround point of 178.9 degrees east (over the Pacific Ocean) and began a new westward journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to its progress in GEO, over the last year China has demonstrated the ability to execute increasingly complicated spacecraft maneuvering in LEO. In May 2024, the Shenlong space plane released, maneuvered with, and possibly captured an object before returning to Earth in September 2024, after having been in orbit for over 260 days, according to analysis by Slingshot Aerospace. The space plane had previously released six other space objects soon after it launched in December 2023. In January 2024, three satellites believed to be technology demonstrators—SY-24C-01, SY-24C-02, and SY-24C-03—conducted corkscrew maneuvers around SJ-6-05B, believed to be another technology demonstrator with potential signals collection capability, as described in an analysis by Integrity ISR. Additionally, in March and April 2024, SY-24C-03 and SJ-6-05A conducted rendezvous and proximity operations (RPO), with each satellite maneuvering and the closest approach distance less than 1 km—essentially face-to-face for satellites traveling at around 17,000 mph—on April 22, 2024, according to analysis by s2a solutions, a Swiss company. In March 2025, a senior Space Force official characterized these behaviors as “dogfighting” in space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While continuing to advance its abilities to conduct sophisticated maneuvering in both LEO and GEO, according to a study released by the China Aerospace Studies Institute (CASI) in September 2024, China is also monitoring and assessing U.S. space-based SSA capabilities and is more willing to publicize the results of its assessments. The CASI report details the increasing number of Chinese academic publications that analyze the patterns of life of U.S. Geosynchronous Space Situational Awareness Program (GSSAP) satellites, including publicly naming the satellites most visited by GSSAP. China likely obtains data on close approaches from its own sensors, the Russian-led International Scientific Optical Network (ISON), and publicly available information from U.S. and European SSA databases. The PRC’s SSA capabilities rely on domestic ground-based infrastructure, foreign datasets, and at least 10 spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From an operational standpoint, China’s attention to the patterns of life of U.S. spacecraft has likely influenced how Chinese satellites respond when approached by suspected U.S. space surveillance satellites. Notable examples of such behavior in GEO include how SY-12-01 and SY-12-02 responded to the approach of USA 270 in late 2023 and TJS-4 behaviors described by ExoAnalytic and noted earlier in this section. Integrity ISR and LSAS Tec published information about maneuvers over several months in late 2024 by LDPE-3A, a U.S. satellite characterized as a “freight train” for experiments to GEO, that placed it about 25 km from and with favorable lighting conditions for viewing Chinese satellite SJ-23, which in this case did not maneuver in response. China is likely increasingly willing to publicly discuss observed GSSAP behaviors to influence international opinions, probably aiming to portray the United States as having a double standard—engaging in the same activities for which it criticizes China as being unsafe and unprofessional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is little public information on new Chinese cyber or electronic warfare activities since the last Space Threat Assessment. During the last year, experts expressed concerns about the impacts of Chinese-attributed Salt Typhoon cyber operations on space infrastructure. More detailed information was officially released on another PRC state-sponsored cyber group targeting satellite services and other sectors, Volt Typhoon, including descriptions of the actor’s techniques and recommended remedies. Additionally, public threat reporting from September 2024 indicated that an unknown cyber threat actor tied to Chinese-speaking groups has focused on supply chains for defense-related industries, with a particular focus on drone manufacturers, in Taiwan. It would be reasonable to assume these Chinese-speaking groups were affiliated in some way with China. It has been mostly quiet on the electronic warfare front, as there were only sporadic reports of Chinese jamming or spoofing of GPS or other satellite signals over the last year. Though there is not much cyber or jamming news this past year, based on findings presented in prior editions of Space Threat Assessment, China undoubtedly maintains advanced cyber and electronic warfare capabilities that can affect space systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CHINA IS LIKELY INCREASINGLY WILLING TO PUBLICLY DISCUSS OBSERVED GSSAP BEHAVIORS TO INFLUENCE INTERNATIONAL OPINIONS.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reorganization of China’s armed forces during the last year points to a focus on warfighting in space, as well as in cyberspace and the information operations domain, that cuts across and supports the service branches. Specifically, in April 2024, China announced the reorganization of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) into four services—the PLA Ground Force, Navy, Air Force, and Rocket Force—and four cross-cutting arms—the PLA Aerospace Force, Cyberspace Force, Information Support Force, and Joint Logistics Support Force. Though the Joint Logistics Support Force has existed since 2016, the Aerospace Force, Cyberspace Force, and Information Support Force are new organizations, created by dividing up the responsibilities of the now defunct Strategic Support Force, which had previously handled space-based intelligence, reconnaissance, electronic countermeasures, signals intelligence, information warfare, and communications. The Aerospace Force is responsible for managing all PLA space-based capabilities, including counterspace weapons, and PLA space launch facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the last year, Chinese scientists published several research papers on military technologies, including high-powered microwave and laser technologies, that—though not described as counterspace weapons in the papers—could be applied to counterspace weapons developments. However, there is no new publicly available information on specific military programs aimed at developing or testing these technologies. As noted in Space Threat Assessment 2024, the PRC has already fielded ground-based laser weapons capable of blinding or damaging satellites and conducted research on mobile high-powered microwave weapons for general military applications. China also maintains the same wide range of both fixed and mobile electronic warfare systems that can interfere with satellite communications links, GNSS signals, and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) intelligence-gathering satellites, as described in the 2024 report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, it has also become clear that Beijing assesses a military threat posed by LEO systems like Starlink. Researchers at East China Normal University and the PLA-affiliated National University of Defense Technology have written about the military and strategic implications of Starlink satellites, arguing that SpaceX’s relationship with the U.S. government may have lasting security implications. Three articles, published in Chinese journals focused on intelligence and international security studies, outline concerns of broad deployment of Starlink satellites by the United States and Starlink’s ability to transmit data that may be used for new combat styles, citing the impact Starlink had on the battlefield in Ukraine. Importantly, these assessments overstate the capabilities of Starlink and assume the satellites have been integrated into U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) architectures and intelligence missions. Further, as one U.S. scholar observes, a “clear PRC concern that emerges from these articles is that China’s counterspace capabilities will be less effective against a U.S. satellite constellation composed of a mix of proliferated constellations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early 2025 it was reported that Chinese scientists have run artificial intelligence-created simulations of targeted attacks on Starlink satellites to disrupt services. A Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics team published a study that alleges 99 Chinese satellites could disrupt 1,400 Starlink satellites within a 12-hour period, targeting not individual satellites, but large sections of the Starlink constellation. Inspired by how whales hunt in teams and direct large swaths of fish into their mouths in open water, the study describes Chinese satellites “hunting” Starlink satellites by using directed-energy weapons, such as lasers and microwaves. Notably, Nanjing University has been called one of the “seven sons” of China’s national defense, founded by the Chinese Ministry of National Defense and sanctioned by the United States and Taiwan for its involvement in developing military technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russia&quot;&gt;RUSSIA&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the past year, Russia has engaged in several provocative counterspace activities, in addition to allegedly working on a nuclear space-based anti-satellite weapon, according to revelations that first surfaced in February 2024. In May 2024, the United States accused Russia of launching a counterspace weapon, assessing it had “characteristics resembling previously deployed counterspace payloads” in 2019 and 2022. Not long after launch, the Russian satellite, designated Cosmos 2576, proceeded to enter into a coplanar orbit with a U.S. government satellite, USA 314, maneuvers the U.S. government justifiably viewed with concern, as such actions could signal the positioning of a counterspace weapon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of late February 2025, Cosmos 2576 was no longer operating in a synchronized orbit with USA 314, having begun maneuvers to raise its orbit in mid-February 2025, possibly coinciding with the thaw in U.S.-Russian relations. In February 2025, Russia launched Cosmos 2581, Cosmos 2582, and Cosmos 2583, acknowledged by Moscow as belonging to the Ministry of Defense, but little else is publicly known about their mission. Since then, Cosmos 2581 and Cosmos 2582 have moved in formation, coming as close as 100 meters apart on March 5, 2025—by any measure, a very close approach for two satellites. Though Cosmos 2583 has yet to maneuver since reaching orbit, it did pass as close as 0.5 km to Cosmos 2581 and Cosmos 2582 on March 7, 2025. Additionally, as it has done since its launch in August 2022, Cosmos 2558—a satellite that the U.S. Space Force asserts is also a counterspace weapon—remained in a coplanar orbit with USA 326.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AS OF LATE FEBRUARY 2025, COSMOS 2576 WAS NO LONGER OPERATING IN A SYNCHRONIZED ORBIT WITH USA 314.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Russia’s Luch (Olymp) satellites have continued to prowl the GEO belt. Since the publication of the last Space Threat Assessment, Luch (Olymp) 2 has spent time near Eutelsat Konnect, RASCOM-QAF 1, Astra 4A (originally Sirius 4), Thor 7, SES 5, Intelsat 3-F7, Thor 6, and Intelsat 10-02, according to data from Slingshot Aerospace. These satellites provide communications and broadcast services to a wide range of areas, including Africa, Europe, the Middle East, and South America. Some analysts assess that Luch (Olymp) 2 may have come as close as 5 km to Thor 7 in July 2024 and less than 1 km from Intelsat 10-02 in January 2025. Believed to be a signals collection satellite, it is not surprising that Luch (Olymp) 2 loitered near satellites providing data and broadcast services over Europe, consistent with past Luch behavior. Prior to the arrival of Luch (Olymp) 2 near Astra 4A in March 2024 (providing internet services across Europe), Astra 4A signals were jammed—likely by ground-based Russian jammers—interfering with Ukrainian broadcasts. Though unlikely mere coincidence, the specific relationship between the two events is not clear. Since 2023, Luch (Olymp) 1 had been parked near Intelsat 37e at 342 degrees East latitude, though in March 2025 it moved slightly lower than the geostationary belt, starting an eastward drift of about half a degree per day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though revelations that Moscow is developing a space-based nuclear anti-satellite weapon were covered in last year’s assessment, this issue continued to develop throughout last year and remained a significant counterspace headline in 2024. Not long after the first reports surfaced in February 2024, U.S. officials publicly addressed their concerns that Russia was developing a “troubling” anti-satellite counterspace weapon with alleged nuclear capabilities. A breach of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty (OST), which prohibits signatory nations from stationing nuclear weapons in space, such a weapon would disable or destroy hundreds—if not thousands—of satellites in LEO through radiation effects or the resulting EMP. The United States not only publicly condemned the development of this new weapon but also sought to apply international pressure through the United Nations. To date, Russian officials continue to deny accusations that Russia is even pursuing such a weapon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On March 14, 2024, the United States and Japan introduced a draft resolution to reaffirm states’ obligations under Article IV of the OST, calling on nations not to develop nuclear weapons specifically designed to be placed in orbit around the Earth. The draft resolution underwent a series of negotiations and redrafts leading to a vote on April 24, 2024. While 65 member states cosponsored the draft resolution, Russia cast a veto, and the draft resolution failed to be adopted. China abstained from the vote. The United States and Japan released a joint statement expressing their disappointment and continued commitment to ensuring countries cannot deploy nuclear weapons in space. Soon after, Russia and China circulated their own resolution calling on broad international prohibitions on space weapons. As it has done when Russia and China raised such language in the past, the United States opposed this resolution, previously calling the Russian and Chinese proposal fundamentally flawed and noting that it lacks a verification mechanism and does not address ground-based ASAT weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Piecing together statements from U.S. officials and other publicly available sources, it appears that Russia has not yet launched an anti-satellite weapon with a nuclear payload. However, it was disclosed that Moscow’s efforts have been years in the making, with a senior U.S. official shedding light on the intended orbital regime for such a counterspace weapon and connecting a “scientific” satellite currently in-orbit “in a region not used by any other spacecraft . . . of higher radiation than normal lower-Earth orbits” to the effort. Satellite trackers deduced that the satellite is likely Cosmos-2553, a satellite launched in February 2022 into a 2,000 km orbit that the Russian ministry of defense stated was a “technological spacecraft . . . equipped with newly developed onboard instruments and systems for testing them under the influence of radiation and heavy charged particles.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While reports claim this satellite carries a “dummy warhead,” U.S. officials stress that, should a nuclear weapon be detonated at a 2,000 km altitude, the effects would be “indiscriminate” and render LEO unusable “for some period of time,” perhaps a year. The only other satellites in orbits near Cosmos-2553 are one nonoperational Russian satellite and 10 nonoperational U.S. satellites. According to one expert, if the satellite is testing new technologies, it may have been placed in such a remote orbit because there would be less risk of affecting other satellites and it would be difficult to monitor. Based upon persistent radar monitoring by LeoLabs of Cosmos-2553, there is high confidence it has been tumbling since mid-November 2024. This observation strongly suggests the satellite is no longer operational.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to its counterspace efforts in space, Russia engages in jamming and spoofing GPS signals on Earth. Russian efforts to interfere with GPS signals stretch from the Baltic and Nordic nations, through Ukraine and Russia itself, to countries in the Black Sea region. Though efforts to jam and spoof GPS in Ukraine, including around Crimea in the Black Sea, have been ongoing since the start of the war, those efforts mushroomed to include many other regions in mid-2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Hm290o8.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: TIMELINE OF RUSSIAN NUCLEAR ASAT THREAT AND RESULTING DEVELOPMENTS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;RUSSIAN EFFORTS TO INTERFERE WITH GPS SIGNALS STRETCH FROM THE BALTIC AND NORDIC NATIONS . . . TO COUNTRIES IN THE BLACK SEA REGION.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GPS interference in the Nordic and Baltic regions is not new. For example, in the fall of 2018, Norway accused the Russian military of jamming GPS signals in the Kola Peninsula during NATO’s largest military exercise since the Cold War. However, the past two years have seen a surge in reports of GPS interference in these regions, as noted by the Finnish transport and communications agency Traficom, which saw roughly 2,000 reports filed in 2024 compared to 239 reports in 2023. While it is difficult to point to a clear explanation for Russia’s interest in jamming and spoofing GPS signals across these regions, the growth of GPS interference in Russia itself is a response to Ukrainian attacks on Russia using GPS-guided drones and missiles as point defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has also tried to interfere with Ukrainian television broadcasts from satellites, including attempting to jam signals from one of the Amos satellites in August 2024. Additionally, television signal jamming and hijacking affected Ukrainian broadcasts on Eutelsat’s Hotbird in March and April 2024. In response to increased jamming over the last year, a number of European countries lodged complaints with the International Telecommunication Union in June 2024, which then condemned Russian interference with GPS and television signals. Russia has on at least one occasion during the last year employed electronic warfare activities outside of Ukraine that affected more than GPS and television signals. In March 2024, when flying near Kaliningrad, a UK military aircraft returning a senior official to the United Kingdom from a visit to Poland experienced GPS and communications interference for about 30 minutes. It remains unclear whether the official’s flight was the specific target of the jamming attack, with UK officials publicly noting that it is not uncommon for aircraft to experience GPS interference near Kaliningrad. Russia also continues to pursue capabilities designed to defeat Starlink, having announced in December 2024 the development of a new monitoring system called Kalinka that can identify and locate Starlink terminals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it has done in prior years, Russia threatened the private sector for supporting the U.S. national security mission in space. In March 2024, a spokesperson for Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that Russia is “aware of Washington’s efforts to attract the private sector to serve its military space ambitions,” and that such systems “become a legitimate target for retaliatory measures, including military ones.” Russia also complained during the UN General Assembly in October 2024 that the United States and its allies use civilian and commercial space infrastructure for military purposes, arguing that such activities jeopardize the peaceful use of space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;others&quot;&gt;OTHERS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;iran&quot;&gt;IRAN&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of last year, Iran has continued to increase its proficiency in space launch, successfully launching satellites in January 2024, September 2024, and December 2024 from Iranian launch sites. The December 2024 launch placed three satellites into orbit. Iran claimed one of those three satellites was a space tug, called Saman-1, that could reposition other satellites in orbit, a capability with obvious counterspace uses. In November 2024, Russia launched two Iranian remote sensing satellites, called Kowsar and Hodhod, which Iran claims are the first two satellites operated by its private sector. Russia has launched other Iranian satellites before, including Iran’s first satellite, Khayyam, in August 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran has pursued cyberattacks against aerospace and satellite infrastructure, among other targets, over the last year. Microsoft and Palo Alto Networks published reports in March and August 2024, respectively, that provided more details on the Peach Sandstorm incidents. Both reports assessed that this cyber campaign was directed by the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as part of ongoing efforts to gather intelligence and conduct social engineering attacks. According to Microsoft, this same Iranian cyber threat actor has conducted prior attacks targeting the aerospace, construction, defense, education, energy, financial services, healthcare, government, satellite, and communications sectors in multiple countries. In February 2024, Mandiant reported on malicious cyber activity, aimed at espionage, linked to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps that targeted the aerospace and defense sectors in the Middle East and possibly Turkey, India, and Albania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;north-korea&quot;&gt;NORTH KOREA&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s only space launch attempt in 2024 ended in failure when a rocket carrying the country’s second reconnaissance satellite exploded after liftoff in May 2024. North Korea continues to operate its Mallygyong-1 satellite, which was launched in November 2023, and executed maneuvers to raise the satellite’s altitude in February and June 2024. It was reported that North Korea successfully tested a new ballistic missile in October 2024 and new intermediate-range hypersonic missile in January 2025, which followed a prior test in April 2024. Though none of these developments specifically relate to counterspace weapons, they demonstrate increasing North Korean proficiency with space, missile, and rocket technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the past year, South Korea repeatedly raised concerns about North Korean efforts to jam GPS signals around the Korean Peninsula and near the border between North and South Korea. Without providing more specific information, in January 2025, then–U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned that Russia was close to sharing “advanced space and satellite technology” with North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2024, the FBI and other partners issued a joint cybersecurity advisory warning of North Korean cyber espionage activities targeting defense, aerospace, nuclear, and engineering entities around the globe with the goal of advancing North Korea’s military and nuclear capabilities. Mandiant identified a cyber threat group in June 2024 with probable ties to North Korea that conducted phishing attacks pretending to be from an energy company and aerospace industry entity while targeting other entities in those sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;india&quot;&gt;INDIA&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2025, the Indian Space Research Organisation’s Space Docking Experiment (SpaDeX) mission successfully demonstrated India’s ability to conduct rendezvous and proximity operations and docking activities. Though not publicly associated with a military program, such capabilities have clear counterspace uses. As of December 2024, India may be in talks with Russia to acquire a ballistic missile early warning and space surveillance radar with a 6,000-km range for placement in southern India. Such a system may be intended for monitoring missile launches from Pakistan, though it could also play a role in monitoring satellites and space objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;israel&quot;&gt;ISRAEL&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though Israel has not featured prominently in past editions of Space Threat Assessment, it is hard to ignore this year due to its efforts to interfere with GPS in the eastern part of the Mediterranean Sea, Syria, Lebanon, parts of Egypt, and Israel itself. No doubt aiming to protect itself from missile and drone threats launched by Iran, Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis, Israel conducted markedly more widespread, persistent GPS jamming and spoofing, specifically around April 2024, when it was expecting Iranian retaliation to an Israeli strike in Syria that killed two senior Iranian officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel continues to develop and refine directed-energy weapons, such as Iron Beam, for use in missile defense. While it does not appear that Israel intends to use these weapons for a counterspace purpose, Israel effectively maintains a latent anti-satellite capability, particularly when paired with its satellite detection and tracking knowledge. Israel likely conducted an exoatmospheric missile intercept in November 2024 when it shot down a Houthi ballistic missile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;europe&quot;&gt;EUROPE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only two countries in Europe made counterspace news over the last year—France and Germany—with both countries publicly describing new counterspace initiatives. These would involve deploying satellites capable of performing inspection and space domain awareness (SDA) missions, as well as roles protecting other satellites from attack, possibly using lasers or other non-kinetic weapons. The new French program, called Toutatis, would include two LEO satellites: Lisa-1, performing an SDA mission, and Splinter LEO, a highly maneuverable satellite capable of tracking hostile satellites and potentially positioning itself between a hostile satellite and the target satellite. Germany plans to launch the German Inspector Satellite for Multiple Operations. The satellite, publicly revealed in 2024, would be equipped with robotic arms and be capable of inspecting other satellites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;featured-analysis&quot;&gt;FEATURED ANALYSIS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;gps-jamming-and-spoofing&quot;&gt;GPS JAMMING AND SPOOFING&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year’s space threat assessment noted that GPS jamming and spoofing were becoming ubiquitous across parts of the world, particularly in areas of active military conflict. This past year saw a continuation and growth of that same trend. Many regions of the world, from the Arctic through Eastern Europe, to the Middle East and parts of South Asia, have been affected by GPS jamming and spoofing nearly every day since the publication of last year’s report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though difficult to measure, the societal and economic impacts of such long-term disruptions to GPS service are significant, and no doubt compounded by ongoing conflict and political strife affecting many of these same areas. Qualitatively, however, GPS interference disrupts the lives and work of millions of people and in some cases (such as civil and commercial aviation) poses significant risks to public safety. Several UN agencies have also emphasized the harms of jamming and spoofing, noting that interference with satellite navigation signals is a threat to air and maritime safety and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/MLF5w2T.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: NORMAL GPS RECEPTION VS GPS JAMMING AND SPOOFING&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But GPS jamming and spoofing have produced—at least in part—the desired military effect, as munitions and drones that rely on GPS to find their targets have been made significantly less effective in GPS-denied environments. That said, there is no sign that GPS interference is an air defense magic bullet. It is the many layers of modern integrated air defense systems, including jamming and spoofing, that have demonstrated effectiveness at blunting, for example, air threats to Israel and Russian drone and missile attacks on Ukraine. Likewise, the United States and European countries are implementing technical measures and operational techniques to mitigate such effects on their weapon systems. Employing such GNSS jamming and spoofing systems to protect military and other critical infrastructure from attack—whether in Israel, Ukraine, or Russia—demonstrates the increasing tactical battlefield utility of counterspace weapons, and it is a trend that is expected to continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most complete public picture of GPS interference around the globe at any point in time comes from maritime automatic identification system (AIS) and Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) aircraft transponder signals. Aircraft pilots and drone operators have also been able to report instances of GPS jamming and spoofing through the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) Aviation Safety Reporting System and through a dedicated portal for reporting GPS anomalies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The International Air Transport Association also operates databases containing information about instances of GPS interference: the Incident Data eXchange, a tool for reporting flight security and safety concerns, and the Flight Data eXchange, a global flight data repository. NOTAMs (originally called Notices to Airmen), issued by national aviation authorities to warn pilots about possible GPS interference, can also provide clues about the location and timing of GPS anomalies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until the last five years, though not entirely uncommon, GPS jamming did not have a widespread or persistent impact on global aviation. Although other instances undoubtedly went unreported, between 2013 and 2017, only 90 reports of GPS jamming worldwide were logged in the Aviation Safety Reporting System. On the whole, these reports describe localized, ephemeral events. For example, in 2015, one of these incidents involved intermittent GPS interference near a regional airport in Philadelphia that Federal Communications Commission agents attributed to a jammer being used by a driver to disable the tracking feature on his truck. Several other reports in 2014 and 2015 related to GPS disruptions near a Mexico City airport that could have been caused by jamming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until 2017, when several ships reported GPS spoofing in the Black Sea, documented incidents of spoofing were still rare and mostly corresponded to transient events, such as the protection of traveling high-level government officials in Russia. As recently as the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, widespread reports of GPS spoofing were mainly confined to the Middle East. But Ukrainian drone attacks into Russia provoked an increase in spoofing by Russian forces not just in Ukraine, but also across western Russia. Russian spoofing of GPS in the Baltic Region is harder to explain as a Russian force-protection measure due to its distance from Ukraine. It is instead likely an example of Russian use of hybrid warfare directed at NATO’s newest members, as the rise in spoofing responds to the timing of their ascension to the alliance in spring of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Russian efforts to spoof GPS signals extend from the Black Sea to the Arctic, with impacts to several NATO members, and include many major cities and regions in Russia itself. Additionally, the start of Israel’s war in Gaza in October 2023 coincided with a massive increase in GPS spoofing incidents in the eastern Mediterranean Sea and Middle East. At the time of this report’s publication, over twenty countries experienced endemic GPS interference over all or parts of their territories. That interference can include both GPS jamming and spoofing, as jamming a real GPS signal can make spoofing more effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Er9Cvbh.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 3: TIMELINE OF NOTABLE GPS SPOOFING AND JAMMING ATTACKS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, a jamming signal is broadcast at sufficient strength to overpower legitimate GPS signals, alongside a spoofing signal slightly more powerful than the jamming one, leading a GPS receiver to lock onto the spoofed signal. A spoofing signal is meant to appear like a legitimate GPS signal, but the spoofing signal transmits incorrect positional information. Though criminals, terrorists, and other nonstate actors may still find it easier to acquire and use GPS jammers, nation states that have access to powerful long-range electronic warfare capabilities have clearly found that spoofing can be more effective than jamming alone because GPS receivers often do not realize they are being spoofed but easily recognize when a GPS signal is blocked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/IEn4Bjt.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 4: LOCATIONS OF SIGNIFICANT GPS INTERFERENCE EVENTS BETWEEN APRIL 2024 AND MARCH 2025&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to publicly available data, estimates for the number of worldwide commercial flights experiencing spoofing increased from 500 or fewer per day between January and mid-March 2024 to a peak of nearly 3,000 flights in April 2024, before leveling off at between 1,000 and 1,500 affected flights per day for the following several months. Most of these spoofing incidents occurred in the Middle East and were likely attributable to Israel as part of its efforts to combat threats from Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran. The greatest spike in spoofing incidents over the last year, in mid-April 2024, followed Israel’s airstrike on April 1, 2024, targeting senior Iranian commanders in Syria, while Israel awaited possible Iranian retaliation, which ultimately came on April 13, 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, around April 2024, the Black Sea region and Russia experienced a surge in the number of flights daily reporting GPS spoofing, with these activities plausibly attributed to Russian efforts to defend against missiles and drones launched from Ukraine. This time frame coincides with a drone attack deep into Russia from Ukraine, a major drone attack on a Russian airbase, and stepped-up drone attacks on other important targets inside Russia. Over the next several months, Ukraine continued to launch drone attacks on Russia, executing one of its largest drone strikes on Moscow in August 2024. Up until early 2025, Ukraine had maintained a steady cadence of drone attacks on targets in Russia, likely prompting Russia to continue GPS jamming and spoofing as part of an integrated air defense campaign to defeat drones. In August 2024, Ukraine destroyed an abandoned offshore gas platform in the Black Sea that Russia had been using for GPS spoofing operations, though it is not clear how the rig’s destruction impacted Russia’s spoofing capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of the Middle East, Russia, and Baltic and Black Sea regions, several other regions experienced significant GPS interference from January 2024 to April 2025, when this report was published. These areas include the region between Lahore, Pakistan, and New Delhi, India, particularly along the countries’ shared border, and Myanmar. In Myanmar, GPS interference is a response by Myanmar’s military to the rise in drone attacks carried out by armed groups affiliated with the opposition party in the country’s ongoing civil war. Some GPS spoofing was observed near the border between North Korea and South Korea throughout 2024, peaking around June. There were also some reports of sporadic spoofing in Beijing in May 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hUeL8AB.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 5: DAILY NUMBER OF AFFECTED FLIGHTS PER SPOOFED-TO AREA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, there are no indications that diplomatic pressure or condemnation has discouraged any nation state from deploying GPS jamming and spoofing systems in and around conflict zones or within their own national territories. Neither broad warnings from the International Telecommunication Union, the UN agency charged with facilitating international coordination on spectrum use, nor directed complaints from affected countries have altered Russia’s behaviors. Even though the International Civil Aviation Organization, the United Nations’ civil aviation agency, admonished North Korea for repeatedly jamming GPS signals near its border with South Korea in May and June 2024, GPS interference was still being reported around the Korean Peninsula as of February 2025. In spite of complaints about its efforts to disrupt GPS, Israel continues to spoof signals throughout the region, with the eastern Mediterranean region widely affected during the past year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-drip-drip-of-cyberattacks&quot;&gt;THE DRIP-DRIP OF CYBERATTACKS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing trends noted in past reports, there has been no shortage over the last year of cyberattacks targeting government, critical infrastructure, and other sectors, including space. But developing a way to accurately tally and characterize certain key aspects of cyberattacks, such as attacker motivations and objectives, is a challenge. The presence of a persistent cyber threat actor on a network may be discovered without revealing the hackers’ aims, leaving questions about the actual target of the attack. For the authors of this report, this ambiguity makes it difficult to determine which cyberattacks qualify as attacks on space systems and related infrastructure and, thus, deserve attention in this report. For example, a threat actor might be detected on the servers of an academic research institute with an aerospace engineering department. Was this attacker targeting space systems (i.e., worth mentioning in a report on counterspace threats)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, because some cyberattacks are only made public by the attackers with no confirmation from the victim organization, it can be difficult to understand the full impact of hacks or even know for certain whether an attack took place. Frequently, hackers publicly post screenshots or other evidence of a successful cyber exploit, to demonstrate data theft, to claim credit for the hack, or in the case of ransomware attacks, to pressure victims to comply with financial demands. But hackers, particularly ones motivated by geopolitical or ideological aims, could also theoretically claim credit for attacks that never took place or exaggerate the scope of their exploits for propaganda purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND THE FULL IMPACT OF HACKS OR EVEN KNOW FOR CERTAIN WHETHER AN ATTACK TOOK PLACE.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/mrncjf5.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 4: REPORTED CYBER INCIDENTS IN 2024 IMPACTING THE SPACE SECTOR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the challenges in understanding hacker goals, positively identifying the physical location of hacker groups can be difficult. For example, experts do not yet know who is behind the IntelBroker hacker group, which has targeted aerospace related entities in the last year, with some indications it may be a lone-wolf actor from Serbia, and others that it might be affiliated with Iran. This lack of clarity on affiliation and physical location of a hacker group complicates attribution, making it hard for the United States and other victims of attacks to calibrate their response to hacks. It also makes it difficult to predict where such hackers may strike next and who should be particularly on guard for attacks from mysterious groups like IntelBroker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all these reasons, the authors of this report have found it hard to count year-by-year the number of cyberattacks targeting space systems. Though their numbers differ, some organizations try to keep tallies of cyberattacks by the type of entity and sector targeted, among other criteria. According to the European Repository of Cyber Incidents (ERCI), a free database containing reports of worldwide cyberattacks, there were about 720 reported incidents across all sectors in 2024, with roughly 57 percent of incidents targeting critical infrastructure. Of that total number, the database lists five attacks as specifically targeting the space sector in 2024, approximately the same number of attacks that targeted the space sector in 2023, according to ERCI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cyberattack documented by ERCI targeting Maxar Space Systems in October 2024 provides few insights into the motives or aim of the attackers. At the time of discovery, hackers had only gained access to employee data on Maxar’s networks. There is no public indication of whether personal information was the goal of the hack or whether gaining this limited access was the first step in a broader effort to breach operational or other systems specific to Maxar’s satellites or space systems. The hackers may very well have been targeting Maxar because it is a space company, but it is equally plausible that Maxar’s servers were just one IP address on a long list of unrelated entities, ones for which they merely found an exploitable vulnerability. That there were only five reported cyber incidents affecting the space sector in 2024 according to the ERCI dataset may leave some readers of this report scratching their heads, as there is a widespread perception that space systems face constant cyber threats. In June 2024, the head of the Space Information Sharing and Analysis Center (Space ISAC)—a nonprofit organization set up in 2019 to improve threat sharing and mitigation for space systems and comprised of over 100 members across the public and private sectors within the United States and internationally—said that the organization records over 100 instances of cyberattacks targeting “infrastructure related to space systems” each week. Though on the surface these numbers are clearly at odds with the rather low number of cyber incidents targeting the space sector according to the ERCI figures, the Space ISAC figures include attempted intrusions and hack claims made by attackers and not only, as the ERCI records report, successful attacks publicly acknowledged by hack victims. Additionally, the Space ISAC statistic speaks to the number of attacks targeting infrastructure related to space systems, which seems to include more types of networks than are included in the term “space sector” used by ERCI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/N9OQuBT.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 5: CYBERATTACKS IN 2024 IMPACTING THE SPACE SECTOR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In yet another attempt to tally cyberattacks targeting space systems, ETH Zurich, a Swiss university, published a report in October 2024 that documented over 120 publicly known cyber operations, between February 2022 and September 2024, targeting the space sector in the context of the war in Ukraine. The report identified 12 pro-Ukrainian and 19 pro-Russian cyber threat actors who made claims to have targeted space systems. Of the attacks assessed in the report, the vast majority—65 percent—were distributed denial of service attacks, with 11 percent identified as network intrusions and 9 percent listed as leak operations. A further nine categories of hack types were specified in the report, including credential theft, data breach, malware, software cracking, and data breach extortion, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One final observation is that, though the available data points to attempted and successful cyberattacks targeting systems associated with the space sector, there are no public reports in the last year that these cyberattacks have specifically targeted spacecraft or satellites in space. References to satellite hacking usually relate to attacks on ground infrastructure, the user terminal only, or the companies and institutions involved in satellite development and operations. This does not mean that cyber threat actors have not compromised satellites in space, only that there is no open-source indication of such efforts in the last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;rpos-benevolent-or-cruel-intentions&quot;&gt;RPOS: BENEVOLENT OR CRUEL INTENTIONS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though space has never been a static environment—relative to the center of the Earth, the orbital speed of GEO satellites is 7,000 miles per hour and LEO satellites around 17,500 miles per hour—most spacecraft have generally tended to stay away from other space vehicles to avoid potential collisions. However, government-owned and commercial satellites are becoming more maneuverable and flying closer together, conducting rendezvous and proximity operations, or RPOs, and docking with other spacecraft on an increasingly regular basis. In 2024, there was strong private sector interest in developing satellites to perform maintenance, repair, assembly, manufacturing, and inspection missions. Government agencies continue to work on systems that use orbital maneuvering, RPO, and docking capabilities, such as space planes, crewed spacecraft, and scientific missions. Additionally, no matter a satellite’s specific function, it may need to maneuver to avoid collision with another satellite or a piece of space debris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the variety of use cases for maneuvering one spacecraft around another, it can be difficult to characterize a spacecraft’s purpose using only data about its behaviors in space. Some spacecraft exhibiting RPO behaviors may be counterspace weapons or testing technologies for use on such weapons. Other spacecraft may have peaceful reasons—or, at least, reasons that do not involve the use of a weapon—to move closer to another active satellite. A spacecraft may even have a non-hostile reason to conduct RPO and docking operations near a noncooperative space object, such as a defunct satellite or piece of space debris—this is the business case for companies like Astroscale and Clearspace. But a U.S. observer noting a Chinese or Russian satellite shadowing or moving closer to one of its own satellites would reasonably view that behavior as threatening. Chinese or Russian observers probably have the same reaction when a GSSAP satellite approaches their spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue is that the United States and its allies rightly do not take Russian or Chinese statements about the purposes of maneuvering spacecraft at face value and find little assurances from Russian or Chinese assertions of peaceful intentions in space. But analyzing behaviors alone does little to clarify what their spacecraft are actually doing. Knowledge about a satellite’s capabilities and context—for example, that it has a grabber arm or device capable of latching onto another satellite or that it “birthed” a smaller object in proximity to a U.S. government satellite—can help more fully assess the purpose of a satellite exhibiting RPO behaviors. Some of these satellites displaying RPO behaviors are probably designed as counterspace weapons, meaning they have capabilities intended to blind, jam, damage, or destroy other satellites. Other satellites are possibly performing a space surveillance mission or are testing on-orbit satellite servicing technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coincidentally, the U.S. government and U.S. companies are fielding more space systems aimed at some of these purposes. Broadly speaking, the U.S. Space Command (USSPACECOM) is increasingly focused on using satellites that are designed for frequent orbital maneuvering. The Space Force operates GSSAP, whose purpose is to collect SSA data. The Space Force is also investigating a next-generation constellation of scout satellites in GEO. U.S. company True Anomaly is planning to operate its own satellites carrying out inspection operations, having launched its first and second missions in 2024. Another company, HEO, is using sensors on satellites to collect data about other space objects in LEO, though HEO’s approach is to use naturally occurring flybys rather than active maneuvering to obtain data. Beyond near Earth, the Air Force Research Laboratory is developing two satellites designed to obtain SSA data from cislunar space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no indications that any of the aforementioned U.S. satellites are weapons, though their maneuvering signatures and behaviors may mirror those of on-orbit counterspace weapons. The perception that satellites like these are weapons could increase the risk of miscalculation, a risk compounded as more and more satellites are launched with missions that include orbital maneuvering. But some maneuverable satellites, including those operated by U.S. allies and some planned by the United States itself, are intended as counterspace weapons. France, for example, publicly stated in 2024 that it plans on building LEO satellites that can actively defend against attacks in space, having already announced plans for a similar GEO capability, called YODA, in 2021. The Trump administration’s January 2025 executive order on “The Iron Dome for America” (now Golden Dome) includes direction to develop and deploy space-based interceptors to defend the U.S. homeland against advanced missile attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on satellite behaviors alone, there is hardly a way to distinguish between a surveillance tool and a weapon, though arguably, the same satellite could perform both roles. Though the United States should view attempts to surveil its satellites by Russia and China with concern, it would undoubtedly respond with considerably more restraint to a surveillance satellite approaching one of its own satellites than a counterspace weapon exhibiting the same behaviors. Greater transparency and awareness about specific satellite capabilities is a possible way to delineate between a weapon and surveillance capability. But a lack of trust between the United States and its allies on one side and Russia and China on the other would impede efforts to increase transparency, since both sides likely mistrust each other’s ability to be truthful about the purpose of their satellites. The U.S. Space Force is building up its space intelligence collection, analysis, and targeting to enable a deeper understanding of foreign capabilities and to support commanders’ operational needs. Meanwhile, researchers from LeoLabs, the University of Bern, and Maxar are developing characterization methods that combine radar measurements, information from ground-based optical telescopes, and non-Earth imagery data to provide new insights that can be used for assessing a spacecraft’s purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a distinction between surveillance assets and weapons aids the United States and its allies in calling out unsafe, irresponsible, and escalatory behaviors, especially when adversaries target surveillance assets as they have done in other domains. For example, in 2019, Iran shot down an unarmed, unmanned U.S. Global Hawk surveillance aircraft operating over international waters, and both China and Russia continue to harass U.S. and allied airborne ISR assets operating in international airspace over the South China Sea and Black Sea, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is further danger in this lack of distinction and transparency. Given that the U.S. government and private sector, as well as allied nations and geopolitical competitors, operate satellites with space surveillance and SSA missions, considering maneuverable surveillance satellites as threats akin to counterspace weapons could expose U.S. satellites doing those missions to increased Russian and Chinese counterspace risks. In addition, grouping satellites with counterspace weapons into the same category as surveillance satellites will make it more difficult for spacecraft operators to identify and calibrate responses to real threats that could damage, degrade, or destroy their space systems. Grouping both types of space systems together also increases the risk of misunderstanding and miscalculation between geopolitical competitors in space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, satellites conducting RPOs can still pose a security threat and safety hazard to others. For example, the revelation in March 2025 that PRC satellites had practiced “dogfighting” maneuvers in space should be concerning. The authors could imagine scenarios where adversary satellites maneuver against a target (like a U.S. government satellite) as to force it to move, expend fuel, and degrade its mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, the authors of this report assert that satellites designed solely for obtaining SSA data or performing space surveillance roles should not be considered counterspace weapons but, understandably, satellites conducting RPOs without a clear understanding of capability and intent may still be viewed as threats depending on the circumstances. As in other domains, the United States, Russia, China, and other countries should eye warily but expect their adversaries and geopolitical competitors to conduct surveillance and intelligence collection against their space assets. Surveillance activities in space should not provoke the same reaction as deployment and use of actual counterspace weapons. Creating a public expectation that inspector or surveillance satellites are a hostile threat to be treated as weapons puts U.S. companies with business plans around doing those very same things more into the crosshairs of U.S. adversaries than they would likely already be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that satellites conducting surveillance on other satellites to understand their purpose and capabilities serve a military and intelligence purpose. But they can also help to prevent misunderstandings, ensuring that deci- sionmakers can better discriminate between satellites that are weapons (i.e., threats) and ones that are not. They also can play an important role in space safety for both government and commercial space operators, helping to build a comprehensive picture of what is happening in the space environment and understand which satellites are truly counterspace weapons threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;points-of-instability-unintentional-space-debris-generation&quot;&gt;POINTS OF INSTABILITY: UNINTENTIONAL SPACE DEBRIS GENERATION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several debris-fragment-generating events in space have taken place since the publication of the last Space Threat Assessment, though there is no indication that any of these were intentional or caused by counterspace weapons. Previous editions of this threat assessment have not specifically addressed accidental debris-causing incidents; however, this report will discuss them, as they have the potential to create geopolitical complications and instability. Catalogued and tracked debris fragments pose risks to space safety and, should debris produced by a satellite of one nation cause harm to satellites operated by other nations, can lead to increased international tensions. Debris-producing events that generate no public alarms, uncatalogued debris fragments, and inadequately characterized debris clouds create even more risks, adding an unnecessary and avoidable element of surprise to the calculus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For inexplicable reasons, certain debris-causing incidents are widely covered in the media, while others go entirely under the radar, without widespread public coverage. Though USSPACECOM often makes public announcements of debris-generating events, it did not issue statements for all events in the last year. However, commercial SSA entities often make public announcements of such events, as will the Office of Space Commerce once its Traffic Coordination System for Space (TraCSS) is operational. Additionally, it can sometimes take weeks if not months before the Space Force enters new debris fragments into Space-Track. In many cases, private sector SSA organizations announce they are tracking far more pieces of debris than are either announced by USSPACECOM or logged by Space Force in Space-Track. Especially when the debris-generating incident is caused by a spacecraft associated with the U.S. government, Russia’s Vimpel space object catalog is sometimes updated to reflect new debris fragments quicker than Space-Track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DEBRIS-PRODUCING EVENTS THAT GENERATE NO PUBLIC ALARMS . . . CREATE EVEN MORE RISKS.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the last year, USSPACECOM only publicly announced five debris-causing breakup events, yet this section describes eight such events. Furthermore, for each event acknowledged by USSPACECOM, this report highlights the differences between the official Space-Track numbers of cataloged debris fragments, as well as the timeliness of their cataloging, and other space-object-tracking options. One reason for the discrepancies may relate to the Space-Track fidelity standards, which relate to how well an object is understood before it is or is not cataloged. But no matter the cause, delays and inconsistencies in adding debris fragments resulting from spacecraft breakups and energetic events to Space-Track create avoidable space safety risks and may affect the credibility of the United States in the eyes of other international partners during discussions on norms of behaviors and rules of the road for space activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resurs-P1 (Russia):&lt;/strong&gt; Russia’s Resurs-P1 broke up on June 26, 2024. Launched in 2013, Resurs-P1 was a commercial remote sensing satellite in LEO that operated until 2021, when it was deactivated upon its replacement by Resurs-DK1. USSPACECOM noted that the breakup generated over 100 trackable debris fragments, while LeoLabs stated that it was tracking about 180 pieces of debris immediately after the event. Though not confirmed, experts speculate the breakup was caused by improper or incomplete passivation efforts upon the retirement of the satellite in 2021. As of early March 2025, 18 pieces of debris were included in Space-Track. Due to the low altitude of the breakup, all other fragments have likely already decayed and burned up in the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upper Stage, Long March 6A (China):&lt;/strong&gt; Most likely caused by residual propellant, the upper stage of a Long March 6A broke up in LEO, creating several hundred pieces of trackable debris—according to LeoLabs, potentially as many as 900 debris fragments—on August 6, 2024. By early March 2025, over 650 fragments were logged in Space-Track. This rocket had been launched by China on that same day carrying satellites for the Qianfan (“Thousand Sails”) LEO broadband satellite constellation. This was not the first time that the upper stage of a Long March 6A rocket broke up in orbit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Centaur Upper Stage, Atlas V (United States):&lt;/strong&gt; On September 6, 2024, the Centaur upper stage of an Atlas V rocket broke up in a geotransfer orbit. The upper stage had been passivated after launching a U.S. government weather satellite in March 2018. As of early March 2025, Space-Track contained no debris fragments associated with this breakup, though an outside expert identified over 950 debris fragments by that time. This is the fourth breakup of a Centaur upper stage, with two other breakups in 2018 and another in 2019. The cause of all four breakups is not known.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intelsat IS-33e (United States):&lt;/strong&gt; Intelsat IS-33e broke up on October 19, 2024, due to unknown reasons. Prior to the breakup, the satellite had been a telecommunications satellite in GEO, launched in 2016 with a planned service life of 15 years. Immediately following the breakup, USSPACECOM announced that it was tracking around 20 pieces of debris. The number of debris fragments eventually reached at least 500, according to ExoAnalytic. Space-Track, however, only listed 18 pieces of debris associated with this breakup event by early March 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) F-14 (United States):&lt;/strong&gt; Probably due to a battery explosion, a defunct DMSP F-14 weather satellite in LEO generated a number of fragments on December 19, 2024. Space-Track did not list any debris associated with this event by the end of December 2024, but both LeoLabs and Slingshot Aerospace were tracking debris fragments resulting from this event. Since 2004, three other DMSP and two NOAA satellites using a similar design have all experienced similar malfunctions attributed to battery explosions. In early March 2025, Space-Track started listing debris from this satellite, with 19 fragments cataloged by March 10, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blue Ring Pathfinder/Upper Stage, New Glenn (United States):&lt;/strong&gt; Though not publicly reported by USSPACECOM, Blue Origin’s New Glenn upper stage, to which the Blue Ring Pathfinder mission is attached, probably experienced a debris-generating event upon passivation in HEO on January 16, 2025. Though originally thought to be ice and other effluent, which should have naturally dissipated, the debris fragments are probably a combination of thermal control materials and other unknown objects. As of early February 2025, over 50 pieces of debris remained in orbit, with about 67 logged in Russia’s space object catalog. As of March 2025, there are no debris fragments associated with this event in Space-Track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Garpun 11L (Cosmos 2473) (Russia):&lt;/strong&gt; On May 28, 2024, a nonoperational Russian military communications satellite in GEO, Garpun 11L (Cosmos 2473), experienced some kind of energetic event that raised the satellite 5 km and produced at least one new space object, identified in Russia’s space object catalog. Launched in September 2011, Garpun 11L has not been operational since experiencing an on-orbit malfunction in June 2020. USSPACECOM did not make any public announcements about this event and there is no indication of debris from this event in Space-Track as of April 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fregat RB/Cluster 2 Upper Stage, Soyuz-U (Russia):&lt;/strong&gt; An experimental Russian upper stage, called Fregat RB/Cluster 2, of a Soyuz-U rocket launched in March 2000, experienced an energetic event on April 8, 2024, resulting in a 3-km change in the object altitude and some kind of residual propellant outgassing. Though USSPACECOM has not provided a public notification of this event or listed any resulting debris fragments in Space-Track, the Russian space object catalog lists more than 300 pieces of debris generated by this event. There is no indication of debris from this event in Space-Track as of April 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-coming-collision-of-commercial-and-counterspace&quot;&gt;THE COMING COLLISION OF COMMERCIAL AND COUNTERSPACE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last decade, space has become increasingly commercial, and the past approach of sectioning space off into different military, civil, and commercial segments has become much more difficult. While space has traditionally been dominated by government activity and specialized defense contractors, the last decade has witnessed the growth of a diverse commercial space sector. Today, commercial companies act independently, with goals and actions to implement separate from government strategies or contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the rapidly advancing domain of space exploration and satellite technology, commercial space companies have become integral players, providing services ranging from satellite communication and Earth observation to space tourism and lunar exploration. As these companies expand their activities in LEO and beyond, they face an increasing risk of being caught in the crossfire of geopolitical tensions and the growing arms race in space. The impact of commercial space capabilities has been well documented in the war in Ukraine, where commercial services such as imagery and broadband communications were widely distributed in the early days and weeks of the conflict and largely continue today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;THE IMPACT OF COMMERCIAL SPACE CAPABILITIES HAS BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED IN THE WAR IN UKRAINE.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments around the globe have seen the impact that a space industrial base has on programs and economic bolstering, so commercial companies are being encouraged in most spacefaring nations to innovate alongside or outside of government priorities. The U.S. Department of Defense and Space Force have each released commercial integration strategies, and other nations around the globe are investing heavily in a commercial space sector, hoping to integrate innovative technologies into all facets of government capabilities. Multilateral organizations are also noting the importance of commercial capabilities, and NATO will reportedly publish a commercial space strategy in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rise of satellite companies offering critical services to governments, businesses, and individuals means that these private sector players are now directly in the crosshairs of geopolitical competitors and adversaries. As noted earlier in the report, in 2024, a Russian official indicated Russia would consider companies supporting U.S. “military space ambitions” as legitimate targets for retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond current capabilities such as communications or Earth imaging, commercial companies around the globe are testing technologies that could have counterspace applications. French company Dark plans to “forge the space armory” by building advanced defense systems to place on orbit to protect other satellites from being targeted. Further, the Dark website states that space has already become a battlefield. The company is developing a platform called Interceptor, launched from a plane that would travel to LEO to move or deorbit satellites or pieces of debris. The company’s CEO has described Dark as aiming to be the “S.W.A.T. team of space,” and the Interceptor capability as ready to operate on call, akin to air defense missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other technology developments are not as blunt, but could be considered a counterspace technology. Commercial companies are developing on-orbit servicing capabilities that are designed to extend an assets’ life on orbit. But with capabilities like robotic arms and grapplers, these technologies have the potential for nefarious use. For example, Japanese company Astroscale is partnering with BAE Systems to test in-orbit servicing technology, in a contract funded by the European Space Agency to service a test satellite. The Astroscale satellite would do this servicing by conducting proximity operations to get close to the test satellite, then using a robotic arm to take a part off of the test satellite and replace it with a new part. European space company Airbus, through its Surrey Satellite Technology Limited subsidiary, demonstrated a debris removal concept releasing a net and pencil-sized harpoon to capture space debris. While the objective of these test missions is civil in nature, similar technologies could be used in the future for harming or disabling an adversary satellite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development of dual-use technologies, with both commercial and potential counterspace applications, underscores the delicate balance between actors in the space domain today. In an arena traditionally dominated by government agencies, private enterprises are now not only shaping the future of space exploration but also becoming entangled in geopolitical and security concerns. As these companies expand their capabilities and develop technologies that could have both peaceful and defensive applications, the lines between civilian, commercial, and military activities in space are becoming increasingly blurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-to-watch&quot;&gt;WHAT TO WATCH&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;distinguishing-between-peacetime-norms-and-wartime-actions&quot;&gt;DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN PEACETIME NORMS AND WARTIME ACTIONS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Senior administration and Pentagon officials have repeatedly made clear that the U.S. military intends to be a responsible, good neighbor in space. To meet that goal, the secretary of defense published a memo in 2021 outlining DOD tenets of responsible behavior in space. Those tenets specify that DOD will operate in, from, to, and through space with due regard to others and in a professional manner; limit the generation of long-lived debris; avoid the creation of harmful interference; maintain safe separation and safe trajectory; and communicate and make notifications to enhance the safety and stability of the domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2023, USSPACECOM proposed eight specific behaviors, which map to the five tenets, for DOD space operations, which USSPACECOM notes complement broader U.S. efforts to establish space norms and best practices. Additionally, the United States has tried to discourage the testing of destructive DA ASAT weapons, which have the potential to generate space debris. In April 2022, the United States declared a moratorium on its testing of DA ASAT weapons. And in December 2022, along with several other nations, it introduced a UN resolution calling nations not to conduct destructive DA ASAT testing. The resolution was supported by over 150 countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tenets and eight behaviors are clearly applicable to day-to-day space operations and establish sensible norms for peacetime space activities, which apply to military space operations just the same as civilian and commercial ones. The moratorium on debris-generating destructive DA ASAT testing is a de facto peacetime restriction, as the preponderance of weapons testing would surely happen prior to a war or conflict. What is less clear is how these rules apply to wartime actions, though they have probably influenced the apparent U.S. emphasis on low-debris-causing and non-kinetic counterspace weapons, and how efforts oriented around space sustainability and safety, like the tenets, relate to the law of armed conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general aims of the universal laws of war, including international humanitarian law, are to protect those not fighting and those no longer able to fight, which includes avoiding harm to civilians or things that are essential to their survival. Though certainly open to interpretation, the operation of satellites in space is undeniably less essential than, and several steps removed from, the provision of things like food, water, medicine, and clothing to noncombatants. Except for humans on the International Space Station or China’s Tiangong station, operations in space are unlikely to directly harm civilians. Operations on land, sea, and air are far more likely than those in space to harm people or cause disruptions to the delivery of the essentials of life. Yet the United States assigns the space domain a special set of tenets—though one-sided, since neither China nor Russia have agreed to these restrictions—for responsible behaviors that do not directly correlate to the expectations placed on combatants by the laws of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than self-imposed tenets, applicable to one side and not the other, a better approach to space operations, particularly U.S. operations vis-à-vis China and Russia, could be one modeled on the 1971 agreement between the United States and Soviet Union on incidents on and over the high seas. The goal of this agreement was not to cover wartime actions, but to prevent peacetime incidents from becoming more serious. The lessons from this approach for space operations are twofold. First, it could help establish norms of behavior for space that could improve overall space safety for military, civilian, and commercial operators. Second, it could help reduce the risk of misunderstanding between the United States, China, and Russia for space activities such as RPOs and other on-orbit behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This model also implicitly acknowledges that wartime actions are entirely different from peacetime behaviors, with guardrails placed around wartime behaviors established by the law of armed conflict, which is domain agnostic. Given the frequency of both Chinese and Russian RPOs and U.S. emphasis on space norms, a concerted U.S.-led effort over the next year to establish a space equivalent to the 1972 U.S.-Soviet agreement on incidents on and over the high seas would be beneficial both to U.S. interests and to the overall chances of success for the growth of the space economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;making-more-counterspace-weapons-public&quot;&gt;MAKING MORE COUNTERSPACE WEAPONS PUBLIC&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, U.S. officials have shared little publicly about U.S. counterspace capabilities and operations. To date, the only publicly acknowledged counterspace weapons operated by the Space Force are the Counter Communications System and the Remote Modular Terminal, both electronic warfare capabilities. The United States has emphasized these are defensive capabilities—not dissimilar from the use of GPS jammers and spoofers for force protection in Ukraine, Russia, and Israel described earlier—drawing a distinction between offensive and defensive space and emphasizing the U.S. intention to use space for deterrence and not aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next year, the United States may want to consider publicly revealing more, though not all, of its counterspace capabilities—as France and Germany are already doing—because acknowledging some U.S. counterspace weapons, beyond just jammers, can be used to deter hostile action in space or other domains. Additionally, talking more publicly about counterspace weapons means the U.S. military can more easily partner with space companies already working on commercial technologies, such as servicing, debris removal, hypersonics, and atmospheric reentry, that could be transformed into new military space capabilities. For classified projects, the military also cannot tap into innovative space startups, as these companies often do not have the right security clearances to even know what the government wants to buy, let alone bid on the work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;THE UNITED STATES MAY WANT TO CONSIDER PUBLICLY REVEALING MORE, THOUGH NOT ALL, OF ITS COUNTERSPACE CAPABILITIES.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;development-of-bodyguard-satellites&quot;&gt;DEVELOPMENT OF BODYGUARD SATELLITES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted in this report, China has demonstrated it can operate highly maneuverable satellites in both LEO and GEO and track and synchronize orbits with U.S. government satellites. China also remains the only country to conduct a noncooperative capture of one satellite by another in GEO, when SJ-21 moved a defunct Beidou satellite into a graveyard orbit in 2022. These capabilities should be seen as ominous signs of the potential for China to develop, if it has not already done so, sophisticated on-orbit counterspace weapons against which U.S. satellites have limited, if any, defenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, France is the only country that has consistently talked about building and deploying on-orbit satellite systems designed to guard, defend, and protect high-value satellites. However, in May 2024, the European Commission announced that the European Defense Fund included €6.5 million ($7 million) for an “Autonomous SSA Bodyguard Onboard Satellite” that would perform SSA and threat detection, but also “counteract [threats] with a robot or laser.” It remains to be seen how the public acknowledgment of such initiatives will influence counterspace weapons trends, though one likely response from countries like China and Russia would be to develop new counterspace systems. This cat-and-mouse game between offensive and defense space capabilities will likely make space operations more expensive for both government and commercial operators, as space operators will likely want to invest in systems and methods that protect their space assets. It will also raise questions about what commercial operators are legally allowed to do to protect their satellites, similar to the issues raised in cyberspace about whether cyberattack victims can “hack back” against their attackers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking to the future, the United States and its allies, beyond just France, will want new on-orbit technologies—like bodyguard satellites—to protect against on-orbit counterspace threats. Such systems could employ non-kinetic weapons, such as jammers and lasers, or kinetic weapons, such as projectiles or grappling capabilities, to disable attacking satellites. There is no reason to delay efforts to develop such capabilities and no reason to make such efforts secret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;generation-of-debris-fragments&quot;&gt;GENERATION OF DEBRIS FRAGMENTS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though experts frequently warn of increased risks of collisions and creation of space debris resulting from the deployment of large satellite constellations, most debris-generating incidents over the past year have nothing to do with operating satellite constellations. Of the eight debris-causing events described earlier in this report, only one involves an active satellite (e.g., Intelsat IS-33e). Further, while concern has focused on the risk of collisions in congested LEO orbits, only one related to LEO constellations, and even that connection is tangential because the event relates to the launch vehicle, the Long March 6A upper stage, and not the satellites themselves. Additionally, most of these events were caused by defunct spacecraft that were at least 10 years old, or rocket bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as the operation of large satellite constellations to date has not caused a commensurate rise in space debris, neither has testing or use of kinetic counterspace weapons. Most debris from the U.S. military’s shoot down of a defunct U.S. satellite in 2008, called Operation Burnt Frost, deorbited within days. Additionally, the Russian ASAT test in 2021 created around 1,800 catalogued debris fragments, yet only around 9 tracked pieces remained in orbit by March 24, 2025, according to Space-Track. The glaring exception is China’s test of a DA ASAT in 2007. Because of the altitude of that test, around 800 km, nearly 70 percent of resulting debris remains in orbit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though not directly related to the operation of large constellations, one trend to watch is China’s tendency to date of leaving the upper stages of Long March 6A and 8 rockets used to launch its LEO broadband constellations at altitudes near 800 km. At that altitude, the rocket bodies could remain in orbit for more than 100 years, creating increased collision risks and the potential for debris-generating collisions or other events. With plans to launch thousands of satellites for these constellations, unless China takes a different tack in the future, the risks from these rocket bodies will grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact is that most space debris fragmentation events result from breakups involving old satellites and incidents involving spent rocket bodies. These objects are ticking time bombs, which have a tendency to regularly and spectacularly go off, creating the vast majority of debris-generating incidents since the publication of last year’s threat assessment. But so far, little is being done by the United States or other countries, including China and Russia, to address these main causes of increasing space debris. Though most breakup events are not caused by nefarious acts, debris-generating breakups pose just as much risk to the space environment as the counterspace weapons regularly chronicled in this report, and debris-generating breakups will continue to do so in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MOST DEBRIS-GENERATING INCIDENTS OVER THE PAST YEAR HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH OPERATING SATELLITE CONSTELLATIONS.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;countering-proliferated-satellite-constellations&quot;&gt;COUNTERING PROLIFERATED SATELLITE CONSTELLATIONS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alarming news of 2024—that Russia is pursuing a space-based nuclear anti-satellite weapon—brought the first signs of active development, including on-orbit testing, of a counterspace weapon believed to be designed to counter proliferated LEO (pLEO) constellations en masse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments and commercial operators alike have embraced pLEO constellations: from first-mover Starlink, to the U.S. government through its investment in hundreds of satellites for ISR and missile detection and tracking, to China and its ISR and SATCOM system expansion. These architectures offer clear advantages: enhanced persistence, higher technology refresh rates, lower per unit costs, and greater resilience. Russian efforts to interfere with Starlink in Ukraine have been largely stymied by the sheer number of satellites still able to connect with ground terminals and SpaceX’s ability to rapidly update its systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, no advantage is permanent and, as previous editions of this report have cautioned, adversaries will seek new methods to erode it. Both this report and previous ones have drawn attention to PLA-affiliated research into attack simulations that could wipe out planes of LEO satellites, cyber penetrations of satellite networks and infrastructure that could impact satellite command and control, and high-altitude nuclear detonation (HAND) effects on satellites. Further, Moscow is signaling new redlines with threats that commercial satellites, like Starlink, supporting military operations are legitimate targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors fully expect to see more counter-pLEO threats in the years to come, a reminder that proliferation is but one means of enhancing resilience. The United States must figure out how to deter and defend against such attacks and minimize their catastrophic potential. At the same time, as countries like China utilize pLEO constellations to close their own “space-enabled kill chains,” the United States will also seek ways to erode their capabilities. The distinction for Washington will be to do so in ways that do not lay waste to orbits for all who use them to advance commerce, science, and security in contrast to Moscow’s approach and even those hinted by Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;space-and-missile-defense-nexus&quot;&gt;SPACE AND MISSILE DEFENSE NEXUS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this report does not describe U.S. counterspace weapons, it is impossible to ignore the counterspace implications of the “Golden Dome” missile defense initiative announced by the White House in January 2025. Specific details remain scarce, but the executive order points to the centrality of space for missile defense—encompassing space-based sensors for missile detection and tracking, data relay networks, and renewed interest in space-based interceptors (SBIs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historical analyses suggest that thousands of SBIs in low Earth orbit would be necessary to intercept ballistic missiles in their boost phase, before countermeasures or maneuverable reentry vehicles are released. These SBIs are certain to become high value counterspace targets. Russian officials have already accused the United States of undermining “Russian and Chinese strategic deterrence capabilities” with its Golden Dome plans. Adversaries may well gravitate to nuclear ASATs or other wide area-effects weapons to neutralize such orbiting systems at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, though intended as a missile defense system, SBIs also have utility as counterspace weapons. An SBI equipped with a kinetic payload, laser, or microwave device could be used as a bodyguard satellite or to degrade an adversary’s space systems. It also could be used to entirely cut off access to space, as it could be capable of destroying any attempted space launch withing minutes of a rocket leaving the launch pad, challenging an adversary’s ability to reconstitute satellite systems damaged in a conflict. Taking a step further, SBIs may very well open the door to a broader conversation among policymakers on how to unlock the full military potential of the space domain for warfighting, including capabilities that operate “in, from, and through” space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The years teach much which the days never know.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-ralph-waldo-emerson-from-essays-second-series-1844&quot;&gt;— RALPH WALDO EMERSON FROM ESSAYS: SECOND SERIES, 1844&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That this report chronicles no new spectacular counterspace developments does not mean nothing interesting or noteworthy happened. To understand the events, and the significance, of this past year, one must look at the trends over a wider time horizon. Doing so reveals patterns that illuminate the direction of U.S. adversaries, as well as of the United States and its allies in space. China and Russia, as well as, to a lesser degree, Iran and North Korea, are actively working to test new technologies and concepts of operations in space that have clear applicability and use for counterspace weapons capabilities. Meanwhile, building on trends noted in past years, jamming and spoofing GPS signals has become ubiquitous in certain regions of the world, and cyber operations targeting space systems continue to take place and are uncovered on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, the United States has not publicly revealed its own counterspace-specific capabilities beyond two electronic warfare capabilities. Of its allies, only France has routinely acknowledged its intent to develop on-orbit counterspace capabilities that could perform defensive and offensive missions. From what is publicly known, the United States and its allies appear to be developing a much narrower range of counterspace weapons than their potential adversaries. This imbalance is possibly attributed to the commonly held assumption that the use of kinetic counterspace weapons in conflict is incompatible with maintaining a usable space environment for military space operations and somehow in conflict with the law of war. But the United States is reevaluating these assumptions, talking about kinetic counterspace weapons and space-based missile interceptors as part of the Golden Dome initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Russia and particularly China are demonstrating sophisticated counterspace capabilities in orbit, as well as deploying cyber and electronic warfare capabilities targeting space systems. Iran is growing more capable in space, deploying more satellites and having greater success with indigenous space launch capabilities. The United States has, to date, constrained its counterspace emphasis to non-kinetic capabilities and publicly expressed no interest in developing bodyguard satellites or other systems to defend against attacking satellites in space. But the United States is shedding those restraints. Additionally, the secrecy that surrounds U.S. counterspace capabilities has to date limited its usefulness for deterrence purposes. In this complicated and increasingly threatening space environment, to retain its edge in space, the United States will need all the counterspace tools it can get its hands on, including bodyguard-style satellites. It should also be more public about the U.S. arsenal, ensuring that these systems can be used to the maximum extent for deterrence as well as warfighting.&lt;/p&gt;

This paper aims to understand the operational and strategic logic of why states may use military force against nuclear installations, as well as the consequences, and identify approaches for reducing related risks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has centred concerns on the threat that militaries pose to nuclear installations. While Ukraine’s situation is unique, the threat of military strikes on nuclear facilities predates the war in Ukraine, with military force having been used – or seriously considered – against and in the vicinity of nuclear installations on multiple occasions before that. As more countries become interested in pursuing nuclear energy as a source of clean and sustainable power, and as non-proliferation norms are increasingly challenged, the probability that nuclear installations will find themselves the targets – or unintentional victims – of the use of military force could increase. Such military activity should not be normalised; however, political and military leadership must be ready to anticipate, mitigate and respond to potential future military attacks on nuclear installations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper aims to understand the operational and strategic logic of why states may use military force against nuclear installations, as well as the consequences of such attacks, with the intention of identifying approaches for reducing related risks. It presents five contexts in which military force may be used or threatened to be used against nuclear installations. These are: as a counterproliferation tool; for energy disruption purposes; for area denial; to generate escalatory, deterrent or coercive effects; and when a nuclear site is encountered on an axis of advance or during a broader military operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military force has been used or seriously considered against nuclear installations on numerous occasions in the pursuit of counterproliferation aims. This is despite historical cases pointing to significant limitations of military attacks as an effective counterproliferation tool. The use of military force in a counterproliferation context may seek to achieve a range of objectives – from the elimination of an adversary’s programme altogether, to limiting its progress, or simply as a way of sending a signal of displeasure and resolve to counter the perceived threat. Depending on the proliferation pathway a state may be pursuing, counterproliferation strikes may be carried out against a range of installations across the nuclear fuel cycle, each presenting unique risks to civilian populations and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s military advance on and occupation of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, in contrast, appear to have been driven, at least in part, by an intention to disrupt and eventually co-opt the energy generating capacity of the plant. The targeting of enemy energy generation and distribution infrastructure is well established in the military doctrine of many alliances and states – including those of NATO, Russia and China. The expected growth of the importance of nuclear power in the global energy mix in the coming decades may increase the likelihood that future armed conflict will see greater targeting of nuclear energy infrastructure. This may not necessarily entail direct attacks on nuclear reactors but rather assaults on auxiliary systems – such as water and electricity supply to nuclear power plants – under the erroneous assumption that such attacks carry limited risk to nuclear safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attacks on nuclear facilities may also be carried out with the express intention of releasing radioactive or other toxic material as an area denial strategy. Radiological or chemical contamination of territory complicates and delays an adversary’s military operations in the affected area. However, most militaries have at least some ability to shield against CBRN (chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear) hazards and to continue operations in a contaminated environment – particularly if a mission is critical. As such, ultimately, the effectiveness of radiological or chemical contamination for area denial is likely to be limited. Furthermore, the unpredictability of the dispersion of a contaminant from an attacked nuclear facility creates significant risks of contamination to friendly populations and forces and this contamination might expand and escalate a conflict if toxic material reaches the territory of a third country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the psychological salience of radiological hazards among the general population, attacks and threats of attack on nuclear installations may be used for escalatory, deterrent or coercive purposes. States may threaten attacks on nuclear facilities and the release of radioactive material from these installations as a “half-step” between the use of conventional weapons and a nuclear weapons attack, despite the differences in effect and normative significance of nuclear safety incidents and nuclear weapons attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Short of attacking nuclear installations as a primary target of a military operation, militaries may also encounter and need to contest nuclear facilities on an axis of advance during a land invasion or may be required to carry out air campaigns against territory where nuclear sites are present. Militaries – supported by relevant national authorities – must therefore ensure they have the necessary expertise and capabilities and have conducted the necessary operational planning to be able to safely operate around nuclear facilities if this becomes necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on analysis of operational and strategic drivers for the use of military force against nuclear installations, the paper proposes a number of considerations and recommendations to manage and mitigate related nuclear safety risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthening understanding of, and compliance with, existing international legal principles and norms that restrict the use of military force against and near nuclear installations.&lt;/strong&gt; This may include developing additional guidance on the operationalisation of existing legal provisions and considering how legitimate military objectives may be pursued while maintaining maximum respect for nuclear safety. Reiterating commitments to existing legal provisions and broader norms, and calling out states that do not respect these, is important for making sure that the use of military force that threatens the safety of nuclear installations and poses a risk to civilians is not normalised.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Considering options for strengthening passive defences around nuclear installations and auxiliary systems and equipment which support the safe operation of nuclear facilities (including water supply systems and electrical infrastructure).&lt;/strong&gt; Passive defences may need to be supported with active defence measures in the instance of an active conflict, including the deployment of layered and distributed air defence, as well as specialised C-CBRN (counter-CBRN) ground capabilities. The introduction of any passive and active defences needs to be balanced against limited resources and other priorities that are likely to emerge during an active conflict and should be commensurate with assessed risk in a given context. The deployment of military capabilities near to nuclear installations may also have the unintended consequence of increasing the risks to facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating redundancy in and decentralising nuclear installations and related network.&lt;/strong&gt; This may help shift the cost–benefit calculus for an attacking state by increasing the number of targets that need to be attacked to have meaningful effects on a system and reducing the effects of single strikes. In the context of nuclear energy generation, this may include a shift away from large gigawatt-scale reactors towards the deployment of small modular reactors. However, decentralisation may have the unintended consequences of increasing the risks of hazardous material release and harm to civilian populations by increasing the number and distribution of facilities containing toxic materials.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improving whole-of-society resilience to nuclear safety incidents, including through efforts to raise levels of emergency preparedness, risk awareness and education on nuclear safety among the public and political leadership.&lt;/strong&gt; This should involve the pre-emptive formulation of risk and crisis communication strategies, as well as tools for countering disinformation and misinformation, which prioritise the establishment of trust between the population and authorities, and offer clear information and instructions. Any such efforts must be commensurate to the risk facing a given state and population, and will have to be balanced against the need to avoid alarmism and the risk of inciting unnecessary anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;States have used force against nuclear programmes for nearly as long as humans have known how to split the atom. Between 1942 and 1943, Allied forces carried out a series of operations against the Vemork heavy water production plant in Norway. They suspected – rightly – that the facility was part of a German effort to build a weapon “a thousand times more potent than any in use to-day”. The destruction of the plant and the stocks of heavy water that it was producing thus took the highest priority. The facility was ultimately destroyed in a bombing raid in November 1943.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since those attacks, states have directed military force against other states’ nuclear programmes on multiple occasions. Iraqi strikes on Iran’s Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant (at the time still under construction) during the Iran–Iraq War, the Israeli attacks on Iraq’s Osirak reactor in 1981 and Israel’s bombing of Syria’s Al-Kibar reactor in 2007 are some of the better-known cases. In numerous other instances, attacks were considered but not carried out, including: Egyptian and Soviet deliberations over striking Israel’s nuclear facility at Dimona (during the 1960s); US as well as Indian and Israeli plans, in the 1970s and 1984 respectively, to attack Pakistan’s nuclear facilities at Kahuta; and US plans under multiple administrations for military strikes against North Korea’s nuclear programme. Russia’s plans for a potential conflict with Japan and South Korea also included plans to target the countries’ nuclear energy infrastructure. Meanwhile, Iran’s continued advancement of its nuclear programme and concerns from the US, Israel and others over its weaponisation potential have once again brought to the fore the debate over the utility of military force for addressing the threat of nuclear weapons proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Counterproliferation objectives have historically been a prevalent driver for the use of military force (and its serious consideration) against nuclear facilities. However, it has not been the only one. Russia’s military seizure and subsequent occupation of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) in 2022 have highlighted the broader range of risks posed to nuclear infrastructure from military activity. As nuclear power is expected to become an increasingly important source of energy globally, as conventional conflicts persist in multiple parts of the world, and as non-proliferation norms continue to be challenged, it is likely that military threats to nuclear facilities will persist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper is a contribution to ongoing work on identifying ways to reduce the risks that military force can pose to nuclear installations. It aims to supplement existing analysis – which has, in large part, focused on ways to strengthen legal prohibitions against attacks on nuclear installation and to improve nuclear safety and security measures in times of crisis – by distilling the strategic and operational logic of the use of military force against nuclear facilities. In other words, the paper poses the questions: What may cause militaries to target nuclear facilities? And what does that mean in terms of reducing the risk to nuclear installations posed by military operations? While such military activity should not be normalised, it is important that those working to reduce risks to nuclear sites understand its logic and the risks it may present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology-sources-and-limitations&quot;&gt;Methodology, Sources and Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper builds on existing literature on military threats to nuclear facilities and nuclear safety in conflict zones. It draws on, among others, Bennett Ramberg’s seminal monograph Nuclear Power Plants as Weapons for the Enemy: An Unrecognised Military Peril (first published in 1984), the work of Matthew Fuhrmann and Sarah E Kreps on military attacks on nuclear facilities as a counterproliferation tool, and research and analysis on nuclear safety in conflict zones and related international legal frameworks conducted by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, the Nuclear Threat Initiative, the Vienna Center for Disarmament and Non-Proliferation, and RUSI. This paper aims to update and complement some of the analysis presented in these and other works. In part, it does so by integrating lessons learned from Russia’s occupation of Ukrainian nuclear sites and its broader assault on Ukraine’s energy system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the research for this paper was conducted during field study in Ukraine in July and August 2024. This aimed to capture and learn from Ukraine’s experience in managing the safety and resilience of its nuclear installations and the broader energy grid since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion. The research included interviews with Ukrainian energy and nuclear safety experts, nuclear operators, nuclear plant workers, legislators and military personnel in Kyiv, Zaporizhzhia and the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone (CEZ). In particular, the fieldwork helped to inform some of the analysis presented in this paper related to the targeting of nuclear facilities for energy disruption, for coercive purposes and when encountered on an axis of military advance. The research also relied on a review of other historical cases of military attacks on nuclear facilities to inform the analysis. Cases were examined in varying degrees of detail, due to time limitations and discrepancies in the availability of information. Cases were identified and studied through review of existing literature, archival documents, and interviews with subject matter experts (SMEs). A list of the cases considered for this research is included in the Annex; this is unlikely to be a comprehensive list of all instances in which nuclear installations were targeted or found themselves in the vicinity of military operations. Furthermore, the precise reason for the use or threat of use of military force against nuclear infrastructure in individual cases was not always possible to ascertain, due to sometimes limited information on an attacking state’s decision-making and the presence of confounding drivers and factors. However, the review of cases allowed for a general sense of the likely motivations, desired effects and other considerations that appear to have driven past attacks. The identified drivers and other relevant considerations were subsequently tested, refined and expanded through semi-structured SME interviews and the review of primary and secondary sources. This included consultation of materials on: national risk and resilience assessments; military targeting doctrine; energy grid design and resilience; chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) hazards and emergency response; international law relating to attacks on nuclear infrastructure; and nuclear safety and security regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-1-legal-considerations-and-limitations&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 1. Legal Considerations and Limitations&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While the paper generally foregoes a legal analysis of military attacks on nuclear facilities in various circumstances, it is worth stressing that such military activity exists in highly contested and nuanced legal territory.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The use of military force against civilian infrastructure is generally prohibited under international humanitarian law (IHL), although exceptions may be made if the target is determined to be contributing significantly to an adversary’s military operations and if an attack is deemed militarily necessary. However, the bar for determining military necessity is set high and attacks still need to abide by principles of IHL that require – among other considerations – the effects on civilians of an attack to not be disproportionate to the military advantage being sought. Attacks that cause undue harm to civilians or are intended primarily to terrorise the civilian population are prohibited under international law.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The dual-use nature of many of the activities and materials in a nuclear fuel cycle can complicate the distinction between civilian and non-civilian sites. In a broader military conflict, discerning the extent to which nuclear power installations support military activity can also be difficult. The presence of toxic materials at many nuclear installations makes it difficult to argue that attacks on those sites will not pose a serious risk to civilians and the environment. Yet, the likelihood and extent of the risk and its proportionality in relation to the expected military effects and resulting military advantage can be difficult to assess.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The reliance on individual states’ interpretations and applications of IHL also means that – in instances where a state has decided that another state’s nuclear installations pose a critical threat – the state will likely find ways of justifying the use of military force against a nuclear site. The desire to preserve the use of military force against nuclear installations as a policy option – namely, in the pursuit of non-proliferation objectives – has prevented the introduction of more extensive legal prohibitions and is likely to do so in the future. Russian behaviour in Ukraine also demonstrates that some countries will remain indifferent to their IHL obligations.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;As such, while finding ways to strengthen compliance with existing legal restrictions should be part of the effort to minimise risks, measures to make these facilities less attractive targets, to reduce the consequences of any future attacks and to prepare militaries to operate safely around these facilities are equally important.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author conducted semi-structured research interviews with more than 30 SMEs and practitioners (including military personnel and government officials) by telephone, video conference and in-person between July and November 2024. Some responses to questions were also collected by email. The interviewees’ areas of expertise spanned the fields of nuclear safety and security, nuclear power plant operations, nuclear non-proliferation, strategic security dynamics, nuclear risk reduction, energy grids and energy security, military targeting practices and other military doctrine, military engineering, CBRN emergency preparedness and response, and radiological medicine. Interview questions were tailored to the individuals’ area of expertise and experience and therefore varied considerably across the sample. Interviewees had the option of remaining anonymous or being identified. Those who preferred to remain anonymous have been assigned an alpha identifier alongside a general description of their role and/or area of expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviewees were selected based on their areas of expertise and experience and were identified through the author’s professional networks. The sensitive nature of the subject matter and its direct relevance to countries’ national security imposed limitations on the information that could be shared during interviews on matters pertaining to vulnerabilities and defence of nuclear infrastructure. The author was also limited somewhat by geopolitical constraints in the perspectives that could be captured for this research: attempts were not made, for instance, to identify Russian or Chinese interviewees to query their countries’ perspectives on the targeting and defence of nuclear sites, as such attempts were likely to prove fruitless in the current geopolitical climate. Insights into these countries’ attitudes were drawn, where possible, from public statements, policy documents and observable behaviour – but were ultimately limited in this analysis. As such, the sample of experts interviewed for this paper is not representative of the full range of perspectives on the subjects discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scope-and-definition-of-concepts&quot;&gt;Scope and Definition of Concepts&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The terms “nuclear facilities”, “nuclear sites”, “nuclear installations” and “nuclear infrastructure” are used interchangeably throughout the paper to refer to “nuclear facilities” in the broadest definition offered by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Nuclear Safety and Security Glossary: “A facility (including associated buildings and equipment) in which nuclear material is produced, processed, used, handled, stored or disposed of”. The paper also considers attacks on sites that are meant to host nuclear material but to which nuclear material has not yet been introduced; this would have included Iraq’s Osirak reactor at the time of the 1981 Israeli attack as well as Iran’s Bushehr nuclear power plant, which was under construction when it was repeatedly struck by Iraqi forces. Nuclear facilities vary significantly in their purpose, construction and levels of protection, as well as the radioactivity and other hazards they have the potential to release if they are damaged. As such, where analytically necessary, this paper discusses considerations related to specific types of facilities (for example, nuclear reactors, uranium enrichment plants, spent fuel storage facilities, and so on).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military attacks also vary widely in their scale, the methods they employ and the context in which they are carried out – including whether they take place as part of a larger military operation (for example, a ground invasion or a protracted air operation) or as one-off strikes outside a broader state of war. The term “military strike” is used in the paper to refer to a hit (or intended hit) on a target using military force – irrespective of the kind of military force used, whether the strike took place in the context of a broader military operation or was a one-off hit, or the ultimate effect on target. The term “military attack” is used to refer broadly to military operations aimed at or conducted near nuclear facilities (which may not include a direct strike on a facility). Defining what constitutes “use of military force” and distinguishing it from other “sub-threshold” activities that states may use against an adversary is challenging and the subject of academic and legal debate. For the purposes of this paper, reviewed cases and analysis were limited to instances when kinetic action was conducted by a state’s military. The paper therefore excludes instances of sabotage operations, cyber attacks, assassinations or intelligence-collection activities. The logic, practicalities, effects and countermeasures for these types of activities are likely to differ considerably from attacks using military force – even if carried out in the context of a broader military operation. As such, these activities deserve separate consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The focus of this paper is the use of military force by states and therefore this paper does not consider attacks against nuclear facilities by non-state actors. The non-state threat has received much greater attention – analytical, regulatory and legal – in the nuclear safety and security space, compared with that given to state threats. Furthermore, the motivations, resources and constraints of non-state actors looking to attack a nuclear facility are likely to differ significantly from those of state militaries. As such, they require separate consideration. As with defining “use of military force”, drawing a clear line between state and non-state actors can sometimes be difficult. For the sake of clarity, this paper has limited itself to an analysis of attacks carried out by state militaries. Nevertheless, state-sponsored non-state actors have threatened nuclear infrastructure in the past and may do so in the future. The interplay between state and non-state motivations, resources and restrictions, and the impact on approaches to defence against such attacks is worth exploring in future research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-drivers-and-effects-of-military-attacks-on-nuclear-infrastructure&quot;&gt;I. Drivers and Effects of Military Attacks on Nuclear Infrastructure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In certain contexts, the driver for targeting nuclear infrastructure may be much the same as that for military attacks on other forms of critical national infrastructure (CNI) – for example, the interruption or seizure of energy production (to impede military industry and/or to degrade a population’s morale and will to resist). Nuclear facilities may also be targeted for their intrinsic economic value, just like any other part of large-scale industrial or other infrastructure. However, nuclear facilities have a number of particular characteristics which may present unique strategic and operational opportunities and challenges that influence states’ thinking on whether and how to carry out military activity against or near nuclear infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most relevant particularities of nuclear facilities as a target set are the dual-use nature of some nuclear technology and the presence of material at some nuclear sites which – if dispersed – may pose a radiological danger to human health and the environment. The threat posed by radiological release presents the potential for both physical and psychological harm. Meanwhile, when nuclear sites form part of a nuclear weapons programme – or are suspected of contributing to a state’s nuclear weapons ambitions – they are also likely to be imbued with a level of symbolic significance. Such significance relates to a state’s perception of its own place on the world stage, technical prowess and strategic security, and can exist independently of the actual tactical or operational value of the facilities and the capabilities they may host. The relatively high baseload of nuclear power plants – compared with other energy production facilities – can also present a much larger and centralised energy disruption target for attacking militaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above-listed characteristics of nuclear facilities as targets are the departure point for the analysis that follows of why and how states may carry out attacks against nuclear infrastructure. These characteristics of nuclear facilities, and related consequences of attacks, may be key to why these sites are targeted. For instance, a nuclear installation may be attacked because of, rather than despite, its dual-use nature or the likelihood of radioactive release, as this may be the desired strategic or operational effect. Alternatively, these characteristics and consequences may act as undesirable or unintended consequences of attacks, which may or may not deter or make less attractive attacks on nuclear sites. For example, strikes on other parts of an electrical grid may be carried out despite the risk of creating a nuclear accident at a power plant and the consequent release of radioactive material; alternatively, strikes on the grid may be deterred when the collateral risks are determined to be excessive. This paper attempts to capture both these dynamics in analysing how these unique characteristics have an impact on the operational and strategic considerations for attacks on nuclear sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter discusses five overarching operational and strategic drivers of military attacks, and threats of attack, on nuclear facilities: counterproliferation; energy disruption; the release of radioactive material for area denial and defence; escalation of violence in the course of a conflict, or the threat of doing so for deterrent or coercive purposes; and encountering nuclear facilities on an axis of advance or during a broader military operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These broad categories were articulated based on a review of historical cases of attacks on nuclear facilities and data collected through research interviews, in which SMEs were asked to consider the range of possible drivers for military attacks on nuclear sites. The drivers identified in this paper are unlikely to be exhaustive and are not mutually exclusive; a decision to attack may be informed by several of these factors simultaneously. The following discussion aims to be a starting point for policymakers, militaries and international organisations looking to understand why militaries may consider attacking nuclear infrastructure and when or how influence can be exerted to reduce risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chapter first provides an overview of the effects of radioactive and other toxic material release from nuclear installations, before moving on to a discussion of some drivers of military attacks on nuclear facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;effects-of-nuclear-material-release&quot;&gt;Effects of Nuclear Material Release&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nature of the materials released from nuclear facilities and their practical impact on human health and the environment depend on many factors. These include, but are not limited to: the nature of the material at the facility; the extent and effectiveness of material containment; the quantity of material released; meteorological conditions (such as wind speed, wind direction and precipitation); the availability of protective measures and emergency response; proximity of population centres; and the nature of the environment in the vicinity of the attacked facility (including the presence and type of vegetation and animal life, water sources and the type of soil). Furthermore, nuclear facilities can contain a range of radiotoxic materials, comprising various nuclides and isotopes. Differences in the types of radioactivity the materials release, their half-lives and masses dictate the nature of the threat posed by the various nuclides that may be released from a given facility as a result of an accident or strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The state of current prohibitions on the use of military force against nuclear facilities, as well as the historical trajectory of efforts to strengthen protections against such attacks, have been outlined at length elsewhere. While a detailed summary is not provided in this paper, it is worth briefly outlining the key parameters (an inexhaustive list) of existing international and multilateral protections from military attacks on nuclear installations:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Geneva Conventions (Additional Protocols I and II):&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Various provisions of the Geneva Conventions require militaries to take the necessary precautions to avoid harm to civilians; these include, but are not limited to, prohibitions on attacks against facilities containing “dangerous forces” (including nuclear electrical-generating stations).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;

In a 2009 General Conference decision, the IAEA noted that armed attacks against peaceful nuclear facilities constitute “a violation of the principles of the United Nations Charter, international law and the Statute of the Agency”. In September 2023, the IAEA General Conference adopted a resolution expressing concern over Russian military activity at the ZNPP and reiterating the importance of ensuring nuclear safety in armed conflict.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;

The resolution did not introduce any new binding prohibitions. In July 2024, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution recalling the 2009 IAEA General Conference decision and condemning the Russian seizure of the ZNPP.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

The 2022 NPT Review Conference draft outcome document (not ultimately adopted) also expressed “grave concern” at attacks and threats of attack on peaceful nuclear facilities.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facilities at the front end of the nuclear fuel cycle – namely, uranium mines and mills, uranium conversion sites, uranium enrichment plants and nuclear fuel production facilities – present primarily a chemical rather than radiological risk. Natural uranium and unirradiated uranium compounds (triuranium octaoxide, uranium dioxide and uranium hexafluoride) are not significant sources of radioactivity (with enriched uranium hexafluoride slightly more radioactive than natural uranium). However, these materials can pose a serious chemical risk, primarily from inhalation. For instance, uranium hexafluoride reacts with water vapour present in the air to produce the highly toxic uranium fluoride and, through further reaction, uranyl fluoride, another toxic substance. The threat posed to life from these chemicals again depends on a range of factors, with the most serious effects likely to be fairly localised – although dispersal of some material through wind or groundwater contamination may produce some hazard for populations further away from the site of release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Release from facilities involved in the service period and back end of the nuclear fuel cycle – namely, nuclear reactors, spent-fuel storage sites and spent-fuel reprocessing facilities – pose significant risk of radiological harm, due to the composition of the irradiated nuclear fuel at these facilities, which contains – in addition to uranium and plutonium – unstable radionuclides especially harmful to human health, which are not present in fresh (unirradiated) fuel. The precise isotopic composition of the irradiated fuel at a given facility (and therefore the nature and volume of harmful isotopes present) depends on the initial make-up of the fuel, its burnup, and, if the fuel is no longer in an operational reactor, how long it has been cooling. As with the chemical hazard discussed above, the extent of the radiological hazard depends on (among other factors) the nature of the facility in question (including the extent of physical protection afforded to the radioactive material), the facility’s operational state at the time of the incident, the nature of the incident itself, the abilities and responsiveness of the facility’s personnel and emergency responders, the proximity of the facility to population centres, and the nature of the ecosystem in the vicinity of the site. The consequences of incidents can vary widely depending on these factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extent to which radioactive material is physically protected from any direct strike or dispersal has an important impact on the likelihood and extent of dispersal following various safety incidents or the use of various weapons systems and munitions. Most nuclear installations benefit from reinforced containment structures or vessels. As discussed in greater detail in the section of this paper on strengthening passive and active defences of nuclear facilities, these protections are meant to protect nuclear installations against a range of threats and to prevent release of hazardous material in case of an accident. However, facilities are not generally designed to withstand military assault or operate under wartime conditions (with the exception of some facilities which may be part of an effort to develop nuclear weapons and/or are expected to face serious military threats from adversaries – for instance, Iran’s underground enrichment sites). The extent of protections also varies across countries and facilities. For instance, many of the Soviet-built reactors still operating in Russia are not under a reinforced concrete containment structure; this includes the reactors at the Kursk nuclear power plant, which caused some concern as Ukrainian armed forces advanced into Russia’s Kursk oblast in summer 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;physical-and-psychological-effects&quot;&gt;Physical and Psychological Effects&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on the amount and nature of the exposure to various kinds of nuclear material, effects on the human body will vary. Acute exposure to significant amounts of radiation may result in acute radiation syndrome (ARS), affecting the bone marrow, the gastrointestinal system, and the cardiovascular and central nervous systems. ARS can generally be expected at a dose of 700 millisieverts (mSv) (the equivalent of receiving about 70 full-body CT scans, or 140,000 dental X-rays, or eating 7 tonnes of Brazil nuts). Symptoms vary in severity and duration and may include – depending on the severity of exposure – nausea and vomiting, fever, confusion, haemorrhaging and even death. Cutaneous radiation injury may also result in damage to skin and hair loss. Changes in blood cells can be readily observed at lower doses, of about 100 mSV (the equivalent of 10 full-body CT scans, 20,000 dental X-rays or 1 tonne of Brazil nuts).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, the impact of radioactive release on human health and the environment – especially long-term effects – can be notoriously challenging to track; the effects of any excess radiation may develop over years and decades and may be challenging to isolate from confounding acute and long-term factors. The data on the impact to human health of the 1986 Chornobyl and 2011 Fukushima-Daiichi accidents (which tend to serve as worst-case scenario references in public commentary) is largely inconclusive – with some exceptions. According to the UN Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) – whose findings have been contested by other sources – of the 600 workers on the site at the time of the Chornobyl accident, 134 suffered from radiation sickness, 28 of whom died in the first three months after the accident. Some subsequent deaths may also be attributable to radiation effects. A marked increase in thyroid cancer among children in Belarus, Ukraine and affected parts of Russia, as well as increased rates of leukaemia and cataracts among those workers that had suffered from radiation sickness, has been recorded in the decades since. However, the UNSCEAR report notes that significant changes in other rates of cancer have not been observed, and a general upward trend in mortality across the area of the Soviet Union and improvements in reporting make it difficult to isolate and accurately assess the long-term health impacts of the accident. After the Fukushima-Daiichi accident, no acute health effects attributable to radiation exposure were immediately reported. The UNSCEAR report on the impact of ionising radiation following the accident did not expect a discernible increase in most cancer occurrences among the Japanese population, although it did note the possibility of increased thyroid cancer rates and a potential (likely not discernible) increase in occurrences of leukaemia among children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Environmental impacts of the accidents have also been debated. The CEZ – which stretches out to a 30 km2 radius around the Chornobyl nuclear power plant – remains contaminated and largely without permanent inhabitants. Yet, the site remains operational and – prior to the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine – was open to public visitors, with remaining radioactive isotopes “at tolerable exposure levels for limited periods of time”. Mutations and other adverse effects on animal and plant species in the CEZ were reported in the years after the accident. Today, the area has been rewilded and become a wildlife sanctuary; however, there is also data to suggest that species diversity remains impacted by radiation. Despite the spread of radioisotopes from the accident to other parts of Europe and subsequent contamination of animal products and plants, the increased exposure of radiation is not believed to have had a direct impact on cancer rates outside the affected Soviet republics. At Fukushima-Daiichi, some areas around the plant remain exclusion zones; many have been deemed safe enough for residents to return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assessing the consequences of a given radiological release is particularly challenging for long-term and generational effects of radiation exposure, but this can be true for immediate effects as well. In an interview with the author, Robert Peter Gale – an expert on radiation health effects, who was a leading figure in the medical responses to the 1986 accident at Chornobyl, as well as the 1987 radioactive incident in Goiânia, Brazil, and the Tokaimura and Fukushima-Daiichi accidents in Japan – noted that, immediately following an accident, for victims in close proximity to the event, it may be difficult to tell apart the effects of radionuclide exposure from those of regular burns or exposure to chemicals also released in the accident. This complicates identifying the most appropriate course of immediate treatment for victims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the physical impacts on human health, concerns over exposure to radioactive materials – whether harmful exposure actually took place or not – can have significant psychological effects on populations. The particular propensity of CBRN incidents to incite fear among the public is a well-studied phenomenon and was raised repeatedly by experts interviewed for this project. Interviewees contrasted the fear of an attack on a nuclear site with reactions to attacks on other energy and strategic targets, such as coal and hydro plants, which do not tend to generate the same levels of panic among the general population. Scholars who have studied the subject of risk communication in response to CBRN incidents (namely, CBRN terrorist attacks) have noted that “CBRN releases score highly on all characteristics that trigger fear and anxiety”. The factors that make CBRN a particularly anxiety-inducing threat include relatively low levels of understanding of nuclear technology and the effects of radioactivity, the ability of CBRN incidents to induce “severe and unusual medical conditions”, the unpredictability of the threat, and its manufactured nature (as opposed to “acts of God”). As some of the experts interviewed for this paper pointed out – and as has been well-documented in literature – the public anxiety caused by radiological release is likely to be incommensurate with the actual physical danger. This may, in turn, create additional challenges and risk as the “worried well” overwhelm emergency response services and potentially engage in unnecessary and possibly harmful remedial action (for instance, unnecessarily evacuating their homes or self-medicating).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his conversation with the author, Gale pointed to the panic that spread to Kyiv and Tokyo after the Chornobyl and Fukushima-Daiichi disasters respectively, despite the fact that the disaster sites were a considerable distance away from these cities and, in Gale’s assessment, did not pose a significant radiation threat to the cities’ populations. Instead, he noted that the subsequent evacuations from surrounding areas, as well as precautionary measures taken out of fear of the effects of radiation exposure, may have caused greater collateral harm. Gale pointed to the increase in induced abortions after the Chornobyl accident, as a result of misguided advice from doctors on the effects of the radiation on foetuses. Studies conducted in the years following the disaster found no evidence that children exposed to radiation in utero showed any neuropsychological differences from the control sample.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evacuations following a nuclear accident can also have harmful secondary effects on the displaced population. Gale and others have highlighted the risks of disruptions to healthcare, particularly for the older population, caused by evacuations from around the Fukushima-Daiichi plant after the 2011 disaster. Such evacuations appear to have had a greater direct health impact than radiation exposure from the accident. In its report on the levels and effects of radiation exposure after the accident, UNSCEAR reported on the “immediate aggravation of the condition of already vulnerable groups: for example, more than 50 hospitalized patients were reported to have died either during or soon after the evacuation … upwards of 100 elderly people may have died in subsequent months because of a variety of conditions linked to the evacuation”. The influx of people into neighbouring regions and countries also has important social, political and health implications as public services, including healthcare, must stretch to accommodate the new arrivals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intermediate- and long-term psychological effects of radiological release incidents have also been well-documented. Studies have found increased levels of depression, anxiety and “medically unexplained physical symptoms” among survivors of the Chornobyl disaster than in control samples. A 2006 World Health Organization study also reported that distress among victims was also often the result of subjective perceptions that they, or their children, had been affected by the radiation release at Chornobyl. The study noted expert consensus that, “The mental health impact of Chernobyl is the largest public health problem caused by the accident to date”. Research conducted on the Fukushima-Daiichi accident also reported psychological distress among individuals who felt they had been affected by radiation. Similarly, following the Goiânia accident, more than 112,000 people sought assistance related to symptoms of radioactive exposure; however, only 260 people appear to have been actually contaminated, with four deaths reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;counterproliferation&quot;&gt;Counterproliferation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the Second World War Allied attacks on the Vemork heavy water production plant, military strikes – and more covert means – have been used repeatedly to target nuclear programmes that are believed to pose a risk of weaponisation. Counterproliferation has, historically, been a leading driver behind the use of military force (or its serious consideration) against nuclear infrastructure. Other instances include: repeated strikes on Iraq’s nuclear facilities – by Iran in 1980, Israel in 1981, and the US in the 1990s; and Israel’s strike on Syria’s Al-Kibar reactor in 2007. As mentioned earlier, there are also multiple instances in which strikes were considered but not carried out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Logic of Counterproliferation Attacks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The definition of operational success in the context of military strikes as a counterproliferation tool varies on a case-by-case basis and may range from a limited roll-back of a nuclear programme to completely disabling (at least in the immediate term) a country’s ability to continue its pursuit of nuclear weapons. In their work on military strikes as a counterproliferation tool, Kreps and Fuhrmann have proposed that attacks on nuclear facilities may have an impact on the host country’s proliferation activity in four ways: by delaying the production of relevant materials and components through the destruction of chokepoint facilities; by forcing a change in the target country’s approach to fissile material production (shifting from the production of plutonium-using reactors and processing facilities to the production of uranium in easier-to-conceal enrichment facilities); by discouraging foreign suppliers from providing materials and assistance to the programme; and by increasing international inspections of the target country’s nuclear sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military strikes on facilities can also serve a signalling purpose – demonstrating the attacking state’s resolve to do what is necessary to prevent the emergence of a nuclear weapons capability. Israeli strikes on nuclear facilities in the Middle East are a good example of this dual effect. Israeli military action against nuclear facilities has had the effect of physically eliminating or degrading programmes perceived to be a proliferation threat while also reinforcing the so-called “Begin Doctrine” – Israel’s policy of not permitting its regional adversaries to acquire WMD and its preparedness to use “all the means at [its] disposal” to this end. An Israeli nuclear expert interviewed for this paper noted that military attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities may become necessary, not just to physically degrade the programme, which can be reconstituted with some time, but to signal Israeli (and/or US) resolve to continue striking the programme until Iran decides to abandon any nuclear weapons ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practical terms, the effectiveness of military strikes as a counterproliferation tool is the subject of considerable debate and depends on a variety of factors. The prevalent opinion among counterproliferation experts tends to be that military force is limited in its effectiveness as a counterproliferation tool and – in isolation – is best-suited to delaying, rather than outright eliminating a state’s nuclear ambitions. However, when accompanied by a large-scale military operation aiming to achieve broader strategic security objectives and/or the installation of permanent IAEA inspectors with the requisite authority to destroy nuclear material – as was the case in the Gulf War and the subsequent approach to dealing with the threat of a nuclear Iraq – it may be able to achieve more lasting results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel’s 1981 attack on the Osirak reactor and 2007 attack on the Al-Kibar reactor are often lauded as examples of successful counterproliferation strikes. Yet, this is a misguided reading of the facts. After the Osirak attack, the Saddam Hussein government only doubled down on its nuclear ambitions; as Ramberg has pointed out in his work on the use of military force as a counterproliferation tool, “Baghdad, which had committed 400 scientists and $400 million to the nuclear program before the attack, enlarged its nuclear staff to 7,000 and upped its budget to $10 billion”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the attack, Iraq also reportedly turned to the Soviet Union for guidance on how to make nuclear facilities more resilient to attack: “Specifically, the KGB taught them how to disguise and disperse industrial facilities, using techniques such as blocking heat sources from being detected by strategic reconnaissance. They also taught the Iraqis how to build in ‘blow-away’ walls to new structures, such that if the building is hit the structure is left sufficiently in place to permit rapid reconstruction.” The Israeli strike on the reactor followed an earlier Iranian attack on the site in 1980, and it was not until US attacks on Iraq’s nuclear sites during the wider Gulf War air campaign that the programme ultimately ended. While the 2007 Israeli attack on Al-Kibar did seem to eliminate Syria’s nuclear proliferation efforts, some accounts attest that Damascus may have considered reconstructing the reactor after the attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel also did not stop at the 2007 military attack and appears to have continued its use of lethal force as a counterproliferation strategy: in 2008, its special forces assassinated General Mohammed Suleiman who had been in charge of the construction of the Al-Kibar reactor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, despite these limitations, states have repeatedly resorted to – or seriously considered – military force for counterproliferation objectives. In a 2010 journal article, Fuhrmann and Kreps conducted a statistical analysis of counterproliferation attacks and serious considerations of attack to determine the factors that increase the likelihood of states resorting to military force as a counterproliferation strategy. They found that threat perception in relation to the nuclear programme in question, above all else, drives states’ decision-making on whether to carry out a counterproliferation strike. The authors concluded that decisions to use military force for counterproliferation aims are driven primarily by a fear on the part of the attacking state that the proliferating state “might use nuclear weapons or engage in other offensive behaviour”, not diplomatic recrimination or even retaliatory strikes by the latter. Fuhrmann and Kreps identify three factors that appear to have a particular influence on threat perceptions: the prior existence of militarised conflict; the presence of an autocratic proliferator; and divergent policy interests between the attacking state and the proliferator. Their analysis finds no statistically significant correlation between a decision to carry out military strikes and risks of reprisal or diplomatic recrimination. The authors argue that “states are willing to accept substantial costs in attacking if they believe that a particular country’s acquisition of nuclear weapons poses a significant threat to their security”. Israel’s experience is instructive in this instance; despite considerable concerns among the Israeli decision-makers over the diplomatic backlash the country may have faced in response to its decision to strike Osirak in 1981, the attack went ahead. The decision to resort to military action in the face of possible diplomatic recrimination was informed by a perception among Israeli leadership that there was no other way to prevent an Iraqi nuclear weapon; diplomatic efforts with Iraq had failed and the reactor was about to be loaded with fuel, which would have greatly increased the risk of collateral damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Likely Targets and Effects&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on the objective of a counterproliferation attack and the nature and state of the programme, a range of facilities and assets may be targeted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the purpose of a strike is to cause material damage to a state’s capability to develop nuclear weapons (and not just signal resolve), in instances where a country may be pursuing a uranium weapon, the front end of the fuel cycle is likely to be of greatest relevance for an attacking state. Targets may include uranium mines and mills, conversion facilities, enrichment plants, enriched uranium storage sites and centrifuge production plants. In cases where a state is suspected of pursuing a plutonium weapon, it is more likely to be relying on heavy water reactors, graphite-moderated reactors or fast breeder reactors to accumulate plutonium. These may be dedicated plutonium production reactors or may double as research reactors or power-generating reactors. Light water reactors can also be used for plutonium production, although they tend to be less efficient, as light water reactor fuel tends to contain relatively high levels of Plutonium-240, making it less suitable – although still useable – for the production of nuclear weapons. A reprocessing facility is also required to extract the plutonium from the irradiated fuel. Counterproliferation attacks against plutonium programmes are therefore likely to target reactors or reprocessing facilities – which can pose a serious radiation hazard if material is released. A country may of course host facilities that allow it to pursue either pathway; for instance, Iraq pursued both the uranium and plutonium pathways following Israel’s 1981 attack on Osirak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any sites that may be hosting weaponisation-related activities and expertise – such as research reactors and centres or various laboratories – may also be targeted, regardless of the weaponisation pathway a country may be pursuing. Such activities can often be obfuscated in small and non-descript facilities or at sites engaged in civilian or military research. As such, they may be much more difficult to identify for targeting than large enrichment facilities or reactors. Furthermore, weaponisation research sites and even enrichment facilities and centrifuge production plants can be placed deep underground, making them much harder to damage or destroy through the use of limited military force. Assassinations of nuclear scientists have also been a counterproliferation tactic deployed by Israel, as a way of eliminating proliferation-relevant expertise in a state. However, such activity falls outside the definition of “military attack” in this paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;energy-disruption&quot;&gt;Energy Disruption&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military strikes on energy infrastructure are an established aspect of waging war. Nuclear power plants thus risk becoming military targets when the disruption of energy production is an objective of a military operation. This is likely to have been a driver behind the Russian occupation of Ukraine’s ZNPP. No other cases examined by the author point to energy disruption as having been a key driver of a military attack on a nuclear facility. However, the case of the ZNPP is unlikely to remain an exception. As nuclear power is expected to play a greater role in the international energy mix, nuclear energy facilities may be targeted for the purpose of energy disruption in future conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth highlighting that the legality of attacks on energy infrastructure under international law is highly context-dependent. Energy infrastructure is, in many cases, a legitimate military target. However, as discussed earlier, attacks that cause disproportionate harm to civilians or are aimed primarily at terrorising the civilian population are prohibited under IHL. The potential for radioactive release means that attacks which risk the safety of nuclear power plants are particularly difficult to justify under international law since the potential effects of such attacks can lead to significant harm to civilians. However, this does not rule out the possibility that nuclear energy infrastructure and auxiliary systems may be targeted by militaries in the future. As such, it is worth examining the logic of such attacks and possible approaches to risk mitigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Logic of Energy Disruption Attacks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One prevalent approach to conceptualising military targeting priorities is underpinned by the idea that strategic objectives can be achieved through the degradation of an adversary’s key physical systems – or centres of gravity (COGs) – as opposed to aimless attrition or a singular focus on degrading an adversary’s military forces. Power generation and transmission infrastructure is a particularly important COG, as its destruction can significantly undermine the adversary’s ability to prosecute a war and incentivise concessions from the political leadership. Energy infrastructure is therefore often an explicit component of military targeting doctrines – including NATO’s Allied Joint Doctrine for Joint Targeting and the US Air Force’s Targeting Doctrine. During the 1999 Kosovo Air Campaign, NATO forces extensively targeted Serbian electrical infrastructure, reportedly destroying 35% of its electricity-generating capacity. The intended effect – ultimately successful – was to wear down the will to resist of the Serbian population and the elites, thus pressuring Serbian President Slobodan Milošević to comply with NATO demands. The US Air Force also targeted Iraqi electrical infrastructure, alongside other strategic targets, during both the Gulf War and the Iraq War. The aim was to incapacitate Iraq’s military while also creating the necessary conditions for the political overthrow of the Iraqi regime. The focus on the degradation of an adversary’s systems, rather than its armed forces, is also central to Chinese military thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian military thinking appears to be predicated on similar assumptions, with an apparent recognition of the fact that in modern wars, priorities for the application of force have shifted from the destruction of an adversary’s forces to the destruction of an adversary’s critical facilities. Energy generation infrastructure – including nuclear power plants – is one of the operational-strategic and strategic target categories captured by Russia’s doctrinal concept of Strategic Operation for the Destruction of Critically Important Targets. Strikes on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure have been a key aspect of Russia’s war on the country. Considering that over half of Ukraine’s energy-generating capacity in 2021 came from its four nuclear power plants, it was perhaps not surprising – but still alarming – that these facilities have been targeted. Russian war planning documents for a potential conflict with Japan and South Korea, dating from 2013 and 2014, also included plans to target nuclear power plants, among other energy and CNI targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As nuclear power plants tend to have greater baseload generating capacity per station (with the majority falling within the range of 1–4 GW of generating capacity) than other energy sources (although not always), they may be particularly attractive energy-disruption targets: an assault on a single large nuclear plant can cause greater disruption to a country’s energy generation than attacks on smaller hydro, thermal or other generating stations and related transmission infrastructure. In the case of these latter targets, the destruction of multiple targets may be required to produce energy disruption on a similar scale. The capture and shutdown of the ZNPP has had the single most important impact on the loss of Ukraine’s energy production capacity from the incapacitation of a single facility. Prior to the start of the full-scale invasion, the ZNPP had a total net generating capacity of 5.7 GW. The ZNPP is, of course, an outlier as it is the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. Still, its capacity is significantly higher than that of Ukraine’s second-largest power station, the Vuhlehirska Thermal Power Plant, a coal-fired facility with a generating capacity of 3.6 GW, which Russia captured in July 2022. According to some accounts, by summer 2024, Ukraine had lost 25.5 GW of generation capacity. Based on these figures, the loss of the ZNPP, which took the Russian forces less than a day, represented nearly a quarter of all generation capacity lost during the first two-and-a-half years of full-scale war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some coal or hydro power plants can rival the generating capacity of nuclear power plants. In such instances, militaries may opt to target these facilities rather than nuclear power generating stations to reduce enemy energy generation capacity and potential collateral effects – namely, the risk of radioactive release. However, the dangers to the population of the destruction of a hydroelectric facility may similarly have devastating consequences if it involves damage to a hydro dam. The breach of Ukraine’s Nova Kakhovka dam caused 58 confirmed fatalities – the actual death toll was likely higher, potentially in the hundreds, by some estimates. The flood affected 620 km2 of land, forced the reduction of energy output from hydroelectric stations along the Dnipro River, destroyed irrigation systems across the region, caused the leakage and spread of chemicals and other pollutants into waterways and soil, and displaced mines, causing a further hazard to human life. As mentioned earlier, attacks on hydro facilities and other power generating plants may, however, not carry the same psychological effect on the population and decision-makers as attacks – or threats of attack – on nuclear infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A high dependence on nuclear power for energy production naturally makes it more likely that a country’s nuclear infrastructure will come under threat should it become the target of a military campaign by an adversary. Few countries are currently as dependent on nuclear power as Ukraine. As of 2023, only France and Slovakia generated over half of their energy from nuclear power, with Hungary just below the 50% mark. Another five countries – Finland, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechia and Slovenia – relied on nuclear power for over a third of their energy generation in 2023. Should an adversary decide to incapacitate energy infrastructure in these countries in the course of a full-scale invasion or strategic air campaign, it is likely that their nuclear power plants or related transmission networks would be at risk. A military assault of that scale remains highly improbable in the aforementioned countries, even though there is concern in a number of them about the threat posed by Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The potential for nuclear energy infrastructure to be targeted in countries that face a clear and considerable threat of strategic military attack from regional adversaries is a greater concern. Countries that may face such threats include Armenia (which has one reactor, making up 31.1% of the country’s energy generation) and South Korea (26 reactors, making up 30.7% of the country’s energy generation). As more countries become interested in nuclear power as a sustainable and clean source of energy, the share of energy produced by nuclear power plants is projected to increase in the coming decade, including in countries that might face strategic-level military threats from adversaries – namely, Iran and South Korea. Concerns have also been raised over the potential for China to attack or otherwise disrupt the operations of Taiwan’s nuclear reactor at Maanshan, should open conflict break out. Taiwan’s ruling party has committed to shutting down the island’s last operating reactor in 2025, which will minimise both the energy security and nuclear safety implications of any future attack. However, Taiwan’s stores of spent fuel withdrawn from the decommissioned reactors will continue to pose a potential radioactive threat should China decide to target them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Likely Targets and Effects&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of energy disruption, nuclear installations that may be targeted include nuclear reactors and their support systems, as well as the transmission lines and substations that connect the reactors to the broader grid. The destruction of nuclear fuel production facilities, fuel storage facilities and other sites outside the operational stage of the nuclear fuel cycle – that is, the point in the cycle where energy is being produced – may complicate the operation of nuclear power plants in the long run. However, reactors are normally loaded with fuel that can supply power for years before needing to be replaced. Equally, nuclear fuel can be stored on-site – in cooling pools within reactor buildings – for several years before a shortage of space for spent fuel storage becomes enough of an issue that it impacts the operation of a reactor. Spent fuel pools may also be allowed to exceed their designed capacity if needed. As such, while disrupting the operation of these other facilities may have an impact on nuclear energy production in the long term, an immediate effect on energy generation would require attacks on reactors themselves, their support systems or their transmission infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Direct attacks on a reactor vessel are unlikely, if the sole purpose of the attack is to disrupt energy production. The risk of large-scale radiological release if the containment structure and core of a reactor are penetrated – for instance, by a missile strike – is exceptionally high. Instead, militaries aiming to disrupt nuclear energy production or distribution are more likely to target supporting systems and transmission infrastructure. This may be perceived by militaries and governments as a safer and easier alternative to achieving energy disruption objectives – posing fewer risks of a catastrophic nuclear safety incident, eliciting less fervent recriminations from the international community and requiring less firepower to inflict damage. This logic may have been playing out in Russian military assaults on Ukraine’s nuclear infrastructure, with strikes carried out primarily against supporting infrastructure – including water supply, power lines and substations connected to Ukraine’s nuclear power plants, as well as auxiliary buildings and infrastructure at the ZNPP. Ukraine’s reactors have, however, also been hit on a number of occasions – including direct drone strikes on one of the ZNPP’s reactor domes and a drone strike on the New Safe Confinement Structure at Chornobyl. Similar logic has been observed in campaigns targeting non-nuclear energy infrastructure. After receiving significant criticism for attacks on Iraqi energy infrastructure during the Gulf War, coalition forces reportedly limited their attacks during the Iraq War only to energy transmission infrastructure, rather than energy generation stations, as well as switching to weapons expected to be less harmful to civilians. The reduced firepower required to damage power lines and water reservoirs as opposed to reactor vessels (which would require the use of heavy and targeted munitions to penetrate the containment structure) also allows the attacker some credible deniability of responsibility, should diplomatic recrimination be a concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is only partially true that attacks on supporting and transmission infrastructure are lower risk: these systems are all critical for the safe operation of a plant. A loss of off-site power (LOOP) incident, a loss of coolant accident (LOCA) or a station blackout (SBO) (when the station loses access to both off-site power and emergency generators) can have catastrophic results for a nuclear plant. This is something that the IAEA has repeatedly drawn attention to in the context of the war in Ukraine. The IAEA has highlighted the risk to nuclear safety posed by the frequent disconnection of Ukraine’s nuclear power plants, and the ZNPP in particular, from off-site power supply and the risks of potential coolant loss following the draining of the Kakhovka reservoir. Off-site power and water supply are critical for the maintenance of a plant’s safe and secure operation. While nuclear power plants have on-site emergency diesel generators and alternative sources of coolant can be sought (for instance, through the drilling of wells), these cannot fully replace normal operating systems or be relied on indefinitely and may themselves be challenging to procure and maintain during a war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attacks on transmission networks rather than the generating facilities themselves may also be the preference when a military operation is aimed at the occupation of a country, rather than a purely punitive or coercive military campaign, when destruction rather than territorial gain is the primary objective. In such cases, the adversary may wish to minimise damage to CNI (to the extent that military operational necessity allows) and to prioritise instead targets that may be easier to rebuild following the end of hostilities. In the case of energy infrastructure, transmission lines and substations are much less costly, timely or complex to repair than generating stations. Damaging energy transmission – rather than generation – infrastructure also allows for the rerouting of energy infrastructure away from unoccupied territories and towards those that the adversary has managed to capture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disruption of energy production and distribution also has serious implications for both the safety and morale of civilian populations, and potentially also for military operations. Modern societies are highly dependent on reliable electricity supply to operate CNI and critical services – from the provision of water supply, sanitation services and heating to the operation of communication networks, health services, financial systems and government bureaucracies. Disruption of this infrastructure may lead to civilian deaths, at worst, and a decline in morale and willingness to continue with the war effort, at best. For instance, as mentioned earlier, NATO attacks on Serbia’s energy infrastructure elicited frustration among Serbian elites and the broader population that helped pressure Milošević into concessions. These disruptions to daily life may also drive internal displacement and refugee flows outside the targeted country, putting pressure on neighbouring states and potentially decreasing whatever political or military support these states are lending to the targeted country. The potential for renewed waves of refugee flows from Ukraine into Europe has been a concern in light of persistent Russian assaults on Ukraine’s energy system and Russia’s track record of weaponising refugee migration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;area-denial&quot;&gt;Area Denial&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Release of radioactive material may be an unintended consequence of a direct attack on a nuclear facility or of other military operations that result in a nuclear accident. However, it is also conceivable that militaries may target nuclear facilities – or threaten to do so – with the express intention of releasing radioactive material precisely because of the risk that such a release would cause to the surrounding environment, as a method of area denial. The author has not identified any instances of nuclear facilities having been expressly targeted for this purpose in the past. Any such attack would also almost certainly violate provisions of the Geneva Conventions and IHL principles more broadly, as it would be difficult to ensure or convincingly make the case that release of radioactive material as a result of attack would not place civilian populations at risk. Furthermore, nuclear facilities in the back end of the nuclear fuel cycle – for instance, spent fuel storage facilities – would have little military utility; attacks on such installations would be difficult to justify on the basis of military necessity. However, a number of experts interviewed for this paper agreed that nuclear sites could hypothetically be targeted by militaries for area denial purposes; as such, the possibility deserves analytical consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Logic of Area Denial Attacks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attacks to release radioactive material may be used either as part of an offensive operation – denying manoeuvrability and incapacitating an adversary – or as part of a defensive effort – placing radiation in the way of an advancing military. Radioactive or chemical contamination of a territory complicates and delays an adversary’s operations in the affected area and may lead to mission failure. Contamination can have an impact on a force’s freedom of movement, force personnel to operate in cumbersome protective gear, interrupt logistics and supply lines, and require the updating of risk assessments and the adjustment of mission plans. If radiation or chemical exposure is suffered by troops, this may also incapacitate personnel and impact the morale of those not directly affected. Levels of awareness of CBRN risks and how to manage them vary among and within militaries. Furthermore, specialised counter-CBRN (C-CBRN) units ultimately have limited personnel and capacity and may therefore struggle to provide the levels of support necessary to carry out large-scale or complex operations in a contaminated environment or one that poses the risk of a CBRN incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on the extent of the radiological or chemical dispersal, a broader emergency response may be needed to address risks to the broader population, thereby drawing on already-stretched civil and military resources. Meanwhile, forces of the attacking state which were previously tasked with holding the now-contaminated territory could probably be reallocated to bolster operations elsewhere on the frontline. Equally, stressing and even exaggerating risks to a nuclear site may be used as a way of deterring any attempts at contesting the territory near a nuclear facility or the nuclear site itself – both because of the actual risk of causing a nuclear accident and because of the diplomatic and public outcry that would accompany such a military operation. Militaries may therefore be incentivised to use these sites as defensive positions. The deterrent and coercive impacts of such threats are discussed in the next section of this chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these challenges of operating in a CBRN environment, there is some reason to doubt the ultimate operational impact and effectiveness of radioactive release as an area denial tool. Most modern militaries have procedures in place to respond to CBRN incidents and to maintain – to the extent possible, based on an assessment of risk to personnel and mission importance – operability in such environments. While radioactive contamination of a territory may delay and complicate a military operation, the adoption of protective measures and – depending on the importance of the mission – some acceptance of risk will likely allow operational objectives to be pursued, albeit with significantly greater difficulty and risk. The measures taken to minimise exposure are dictated by individual militaries’ doctrines for CBRN operations, the nature of the hazard, the availability of protective measures and operational requirements. Protective measures for operations in a contaminated environment include some combination of minimising exposure time, maintaining distance from the hazardous material and employing shielding materials. Trade-offs between the various protective measures may be necessary depending on operational requirements – for instance, foregoing protective gear to minimise exposure time. The degree of acceptable exposure is also dictated by how critical the mission is to achieving operational or strategic objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unpredictability of any radiological release and the impossibility of controlling the extent of contamination also make radiological dispersal a very risky area denial tactic – one which is likely to pose greater risk than benefit. Radiological dispersal does not discriminate between adversary and friendly forces: any territory denied to the adversary will be equally denied to friendly forces. This not only will complicate friendly force operations in the contaminated territory but – depending on the extent and nature of the contamination – can also make the territory uninhabitable following the end of hostilities. Depending on weather patterns and the nature and direction of the radioactive plume, the territories and civilian populations of the attacking state may also come to harm. The risk of contaminating one’s own territory and putting one’s own troops and civilians in harm’s way is highlighted in NATO doctrinal documents on CBRN operations and was raised repeatedly – alongside IHL considerations – by the military and defence experts interviewed for this paper as a major disincentive for the use of military force against or in the vicinity of a nuclear facility. The extent to which self-harm acts as a disincentive would depend on the attacking state’s concern for its own military personnel and civilians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The likely eventuality that radioactive contamination spreads to third states would also risk escalating the conflict by potentially invoking a response from countries not already directly party to it. In June 2023, amid rising concerns over the safety of the ZNPP, a bipartisan resolution was introduced in the US Senate calling for any attack on a nuclear facility that disperses radioactive material to NATO territory to trigger “an immediate response, including the implementation of article V of the North Atlantic Treaty”. The resolution was never adopted and the credibility of threats to invoke Article 5 in such an instance are debatable; however, it does highlight the escalatory threat that may be posed by such an incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An imperfect comparison can be drawn here with the long history of releasing other “dangerous forces” for the purposes of area denial – for example, flooding territory by breaching dams and dykes. Examples of this practice include the piercing of dykes by the Dutch to break the sieges of Alkmaar (1573) and Leiden (1574) during the Eighty Years’ War; China’s breach of the Yellow River Dam (1938) to slow the advance of the Japanese army during Japan’s invasion of China; the Soviet destruction of the Ukrainian DniproHES hydroelectric dam with the aim of slowing German advances during the Second World War; strikes on the Islamic State-controlled Tabqa Dam by US Special Forces, apparently for the purpose of “territory denial” and to destroy Islamic State garrisons in the walls of the dam; and most recently, Russia’s destruction of Ukraine’s Nova Kakhovka dam in June 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are of course notable differences between the risks posed by mass flooding and those posed by the release of radioactive material – namely, the much more persistent nature of radioactive contamination, the greater challenges of shielding oneself from radiation, the greater unpredictability of the direction and extent of a radioactive plume and, perhaps most critically, the psychological impact of radioactive contamination. However, as with radioactive release, mass flooding can also cause significant harm to civilian populations and have catastrophic and long-term economic, ecological and health effects – damaging farmland, destroying livelihoods, polluting groundwater and spreading disease. While past instances of mass flooding for area denial have produced some effects on the battlefield, there is a dearth of examples where its use has proven strategically decisive in a military conflict. In some cases, such tactics instead caused adverse effects for friendly forces. The ability of militaries to adapt, especially in pursuit of existential or other strategically important objectives, and the difficulty of controlling these “dangerous forces” makes them a suboptimal method of area denial. As has been noted elsewhere, conventional means – for instance, mines – can be used instead of CBRN or other dangerous forces to achieve area denial with much lower risks to one’s own forces, territory and populations and with lower risks of political castigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Likely Targets and Effects&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a substance to act as an effective area denial tool, it must be at once hazardous enough to impede safe operation in the contaminated area and persistent enough to stick around long enough to achieve the desired effect. In this way, the considerations on the use of radioactive material for area denial are similar to those for the use of chemical weapons for that purpose. The definitions of “hazardous enough” and “persistent enough” depend on the intended operational or strategic effects, the intended target (personnel or vehicles) and the resilience of the adversary – including shielding capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on these considerations, nuclear facilities across the nuclear fuel cycle that contain nuclear materials could in future be targeted for area denial purposes. Broadly speaking, the radiological hazard posed by attacks on facilities in the operational and back end of the nuclear fuel cycle may pose a greater shielding and decontamination challenge than the predominantly chemical hazard posed by materials released from sites in the front end of the nuclear fuel cycle. However, as discussed earlier, the actual risk depends on many factors, which will dictate the type of shielding that personnel wishing to operate in the affected area would require, as well as the amount of time and types of activities that personnel would be able to perform. For an extensive discussion of the physical and psychological effects of nuclear materials release, see the start of this chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;escalation-of-violence-deterrence-and-coercion&quot;&gt;Escalation of Violence, Deterrence and Coercion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the potential physical effects of assaults on nuclear facilities, and any consequent release of hazardous material, the threat of such attacks can also have an important psychological impact on populations and political leadership. The fear that radioactive release engenders in the popular psyche – discussed in greater detail at the start of this chapter – makes the psychological dimension conducive to weaponisation, particularly when public opinion and morale, or diplomatic pressure, are important for achieving a given objective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combination of the physical, psychological and normative effects of attacks on nuclear facilities means that states may conceive of them as a “half-step” in escalation dynamics between conventional war and the use of nuclear weapons by a nuclear weapons state. This is despite the fact that the effects of nuclear accidents differ considerably from those of nuclear weapons. The conflation of the effects of major nuclear accidents and nuclear weapons detonations sometimes observed in public debate can exacerbate the strategic impact of such threats. Such strikes and threats could be used to signal one’s willingness to escalate a conflict by inflicting – or threatening to inflict – radiological effects on an adversary’s troops, environment and population, without actually resorting to the use of nuclear weapons. The fear of radiological release also means that threats of attacks on nuclear facilities can be used for deterrent and coercive purposes. Threats to the safety of a nuclear site – whether explicit or implied – may be used to deter further escalation by the adversary elsewhere on the front line or away from the battlefield, as a source of leverage in diplomatic negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equally, non-nuclear weapons states may strike – or threaten to strike – the nuclear facilities of an adversary in the absence of a nuclear weapons capability for similar signalling and escalatory logic. Non-nuclear weapons states facing a nuclear-armed adversary may use such threats against the latter’s nuclear sites in an effort to compensate for an imbalance in deterrent capabilities. The ability and willingness to threaten to attack an adversary’s nuclear sites may have a significant effect on the deterrent balance between two non-nuclear weapons states and may help to address imbalances in conventional capabilities. One such attempt by a non-nuclear weapon state to bolster its deterrent capability against another non-nuclear weapon state may have played out during the escalation in violence between Armenia and Azerbaijan in 2020. In a statement from its defence ministry, Baku warned that Yerevan “should keep in mind that our armed forces have advanced missile systems in service, capable of conducting high-precision strikes on the Metsamor nuclear power plant, which may result in a huge disaster for Armenia”. Media commentary on the incident suggested that the threat may have been issued following a miscommunication between the two sides and highlighted the escalatory risk posed by such rhetoric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The possibility of placing adversaries’ nuclear power plants at risk – as a sort of “less apocalyptic” alternative to nuclear weapons deterrence – was raised in public discourse as early as 1978, in an article for Foreign Policy by Chester L Cooper, who was, at the time, assistant director to Oak Ridge Laboratory’s Institute for Energy Analysis. Cooper noted that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A high explosive bomb, when used against a nuclear target, would acquire some of the radioactive attributes of a nuclear bomb (although it obviously would not have the same blast effects). Thus the presence of nuclear power plants in a given country could effectively transform its enemy’s arsenal of conventional bombs into weapons with radioactive fallout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also pointed out that, while some attacks – for instance, those targeting only the electrical system of a nuclear power plant – would likely result in limited consequences that could be mitigated, “no national leader could be confident that an attack would not succeed in destroying the sensitive elements of a nuclear plant”, with catastrophic results. He concluded not only that the proliferation of nuclear power plants would lead to “a vast increase in energy supply for developing nations”, but also that nuclear power generating stations could actually improve relations among countries by introducing a dynamic akin to the concept of mutually assured destruction. Ramberg later built on Cooper’s observations in Nuclear Power Plants as Weapons for the Enemy: An Unrecognised Military Peril, noting that states could threaten to target an adversary’s nuclear facilities in response to being attacked. Ramberg also suggests that nuclear facilities – namely, spent fuel repositories – could be placed along a likely invasion route as part of a country’s defence strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as Ramberg also points out, the parallels of the deterrent, coercive or military effects of nuclear weapons and attacks on nuclear facilities are ultimately limited. The effects of nuclear accidents differ in a number of meaningful ways from those nuclear weapons detonations. For instance, even large nuclear accidents – such as the 1986 Chornobyl disaster – do not produce the fireball and blast waves that cause much of the immediate destruction following a ground burst nuclear weapon detonation. Nuclear weapons detonations also produce an electromagnetic pulse, which can disrupt and damage electrical equipment; this is not present during a nuclear accident. Comparisons between the radiation released from nuclear weapons detonations and nuclear accidents (both immediate radiation and fallout) are more difficult to draw, as in both instances the nature, extent and effects of radiation depend on a range of factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nuclear weapons and attacks on nuclear facilities also differ significantly in terms of their operational and strategic utility and significance. Nuclear weapons play a range of roles in countries’ nuclear doctrines and national security and defence planning, most of which cannot be replicated by radioactive release from a nuclear facility. For one, nuclear facilities are, generally speaking, immovable and therefore cannot be used to hold at risk a range of military, territorial or other targets of an adversary. This is further complicated by the difficulties, discussed above, in determining the scale and direction of any radioactive release from a nuclear facility. The immovability of many nuclear installations also makes them less effective for signalling – which a state may do through the deployment or removal of nuclear-armed delivery systems across its territory. As mentioned earlier, some signalling may nevertheless be possible through attacks on nuclear sites – for instance, the use of limited attacks on a suspected nuclear weapons programme to signal resolve to take military measures against the perceived threat, or an attack resulting in radioactive release to signal a willingness to escalate the conflict outside the strictly conventional realm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critically, just as attacks on nuclear infrastructure present unique psychological challenges and cross certain normative thresholds, so does the use of even low-yield nuclear weapons. Some have argued that, as a result of the non-use of nuclear weapons since 1945 and the devastation that nuclear weapons are understood to reap on society, a taboo has been established on nuclear weapons use. The breaking of this taboo and of the 80 years of non-use would cross a major normative and psychological threshold. Most of the experts that were asked about the existence of a similar taboo on attacks on nuclear facilities felt that a certain level of restraint, or even a conditional taboo on attacks that resulted in radiological release, does exist. However, they did not go as far as to suggest that the normative restraint on attacks on nuclear facilities reached that of nuclear weapons use. One expert that was interviewed also noted that for countries such as Russia – whose population is willing to accept considerable suffering for the pursuit of the state’s strategic objectives – the radiological threat of an attack on a nuclear facility would likely have limited deterrent effect. In fact, it may produce an inverse “rally around the flag” response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nuclear-facilities-on-the-axis-of-advance&quot;&gt;Nuclear Facilities on the Axis of Advance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, this paper has discussed some of the operational and strategic logic that may inform a decision to expressly target nuclear infrastructure. Yet, most militaries, in most circumstances, would not actively pursue such a target – both because of the radiological risks (and associated challenges) that such attacks pose and because of the legal prohibitions and broader normative restrictions on attacking nuclear sites. A number of military and defence experts interviewed for this paper, when asked to consider why a military may be asked to target a piece of nuclear infrastructure, stressed that they saw no justification or operational utility in deliberately targeting a nuclear object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, some of the military and defence experts consulted did assess as feasible a scenario in which a military may need to contest control of a nuclear site – or operate in its vicinity – if such an installation were to be encountered on a route of advance during a wider military operation. For instance, the CEZ, which was occupied by Russian forces in February 2022 when they crossed into Ukraine from Belarus, appears to have come under occupation primarily because it was on the route of attack for the Russian Army on its way to Kyiv. The site offers no benefit as an energy target and – relative to the ZNPP – would not have been the most effective target for the purposes of radioactive release considering its close proximity to the Belarusian border. The case of the CEZ is certainly not the first time that a nuclear installation has found itself on a military’s axis of advance. During the Vietnam war, a nuclear research reactor in Dalat ended up in contested territory and at potential risk from military hostilities, despite there being no indication that the facility was expressly targeted. The threat posed to Slovenia’s Krško nuclear power plant during the Yugoslav Army’s invasion in 1991 also does not seem to have been the result of express targeting of the facility (although overflights of the facility at low altitude by fighter aircraft were perceived as an intentional threat to the plant in subsequent accounts). As the number of nuclear power plants around the world is expected to expand in the coming decades, it will become increasingly likely that militaries will have to reluctantly contest or occupy nuclear facilities – be they power plants, fuel production facilities, or spent fuel storage sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerns over causing a nuclear accident is likely to constrain, complicate and slow a military’s operations in the vicinity of the facility. Should radioactive release occur, those challenges will of course multiply, as discussed in the section on radioactive release for area denial. As described earlier, most modern militaries have access to C-CBRN capabilities with the requisite expertise for conducting operations around facilities that may pose a hazard. However, conducting operations around a nuclear facility – or even occupying a nuclear site – is likely to require a greater number of specialised personnel than what may be available in most militaries, probably requiring operations to be predominantly carried out by unspecialised forces with some C-CBRN support. Furthermore, as already noted, the level of C-CBRN expertise, preparedness and capacity is likely to vary from country to country and may be quite low within some militaries – especially among non-specialist personnel. For instance, the fact that Russian soldiers dug trenches in contaminated soil in the CEZ during their occupation of the site suggests a certain lack of understanding within the ranks of the Russian military of best practices and standards of operation in a CBRN environment. Military activities may also pose an inadvertent risk to nuclear facilities if they include strikes – intentional or accidental – on other parts of a country’s infrastructure (for instance, the energy grid or water supply). Such strikes may not be intended to disrupt the safe operation of nuclear facilities but may nevertheless create nuclear safety risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occupation of a facility also poses a range of challenges for both military and political leadership. Ensuring the safety of an occupied facility would require extensive resources and expertise on nuclear plant operations and nuclear safety. The occupying state would face the challenge of potentially having to maintain nuclear safety in a conflict zone and all of the difficulties that this entails. Political leadership would also need to determine whether and how to manage the occupied facility under existing nuclear safety and security frameworks and who would be responsible for overseeing the operation of the facility in what may still be an active warzone. However, the risk of causing a nuclear safety incident will not always be sufficient to deter a military from contesting the area around a nuclear facility or occupying it, if a military judges that this can be done safely, if the mission is deemed critical enough, or if the threat of radioactive release is not well understood or is disregarded. This was certainly true for the Russian Army, which advanced on both the CEZ and the ZNPP despite the risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-reducing-the-risks-of-military-strikes-on-nuclear-facilities&quot;&gt;II. Reducing the Risks of Military Strikes on Nuclear Facilities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, the author has outlined some of the operational and strategic effects that militaries may pursue in attacking – or threatening to attack – nuclear infrastructure. As indicated, states may perceive a range of threats – as well as operational and strategic opportunities – that could lead them to use military force against or in the vicinity of nuclear sites. As noted in the introduction of this paper, the intention here is not to normalise the use of military force against or near nuclear installations, but to make clear the need to realistically assess the probability and nature of these risks and to prepare for dealing with them. This chapter considers a few approaches for reducing the risk of military attacks on nuclear facilities. In doing so, it examines the likely effectiveness of these approaches in responding to the various drivers of military attacks discussed earlier in this paper, as well as in mitigating against some of the likely consequences of attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risk-reduction measures must account for various trade-offs and resource limitations. Even in the most economically advanced or security-minded states, resources are not unlimited; this is likely to be especially true in the context of a broader military conflict, when already-limited sources must be allocated across a range of defence and security priorities. Furthermore, some preventive and mitigation measures may have unintended consequences that could, in fact, increase other undesirable consequences of attack or make attacks more likely. Additionally, an overly cautious approach to risk management – for instance, foregoing nuclear energy altogether out of a fear of possible military threat – may have other undesirable and unnecessary economic, environmental and political drawbacks. As such, the departure point for any risk-mitigation measures should be a realistic assessment of the precise nature and degree of risk that a given state’s nuclear infrastructure is likely to face from military threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strengthening-existing-prohibitions-norms-and-guidance&quot;&gt;Strengthening Existing Prohibitions, Norms and Guidance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine – and, arguably, before that – an important aspect of the debate on how to reduce military risks to nuclear facilities has focused on whether existing legal prohibitions on attacks are sufficient and whether and how they may be strengthened and expanded. Military and defence experts interviewed for this paper repeatedly noted that Western militaries would not attack nuclear facilities, with IHL considerations and existing restrictions on attacks under the Geneva Conventions repeatedly referenced. This awareness and commitment to existing restrictions is reassuring and suggests that these are likely to be sufficient to prevent attacks from states that are committed to respecting international law. Of course, some states may chose to disregard their IHL obligations or to find ways to justify their actions under IHL – even when such justifications are unconvincing or disingenuous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as the analysis presented in this paper has highlighted, there are instances when military force may be used against, or in the vicinity of, nuclear installations for the pursuit of legitimate military objectives. To ensure that such objectives can be pursued with minimal threat to nuclear safety, to civilians and to the environment, additional clarity and guidance on the operationalisation of existing relevant legal provisions may be useful. These may be developed by individual governments or groups of governments, or by international organisations, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross. Ensuring that these principles and their operationalisation are understood and respected at all ranks of a military force is also critical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussed, a potential scenario in which a military may find itself having to conduct operations around – or directed at – a nuclear facility is one where it encounters a nuclear site on an axis of advance and needs to contest control over or occupy the site. It is unclear to what extent various national nuclear regulators or militaries have thought through their country’s ability to carry out such operations, what procedures may have to be adopted and what stakeholders (military and civil) would need to be engaged to ensure the safe transfer of control of a nuclear site in the course of a military operation. Laying out such operational considerations should be integrated into military and civilian planning well in advance of any military operation that may involve such a scenario. Militaries would also benefit from wargaming possible scenarios in which they may be required to contest territory that hosts a nuclear facility – to develop operational options for doing so safely, assess readiness and identify challenges. For instance, one possible approach may be to quarantine the facility and cut off supply chains to any military units operating in its vicinity. Such an approach, however, must account for the need to continue to allow supplies and personnel to reach the nuclear site itself, so as to ensure its safe operation – a vulnerability which could in turn be weaponised by the military occupying the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, preparing to use force against or near nuclear installations cannot be normalised. Clear demonstrations of political commitments to existing restrictions and norms relating to attacks against nuclear facilities should be pursued to this end. As mentioned earlier, a limited taboo on attacks on nuclear facilities that result in radiological dispersal may exist or be emerging. Any such taboo should be strengthened. This can be done first and foremost by continued non-attack on facilities that may reasonably be expected to result in significant release of radioactive material, and the condemnation of any military action that presents such risks. Individual states may also wish to explicitly reiterate their own commitments to the relevant provisions of the Geneva Conventions in unilateral or multilateral statements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some have also argued that further NAAs, modelled on the India–Pakistan NAA, should be pursued. However, the relevance of the NAA as a model for future agreements is likely to be limited, due to the particular historical, political and security context in which it was concluded. The 1988 Agreement was concluded between two countries with advanced nuclear programmes; India had tested its first nuclear device 14 years earlier, while Pakistan was known to be pursuing a nuclear weapons capability at the time. The mutually perceived vulnerability of the two states, exacerbated by rising bilateral and global tensions but which had not yet escalated to armed confrontation, created the conditions for such a risk-reduction measure. A similar NAA would – of course – not be currently possible between Russia and Ukraine. An Iranian nuclear expert interviewed for this project rejected the possibility of a similar NAA in the Middle East, pointing to the perceived imbalance of vulnerability created by Israel’s undeclared nuclear weapons capability. An Israeli interviewee also rejected the possibility, arguing that Israel faces an existential threat from its regional adversaries and noting the historical propensity of regional actors – including Syria, Iraq and now Iran – to obfuscate their apparent pursuit of nuclear weapons. One possibility might be the conclusion of bilateral or multilateral NAAs between states with friendly relations – for instance, Argentina and Brazil. Such agreements might serve as an example-setting and norm-strengthening exercise; however, the practical effects of such agreements would be limited and their conclusion outside of any clear security need to do so may instead engender suspicion between parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are currently very few international standards for the safe and secure management of a nuclear facility in a warzone or under military occupation. The Seven Indispensable Pillars and Five Concrete Principles for Nuclear Safety and Security articulated by the IAEA since the start of the war in Ukraine offer a useful starting point for establishing best practices for nuclear safety and security in warzones. Yet, they ultimately fall short of offering concrete guidance and processes for nuclear safety and security in armed conflict. The technical guidance document on challenges in the application of the IAEA safety standards and nuclear security guidance during armed conflict (under development by the IAEA at the time of writing) is also expected to draw on existing IAEA guidance. The Agency’s consensus-based approach to decision-making, the need to maintain flexibility of response to address the unique challenges and needs of a given facility or attack scenario, and the general aversion of IAEA member states to any overly prescriptive standards on the operation of their nuclear facilities ultimately limit the Agency from going far beyond providing fairly high-level direction and ultimately drawing on existing nuclear safety documents. This should not, however, preclude individual states from ensuring that their nuclear regulators and operators, emergency response services and militaries have the necessary standards and operational plans in place to both respond to the threat of attack on their nuclear facilities (commensurate with the risk profile) and conduct military operations in the vicinity of nuclear sites in other countries, if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strengthening-passive-and-active-defences&quot;&gt;Strengthening Passive and Active Defences&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One option for reducing the risks of military strikes against nuclear sites may be to strengthen the physical protections of the facilities in question. Increased passive defences could help to reduce the likelihood of damage to systems and equipment – whether intentional or accidental – while also limiting the spread of toxic material should any be released. Decreasing the degree of damage an attacking state may be able to inflict on a given target (or increasing the costs of inflicting meaningful damage) may also act as a disincentive for attacking forces. This is likely to be particularly true when attacks on other, softer, targets may produce similar effects – for example, in instances of attacks carried out for the purpose of disrupting a country’s energy production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most nuclear power plants operating today are already protected by reinforced concrete containment structures, making them challenging, although certainly not impossible, to penetrate. Spent fuel storage normally also benefits from reinforced concrete containment and can withstand substantial force. More broadly, the IAEA requires national regulators to ensure that facilities across the nuclear fuel cycle, including conversion and enrichment sites, benefit from containment structures and other safety measures that are appropriate for a range of assessed risks. Such assessments are normally completed as part of the Design Basis Threat (DBT) process, which requires states to account for such threats as severe weather (including floods and strong winds) as well as terrorist attacks. Threats that fall outside what a nuclear regulator can reasonably be expected to account for are classed as beyond-DBT threats and are generally the responsibility of the state. This would include military attacks and occupation of facilities. Since the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, the need to update IAEA requirements and guides to account for the military threat has been the subject of considerable debate within expert and regulatory communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Constructing thicker containment structures over existing reactors that already benefit from reinforced containment would be a resource-intensive undertaking which would be incommensurate with the risk of an accidental strike and ineffective against an adversary determined to penetrate the reactor core to release radioactive material. Options for strengthening protections of spent fuel may include the construction of additional containment structures, moving dry spent fuel casks inside specially designed facilities (in instances where casks are currently stored outside) or moving storage underground. Conversion and enrichment facilities may also be moved underground or under reinforced containment structures if deemed necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all these cases, additional physical protection would be subject to cost–benefit considerations and would be dependent on the extent and nature of the threat faced by a given state. For instance, it may be reasonable to expect that Ukraine or even Finland would expend the necessary resources to strengthen the containment structures around their wet spent fuel storage facilities to withstand a determined large-scale kinetic strike (if current structures were assessed to be insufficient), considering the Russian threat. Similar measures would seem excessive for Canadian or UK spent fuel storage facilities, which are likely at more significant risk from cyber attack than missile strikes. Beyond-DBT and broader national-level risk assessments must therefore take into account the likelihood of potential military attacks on their nuclear sites by hostile states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the nuclear facilities themselves, states may consider strengthening the physical protections around auxiliary systems and equipment that ensure the safe operation of nuclear facilities and which do not normally benefit from similar levels of protection. As discussed earlier in the paper, in case of a military conflict, an adversary is likely to target this auxiliary infrastructure as part of a campaign to disrupt energy production and distribution. This may include infrastructure for the supply of water to the facility (such as water pipes and pumps) and parts of the power grid supplying and offloading electricity to nuclear plants and substations – namely, power lines and substations. However, such an approach is also not a panacea against a determined attacker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s experience of improving physical protections of electrical substations is instructive. The country has adopted a three-tier approach to the protection of CNI. Varying degrees of protection are offered to facilities depending on the assessed risk profile and size of the potential target, with the use of sandbags, gabions and netting around transformers to protect equipment from UAV attacks, and the construction of T-walls and other cement structures around individual transformers and whole substations to provide defence against missile attack. However, Ukraine’s experience also demonstrates the limits of this approach. The construction of passive defences is likely to be most effective in advance of a war, as such efforts run up against a number of challenges during an active conflict. First, defences – particularly large cement structures – can become costly to construct when resources are likely to already be tight. Resource constraints have reportedly slowed – and, in some instances, halted – Ukrainian construction of larger concrete structures around substations. Second, construction of such defences also takes time and is quite conspicuous, easily detected by an adversary’s reconnaissance. Defences can be destroyed before they are ever completed. Third, adversaries learn to adapt their methods of attack to counter constructed defences. In Ukraine, Russia has reportedly started fuelling its missiles with metal-corroding fuel to penetrate the passive missile defences the Ukrainians built around their substations. Finally, as with the containment structures around nuclear reactors, reinforced concrete structures will only delay and complicate – but not stop – the efforts of a determined adversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the perception that a site is not particularly vulnerable, or that an attack is unlikely to result in significant release of hazardous material, may, in fact, increase the likelihood of it being targeted in some instances. For example, a state may feel that – due to the presence of a reinforced containment structure – it can safely carry out UAV strikes against a nuclear reactor, for instance, to force the facility to shut down and thus stop generating power or to signal resolve to use military force against a suspected proliferation threat. Militaries may also generally be less worried about operating around facilities they perceive to be well-protected, possibly increasing the risk of military force being used near nuclear sites. Such action does, of course, run a high risk of miscalculation and may ultimately result in catastrophic effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;States may also be more willing to carry out counterproliferation attacks against sites which they do not believe pose a serious risk of toxic material release. For example, in conversation with the author, David Deptula – who was the principal attack planner for Operation Desert Storm during the Gulf War, which included attacks on Iraq’s Al-Tuwaitha complex – noted that considerations around the potential for the spread of radioactive material were a factor in targeting decisions. The operation ultimately went ahead, as the risk was deemed to be low because the facility was surrounded by a large sand berm. An Israeli nuclear expert interviewed for the paper, when asked about whether the risk of radioactive release from Iranian nuclear facilities would be likely to be factored into Israeli decision-making on whether to carry out military strikes against Iranian sites, confirmed that such consequences would likely be considered. However, they also noted that – in the case of strikes on enrichment facilities – the threat would be primarily chemical, not radiological, and the fact that some of the sites are underground and most are away from population centres would mean that the actual threat to civilians would be low – seemingly suggesting that this would likely not act as a major inhibitor to a decision to attack. Similarly, states may be incentivised to increase the potential health or political consequences of an attack – for instance, by introducing highly radioactive material into a facility under threat of attack – as a way of deterring attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, any increased passive defence of facilities may be combined with active defence efforts to improve effectiveness against attack. Active defence may include a combination of an increased military ground presence in the vicinity of key sites (either permanent or deployed in response to an active threat) and the deployment of air defence systems. Ground forces must include a meaningful C-CBRN presence and specialised forces trained to operate in complex environments – ideally, in sufficient numbers to not only provide advice to the units that may have to defend the plant but to play a leading role in any defensive operation. The same should be true for any military forces expecting to have to advance on territory where nuclear facilities and material may be present. As has been reiterated throughout this paper, military operations directed at or in the vicinity of nuclear installations should not be normalised; however, militaries need to be prepared to contest legitimate military objectives in the vicinity of nuclear installations in a way that minimises the risk of causing a nuclear safety incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air defence systems are likely to be the most effective active defence measure that a country can take to defend its nuclear sites. They are generally deployed near nuclear facilities by states likely to be at particularly acute risk of strikes on their nuclear infrastructure. Calls for additional Patriot systems and the perception that this is the only way to ensure the protection of the country’s nuclear facilities came up repeatedly in the author’s interviews with nuclear operators and policymakers in Ukraine. However, the provision of effective air defence for nuclear facilities is not a panacea and must consider a number of factors. Air defence systems are costly to field and limited in number, even for well-resourced militaries. As such, other potential targets – such as major population centres, key military assets and other CNI – may be prioritised over nuclear sites for air defence allocation, particularly if large-scale radioactive release from an attacked facility is deemed unlikely. Furthermore, providing point defence for individual facilities is complicated by the fact that a facility might be at risk from a variety of threats, which may include guided or unguided systems and everything from ballistic missiles to low-altitude cruise missiles and UAVs. Each threat requires different air defence capabilities. As such, effective air defence for nuclear facilities needs to be layered and distributed and is therefore likely simply to form part of a country’s broader air defence system. Ultimately, as with containment structures, air defence is not a guaranteed solution for defending against a determined adversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, as with increased passive protection, strengthening the active defence of a nuclear facility may risk having a counterproductive effect by increasing the likelihood that the site is targeted or that threats of attack may be used for deterrent or coercive purposes. Placing military personnel or equipment in the vicinity of a nuclear site for defence of the facility may draw fire on those positions, thereby also putting the safety of the facility at risk. States may also argue that the placement of military units or systems near a nuclear site by an adversary is intended to grant protection to the military assets, rather than the nuclear infrastructure – whether or not that is actually the case. The argument might then be made that the facility has lost its protections under the Geneva Conventions. This would be an erroneous reading of international law if an attack on the facility is expected to result in significant harm to civilian populations, yet this would likely not stop a determined attacker from making the argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;redundancy-and-distribution&quot;&gt;Redundancy and Distribution&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minimising the effects – and, by extension, the incentives – of attacks on nuclear facilities may be achieved by increasing redundancy in systems and distributing potential targets. Increasing the number of targets that need to be destroyed or seriously damaged for an attacking state to achieve a desired effect may help to disincentivise attacks on nuclear sites by tilting the cost–benefit calculus for the attacking state. Not only does the attacking state need to expend greater resources for a given attack, but also smaller facilities can be reconstructed quicker than larger ones and redundant systems can continue operating by relying on parts of the system that escaped attack. Furthermore, the scale of force needed to eliminate a highly redundant and distributed system poses a greater risk of the conflict escalating beyond what may be an acceptable threshold for the attacking state than a single strike on a centralised facility. Such an approach is likely to be particularly effective against military strikes carried out for counterproliferation or energy disruption purposes, when the intention is to have an impact on a programme or system as a whole, rather than to release (or threaten release of) toxic material – which can conceivably be achieved by attacking a single site. The practical challenges and escalatory risks of using military force to meaningfully degrade the Iranian nuclear programme, as well as the system-wide assault on Ukraine’s energy system (see Box 3), demonstrate the defensive value of decentralisation and redundancy well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-3-decentralisation-and-redundancy-of-ukraines-energy-grid&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 3. Decentralisation and Redundancy of Ukraine’s Energy Grid&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In response to Russia’s attacks on the country’s energy grid since the start of the full-scale invasion, the need to decentralise Ukraine’s energy system has become abundantly clear and is being prioritised. The use of emergency generators by businesses and private citizens has been one example of decentralisation – an organic adaptation by Ukrainian society to the disruption of the main energy system. But top-down initiatives to speed up decentralisation are also in place. The Ukrainian government is offering incentives to civilians, businesses and housing cooperatives for the installation of small-capacity local power generation. The US has also been working with municipalities across Ukraine to provide small and medium gas-powered cogeneration units.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;As the Ukrainian grid is reconstructed, the focus appears to be on the construction of greater numbers of smaller capacity energy generation systems. The greater integration of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind into the Ukrainian grid is also being pursued, both to meet European green energy generation standards and to increase resilience in the grid, which has historically relied heavily on nuclear power and – to a lesser extent – coal, gas and oil. Independent experts have also stressed the benefits of diversification and decentralisation for ensuring the resilience of Ukraine’s energy grid, through the introduction of microgrids, small modular gas turbines and renewable energy sources (solar and wind) as well as the use of batteries for energy storage.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relatively large generating capacity of nuclear power plants contributes to the centralisation – and therefore decreases redundancy – of an electrical grid. As mentioned earlier in this paper, this may make nuclear plants particularly attractive targets for incapacitation by an adversary aiming to disrupt energy production. Decentralisation in nuclear energy generation could be achieved by eventually phasing out traditional gigawatt-scale nuclear power plants in favour of the deployment of small modular reactors (SMRs). SMRs have generating capacities of less than 300 megawatts and are physically smaller in size. They may therefore be used to establish more decentralised grids while also being easier to build physical protections around or even build underground. SMRs can be designed to operate with accident tolerant fuels and to be passively cooled, meaning they would not require electricity to pump water for fuel cooling (although some non-SMR reactors may also be able to integrate similar features in their designs). However, the transition from traditional gigawatt reactors to SMRs will take time. SMR technology has yet to be deployed and many of today’s operational large reactors are due to continue operation for several decades, with many more being constructed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, while the decentralisation of nuclear programmes may decrease some risks of military strikes, it may exacerbate others. A greater number of smaller nuclear facilities distributed across a country might provide a larger target set for states that mean to intentionally target nuclear facilities – for instance, for area denial or coercive/deterrent purposes. It may also increase the likelihood of militaries coming into contact with a nuclear facility in the course of an operation, thereby exacerbating risks of unintentional damage to nuclear infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;whole-of-society-resilience&quot;&gt;Whole-of-Society Resilience&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important part of the effort to defend against, disincentivise and mitigate the consequences of attacks and threats of attack on nuclear facilities should be the strengthening of whole-of-society resilience against such attacks and threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such lines of effort can help to reduce the effects – and, by extension, some of the incentives – of military strikes on nuclear facilities across most of the drivers discussed in this paper. However, they are likely to have the greatest impact on reducing the effectiveness and consequences of attacks aimed at inciting public and political anxiety and/or degrading public and leadership morale – namely, energy disruption and coercive attacks or threats of attack. As discussed earlier, while disruption of nuclear energy generation may in part be intended to undermine military production as one of its objectives, it is more often than not meant to degrade the morale of the civilian population by direct denial of reliable energy and disruption of industrial and economic activity. The use of attacks – or threats of attack – for deterrent and coercive purposes may be primarily targeted at a country’s leadership; yet, the latter is likely to be influenced by public fears and demands (at least in a democracy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasing resilience within the population for dealing with the consequences of attacks on nuclear sites, or nuclear safety incidents more generally, may entail a few different lines of effort. This can include broader dissemination among the general population, local governments and emergency responders of information on dealing with the immediate risks of low-level radiation and chemical hazards (including sheltering in place without forced ventilation and simple decontamination measures such as the removal of contaminated clothing). Communities should also be prepared to deal with widespread and prolonged energy disruption, potentially with limited support from central government if the disruption is widespread across a country. This may include ensuring that communities – as well as individual households and businesses, where logistically feasible – are equipped with independent power generation and water sanitation capabilities. Promoting basic nuclear safety education – among both the public and political decision-makers – might help to combat susceptibility to panic and misinformed responses and improve resilience to the threat. It may also be appropriate to expand the number of medical service providers in a country that are trained to deal with large-scale radiological dispersal, to ensure that medical facilities outside of just specialised centres are able to provide support in case of a large emergency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with other risk-mitigation measures, it is important to ensure that public awareness-raising, preparedness and resilience efforts are commensurate with the actual risk faced by a state. Otherwise, one runs the risk of alarmism, inciting unnecessary anxiety among the population. This is likely to result in undesirable consequences, as discussed earlier in this paper. However, as Brooke Rogers has noted, communication of risks to the public need not necessarily result in a panicked public response and fears of the potential for the latter should not preclude efforts to responsibly and thoughtfully engage with the public on this subject. Avoiding alarmism and panic among the population requires the careful formulation of risk-communication strategies. As others have noted elsewhere, risk communication on CBRN threats must prioritise establishing trust between government and the public. This requires the formulation of a clear and unified message, an honest articulation of both what is known andwhat remains unknown, and actionable instructions on what measures to take. Ensuring that external-facing versions of national-level risk assessments – such as the UK’s National Risk Register – are made available and socialised in condensed and easily-digestible formats to the general population will help to socialise the risks at an appropriate level. To ensure effectiveness, communication on potential nuclear safety or energy disruption risks should not be restricted to crisis scenarios. Thoughtfully developed communication strategies should allow governments to sensitise populations to the nature of the risk and to appropriate risk-mitigation strategies at various stages – not just at the time of an acute crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another key aspect of raising societal resilience should be efforts to counter disinformation and misinformation which may be used to weaponise future nuclear safety incidents. Such efforts are particularly important in response to the rising prevalence of the broader weaponisation of disinformation by countries such as Russia and China. The unintentional spread of misinformation can have equally pernicious effects. For instance, frequent comparisons in media – and even sometimes by political leadership – between possible worst-case scenarios at the ZNPP and the 1986 Chornobyl accident are inaccurate and risk inciting panic among the general public and decision-makers. Such reactions are highly detrimental to sensible policymaking, as they grant Russia outsized leverage to practise extortion by threatening the facility’s safety. Similar disinformation and misinformation tactics might be leveraged to exacerbate the deterrent and coercive impact of threats against nuclear facilities in other contexts – for instance, in a potential future conflict between China and Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has brought public and policy discussion on the risks that military activity poses to nuclear installations to the fore. Ukraine’s case is, in many ways, unique. However, nuclear installations have been targets of military attack throughout the history of nuclear weapons and nuclear energy; they are likely to face similar risks in the future. While the use of military force against or in the vicinity of nuclear installations should not be normalised, considering the operational and strategic logic behind such military activity – as well as its likely consequences – can help political and military leadership prepare to defend against related threats and mitigate risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has aimed to contribute to ongoing efforts on the topic of nuclear safety in armed conflict by improving understanding of the strategic and operational drivers for the use of military force against and near nuclear installations. These include: counterproliferation; energy disruption; area denial; efforts to generate escalatory, coercive and deterrent effects; and military operations around or at a nuclear facility encountered on the axis of advance. As the number of nuclear installations around the world is expected to grow, militaries, national and international policymakers and regulators need to consider the possibility that militaries may increasingly run the risk of encountering and having to operate or contest control of nuclear sites in the course of military operations. Militaries that are determined to respect the principles of IHL and the safety of civilians and the environment more broadly, but which may find themselves in such situations, should have the necessary guidance and tools to pursue legitimate military objectives safely. At the same time, countries should be prepared to protect and ensure the nuclear safety of nuclear installations that may be targeted by states that do not share a similar respect for IHL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper has put forward a number of considerations and recommendations that may be helpful to informing ongoing efforts within multilateral organisations, among policymakers and in militaries for reducing the risks that military activity may pose to nuclear installations. These include: identifying opportunities to strengthen effective implementation of existing restrictions on attacks on nuclear facilities and reiterating political commitments to respecting these restrictions; considering options for passive and active defence of facilities and auxiliary systems during active conflict, including through the deployment of layered and distributed air defence and specialised C-CBRN ground capabilities; increasing redundancy and decentralisation of nuclear installations and related networks; and improving whole-of-society resilience to nuclear safety incidents, including through efforts to raise levels of emergency preparedness, risk awareness and education on nuclear safety among the public and political leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these risk-mitigation measures, of course, has to compete for limited resources, especially in the instance of an ongoing military conflict. Each also needs to account for unintended consequences, which may, in fact, increase the likelihood and consequences of attacks on nuclear sites in some instances. Thoughtful management of risk and corresponding trade-offs requires an understanding of the motivations for which an adversary may attack a given facility, to appropriately and effectively address the incentives for a potential attack. Considering which consequences of an attack are of greatest concern and the best approaches to mitigate them also helps with the prioritisation of risk-management efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

Losing MCC’s capabilities cedes ground to China.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) notified the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) that it would “shutter” the agency, instructing the MCC to terminate all its compact and threshold agreements with partner countries, terminate all contracts, and fire or retire its staff within 90 days. While this may seem aligned with President Trump’s executive order (EO) pausing U.S. international assistance to reevaluate aid effectiveness, the MCC does foreign investment, not foreign aid. Instead of shuttering, the administration can easily reform the MCC to meet its goals and eliminate wasteful spending. But shuttering the MCC will hinder—not help—better aligning investment with American interests and cost more than it saves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MCC’s ability to make deals via bilateral country compacts is unique in the U.S. government and ideal for advancing administration goals. The MCC method of developing investment packages provides tremendous political leverage with governments, and the programs have solid evidence of effectiveness. Terminating the MCC’s compacts and programs will provide China and other U.S. adversaries diplomatic and economic wins while leaving blighted, half-built infrastructure scarring both the landscape and minds of former U.S. partner countries and their citizens for a generation. If the Trump administration wants to reorganize and eliminate the MCC as an independent agency, at a minimum, it should transfer its capabilities and personnel, especially in blended finance, to the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) and allow it to administer existing compacts, agreements, and contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DFC already struggles to process its current transaction workload, and it lacks the ability to commit to contractually obligated disbursements. Eliminating the MCC without transferring its capabilities and qualified personnel will do the opposite of derisking engagement with developing countries and create unnecessary hardship and resentment, especially given how much effort developing countries invest in getting an MCC compact. Rather than shuttering the MCC, the administration has an opportunity to reassess the role of the agency in advancing an “America First” agenda and further moving international development assistance away from just “gifting” funds. To maximize the MCC’s value, the Trump administration should enhance its mission under the existing charter to better fit America First priorities by building on the agency’s core strengths—country ownership, conditional and performance-based funding, and a rigorous, evidence-driven model—while addressing procedural constraints that limit its agility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The administration can modify the MCC’s program parameters to prioritize investments in the national interest by adjusting the agency’s long compact development timelines, limited field presence, and risk aversion, all of which reduce its responsiveness and limit its untapped potential to engage with the private sector, particularly American businesses. These barriers, largely due to the complexity of the MCC’s current procurement process and timeline, can be addressed mostly without significant changes to its legislative charter. At the same time, the administration should work with Congress to update the charter for the modern era, including adding a provision to buy more American goods and services. Targeted reforms to improve the compact and threshold program development process, increase flexibility, shorten feedback loops, and modernize measurement tools would amplify the MCC’s value, identify opportunities for U.S. investment, and increase collaboration with co-financiers without compromising its credibility in some of the regions of the world most vital to American interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the first Trump administration selected many of the current MCC compact countries precisely for their strategic importance. The United States has spent years courting Nepal away from China’s orbit, and abandoning the country now would irreparably harm the United States’ reputation in the fraught neighborhood between China and India. Cote d’Ivoire provides one of the last remaining drone bases in Africa to counter ISIS. The Pacific Island states of Kiribati and the Solomon Islands lie astride trade routes and the undersea cables powering the digital economy; deserting them would allow China to ring-fence a close U.S. ally, Australia. Zambia anchors part of the critical Lobito Corridor for mines and minerals in Central and Southern Africa. Instead of abruptly terminating compacts and agreements that the first Trump and other administrations carefully put in place, this administration can preserve both diplomatic and financial capital with targeted reforms at the MCC or by transferring some of its specific capabilities to the DFC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-unique-value-of-the-mcc&quot;&gt;The Unique Value of the MCC&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MCC takes a unique approach that focuses on poverty reduction by creating economic growth through an evidence-based approach. Unlike other development organizations, the MCC executes a rigorous and transparent selection process for potential partner governments, providing eligibility-based funding to large-scale infrastructure or other high-priority growth sectors, all codeveloped and codified in a “compact” with recipient countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This government-to-government collaborative model directly involves local communities in project planning and execution, fostering national ownership (and therefore sustainability) of the projects while providing the United States with high levels of diplomatic leverage and influence. Future assistance and investment are always contingent on the terms in the compact and on a country’s implementation and policy performance. The time-bound nature of compacts, with clear start and end dates, also prevents them from becoming self-perpetuating, never-ending obligations. Because of this co-development process and commitment to understanding recipient country needs built around clear milestones, the MCC has a global reputation for credibility and impact in the countries where it has operated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MCC’s data- and evidence-driven programs focus on measurable outcomes, transparency, and long-term impact. The agency’s structure, unencumbered by mandates, budgetary line items, and reporting requirements, should allow the MCC to move efficiently while maintaining greater maneuverability. In practice, however, the MCC has a single-track, rigid approach to compact development, with a heavily defined process resulting in a three-to-five-year preparation period. The administration might modify this self-imposed process and create a dual-track approach that provides greater diplomatic leverage, ensuring that programs are developed and agreed upon in an accelerated fashion (e.g., 90–180 days) in direct alignment with U.S. geopolitical interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;immediate-reforms&quot;&gt;Immediate Reforms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MCC has significant room to evolve within its existing legislative charter and mandate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the Trump administration can revise the MCC’s internal processes for program development and the application and interpretation of scorecard metrics—adjusting or adding additional metrics more focused on America First factors (e.g., critical supply chains, minerals, and return on investment, or ROI) while retaining metrics for effective governance and management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do so, the MCC should prioritize flexibility, agility, and diplomatic leverage by adapting proven methods from the private sector for rapidly developing agreements and programs (e.g., “lean startup” methodology), which could shrink program development and due diligence in specific cases from three to five years to 90–180 days (or less).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the MCC’s flexible, data-driven model that supports country-led development has earned bipartisan trust in Congress, it has untapped potential to enhance U.S. diplomatic influence in a post-USAID era and in active collaboration with the DFC. The credibility of the MCC’s selection process reliably signals U.S. support to allies and emerging partners, and the compact model has the potential to retain greater diplomatic leverage because of its inherently contingent nature, wherein the agency can include provisions within the compact linked to diplomatic priorities but only if compacts are agreed upon within the life of a presidential administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of these reforms, the Trump administration can make the MCC engage the U.S. private sector earlier in compact development to live up to Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s call to make America more prosperous. Likewise, the MCC can also resolve policy-level decisions around scoring methodologies, compact allocation, or internal staffing and procurement flexibility within the agency’s current framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the Trump administration can adjust how the MCC evaluates which projects it funds by integrating national security or commercial impact into its economic rate of return (ERR) analysis. It can also modify the weighting or structure of scorecards, including the addition of a dual-track system, allowing simpler, more easily developed and verified programs to proceed while more complex programs are being finalized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the Trump administration should continue to grow its focus on hard infrastructure investment and broaden the structure of its sector-specific or corridor-based regional initiatives to include more sectors that align with America First priorities, such as developing natural resources, which the Biden administration effectively excluded from consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, the MCC should become the “investment origination and project preparation arm” of the DFC to create deals and reduce bottlenecks for U.S. strategic interests. This would require effective coordination, including the formation of joint DFC-MCC deal teams and private sector opportunity analysis to pick sectors with the most investment potential. It would also require countries to commit to further reforms or to facilitate U.S. investments. In this context, the DFC should use the MCC to build the trust and relationships necessary to cocreate more sustainable investments in these countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new approach to cocreating compacts would also allow for strategic alignment among several U.S. government entities looking for greater U.S. strategic investment globally. For example, the MCC, DFC, and Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM Bank) could collaborate on large-scale infrastructure projects. The MCC could facilitate enabling institutional and policy elements as well as initial investment analysis to enhance the DFC’s returns and ability to engage in a project based on its model. Further, given that the MCC can grant monies, it could take a portion of the capital stack of a mezzanine financing structure and absorb the pieces that do not meet the DFC’s ROI requirements, thereby allowing a structured trade project to proceed. The EXIM Bank could help crowd in U.S. companies with their financing supported by both the MCC’s grants and the DFC’s capital. While narrower in scope and focus from traditional compacts, this would also enable less complex compact design through a collaborative one-stop shop for financing and investing, improving America’s ability to counter competitors already aggressively investing in projects. Ultimately, this could easily lead to the merging of the DFC and MCC, in whole or in part, saving money and improving coordination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifth, the MCC should stop shying away from “third compacts.” Congressional stakeholders in the past have sought to limit the executive by capping MCC compacts to one or two per country. While the intent of not continuing failed investments should continue, the MCC should create standards for countries seeking a third compact. These criteria would allow continued engagement with countries that the president has decided provide a strong economic and strategic rationale for ongoing U.S. commercial engagement. This would also enable the MCC to better support the DFC, leveraging transactions for investment opportunities and deal origination on the ground and securing U.S. interests in strategic sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last, MCC leadership must foster a culture that supports calculated risk-taking. Risk aversion is deeply embedded in the MCC’s structure and culture, which constrains its ability to engage in more complex environments, larger-scale projects, or investments in strategic sectors. While individual staff may be willing to take bigger risks, the institutional culture prioritizes caution, fearing failure and reputational damage. The transformative, high-impact economic growth outcomes and projects most likely to provide political leverage will be rare if MCC leadership remains confined to low-risk environments. The MCC should focus on building a portfolio of viable and attractive investments, in partnership with the DFC, that advance U.S. strategic goals and create economic opportunity in MCC countries for both local and U.S. interests (including infrastructure investment, trade, supply chain security, market development, and employment).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;structural-reforms&quot;&gt;Structural Reforms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certain structural shifts would require congressional authorization, starting with expanding the pool of eligible countries. Under current law, the MCC can only operate in low- and lower-middle-income countries, limiting its reach and constricting its ability to coordinate with the DFC, which uses different eligibility criteria. In addition, creating a statutory national security waiver—allowing the MCC to work in countries that may not meet traditional governance benchmarks but that serve critical U.S. interests—would also require congressional approval. Congress should also consider expanding the MCC’s core financing model beyond grants to add blended finance options, ideally aligned with DFC mechanisms. Likewise, extending compact timelines beyond the current five-year structure would add administrative flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;selection-process&quot;&gt;Selection Process&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MCC’s country selection process should undergo significant changes to align with U.S. strategic interests to (1) address great power competition, (2) better align with U.S. economic interests, and (3) address critical regional supply chains. Much of this can be done without legislative changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better address great power competition and U.S. economic interests, the MCC should enhance its selection metrics. Historically, the MCC’s selection process emphasized “hard hurdles” like governance and corruption. The MCC should augment its metrics to incorporate new indicators that capture the growing importance of sectors like digital infrastructure, critical minerals, and critical supply chains for goods such as technology, pharmaceuticals, and natural resources. This would enable engagement with the U.S. private sector and international allies to help MCC countries improve their economic position and governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Congress could allow for a national security waiver that allows the MCC to partner with countries where projects have the ability to meet U.S. strategic interests despite scorecard shortcomings. In parallel, implementing a dual-tiered scorecard system, with a “gold status” for countries with strong governance and a “bronze status” for those that may not meet all criteria but hold strategic significance, would allow the MCC to extend support without compromising on governance standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States’ foreign policy challenges and interests increasingly cross borders. The MCC can help protect multi-country strategic supply chains by using some of its money for regional, not country-to-country, grants. Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) increasingly seek regional agreements to align their economic priorities with global demands in sectors like mining, digital infrastructure, energy, agriculture, pharmaceuticals, and ports—industries driving development and central to global supply chains and U.S. strategic interests. Focusing on interconnected programs—like the one mirroring the Lobito Corridor to better connect resources in Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Zambia to U.S. markets—would unlock commercial opportunity. Doing so requires Congress to revise eligibility criteria and the MCC to revise its selection criteria so that projects can be implemented in strategic sectors. The MCC’s current approach to regional compacts, however, suffers from several execution weaknesses. It should learn from these lessons and improve its ability to deploy regional compacts to support cross-border investments and transactions. For example, rather than create cumbersome and complex administrative arrangements through a full regional compact, the MCC could use the Zambia compact to support the Lobito Corridor through cross-border investments in countries that do not meet MCC criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;measuring-return-on-investment&quot;&gt;Measuring Return on Investment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration should assess the economic benefits of projects from both the perspective of the partner countries and the United States. Currently, the MCC primarily employs ERRs to compare a project’s benefits to its costs, requiring a minimum 10 percent threshold for investment. The MCC should develop a complementary measure of ROI for the United States to demonstrate how the MCC aligns with partner-country growth and with U.S. strategic and economic interests. This could include metrics like expanded access for U.S. firms, strengthened supply chains, and increased geopolitical leverage. The MCC should convene private and public sector economists to design an updated ROI formula that aligns with the administration’s “safer, stronger, more prosperous” pillars. Integrating an American ROI framework would align with the MCC’s commitment to ensuring that U.S. taxpayers receive a substantial ROI in international development and help the agency better communicate its value to the American people and their elected representatives in Congress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;involving-the-private-sector&quot;&gt;Involving the Private Sector&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Integrating the U.S. private sector earlier and more frequently into development projects, such as during geographic selection and design, would better align initiatives with U.S. strategic goals and local needs. Engaging U.S. small businesses offers specific value, as they often create scalable business models and serve as conduits for innovation and investment from global technology companies. Focusing on U.S. strengths, particularly in technology and innovation, by collaborating with U.S. small businesses and tech giants like Google, Amazon Web Services, Visa, MasterCard, Cisco, and Intel can drive technological advancement in developing nations while generating employment opportunities in the United States and in local economies. Leveraging corporate soft power, particularly in promoting meritocracy, can enhance global influence and strengthen strategic partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure the involvement of U.S. private sector interests in the long-term success of development projects, partnerships and grants should be structured to require crowding in follow-on investments from companies and investors. Adopting public-private partnership (PPPs) models (e.g., build-operate-transfer, leases, and concessions) can be highly effective, as they involve private entities in financing, constructing, and operating infrastructure and other economic assets for a specified period before transferring ownership, ensuring a balance of interests between the public and private sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enhancing coordination between government agencies, the MCC, and the private sector is essential for streamlining project implementation, addressing regulatory challenges, and crowding in blended finance. Educating U.S. companies about international bidding processes and involving them early to help shape projects can ensure they can effectively bid, offering better value and driving competition. Early collaboration with U.S. industry associations (e.g., chambers of commerce and trade associations) would create platforms for gathering feedback and tailoring MCC projects to better align with market objectives. Adjusting project criteria and speeding up development processes will help attract private investment and align funding with the private sector’s need for quicker returns on investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;procurement-reform-life-cycle-costs-and-buying-american&quot;&gt;Procurement Reform, Life-Cycle Costs, and Buying American&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Partner governments often prefer working with U.S. firms but are constrained by procurement rules or a lack of early engagement. A soft “Buy American” preference, with set-aside criteria for American small businesses, modeled after existing practices in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), could increase U.S. participation without undermining competition or local capacity building. Leveraging tools like non-reimbursable grants could de-risk investments, reduce financial burdens on partner countries, and further incentivize U.S. companies, advancing U.S. strategic and economic interests while preserving the MCC’s commitment to high standards and locally owned development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MCC should also address the inefficiencies stemming from the inherently distributed nature of procurement within individual Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) programs. Instead, the MCC should publish a consolidated business forecast for all MCA projects and house it prominently on its website to improve transparency and make opportunities more accessible, especially for American firms. Complementing procurement reform, the MCC should complete its transition to life-cycle cost analysis across its programs. This would move procurement beyond upfront pricing to consider the total cost of ownership, including maintenance, energy use, and long-term performance while avoiding short-term decisions that lead to unsustainable or low-quality infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lessons-learned-for-broader-international-development&quot;&gt;Lessons Learned for Broader International Development&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;apolitical-compact-with-local-buy-in-and-cocreation&quot;&gt;Apolitical Compact with Local Buy-In and Cocreation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than imposing predesigned U.S. programs, the MCC collaborates with partner countries from the outset to jointly identify development priorities, design interventions, and set measurable goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MCC’s use of time-bound, apolitical compacts that are cocreated with partner governments offers a strong model for broader U.S. development efforts. These agreements are intentionally insulated from short-term political pressures, allowing development investments to remain focused on evidence-based priorities rather than shifting political agendas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cocreation fosters strong local ownership, ensuring that investments align with national priorities and address context-specific challenges. Positioning governments as active participants and not passive recipients makes them more likely to contribute their own resources and remain committed to implementation after U.S. involvement ends. As a result, the United States generates diplomatic leverage to directly counter the influence of China’s Belt and Road Initiative. This model offers a blueprint for other development agencies to develop projects embedded in local systems that will yield lasting impacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;intra--and-interagency-coordination-with-the-dfc-and-other-us-government-entities&quot;&gt;Intra- and Interagency Coordination with the DFC and Other U.S. Government Entities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Central coordination, posting, and reporting systems across agencies would increase transparency, efficiency, and private sector engagement. It is critical to include the DFC in the early stages of compact design and scoping to ensure alignment of strategic and investment priorities. This system would create a competitive market for development contracting by allowing local and international firms to see what projects are open for bidding through a centralized business forecast spanning the whole international development sector, including the Department of State, MCC, EXIM, DFC, and the Trade and Development Agency. This approach lowers barriers to entry and ensures greater predictability across projects, improving cost-effectiveness and reducing opportunities for opaque contracting practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;blended-finance&quot;&gt;Blended Finance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blended finance—combining public, private, and philanthropic capital to fund development and stimulate investment—offers the potential to scale the MCC’s impact and attract private investment and philanthropy. However, blended finance has remained relatively niche, and efforts to scale it have fallen short because of the highly bespoke nature of blended finance transactions to date. Scale requires standardization, but what works for philanthropic actors, driven by mission and risk tolerance, rarely aligns with the needs of commercial investors, who operate with different timelines, risk thresholds, and expectations for returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MCC and the U.S. government could make better use of blended finance by addressing several cultural, procedural, and partnership barriers. Culturally, the U.S. government is accustomed to being the rule-maker, not the rule-taker, when it comes to financing deals. This, combined with desired requirements from other donors and investors, has kept blended finance models bespoke and limited in scale. Achieving scale requires a move toward standardization. The U.S. government and MCC should leverage their convening power to bring interested parties together and set standards, aiming for a “HUD-1 for blended finance,” with standard terms applicable to multiple transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, the MCC could play a convening and standardizing role in the use of concessional finance transactions, including zero-interest loans and reimbursable grants. Right now, multiple entities, including the DFC and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, have different rules on the use of these forms of concessional finance. The MCC could lead the charge, both within the U.S. government and with allied governments, to conduct a rapid review of the MCC’s own rules, the FAR, and related rules and regulations with foreign governments and large philanthropic donors to identify barriers and make appropriate recommendations. The MCC could also lead the charge in accelerating coordination with donor-advised funds (DAFs), a growing pool of philanthropic capital relatively untouched for blended finance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MCC should embrace a more flexible “parallel play” approach, where public and private entities operate alongside one another, each bringing their comparative advantage to a shared objective. By co-creating tailored financial solutions on a case-by-case basis, the MCC can better mobilize private capital without slowing deal-making or compromising its development mandate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the MCC evolves to look at how to counter China and other malign actors, it will increasingly need to take a regional view. The MCC should develop a systematic way of working with regional development banks at scale, as they rapidly add capacity without adding cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;prerequisites-for-commercial-investment&quot;&gt;Prerequisites for Commercial Investment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large-scale development projects, especially infrastructure with national security implications (e.g., an Arctic port requiring radar systems), or those that require having foundational infrastructure in place (e.g., roads, electricity, subsea cables, and other enablers) are often too risky and costly for commercial investors to handle alone. These investments require high upfront costs, long timelines for returns, or the inclusion of military assets, which includes incumbent added costs and political sensitivities that exceed typical private sector risk tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make them viable, public subsidies, new financing models, or hybrid approaches with targeted risk-sharing are necessary to cover non-commercial costs. Public actors, such as governments and philanthropists, must step in early to de-risk these investments and create the necessary conditions to attract private sector capital. There may be some MCC and DFC projects with national security implications, and those should receive support to determine financial risks. However, a risk management approach needs to be in place to ensure commercial viability and sovereign financial prudence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration and Congress should work together to reform—not shutter—the MCC. The costs of closing it far outweigh the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, the MCC drives foreign investment, not foreign aid, and if implemented, these reforms will help it even more effectively provide good value for money. If, however, the administration chooses to shutter the agency, it should keep the best elements of the MCC model and transfer its compacts, agreements, contracts, and select qualified personnel to the DFC. This would enhance the U.S. government’s ability to deliver for the American people by retaining the MCC’s strengths—country ownership, performance-based and conditional funding, data-driven and transparent discipline, and apolitical delivery. But to stay effective, the MCC model must embrace calculated risks and better align with U.S. economic and geopolitical goals. This includes refining its approach to better engage private capital, work regionally, and deliver sustainable value to both partner countries and the United States while updating how it selects countries and measures impact. With targeted reforms and a renewed focus, the MCC model—regardless of whether applied at the MCC or DFC—can drive U.S. global leadership and offer valuable lessons for the broader development community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and the world are safer, stronger, and more prosperous with the MCC model than without it.&lt;/p&gt;

Both technologies hold promise to transform the financial services industry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Financial services are a powerful driver of human well-being, enabling businesses to operate and raise capital and households to save, manage economic shocks, and invest in essential needs like education and health. However, across many developing countries, access to affordable and comprehensive financial services—which are key to promoting financial inclusion—remains out of reach for many people. A series of infrastructural, economic, regulatory, and social barriers limit the participation of millions of individuals in financial services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technological solutions have the potential to help overcome some of these barriers by lowering costs, promoting competition in traditionally concentrated markets, and better serving consumers’ varied and unique needs. The introduction of mobile phones in the early 2000s removed the need to use physical banking services and simplified onerous identification processes, granting access to payments and credit for many individuals who were previously unbanked. As a result of mobile telephony, today 3 billion people (57 percent of mobile subscribers) use mobile financial services worldwide. In addition, mobile telephony contributed to 5.8 percent of global GDP in 2024, and is projected to account for 8.4 percent of global GDP by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, innovative developments have come from cloud, mobile, and social technology. Developing countries have mostly seized the opportunity to build and strengthen their own digital public infrastructure, including by innovating with fast payments systems. However, given that those systems still rely on legacy infrastructure, the benefits behind fast payment systems have been primarily contained to domestic markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the next wave of borderless and truly digital innovations will likely be driven by emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and distributed ledger technology (DLT). Both technologies hold promise to transform the financial services industry by enabling faster cross-border payments, expanding access to credit, improving financial markets, and broadening retail investment opportunities. These market-based solutions allow for faster, safer, and lower-cost services, empowering individuals to claim a sense of financial autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI can streamline account opening and credit, as well as help deliver personalized financial advice and products tailored to individual needs. This technology can support individuals who either lack the skills or the experience to fully benefit from traditional financial services. Separately, by reconfiguring the traditional roles of intermediaries, in principle, DLT—a digital database to record transactions in a shared and secure way—could promote financial autonomy, expand access opportunities, introduce greater efficiency, and unlock liquidity globally. DLT’s inherently transparent, immutable, secure, and tamper-resistant architecture could thus help unlock a range of benefits at a wholesale and retail level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the above reasons, there is substantial enthusiasm surrounding the promise of both technologies in the financial sector. Most recently, the Trump administration has taken a new and more proactive approach to DLT with the appointment of a White House AI and Crypto Czar who has been tasked with developing digital asset regulations. In the U.S. Congress, representatives from the cryptocurrency industry are actively participating in hearings with lawmakers interested in establishing legal standards for digital assets. For example, a 2025 bill introduced by the Senate Banking Committee—the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act)—seeks to create a central regulatory body for stablecoins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DLT has made progress over the last 15 years, with increasing interest and early adoption across sectors. Still, challenges like fragmented governance, limited interoperability, and uneven regulation remain barriers to scale and broader impact. In addition, more evidence is needed to fully understand its benefits compared to the alternatives. Given the many developments taking place in the field of DLT, the body of scholarly work is steadily growing. This paper aims to unpack the main issues discussed in the literature and summarize recent trends in the sector. It examines how DLT could facilitate broader financial inclusion, particularly through the use case of asset tokenization, and explores the risks and challenges the technology brings. While DLT may disrupt the financial services industry, its precise impact remains uncertain: Will it complement or replace existing financial institutions and other proven technologies such as mobile money?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-distributed-ledger-technology-can-advance-financial-inclusion&quot;&gt;How Distributed Ledger Technology Can Advance Financial Inclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its core, DLT is a shared and safe database, similar to a shared Excel workbook. It is decentralized in nature, offering a secure way of conducting and recording transactions without the need for a central authority. DLT is “distributed” because multiple members of a computer network can contribute and sync copies of a single ledger. New transactions are added in a manner that is cryptographically secure, permanent, and visible to all participants in near real-time. DLT can record both static data, like phone numbers, and dynamic data, like digital assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional databases, this technology enables peer-to-peer (P2P) information flow, while eliminating added costs from middlemen in the process. In the financial services space, this translates into facilitating quicker and more affordable transactions and money transfers. In addition, DLT can improve transparency and build trust in financial products because transactions are unalterable and traceable back to their origin. This not only eliminates doubt about the integrity of financial data but also fosters trust between participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although DLT is often narrowly associated with digital financial assets like cryptocurrencies, the underlying technology possesses wider capabilities to accelerate transaction speeds, reduce costs, and expand consumer participation in financial services. There are several avenues through which DLT can impact the sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transparency, traceability, and auditability:&lt;/strong&gt; DLT enhances efficiency in tracking transactions and spending, helping to reduce fraud and corruption within economies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost efficiencies:&lt;/strong&gt; Compared to legacy systems, DLT can significantly lower record-keeping costs, leading to reduced service fees.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managing assets:&lt;/strong&gt; Digital wallets allow societies to rethink how assets are managed and how recordkeeping functions. Without the use of intermediaries, digital wallets allow financial services users more control over their assets, reducing risks in particular for women and other vulnerable populations and providing more secure and private means of managing assets for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Programmable money:&lt;/strong&gt; DLT enables the programmability of assets—transactions that automatically occur once certain rules and conditions are met—thereby allowing for automated processes and expanded use cases for money. For example, project funds can be gated based on milestones, cash disbursements can be restricted to specific uses, and stimulus payments can expire if not used.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Universal acceptance:&lt;/strong&gt; Digital assets (such as stablecoins) are increasingly being accepted worldwide. This “universalness” enables significant use cases like global payroll and payment for remote workers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/YLcdRyy.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: DLT Applications for Financial Inclusion.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS Project on Prosperity and Development.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the financial services industry, some of the most promising applications of DLT for advancing financial inclusion include streamlining the account opening and onboarding process, enhancing the efficiency of payments and remittances, improving individuals’ access to credit, and empowering individuals with greater control and ownership over their credit history (Figure 1). These innovations have the potential to make financial services more accessible and transparent for underserved populations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easing the account opening and client onboarding processes:&lt;/strong&gt; DLT can be instrumental to individuals and firms that want to access formal financial services for the first time. In this context, this technology can be applied in two key ways: (1) enabling digital identification, and (2) enhancing the client onboarding experience.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Over 1.1 billion people in the world lack sufficient proof of their identity. If people cannot prove who they are, they are often denied essential services, including financial services. The Global Findex Database 2021 found that a lack of documentation (e.g., an ID, proof of address, or proof of income) was one of the primary barriers to accessing banking services in low-income countries, with a staggering 27 percent of their population citing identification issues as a reason for remaining unbanked.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;DLT can help address identification barriers that keep people unbanked by providing a secure, verifiable, and decentralized digital identity authenticated through cryptographic proofs. For example, three quarters of Sierra Leone’s adult population do not have access to formal financial services due to a lack of identification and credit history. Thus, in 2018, the government of Sierra Leone partnered with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF), and online lending platform Kiva to launch a DLT-based platform to provide citizens with formal identity and give them more control over their own credit information. The Kiva protocol uses biometric data (such as fingerprints) and houses credit information of citizens collected through different means. Other examples where DLT is applied for identification purposes include Ethereum and WorldCoin—cryptocurrencies that use blockchain digital identities based on biometric data (e.g., voice and iris scans) to register, enroll, and authenticate customers.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In addition, DLT can be applied to make the customer onboarding experience more secure, efficient, and client friendly. Financial institutions need to verify who the customers are and understand their personal and business activities to better assess whether these entities carry risks related to fraud, money laundering, or financing terrorism (known as Know Your Customer [KYC] and Customer Due Diligence [CDD] checks). These processes can be time consuming for banks (since they must gather and analyze data for each customer) and are also subject to human error. Moreover, customers must undergo this same process every time they start a new relationship with a bank or financial institution. Using DLT technology, financial institutions could reduce the time and costs associated with these processes while also providing greater visibility to regulators and offering customers a more seamless onboarding experience. Since the information housed in the blockchain becomes a single source of customer data across all financial institutions in a jurisdiction, there is greater visibility and transparency about the activities of customers for regulators. Customers benefit from reduced onboarding times and the elimination of the need to submit duplicate information across multiple financial institutions. For example, in 2017, a consortium of banks in Singapore worked with the regulatory authority to use DLT for KYC processes, which resulted in a cost savings of between 25–50 percent to banks, while at the same time providing a clear audit trail to regulators and a better customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facilitating payments:&lt;/strong&gt; DLT can also be utilized to enable secure payments (including P2P, remittances, government-to-person [G2P], e-commerce, and humanitarian payments) without the use of a bank account. An individual living in a rural region with no nearby access to a bank can receive money instantly instead of waiting days for the money to process into an account. DLT can also be employed for cross-border payments, including remittances and humanitarian aid. International money transfers through traditional channels can be expensive to users given the many fees that banks and money transfer corporations charge. Moreover, several days can pass before the funds reach the beneficiary. Since DLT enables peer-to-peer transactions—allowing money to move across borders without relying on the corresponding banking system—it has the potential to cut the costs and increase the speed of money transfers. One example where DLT is applied for these types of payments is Everex, a blockchain-enabled remittance provider. The platform claims that it offers remittance services to Myanmar workers in Thailand faster and with lower fees than traditional money transfer services. Another example is Leaf (Leaf Global Fintech), a blockchain-based digital wallet developed in 2019. Leaf enables vulnerable people and refugees to store, send, receive, and exchange currencies on their phones, regardless of whether they are using a smartphone. The service covers users in Kenya, Uganda, and Rwanda and had reached 40,000 beneficiaries as of 2022. Due to its success, Leaf Global Fintech was acquired the same year by IDT Corporation, a global FinTech provider.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Access to credit and control over credit history and reporting:&lt;/strong&gt; Another promising application of DLT centers on credit services, offering new opportunities for individuals and businesses to secure financing in more efficient and transparent ways. For example, Grassroots Economics, a blockchain-based project based out of Kenya, worked with UNICEF and the Red Cross on an innovative credit line for communities that do not have collateral or credit history. Grassroots Economics developed the idea of Community Inclusion Currencies (CICs)—tokens that are backed by the goods and services provided by the community, including, for example, a town’s food and water supply, a carpenter’s labor, or a babysitter’s time. Kenyans can use these tokens to create a line of credit that is backed by their own work. In this way, farmers can build credit histories and get loans without using physical currency (Kenyan shillings) or going through a bank. The transactions of these tokens using feature phones are documented on a blockchain. In 2020, 58,400 users of Grassroots Economics carried out transactions worth $3 million in tokens.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;DLT can also be leveraged to enhance credit history management and reporting by providing a more secure, transparent, and efficient way to track and verify financial histories. If credit data were stored via blockchain, consumers would be able to directly access their own credit histories and reports, without having to rely on an outside agency. In the United States, in 2023, TransUnion (one of the largest consumer credit reporting agencies) started providing credit scores for individuals that apply for loans on blockchain-based protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New financial assets—unbacked cryptocurrencies, utility tokens, and stablecoins, among others—are being created in DLT for a variety of financial- and non-financial-use cases. Various unbacked crypto assets and tokens sold in secondary markets suffer from inherent volatility and the technology, in some cases, can be misused for illicit activities. Other assets, such as regulated stablecoins, enjoy much greater transparency and price stability as they are pegged to fiat currencies, such as the U.S. dollar. Stablecoins are known for unlocking a range of benefits, including faster, cheaper, and more efficient settlement. The market for these myriad assets has grown considerably and, as such, promoting regulatory clarity has been an objective shared by many jurisdictions around the world, with the United States most recently moving at pace to join these efforts and promote their safe adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-emerging-use-case-in-dlt-the-tokenization-of-assets&quot;&gt;An Emerging Use Case in DLT: The Tokenization of Assets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most prominent use cases of DLT technology—tokenization—has already garnered significant attention from the financial services industry and holds promise for greater financial inclusion. Tokenization is the process of converting real-world or digital assets into DLT-based tokens (or digital representations) that can be securely stored, traded, and transferred. These tokens represent ownership, rights, or access to assets such as currencies, securities, physical goods, real estate, intellectual property, or commodities. While financial assets have been represented on digital ledgers or financial databases for some time (e.g., as liabilities or assets on a bank’s balance sheet), the technological attributes of tokenization are unique and have the potential to transform how retail and financial actors interact with each other and among themselves (Figure 2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/cu1lSwb.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: The Tokenization Process of Real-World Assets.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: U.S. Federal Reserve Board.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A token can be used across sectors and protects all types of sensitive data, including bank transactions, medical records, criminal records, vehicle driver information, loan applications, stock trading, and voter registration. Tokenization can be applied to financial services, supply chain management, healthcare, real estate, media, and entertainment. Given its potential to transform several sectors, asset tokenization is projected to be a $16 trillion industry by 2030, representing 10 percent of global GDP, according to research conducted by the Boston Consulting Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since tokenization is built on blockchain technology, benefits to users include added efficiency, faster transfers, and increased transaction transparency. In addition, tokenization has unique features that can enhance the functioning of the financial services industry (Figure 3). Beyond operational efficiencies, tokenization has the potential to broaden investment opportunities as it allows investors to own a portion of an asset rather than having to purchase the entire asset, which can be prohibitively expensive. This fractional ownership gives investors access to asset classes that were previously out of reach. Furthermore, tokenization can provide more liquidity to illiquid assets (such as real estate or private equity), as well as enable easier and faster trading on a digital platform. Therefore, tokenization can open investment opportunities to a wider range of investors, including those who may not have the capital to invest in traditional illiquid assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/HdGlfT2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3: Potential Benefits of Tokenization.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: OECD.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relatedly, another way tokenization can positively impact emerging markets is by expanding financing options for businesses, thereby providing them with greater access to capital and new growth opportunities. This is particularly important in developing countries where many small businesses struggle to access fresh capital and loans. Tokenization can facilitate private capital flow to small businesses, allowing them to grow, employ people, and pay taxes to their governments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, asset tokenization holds the potential to significantly promote financial inclusion by democratizing access to investment opportunities, lowering transaction costs, enhancing operational efficiency, and bolstering transparency and security for users. This transformation could pave the way for a more accessible and equitable financial ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-challenges-of-large-scale-adoption-of-dlt-and-tokenization&quot;&gt;The Challenges of Large-Scale Adoption of DLT and Tokenization&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across regions, sectors, and institutions, there is significant experimentation and innovation using DLT technologies. A 2024 survey of global capital markets participants—including FinTech firms, banks, and fund managers—revealed that 39 percent of the surveyed institutions are adopting DLT mainly to improve internal operations through cost savings. On a regional level, 23 percent of respondents in the Middle East and Africa claimed that their DLT innovations are in the proof-of-concept stage, 25 percent in Latin America declared theirs to be in the development stage, and 44 percent of respondents from Asia and Europe stated that they are in the “live” stage. At the same time, the survey showed that many of these DLT initiatives are fragmented and siloed, involving a limited number of organizations and thus restricting their impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multilateral organizations are also developing DLT applications to enhance internal operations. At the same time, these institutions are launching initiatives and financing innovations for their clients in both the private and public sectors (Box 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-1-dlt-innovations-within-multilateral-organizations&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 1: DLT Innovations Within Multilateral Organizations&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Agencies within the United Nations— specifically UNICEF, UNDP Innovation, the UN Innovation Network (UNIN), and the World Food Programme—use an internal platform called The Atrium, which uses blockchain technology.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In 2019, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank launched a private blockchain called the Learning Coin. It is a quasi-cryptocurrency focused on research that does not have any real value but instead is intended to be used to educate users through access to content related to research materials, videos, and presentations. The users get paid in this quasi-cryptocurrency and can later redeem the coins for goods and other services instead of a monetized value.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Also in 2019, IDB Lab launched an initiative called LACChain, which was created as a public blockchain ecosystem to facilitate connections between the public and private sectors for users in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). This blockchain infrastructure was created to unite enterprises and the governments in using a compatible DLT platform.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The IMF has formally incorporated cryptocurrencies into their global economic data reporting in 2025. The organization published the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM7) on March 20, 2025, which highlighted the guidelines for the classification and recording of crypto assets like bitcoin, stablecoin, and token-based platforms like Ethereum and Solana. The intention of this manual is for member countries to implement these frameworks by 2029. The IMF will support this implementation by helping and guiding the countries to ensure the enforcement of these frameworks.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In addition, the World Bank launched the first public blockchain bond in 2018—bond-i (Blockchain Operated New Debt Instrument). This platform was launched through the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) and raised $110 million in its initial launch.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In March 2025, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) issued its first digital bond—HSBC Orion. This DLT platform uses the British pound as a denomination and is employed for NatWest’s and HSBC’s operations. It is a 15-month, £5 million (nearly USD $6.5 million), fixed-rate bond.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Latin America and the Caribbean, the Central Bank of Brazil launched a new blockchain pilot project called Drex Pilot (also known as the Real Digital) to develop a CBDC (central bank digital currency) in 2024. On the continent of Africa, South Africa is experimenting with blockchain technologies, including startups like Ice3x and Luno (both cryptocurrency exchanges), as well as Custos Media Technology, GeoPay, and Bankymoon (which use blockchains to address challenges such as international money transfers and online piracy). Moreover, central banks are testing the use of digital currencies as ways of fortifying financial inclusion in, for example, Ghana, Nigeria, and South Africa, all of which are running pilot projects. In Asia, there are government initiatives to develop DLT frameworks and regulations. One example is the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), which began utilizing blockchain and DLT for settlement and clearing systems. MAS is responsible for the Singapore Exchange (SGX), which successfully created a public digital bond using a DLT-enabled platform in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of tokenization, there is limited public data on these transactions globally, including the overall market size and more disaggregated information by different classes of tokens and their actual market growth. Although the first tokenization transaction happened in 2017, few assets have been tokenized aside from cash (in the form of stablecoins) and bank deposits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the significant innovation taking place and the clear institutional appetite for it, DLT has not yet reached the level of adoption necessary to be considered systemically significant. There are several barriers that hinder widespread adoption of these technologies (Figure 4). The most important barriers to support DLT at scale include regulatory uncertainty, a lack of standardization, and the need for interoperability (specifically between DLT platforms and traditional payment systems, and between different DLT platforms). There are also risks involving, for example, differences in the governance of the networks, cybersecurity, and legal ambiguity. As a result, DLT’s mass adoption has been slow, and its long-term success will depend on overcoming these barriers while taking actions to mitigate these underlying risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/JzVnr88.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4: Adoption of DLT at Scale: Barriers and Risks.&lt;/strong&gt; Sources: OECD, McKinsey &amp;amp; Company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of early 2025, the regulatory landscape for DLT and tokenization is still developing, with no single, universally accepted framework having emerged. Countries have moved at different speeds and have taken different approaches to regulating this nascent sector. In addition, there are no binding international standards in place. The inconsistency of global regulations creates unnecessary uncertainty and complexity for businesses. For example, some jurisdictions do not have policies that directly address the novel considerations DLT brings, instead relying on laws regarding the transfer of private information or payments and securities laws designed with traditional financial assets in mind. Due to differences in laws and policies that are tied to digital assets and activities associated with the technology, DLT deployment remains fragmented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the European Union and other advanced economies, such as Hong Kong and Singapore, have already introduced legislation aimed at standardizing legal frameworks, a majority of the developing world is still jurisdictionally fragmented. Assimilating the regulatory and legal policies between various jurisdictions would alleviate potential legal friction and promote greater adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Financial Stability Board (FSB), which has jurisdiction over all G20 economies, has been very active in producing guidelines and recommendation regarding blockchain and crypto activities. In fact, it just finalized its regulatory framework for crypto-asset activities in order to promote regulatory comprehensiveness and consistency. This is a major step toward a more globalized standard for token usage and could provide a regulatory framework for developing economies looking to flesh out their DLT strategies. Additionally, the FSB’s 2023 G20 Crypto-asset Policy Implementation Roadmap is a comprehensive strategy aimed at addressing the challenges posed by cryptocurrencies and is primarily centered around regulatory frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the current state of interoperability, which allows different DLT networks to connect and exchange information with each other without restriction, makes the implementation of the technology in the most needed areas extremely difficult. Unlike mobile technology, where a person can call or text another person without needing the same cellular network, most DLT applications lack interoperability both with each other and with legacy systems. Each DLT platform typically operates in isolation, which hinders the integration of services with other systems. As a result, DLT applications within the financial services sector remain fragmented and siloed, with many still at the proof-of-concept stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Integrating blockchain and tokenization technologies with legacy financial systems presents additional technical challenges. The current financial market infrastructure is not compatible with the decentralized and digital nature of DLTs and requires substantial investment in new infrastructure, as well as the acquisition of skilled talent and employee training. In the case of tokenization, institutions must invest in updating their middle- and back-office workflows to accommodate tokenized assets. Additionally, during the transition to new technology, institutions will need to run digital-twin operations (e.g., managing both digital and traditional settlement, and other functions) to mitigate operational and regulatory risks. These hurdles mean that institutions need a strong business case to justify making this transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dlt-adoption-in-emerging-markets&quot;&gt;DLT Adoption in Emerging Markets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is a flurry of experimentation and innovation surrounding DLT in emerging markets, significant disparities with advanced economies introduce additional complexities that hinder the widespread adoption of these technologies. A combination of economic, infrastructure, and social challenges—such as low levels of financial and digital literacy, limited access to essential digital and energy infrastructure, and potential risks to financial stability—pose unique barriers that must be addressed in order to scale DLT effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to weak digital and financial literacy, individuals in emerging markets do not fully recognize the risks and benefits of these technologies. Blockchain, in particular, is not well understood by the public and its benefits are not adequately documented and communicated to consumers. In a 2024 survey of 18 developing and advanced countries, most respondents did not get the definition of blockchain right, except for interviewees in Nigeria and South Africa. This skill and informational gap prevents individuals from engaging effectively in decentralized finance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, DLT is often confused with cryptocurrency, complete with the latter’s negative connotations. Media coverage frequently centers on examples of cryptocurrency misuse such as authoritarian regimes attempting to circumvent Western sanctions (e.g., Russia’s use of Bitcoin) or cryptocurrency scandals (e.g., the meme coin $Libra and the theft of nearly $1.5 billion in ByBit coins by the North Korean criminal organization known as Lazarus Group), instead of the benefits of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the previously mentioned challenges, DLTs require significant investments in hard infrastructure and can consume massive amounts of energy for computing power. As these technologies expand and the world faces an increase in demand for data centers and computing power, the financial and energy costs will only grow. However, many developing countries do not have access to affordable and reliable energy sources and, moreover, lack the resources to invest in digital infrastructure. As of February 2024, the energy demand generated by current crypto assets was between 0.4 and 0.9 percent of global energy usage. Bitcoin mining (the term used to describe the process in which bitcoins are validated and recorded) required the equivalent of about 50 days of power usage by the average U.S. household per bitcoin in 2022. With roughly 200,000 bitcoin “mined” per year, the energy needs are enormous. To put this in the context of expanding DLT and blockchain technology access, approximately 770 million people worldwide do not have access to reliable electricity, mainly in Africa and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, an additional consideration for developing countries is that DLT adoption without clear rules and standards has the potential to introduce new risks that could impact the overall stability of their financial systems. Although DLT fosters a more democratized financial system by offering consumers greater financial choices, it could present a complex trade-off between consumer choice and the country’s financial stability if its adoption is not managed appropriately. In the case of stablecoins, for example, there is growing popularity for using these digital assets as trading and settlement vehicles and as means of payments across jurisdictions, but lack of oversight (including of stablecoin issuers’ reserve backing model) may undermine the effectiveness of a country’s regulator over their financial system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is especially challenging for emerging markets, which must navigate a complex landscape of competing economic and social priorities. To offer guidance and help jurisdictions navigate these risks, the FSB has issued 10 recommendations aimed at ensuring consistent and effective regulation, supervision, and oversight of stablecoins across jurisdictions while also encouraging responsible innovation. Regarding the tokenization of assets, a 2024 FSB report highlighted the additional vulnerabilities the mass adoption of the technology could pose to the financial system, but concluded that it did not yet present significant risks to the stability of the financial sector given its small-scale usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-navigating-the-future&quot;&gt;Conclusion: Navigating the Future&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Innovative technologies will continue to transform the financial landscape. With DLT driving a shift of the industry to a broader democratization of finance, there is a significant opportunity to leverage this technology for better development outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As new developments emerge in this space, it is crucial to address the barriers and mitigate the risks while ensuring that the technology fosters equitable financial access and upholds the stability of the global financial system. The path forward is both challenging and exhilarating, with several key considerations warranting deeper reflection:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulators must balance innovation and regulation.&lt;/strong&gt; Like any new technology, DLT presents challenges to regulators who want to foster innovation while ensuring sufficient regulation to protect users, maintain financial stability, and prevent misuse. Striking the right balance is crucial—too much regulation can stifle innovation, whereas insufficient oversight can lead to fraud, market manipulation, and security breaches, to name just a few risks. As DLT evolves, regulators must remain flexible and adaptive, allowing for the rapid development of new applications while maintaining a framework that ensures transparency, accountability, and consumer protection. Effective regulation should support responsible innovation, promote trust, and allow the technology to reach its full potential without compromising financial stability or user safety.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The rapid global rollout of emerging technologies demands heightened focus on international cooperation to establish interoperability and standardized practices.&lt;/strong&gt; As new systems and technologies proliferate across borders, the need for a more cohesive approach has become increasingly apparent. Ensuring that various systems can seamlessly communicate with each other will require substantial investments in infrastructure, as well as robust international collaboration to set common standards and protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The benefits to users and market players are not yet widespread, and may even be unknown.&lt;/strong&gt; For users to fully embrace this innovation, they need to understand the value it brings in real terms—whether it’s in terms of cost-saving, increased transparency, or enhanced security. Stronger, more accessible case studies and practical examples are needed to demonstrate how this technology can drive real-world benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In international development, multilateral and bilateral organizations have a unique opportunity to integrate and promote this technology.&lt;/strong&gt; Multilateral institutions are already experimenting and applying DLT both for internal purposes and to help their clients. DLT could streamline and improve processes such as payroll systems, the disbursement of grants and loans, contractor payments, and the delivery of humanitarian aid in challenging environments. In the United States, given the foreign assistance reform taking place under the Trump administration, there is a valuable opportunity to leverage DLT not only to track funding but also to make the entire foreign aid value chain more efficient, transparent, and accountable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is essential to educate consumers on both the benefits and the risks of this technology.&lt;/strong&gt; Although DLT is rapidly evolving, educational institutions must improve their digital and financial literacy offerings so that students are better equipped to engage in decentralized finance. Financial institutions can also play a role in educating their clients, especially when onboarding customers. Media narratives need to shift toward DLT’s positive applications and transformative potential across various sectors, highlighting its benefits beyond the realm of cryptocurrency.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, will this technology complement or replace traditional banking and financial institutions?&lt;/strong&gt; This is a critical question for the future of financial ecosystems. The potential for DLT lies in its ability to both enhance and work alongside existing financial and banking structures. While it may not replace traditional institutions entirely, it could significantly transform and improve efficiencies, streamline operations, and offer new avenues for financial inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the adoption of DLT and other technological applications continues to expand, so too does the body of research exploring their impact on financial inclusion and financial stability. This rapidly growing field of scholarly inquiry is poised to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of the industry, offering valuable insights and evidence to guide policy development. This paper aims to summarize some of the key issues emerging in this area and hopes to inspire greater engagement from academics, policymakers, and leaders across various sectors to contribute to this critical conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 9 February 2023, the UK and US governments jointly sanctioned seven members of Conti/Trickbot, a ransomware group responsible for attacks against at least 149 UK individuals and businesses. The move marked the UK government’s entry into the ransomware sanctions arena. Over the years since, the ransomware sanctions regime has expanded and has become a core component of the UK’s counter-ransomware strategy. The government aims to use sanctions to expose ransomware criminals’ identities, undermine their ability to monetise ransomware, and degrade other criminals’ trust in key ransomware services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are significant challenges posed by designing, implementing and enforcing ransomware sanctions in a way that achieves the government’s goals. In this context, in February 2025, as part of ongoing work through its UK Sanctions Implementation and Strategy Taskforce, RUSI convened an online workshop to discuss the UK’s experience with ransomware sanctions to date. The workshop was jointly organised by the Centre for Finance and Security and the Cyber and Tech research group at RUSI. A select group of 35 expert stakeholders from the UK, US and Canada attended the workshop. Participants represented a diverse range of professional backgrounds. These included incident responders, ransomware payment brokers, cryptocurrency tracers, lawyers, academics, law enforcement officers and UK government officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first section of this report provides an overview of the discussion relating to the implementation of UK cyber sanctions. The second section focuses on the discussion pertaining to the sanction regime’s “theory of change”. The third section describes the impact of sanctions on ransomware threat actors. The fourth section articulates participants’ perspectives on the state of play with respect to compliance and enforcement. Finally, the report outlines policy implications for the UK’s role as a cyber sanctions proponent in a dynamic international context. None of the discussions at the event are attributable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-uk-cyber-sanctions-regime&quot;&gt;The UK Cyber Sanctions Regime&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first session began by outlining the context for the initial development and implementation of the UK’s ransomware sanctions regime. A representative from the UK government noted that the broader cyber sanctions regime was designed when the UK was still a member state of the EU. The UK’s regime, introduced in 2020, is thus modelled similarly to the EU’s. The participant also emphasised that the sanctions regime was an opportunity to collaborate with international partners, namely the US and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants discussed differences between the UK, US and EU approaches to implementing cyber sanctions. Participants described how there was a close alignment between the UK and US approaches, which prioritised operational impact by naming sanctioned individuals relatively quickly. Participants also recognised that there was a disparity in resources between the UK and US, with the latter being able to operate at greater speed and scale. Comparatively, while the UK’s regime was modelled in line with the EU’s regime, the EU was described as facing challenges in coordinating cyber sanctions across the 27 member states. The result of this in-built deliberation meant that decision making on sanctions implementation, prioritisation and information-sharing was relatively delayed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, it is of note that many countries do not have dedicated cyber sanctions regimes. Participants noted that the UK continues to push for broader international action, particularly through partnerships such as the Counter Ransomware Initiative. At the time of writing, no sanctions had been lifted by the US, but participants expressed uncertainty about whether cyber sanctions will continue to be a priority for the US under the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-theory-of-change-for-ransomware-sanctions&quot;&gt;The Theory of Change for Ransomware Sanctions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants from the government emphasised that the UK uses ransomware sanctions as part of a cross-government counter-ransomware strategy. This strategy is derived from the UK’s 2022 National Cyber Strategy and is coordinated by the cross-Whitehall Senior Ransomware Steering Group led by the Home Office. The workshop highlighted several different ways in which the UK government is using ransomware sanctions to try to further the three strategic objectives identified by participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the primary objective, authorities aim to change the behaviour of criminals by altering their calculation of risk and undermining their ability to monetise ransomware. There are two ways that sanctions might contribute to this objective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, sanctions enable law enforcement to “name and shame” individual criminals and remove their anonymity. The government hopes that this will deter ransomware threat actors and force them to operate in a more constrained environment. One workshop participant noted that for UK authorities, sanctions are the best means of attributing ransomware operators and affiliates, as prosecutors will not charge foreign hackers without a reasonable chance of prosecution. This is a contrast to the US, which has frequently indicted both intelligence officers from hostile states and foreign cybercriminals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, sanctions are part of a range of measures that law enforcement uses to attempt to disrupt criminal networks by sowing distrust. The ransomware ecosystem is a collection of individuals, groups and services that rely on some degree of trust to function effectively. Many of the most impactful ransomware strains are run as a service: operators develop ransomware, maintain infrastructure to run it and then sell access to it to affiliates for a cut of ransom payments. Some participants argued that sanctioning key ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operators may cause affiliates to lose trust that these services are safe. This was the premise of Operation Cronos, an operation led by the National Crime Agency (NCA) that compromised the infrastructure of cybercriminal group LockBit and sanctioned its main administrator. Participants also discussed the more recent sanctioning by US, UK and Australian authorities of ZServers, a Russia-based “bulletproof” hosting provider used by ransomware criminals to host servers and domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A secondary objective of UK authorities is to use sanctions to change victim behaviour and reduce the number of ransom payments made by UK individuals and businesses. One participant argued that sanctions inject “friction” into victim decision making because of the need to carry out due diligence checks before a payment is made. At the same time, several workshop participants noted that the government is keen not to “re-victimise” ransomware victims by completely removing their ability to pay. Participants highlighted that balancing these competing desires is one of the reasons US and UK authorities have designated individual criminals rather than ransomware strains. The latter approach would completely remove the ability of victims to make payments to designated strains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some workshop participants also suggested that the UK government is using sanctions as a mechanism for increasing reporting of ransomware incidents in the UK. One industry representative at the workshop highlighted that the guidance from the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI) on ransomware sanctions notes that reporting to the National Cyber Security Centre and NCA will be treated as a mitigating factor if a victim pays a sanctioned ransomware threat actor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, an underlying objective across the UK’s cyber sanctions mission is to enhance international coordination. Cyber threats are inherently transnational, requiring a collaborative approach to sanctions and enforcement among international partners. Participants highlighted that the UK has been working closely with allies such as the US and Australia to coordinate sanctions and intelligence-sharing efforts. The effectiveness of these measures is amplified when multiple nations align their policies and enforcement actions. However, international alignment efforts are hindered by the EU’s divergent approach; participants observed that in the EU, the use of cyber sanctions is viewed as a tool more for countering mis/disinformation than for targeting ransomware attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-impact-of-sanctions-on-ransomware-threat-actors&quot;&gt;The Impact of Sanctions on Ransomware Threat Actors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After discussing the theory of change for using ransomware sanctions, the workshop focused on the effects of sanctions on criminal behaviour to date. This discussion covered the impact of not only UK designations on threat actors, but also designations by the US Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC). There was broad agreement that sanctions have increased distrust in RaaS offerings and disrupted some individuals’ ability to monetise ransomware. Representatives from the public and private sectors at the workshop emphasised, however, that it remains challenging to accurately measure these effects and disaggregate them from both other counter-ransomware measures and internal strife in the ransomware ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants noted that it is likely that sanctions have sown distrust in some ransomware groups and services. This has two effects. First, one participant used the example of Conti/Trickbot and suggested that designating individual members has had a psychological impact and reduced their risk appetite for high-profile ransomware operations. Second, participants noted that sanctions and associated travel bans probably also cause designated individuals to reconsider travelling abroad to spend their profits. Although these measures do not change the central problem of Russia being a safe haven for threat actors, they do constrain the actors’ freedom. Even more significant, however, is the reputational harm that sanctions cause to criminal brands, both for individuals and RaaS strains. One participant argued that key members of Conti/Trickbot, Evil Corp and LockBit have all failed to recover their influence in the ecosystem since being designated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was widespread agreement that sanctions have affected designated individuals’ ability to monetise ransomware. Victims – and the third parties such as insurers, payment brokers and lawyers that support them – are less likely to pay sanctioned threat actors because of the fear of being punished by authorities. One participant highlighted reporting by Chainalysis, which shows that payments to LockBit dropped 79% in the second half of 2024 following Operation Cronos and the designation of LockBit’s core administrator. It is also likely that reputational harm caused to sanctioned RaaS and malware-as-a-service operators such as Conti/Trickbot has undermined their ability to attract new customers and affiliates. One workshop participant also noted that sanctioned ransomware affiliates (such as Evil Corp) may find it harder to access RaaS services because of increased scrutiny from administrators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop also highlighted that sanctions of both key individuals and cryptocurrency and money laundering services have made it challenging for threat actors to launder the proceeds of ransomware. This aligns with analysis conducted by Chainalysis in early 2025, which assessed that sanctions and law enforcement operations have resulted in “insecurity among threat actors where they can safely put their funds”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sanctions have probably also had broader effects on the ransomware ecosystem and the operating models and tactics of key groups and individuals. One workshop participant highlighted how Evil Corp had adapted its business model after being designated by OFAC in 2019: rather than running its own in-house ransomware operations, its members became affiliates of RaaS strains to evade the additional scrutiny and restrictions put on them. However, it is unclear if this dramatically affected its ability to monetise ransomware. Other participants argued that sanctions (along with other counter-ransomware measures) have contributed to the fragmentation of the ransomware ecosystem, with monopolistic RaaS strains like LockBit giving way to smaller players and more “lone wolves”. However, participants noted that an unintended consequence of this may be worse outcomes for victims, with less established threat actors less likely to provide reliable decrypters and more willing to use very aggressive extortion tactics. This may be because they are less constrained by the rules imposed by some RaaS operators and administrators. Additionally, third-party incident responders and ransomware negotiators are less able to draw on battlecards – intelligence and playbooks to guide engagement with different ransomware threat actors – and past precedent when handling incidents caused by splinter groups or groups with no name. This may create uncertainty and/or delays in the victim’s remediation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the workshop was broadly positive about the effects of sanctions on threat actors, it also highlighted that there is uncertainty and scepticism about the ability of law enforcement and industry to accurately measure those effects. Part of this challenge is due to a lack of visibility: as one participant highlighted, it is difficult to know when criminals feel vulnerable, even in cases when their communications may be compromised. It is also a methodological challenge: the effects of sanctions cannot be disaggregated from other counter-ransomware activities such as offensive cyber operations and arrests. However, since these measures are designed to complement one another, ultimately it may not matter if authorities are unable to assign specific effects to sanctions. This also emphasises that sanctions will probably be more effective if used in concert with other tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;compliance-enforcement-and-the-impact-on-ransomware-victims&quot;&gt;Compliance, Enforcement and the Impact on Ransomware Victims&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the final session, workshop participants discussed cyber sanctions compliance at length and in depth. The discussion also reflected on the impact that sanctions checks had on the ransomware victim experience and threat actors’ ability to monetise ransomware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a ransomware victim is considering a prospective payment of a ransom, they have a responsibility to make reasonable efforts to identify whether the payment may – either in part or in full – go to a sanctioned individual. Industry participants at the workshop explained that, in practice, the sanctions compliance checks are often undertaken by third-party firms – specifically, ransomware intermediaries, which are firms that facilitate ransom payments in cryptocurrencies to cybercriminals. This ransomware intermediary function, participants explained, may be a bolt-on to a wider cyber incident response and/or ransomware negotiation service. Some firms may also offer ransomware payments as a standalone service. Ransomware intermediaries are an attractive solution in part because they have the capability to procure or draw upon large sums of cryptocurrency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sanctions checks will be undertaken before a payment is signed off by the ransomware victim and, where applicable, their third-party support. This support may include an incident response firm, legal services provider and/or a cyber insurer. Previous RUSI research has identified that the decision to pay or not pay a negotiated ransom lies with the senior leadership at a victim organisation. This decision may be informed by advice and guidance from third-party support, but the decision ultimately rests with the victim organisation. Participants emphasised that, at present, a red flag from a sanctions compliance check is the only legal impediment to a prospective ransom payment in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to industry participants, there is significant scope for ambiguity with respect to ransomware sanctions checks. While ransomware groups are typically keen to establish and maintain the reputation of their “brand name”, they will obfuscate the personal identities of those in the group. However, the UK’s ransomware sanctions regime targets named individuals rather than groups. Contemporary ransomware payments are likely to go to multiple individuals within a given group. The prevalence of RaaS means that it is common for ransomware payments to be divided on a ratio basis between affiliates and operators. There is also a growing incidence of “lone wolves” operating without branding, as observed by private operators at the workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industry representatives at the workshop described that the entity responsible for sanctions compliance therefore has to try to ascertain whether there is a reasonable risk of a prospective ransom payment going to a named sanctioned individual. They will typically use a range of identifiers to make this judgement call. These may include but are not necessarily limited to: the cryptocurrency wallet address; IP addresses; Tox chat IDs; the computer code used to conduct the attack; and the language expressions used by the criminals in ransom notes and negotiations. One participant emphasised that each individual facilitator needs to determine their own risk tolerance. They argued that an ideal sanctions check would follow a typology using code, syntax and linguistic overlap. However, the judgement call on the degree of overlap is highly likely to be inconclusive and there is a risk of false positives and false negatives. Building on this point, participants described how the judgement call felt like “rolling the dice”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the workshop highlighted that ransomware sanctions checks are, at present, more of an art than a science, with, as one workshop participant put it, “no silver bullet for due diligence”. There is inadequate clarity on what constitutes a sufficient sanctions check. Guidance from governments including the UK’s was described as “intentionally ambiguous”. Participants explained how they had attempted to get clarity from government entities such as OFAC and OFSI, but that this was not forthcoming. Additionally, at the time of writing, there had not been any fine or censure for any ransomware sanctions breach that could provide further insights into what the regulator found to be insufficient checks, despite publicly known instances of alleged sanctions breaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workshop participants who offer ransomware intermediary services described how they took a “conservative approach” to sanctions checks and would clearly explain their risk assessment to clients. These participants noted that they had refused to facilitate payments that they believed carried a sanctions risk. One participant referred to a case that they had supported where they believed there was a high sanctions risk; they refused to make the payment, but the client then went to another firm who ultimately completed the transaction. In the participant’s view, the 80/20 RaaS payment split (80% to the affiliate; 20% to the operator) for that payment included money going to a sanctioned entity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants agreed that this anecdotal case highlights a challenge. The ambiguity in the sanctions regime enables ransomware intermediaries – and ransomware victims – to determine their own judgement call based on their own risk tolerance. This means that there may be a spectrum across the market, ranging from “conservative” approaches at one end, through to “permissive” approaches at the other. Previous reporting has also indicated the presence of extreme outlier practices, wherein intermediaries discreetly pay a ransom to the attackers and present this as an “IT solution” to the client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this means is that ransomware victims are, in the words of one workshop participant, able to “shop around for lower standards” so that they may ultimately be able to proceed with a payment. However, one participant noted that the workshop probably had an inherent selection bias; intermediaries who are moderated in their approach to sanctions compliance were more likely to attend a workshop on ransomware sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to emphasise that the workshop discussion did not label ransomware sanctions regimes as paper tigers. On the contrary, workshop participants emphasised that ransomware victims and ransomware intermediaries often have a genuine fear of the potential repercussions of breaching sanctions. Participants described how this fear had a tangible influence on the decision making journeys of ransomware victims by creating friction in the payment process. A participant described how it was good to create “inertia” and “make the victim jump through some hoops and think rationally about the situation”. Another participant agreed, noting that the introduction of the sanctions regimes had caused victims to “think twice” before proceeding with a payment. A ransomware intermediary participant suggested that they had seen increased “fear of OFAC” following the start of the Russia–Ukraine conflict, which had prompted increased demand for due diligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the workshop discussions indicated a mixed picture with respect to ransomware sanctions compliance. Participants outlined their approaches to sanctions compliance based on risk-averse practices. However, the obfuscated nature of ransomware forensics – combined with ambiguity in the sanctions regime – means that sanctions compliance is imprecise. Practitioners are having to rely, at least in part, on a subjective value judgement. Workshop participants argued that if clarity were needed, it would ultimately need to come from governments and regulators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-takeaways-and-policy-recommendations&quot;&gt;Key Takeaways and Policy Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop discussion highlighted that cyber sanctions have had several impacts on the ransomware criminal ecosystem, ransomware victim behaviours and the activities of ransomware intermediaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With respect to the criminals, cyber sanctions add some complexity to their operations – for instance, with respect to their conversion of cryptocurrency assets or their ability to travel internationally. There are also suggestions that sanctions carry a stigma for named individuals, which may foster consternation and distrust within RaaS communities. Where a figurehead of a ransomware group is named as a sanctioned entity, the whole group may become “unpayable” if there is a likely risk that a portion of any payment would go to the named individual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear from the workshop discussion that, even though no censure or fine has thus far been made against cyber sanctions breaches, the time lag of making a sanctions check and the fear of potential future penalties has added friction into the payment decision making process. Participants noted that the UK government is in an unenviable position of trying to sustain an impactful cyber sanctions regime while avoiding double-victimisation of victims of serious organised crime. This may, at least partially, explain the hesitancy for clarity from OFSI and the lack of censure to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, in the absence of effective prosecutions of international ransomware perpetrators, sanctions regimes are one of the few lighter-touch tools that the UK and like-minded countries can use to directly or indirectly affect known serious organised cybercriminals. However, at present, cyber sanctions are an imperfect tool. There may be opportunities for the UK and like-minded countries to refine their regimes. The workshop concluded with the identification of the policy considerations proposed below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhance transparency from OFSI.&lt;/strong&gt; Industry participants expressed frustration about the lack of transparency and guidance from governments and regulators. Participants described how they had proactively reached out to relevant government entities for clarity and had either received slow, nondescript and/or unhelpful responses, or no response at all. It is possible that this ineffective feedback risks disenfranchising well-meaning ransomware intermediaries and ransomware victims. The UK government should reflect on the status quo and assess whether the current approach is primed to achieve the government’s objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promote standardisation for sanctions checks.&lt;/strong&gt; Guidance should be calibrated to encourage more standardisation for sanctions checks. Outside of extreme cases, cyber sanctions checks are inherently inconclusive, with the risk of false positives and negatives. Two different sanctions compliance checkers – with differing experience and risk appetites – may come to opposing conclusions about the sanctions risk of a given ransomware payment. The government should consider how it can support increased standardisation for sanctions checks. This could include, for instance, clear guidance on which technical indicators should be used to make a check, and how they should be meaningfully assessed. Given that the UK government is currently proposing a “payment authorisation regime”, which would require victims to both request permission to pay a ransom and perform their own sanctions checks, spreading best practice and transparency on sanctions checks will become more important.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Designate more targets at a faster pace.&lt;/strong&gt; If ransomware sanctions do have tangible – if limited – impacts on the criminals perpetrating and monetising attacks, the UK government should be bold and implement more sanctions, more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upturn the bargain bucket.&lt;/strong&gt; Ransomware intermediary participants described how they were regulated as money service businesses, proactively sought external scrutiny through auditing, proactively reported incidents and shared information on request, and took a deliberately conservative approach to sanctions risk assessments. However, not all ransomware intermediaries proactively engage in such good citizenship. Some firms may adopt a “permissive” approach to sanctions compliance. Others may surreptitiously engage with the criminals, process a payment, and present this as a technical solution to a client. Research should be commissioned to understand the scope and scale of such behaviour among unscrupulous providers. Where such firms are based in the UK or like-minded partner countries, efforts should be made to scrutinise their activities and, where necessary, hold them to account.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthen alignment with international partners.&lt;/strong&gt; The UK has successfully collaborated with the US and Australia, but the EU has been less active in leveraging its cyber sanctions regime. The uncertainty about the prioritisation of cyber sanctions under the new US administration also raises concerns. The UK must ensure that international partners collaborate closely to enhance the effectiveness of designations and achieve consistent enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, while the use of sanctions was welcomed by workshop participants, their effectiveness has been limited by a number of shortcomings that could be addressed by some simple, focused actions.&lt;/p&gt;

As the United States shifts toward the Indo-Pacific and Russia continues to pursue its territorial ambitions, what might arms control look like after the war in Ukraine?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Inasmuch as arms control efforts seek to affect future events, we have to be conscious of the degree of our uncertainty about the future, in which we are instructed by our experience with surprise in the past. Perhaps an appreciation for this uncertainty will inhibit our choice of arms control objectives, but if so, that is simply the way the ball bounces.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-bernard-brodie&quot;&gt;– Bernard Brodie&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end of the war in Ukraine could present unique opportunities for arms control and reducing the risk of further instability in the Euro-Atlantic region. With the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) set to expire in February 2026, arms control as we know it is at risk of ending, with no clear successor to facilitate further cooperative efforts to reduce or limit strategic forces. Despite pressure for a peace settlement in Ukraine and follow-on arms control measures, Europe appears likely to remain a theater of instability due to increasing reliance on nuclear weapons, Russian territorial ambitions, and a weakening nuclear order. Additionally, the United States’ gradual shift away from Europe and toward the Indo-Pacific over the past decade has created the potential for a deterrence gap in the region. With these challenges in mind, what might arms control look like after the war in Ukraine?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CSIS Project on Nuclear Issues set out to explore prospects for arms control with Russia following the end of the war in Ukraine. The project developed four alternative futures and two black swan scenarios for the Euro-Atlantic security environment after the war in Ukraine ends and convened a series of scenario-based discussions with cross-generational U.S. and European experts. The alternative futures approach allowed the authors to avoid the perennial challenge of tracking a moving target and instead identify consistent trends, along with potential moments of opportunity, for strengthening strategic stability and arms control. The scenarios included bloc competition, strategic disadvantage, strategic advantage, disordered competition, a change of leadership in Moscow, and nuclear use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scenario-based discussions and analysis yielded two main findings: Competition with Russia is unlikely to end, and Europe is poised to emerge as an increasingly influential player in strategic stability and arms control in the Euro-Atlantic region. The project also identified findings from the black swan scenarios, including that arms control is personality agnostic and that a change of leadership in the Kremlin will not necessarily lead to a breakthrough in arms control in the short term. Additionally, the nuclear order—including the nuclear taboo—is weakening and requires immediate attention as part of any future arms control agenda. The implications of these findings are that future arms control efforts will have to work in tandem with geostrategic competition, and enhancing deterrence should be the top priority. As such, arms control mechanisms will need to be flexible, and creating time limits on agreements is one particular tool for facilitating cooperation in an era of strategic competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the project’s findings, the authors identified six opportunities for arms control after the war in Ukraine, which include specific recommendations for the United States, key actors within Europe, the P5 (the five recognized nuclear weapon states under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT]—China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States), and nonnuclear weapon states committed to strengthening norms of non-use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Trump administration should immediately pursue talks with Russia to agree to observe New START central limits for up to three years after the treaty expires in February 2026. This agreement should rely on national technical means for verification while establishing a standing arms control dialogue to provide transparency into its implementation and explore opportunities for a more permanent, long-term agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States should enhance its nuclear deterrent by preparing to upload warheads if Russia violates the three-year agreement, expanding capacity in the National Labs, and developing additional delivery platforms, including nuclear sea-launched cruise missiles and a new stand-off capability. All of these measures can be paused or rolled back in the event of a breakthrough in arms control.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Europe should develop a new strategy for deterrence and arms control that prioritizes flexibility. Specific steps for strengthening deterrence should include increased defense spending and a coordinated effort to increase defense production, such as by adopting a “comparative advantage” approach, in order to take on a greater burden-sharing role within NATO and to hedge against an uncertain future. Additionally, France and the United Kingdom should modestly expand their strategic arsenals—such as by reintroducing an air leg of the British deterrent—and France should join the NATO Nuclear Planning Group as an observer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Europe should remain open to nuclear arms control opportunities, such as time-bound cooperative efforts, and continue to promote the Vienna Document as a tool for conventional arms control and transparency building. Such efforts will not only create opportunities for engaging with Russia—and potentially China—but also demonstrate an enduring commitment to arms control and the NPT.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The NPT P5 process should establish a Crisis Stability Initiative to identify risks of nuclear escalation during the war in Ukraine through a series of dialogues aimed at sharing national perceptions throughout the conflict. The initiative should also develop a crisis stability tool kit, and the P5 should agree to a set of shared commitments regarding crisis communication and risk reduction.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;States from the Global South, or Global Middle Ground, should issue a joint statement in NPT and UN forums calling on all parties to continue to abide by the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the Outer Space Treaty. States Parties to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons should issue a joint statement in NPT forums condemning the role of nuclear threats in Russia’s war in Ukraine and stop treating all nuclear-armed states as a monolith. Instead, they should seize this unique and powerful opportunity for strengthening strategic stability by upholding norms of non-use.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This more flexible approach to arms control in an era of strategic competition admittedly comes with challenges. Any nuclear or conventional buildup could be perceived as escalatory by Moscow and Beijing. Europeans may struggle to develop a united, consistent, and coordinated strategy for deterrence and arms control. Additionally, a more competitive approach by the United States and Europe could become a self-fulfilling prophecy, undermining both prospects for arms control with Moscow and assurance among allies. It is essential, therefore, that Washington and European capitals consistently demonstrate an openness to arms control and dialogue, and put the ball in Moscow and Beijing’s court to meaningfully engage in strengthening strategic stability and ushering in a new era of arms control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is winter 2027. Europe has enjoyed two years of relative calm following a peace settlement between Russia and Ukraine in which Moscow secured territorial gains and imposed limits on Ukraine’s military forces. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been forced out of power in Kyiv. Immediately following the peace settlement, U.S. President Donald J. Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin secured an arms control agreement to maintain the central limits of the 2010 New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) for an additional five years after its expiration in 2026. The Trump administration is moving ahead with plans to withdraw the U.S. conventional military presence from Europe, and the credibility of U.S. nuclear guarantees to Europe is questionable. European governments are struggling to maintain public support for defense spending following the 2025 peace settlement. Intelligence now shows that not only has Russia ignored the agreed-upon limits on its strategic delivery systems, but it is also just weeks away from deploying a nuclear weapon in space, in violation of the Outer Space Treaty (OST). Additionally, Russia has begun amassing troops on its border with Moldova, in the contested region of Transnistria. What options does NATO have to respond?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This hypothetical scenario demonstrates the risk of chronic instability in Europe following the war in Ukraine. Russia’s regional ambitions and nuclear rhetoric, dating back at least to its 2008 invasion of Georgia, suggest that Moscow may not want stability in Europe. Instead, it is pursing instability and increasing nuclear risks to achieve its strategic objectives. The scenario also tests the limits of what is possible for arms control. In recent years, the United States has repeatedly approached Russia to re-engage in strategic stability dialogues, but Moscow has consistently refused. As a justification for suspending participation in New START in 2023, for example, Putin pointed to fundamental disagreements about Euro-Atlantic security and claimed, “They (NATO) want to inflict a strategic defeat on us and also to get to our nuclear sites.” When New START expires in February 2026, a rich historical legacy of strategic arms control could die with it, and there may be no returning to the status quo ante for arms control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CSIS Project on Nuclear Issues set out to explore prospects for arms control with Russia following an end to the war in Ukraine. The project developed four alternative futures and two black swan scenarios for the Euro-Atlantic security environment after the war ended and convened a series of scenario-based discussions with cross-generational U.S. and European experts. The alternative futures approach allowed the authors to avoid the perennial challenge of tracking a moving target and instead identify consistent trends, along with potential moments of opportunity, for strengthening strategic stability and arms control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across all six scenarios, which included variations in Russian military prowess and alliance unity, experts agreed that the United States and its allies should not assume that Russia’s territorial ambitions will be satisfied by a peace settlement with Ukraine. Instead, Moscow may actually be emboldened by the outcome of the war in Ukraine—whether favorable or unfavorable—and continue to increase reliance on nuclear threats. Another important finding was that a united Europe has the potential to become a major player in strategic stability and arms control. In her speech at the 2025 Munich Security Conference, European Union President Ursula von der Leyen said there was a “need for Europe not only to speak frankly but also to act accordingly. I believe that when it comes to European security, Europe has to do more.” Because of the interrelationship between deterrence and arms control, “doing more” may not only entail enhancing conventional deterrence but also playing a more influential role in prospects for strategic arms control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this means for the United States and Europe is that any arms control agreements will need to prioritize and work in tandem with enhancing deterrence, while allowing for flexibility in responding to an uncertain and dangerous geopolitical landscape. Historically, strategic stability has been defined in terms of the United States’ and Russia’s perception that they possess survivable second-strike nuclear forces. In 2023, the bipartisan Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States, or the Strategic Posture Commission, defined strategic stability as “A condition in which the political relations and military balance between states that pose an existential threat to each other is such that they perceive neither a compelling need nor a viable opportunity to use military force to advance their interests at the expense of the other state.” This definition allows for a broader approach to strategic stability, including nonnuclear capabilities, along with the underlying political incentives driving competition. However, to be sure, strategic stability remains a contested term. Arms control, as a tool for strengthening strategic stability, need not happen in the absence of competition, but rather can occur in a worsening security environment, between potential adversaries, without necessarily involving like-for-like exchanges. It might not even focus on capabilities but could instead facilitate communication in the midst of an ongoing rivalry. Another implication of the project’s findings is that while historically strategic stability has been a two-player game, increasing European strategic autonomy, along with the rise of China, requires rethinking what strategic stability looks like in a multiplayer game and how to strengthen it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report proceeds in three sections. First, it provides a brief summary and analysis of the six alternative futures and their implications for arms control. Second, it presents the project’s main findings. The primary findings from across the scenarios include enduring competition and a growing role for Europe, but other findings touch on the potential for arms control in the event of leadership changes and the health of international institutions and norms. Finally, the report provides an arms control agenda for the United States and Russia, Europe, the P5, and the wider international nuclear order. It identifies time-bound agreements as a likely tool for pursuing arms control in an era of strategic competition, while allowing for flexibility. The third section also identifies key questions for “player Europe” to address in considering its new role in the international system. It outlines various policy options for how Europe might pursue deterrence and arms control in tandem, ranging from extreme autonomy to bilateral alliances. The end of the war in Ukraine will not be the end of Russia’s destabilizing ambitions. The game is now on for Europe to rearm, coordinate a strategy for deterrence and assurance in the Euro-Atlantic, and embrace a more influential role in arms control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;arms-control-futures&quot;&gt;Arms Control Futures&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arms control and deterrence have worked in tandem at least since the 1967 Harmel Report, which recognized NATO’s “first function” as deterrence while also recommending a “balanced reduction of military forces” and concluding that “Military security and a policy of détente are not contradictory but complementary.” Stimson Center Co-Founder Michael Krepon’s definition of arms control, which includes a range of mechanisms—from legally binding treaties to informal agreements on crisis communication—directly ties it to deterrence: “Deterrence requires effective lines of communication, codes of conduct, tacit understandings, political compacts, and formal treaties to help prevent the battlefield use of nuclear weapons. We call these diplomatic methods of reassurance arms control. The fundamental purposes of arms control are to stabilize nuclear rivalries and reduce nuclear danger.” The end of the war in Ukraine may prove to be a unique opportunity for these arms control mechanisms, either as part of a peace settlement or in the aftermath of any political rapprochement. Given the rapidly changing state of play in European security, along with the tattered state of arms control, exploring opportunities for arms control presents a methodological challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project used an alternative futures methodology to develop scenarios for the Euro-Atlantic security environment in late 2027. The scenarios accounted for variations in adversary capabilities, along with cooperation between Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea, and for differences in NATO alliance cohesion—ranging from renewed NATO unity to the waning credibility of U.S. extended nuclear deterrence in Europe. The scenarios also incorporated a range of potential outcomes from the war in Ukraine, such as a peace settlement favorable to Russia and European security guarantees to Ukraine. The scenarios are captured in Table 1, with full descriptions provided in Appendix A, and are characterized from the perspective of the NATO alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/aCXPgXf.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Scenarios for Euro-Atlantic Security&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project also included black swan scenarios involving a change of leadership in Moscow and the use of nuclear weapons to account for significant developments that could shape the future of arms control but were not covered in the alternative futures. The scenarios were then discussed in a series of expert workshops with U.S. and European participants. Additionally, CSIS held a workshop with early-career researchers, which proved valuable in identifying a potentially important generational difference in attitudes toward institutions, as discussed below. For each scenario, participants identified (1) Russian, U.S., and European strategic objectives; (2) potential points of leverage to incentivize Russian participation in arms control; and (3) specific arms control opportunities. While the discussions largely focused on opportunities for nuclear arms control, conventional and non-kinetic capabilities were also considered in the scenario-based discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scenario 1: Bloc Competition.&lt;/strong&gt; In this scenario, NATO provides security guarantees to Ukraine as part of a peace settlement, but Russia continues to deepen its ties with China, Iran, and North Korea. The result is two competing blocs, each pursuing advanced nuclear and conventional capabilities. Russia remains determined to divide European allies, and the sustainability of U.S. support is questionable. In this scenario, the United States, Russia, and European states could be incentivized to participate in arms control for economic reasons, such as to free up resources for conventional rebuilding following the war in Ukraine. In scenario-based workshop discussions, experts assumed that Russia will use arms control to buy time and gain a strategic advantage over the United States and its allies, who will struggle to allocate the necessary resources to deter renewed Russian aggression in Europe, particularly due to a U.S. shift toward the Indo-Pacific. Attempts at nuclear arms control, however, will be challenging, as Russia continues to insist on the inclusion of French and British nuclear forces, while the United States similarly demands Chinese engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scenario 2: Strategic Disadvantage.&lt;/strong&gt; In this scenario, Russia has achieved a favorable peace settlement in the war in Ukraine and concludes that its nuclear saber-rattling had the desired effect. Moscow plans to continue relying on nuclear weapons for risk manipulation. With the war in Ukraine concluded, the United States shifts its focus away from Europe, and NATO becomes a fractured alliance struggling to uphold its security commitments. As a result, Europe is forced to become ruthlessly pragmatic and efficient in defense investments to fill a potential U.S. “deterrence gap.” Europe has limited leverage to incentivize Russia into arms control, aside from potential economic benefits. However, Europeans remain distrustful of Russia’s intentions and suspect that Moscow would use any arms control as an opportunity to build up its forces and achieve strategic supremacy in the region—potentially including further territorial aggression. In this scenario, there may be opportunities for a U.S.-Russia bilateral agreement, such as a time-limited extension of New START limits or a performative agreement similar to the 2002 Moscow Treaty. In the absence of credible U.S. nuclear guarantees, proliferation pressures increase for U.S. allies, putting the NPT at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scenario 3: Strategic Advantage.&lt;/strong&gt; The war in Ukraine ends on terms unfavorable to Russia, forcing Moscow to concede all territory gained since 2022 and weakening its partnerships with China and North Korea. The United States and key European actors provide security guarantees to Ukraine in exchange for its agreement not to join NATO, and the alliance is strengthened through an expanded dual-capable aircraft (DCA) mission and enhanced conventional deterrence. Russia faces economic constraints and political instability, creating opportunities to use economic incentives as leverage for arms control. Additionally, arms control could serve as a “PR win” for Putin by reaffirming Russia’s status as a nuclear peer with the United States while offering a face-saving option for reducing defense spending. In this scenario, NATO is eager for arms control to codify the new status quo and strengthen transparency and predictability. Options for arms control could include bilateral limits on all nuclear weapons—either through a New START follow-on agreement or a Presidential Nuclear Initiatives (PNI)–style agreement—along with recommitting to existing agreements such as the OST; however, the United States will continue to reject any reduction agreements until Beijing participates, and Moscow may take the same stance regarding France and the United Kingdom, though with limited bargaining leverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scenario 4: Disordered Competition.&lt;/strong&gt; Russia, the United States, and Europe all face economic and domestic political pressures but remain entrenched in their strategic positions. Russia makes a third attempt to seize Ukraine assuming that the United States will not intervene in Europe due to its focus on deterring China. Europe is left to deter further Russian aggression, determine the extent of its support for Ukrainian independence, and coordinate defense planning. In this scenario, arms control could center on crisis communication and risk reduction mechanisms, but options for strategic arms control would be limited. Russia will insist on French and British participation, while Europeans refuse any arms control dialogue as long as Moscow continues to threaten sovereign territories backed by nuclear threats; however, the P5 process could serve as a forum for dialogue to prevent escalation to nuclear use. Another opportunity lies in leveraging existing nuclear treaties and mobilizing the wider international community to uphold the nuclear taboo and pressure all parties to refrain from nuclear escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scenario 5: Change of Leadership in Moscow.&lt;/strong&gt; In this first black swan scenario, the war in Ukraine continues into the fall of 2025, but Russian military activity slows following reports that Putin is ill. Eventually, Putin succumbs to his illness and dies, leaving no clear successor. As a result, decisionmaking in Moscow is crippled for months. Ukraine uses this period to strengthen its frontlines and make gains in Donetsk. In this scenario, Russia’s objectives will be driven by a desire to demonstrate the credibility of a new regime, which could include securing a decisive victory in Ukraine and/or securing an agreement with the United States. The new leadership may prioritize stabilizing the economy over defense investments, in which case arms control could serve as a face-saving option for reducing strategic forces. However, it is equally possible that the new regime adopts a hardline approach to shore up its political base within the Kremlin and rejects any Western overtures for dialogue. This scenario is perhaps the most uncertain and least stable of the six, despite repeated expert claims in discussion about other scenarios that “arms control won’t be possible as long as Putin is in the Kremlin.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scenario 6: Nuclear Use.&lt;/strong&gt; In the second black swan scenario, peace negotiations are deadlocked, and Ukraine and Russia reengage in military conflict. Due to renewed European resolve to support Ukraine, NATO members launch a conventional strike on Russian forces in Ukraine, signaling their commitment to the renewed conflict and threatening Russia with a decisive battlefield defeat. In response, Russia detonates multiple sub-kiloton-yield nuclear weapons over a command post and battlefield positions in northern Ukraine, killing thousands of Ukrainian military personnel and allowing Russian forces to break through the frontline, forcing an unfavorable peace settlement on Kyiv. NATO responds conventionally, and the international community expresses widespread condemnation of Russia’s nuclear use. By 2027, however—one year after the detonation—international outrage has faded, the majority of Global South states have normalized relations with Moscow, and China has resumed support for the Russian defense industry. Prospects for arms control are mixed. On the one hand, breaking the nuclear taboo after 80 years of non-use, along with the subsequent humanitarian and environmental consequences, prompts calls for ambitious arms control measures to reduce the risks of further nuclear use. On the other hand, the lack of sustained international outrage and Russia’s argument that nuclear weapons use against a military target was justified under international law when the “existence of the state” was perceived to be at risk could suggest a normalization of nuclear threats and small-scale use. In this scenario, the wider international response could play a decisive role in shaping the prospects for arms control and preventing further nuclear use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;competitive-arms-control-and-player-europe&quot;&gt;Competitive Arms Control and “Player Europe”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two main themes emerged across all scenarios: Competition with Russia is likely to continue after the war in Ukraine, and Europe is emerging as a more significant player in deterrence and arms control in the Euro-Atlantic region. While these two trends were evident across all scenarios, two additional insights emerged from the black swan scenarios, aligning with broader findings: A change in leadership in Moscow will not necessarily lead to a breakthrough in arms control, and the nuclear taboo is weakening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;competition-with-russia-might-not-end-anytime-soon&quot;&gt;Competition with Russia Might Not End Anytime Soon&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key finding across all six scenarios is that U.S. and/or European competition with Russia is likely to continue after any peace settlement in Ukraine, and Euro-Atlantic security will not revert to the status quo ante. Throughout his rule, Putin has expressed a “persistent sense of vulnerability” and publicly voiced a fear of encirclement. In his 2007 Munich Security Conference speech, he expressed disdain for the U.S.-led global order, saying, “Unilateral and frequently illegitimate actions have not resolved any problems. Moreover, they have caused new human tragedies and created new centres of tension.” Following Russia’s 2014 invasion of Crimea, Putin declared, “we have every reason to assume that the infamous policy of containment, led in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, continues today.” Immediately before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, Putin asserted that NATO’s “main goal is to contain Russia’s development. This is the whole point. In this sense, Ukraine is simply a tool to reach this goal.” Based on our scenario analysis, Russia’s strategic objectives at the war’s conclusion could include continuing territorial advances in former Soviet states to expand a “buffer zone,” attempting further incursions into Ukraine as part of a face-saving strategy, or perceiving a peace settlement favorable to Moscow as acquiescence to Putin’s ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all of the project’s scenarios, a peace settlement over Ukraine did not readily facilitate a return to traditional arms control. This was due to enduring distrust in Moscow, Washington, and European capitals, as well as conflicting arms control priorities. Russia has repeatedly violated or suspended participation in arms control agreements. According to former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Eric Edelman and former National Security Council Senior Director for Defense Policy and Arms Control Franklin Miller, Russia has violated nine major agreements under Putin. They argue, “Given this deliberate and well-documented track record, the bar for holding Moscow accountable for its actions under any agreement it might sign regarding Ukraine’s future, much less the kinds of nuclear arms control agreements in which President Trump has also shown an interest, should be exceedingly high.” Russia’s track record was a key inhibitor of arms control across the project’s scenarios. In most cases, participants feared that Russia would attempt to use arms control both to constrain the West and to gain strategic advantage. For example, Russia could pursue limits on regional missile defenses that would asymmetrically benefit Moscow. In this context, arms control was perceived as a potential tool for undermining strategic stability. In short, the scenario analysis revealed that future strategic stability will likely depend on waiting for—and attempting to deter—the next round of Russian territorial aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of the scenario discussions indicated that Russia would reduce its reliance on nuclear weapons following the war in Ukraine. In fact, Moscow may be emboldened by the war’s conclusion, viewing its strategy of coercion as successful. Russian nuclear rhetoric evolved in tandem with its activities on the battlefield, beginning with Putin’s threat on the day of the February 24, 2022 invasion: “No matter who tries to stand in our way . . . Russia will respond immediately, and the consequences will be such as you have never seen in your entire history.” Subsequent nuclear signaling included warnings that attacks on illegally annexed Ukrainian territories could trigger nuclear responses, as well as large-scale nuclear exercises, as Russia suffered battlefield losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s rhetoric has been matched by a buildup of its nuclear forces. In congressional testimony, defense expert Austin Long catalogued new Russian nuclear platforms under development, including the SS-X-30 heavy intercontinental ballistic missile and Status-6 autonomous underwater drone. Long also warned that Russia was pursuing a nuclear posture with options that “would include limited nuclear use in dire circumstances. Yet dire circumstances, from a Russian perspective, could occur very quickly in a conflict.” Russia’s nuclear doctrine states that Russia could use nuclear weapons in response to a “critical threat” to its sovereignty. The type of action that would constitute a “critical threat” to Russian sovereignty is ambiguous, however, allowing Moscow to justify nuclear use under a broad range of circumstances. Experts consistently expressed skepticism that Russia would abandon its nuclear trajectory due to a peace settlement: If Russia emerges from the war strategically weaker, it may continue relying on nuclear weapons to compensate; if it emerges stronger, it could be emboldened to double down on its nuclear saber-rattling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experts concluded that Russia has a fundamentally different perception of the Euro-Atlantic security environment and what “strategic stability” in that context would entail. Many of their observations from the workshops, which were held under the Chatham House Rule, have been reflected in recent scholarship on the topic. As described by Kristin Ven Bruusgaard, “NATO and Russian policymakers disagree on the key challenges to crisis stability in Europe. NATO policymakers express concern that Russia may consider a direct military attack on NATO as a continuation of the war in Ukraine. Russian policymakers worry that NATO or the West is seeking to undermine the Russian state on its periphery and from within.” The scenarios all pointed to the potential for economic incentives for arms control, but any reductions or limitations with meaningful economic benefits would likely be complicated by enduring distrust, ongoing competition, and the anticipation of strategic instability. Since its invasion of Ukraine in 2014, Moscow has proven somewhat impervious to economic pressure, such as sanctions. Additionally, it appears to have either avoided or disregarded any international reputational costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;multiplayer-arms-control&quot;&gt;Multiplayer Arms Control&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second main finding of the project was that Europe is playing an increasingly significant role not only in deterrence within the Euro-Atlantic, but also in shaping prospects for future arms control agreements. Scenario-based discussions acknowledged the challenge of defining “Europe” as a geopolitical actor, particularly due to variations in threat perception, domestic politics, and nuclear status. For the purposes of this project, “Europe” primarily refers to European members of NATO, though the term can encompass a complex and diverse mix of states. In all but one of the project scenarios, U.S. and European priorities were not in clear alignment due to the U.S. shift in focus toward the Indo-Pacific and potential domestic political factors. Depending on the outcome of the war in Ukraine and the process by which any peace settlement is reached, U.S. and European objectives may further diverge, leading Europe to consider exploring greater strategic autonomy from Washington. Amid the war in Ukraine, Europe has already demonstrated its importance in conventional military capabilities. Continued investment in the European defense industrial base could ensure that Europe sustains this influence in the long term. The new €150 billion loan plan proposed by the European Commission forces participants to purchase European-made equipment and will ensure that any rapid effort to acquire new capabilities also strengthens the European defense industrial base in the long term. Additionally, France and the United Kingdom have signaled their intent to increase defense spending beyond NATO’s 2 percent target, while Poland is nearing 5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numerous experts in the scenario-based discussions pointed to Russia’s insistence that French and British nuclear forces be included in any future agreement. Russian Ambassador to the United States Anatoly Antonov has repeatedly stated that Russia’s priority is to engage France and the United Kingdom in arms control dialogue, particularly “in light of London’s recent decision to increase the maximum level of nuclear warheads by 40%,” referring to the 2021 Integrated Review. In many of the scenarios, however, Europe is expected to prioritize enhancing its conventional and nuclear deterrence capabilities, which could pose a challenge for any arms control initiatives entailing reductions or limitations on capabilities. In some scenarios, Europe appeared positioned to play a spoiler role in strategic arms control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the importance of Europe in future arms control, multiplayer arms control is further complicated by the importance of including China’s nuclear forces in any future agreement for Washington. During scenario discussions, participants generated numerous ideas for bilateral arms control, some of which are discussed below, but they were skeptical of their long-term prospects due to the need to include Beijing. The Strategic Posture Commission concluded, “The ideal scenario for the United States would be a trilateral agreement that could effectively verify and limit all Russian, Chinese, and U.S. nuclear warheads and delivery systems.” Additionally, in his February 2025 comments expressing an interest in “denuclearization” and arms control, Trump was explicit that this should include both Russia and China. Thus far, Beijing has rejected attempts at arms control on the grounds of enduring U.S. support for Taiwan and because of an asymmetry in arsenals. For example, in July 2024, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that it was suspending upcoming arms control negotiations with the United States over U.S. arms sales to Taiwan. The United States’ focus on incorporating China into arms control will also persist after the end of the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;black-swans-dont-wait-for-a-gorbachev-moment-and-the-nuclear-order-is-wobbly&quot;&gt;Black Swans: Don’t Wait for a Gorbachev Moment, and the Nuclear Order Is Wobbly&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One surprising finding from the scenario analysis was that prospects for arms control are seemingly personality agnostic. In the black swan scenario, wherein Putin dies and there is a leadership change in Moscow, arms control opportunities did not flourish, at least in the 2027 timeframe. Workshop participants pointed to the political leadership surrounding Putin, which would likely produce his replacement and share his worldview. Putin’s successor may be able to provide top-down support for rapprochement and arms control, but they would likely first need to consolidate power among traditional hardliners, build trust with U.S. and European counterparts, and surround themself with like-minded policymakers to execute their vision, as occurred in the case of Mikhail Gorbachev. An additional challenge would be reshaping public attitudes in Russia toward the West to facilitate rebuilding trust. In terms of arms control, this finding from the scenario-based discussions doesn’t rule out any potential agreements but suggests that they would likely be performative in the short term. In many ways, this finding challenges conventional wisdom that a change in leadership can produce arms control breakthroughs, such as the arrival of Gorbachev in the 1980s, and recommends a more sanguine approach to the influence of personality, even in authoritarian regimes, over arms control in the short to medium term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second black swan scenario produced an equally pessimistic conclusion in terms of prospects for future arms control. In a scenario of nuclear use, the international community succeeded in the short term but failed in the long term to hold Russia accountable, with dangerous implications for both the nuclear taboo and the wider nuclear order. The arms control architecture is now a shell of its former self. Russia has systematically undermined the practice of bilateral strategic arms control because it believes such agreements no longer serve its interests and, according to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, the United States’ interest in arms control is based on an attempt “to try to establish control over [Russia’s] nuclear arsenal and minimize nuclear risks for itself.” Additionally, the nuclear order is crumbling, and long-standing pillars of the regime, such as the NPT, risk sliding into irrelevance due to a failure to reach consensus, along with a muted international response to Russia’s nuclear saber-rattling. To be clear, the NPT does not appear to be at risk of some dramatic collapse sparked by a cascade of withdrawals; rather, it risks a gradual descent toward a hollow treaty that is still in force but lacking in political buy-in. The end of the war in Ukraine will not suddenly revive the nuclear order, so this wider challenge for arms control agreements such as the NPT and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) will also remain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final finding came primarily from next-generation experts, who posed fundamental questions about the enduring value of institutions. One participant posed the question, “How hard should we fight” to keep institutions like the NPT, but also NATO? This also reflected a geographic difference among participants, with European experts focusing on how to keep the United States engaged in NATO and preserving the alliance, whereas U.S. participants were more focused on the two-peer challenge and balancing deterrence in both Europe and the Indo-Pacific. Next-generation experts offered a creative vision for finding a balance between preserving existing institutions and pursuing new, more inclusive approaches to security and arms control, such as formalizing the role of the private sector or civil society organizations in traditional diplomatic forums. This finding not only offers a valuable framing for the future of arms control—what is worth saving?—but also demonstrates the value of cross-generational and early-career engagement in discussions about seemingly intractable security and defense challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;integrated-arms-control-in-practice&quot;&gt;“Integrated Arms Control” in Practice&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2022, CSIS published a report on integrated arms control that advocated for a more flexible approach to arms control to address a rapidly changing security environment. The report outlined a “menu of options” for pursuing arms control in an era of strategic competition, allowing for flexibility in format, verification, membership, and limits. This adaptability would enable arms control strategies to accommodate new agreements, adopt different modalities, or modify existing agreements. The end of the war in Ukraine could present an opportunity to apply the report’s concepts and draw from its menu of options to develop new arms control opportunities and a refreshed arms control agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But arms control is not the only tool for strengthening deterrence. For decades, scholars and policymakers have emphasized the need to broaden the concept of strategic stability to account for nonnuclear capabilities, as well as broader political factors and capabilities that are not easily quantifiable, such as emerging technologies like cyber. An overarching finding from this project is that strategic stability must also expand to encompass a wider range of actors; it is no longer a purely bilateral equation—if ever it was. Both China and “player Europe” will shape the strategic environment and have the potential to strengthen strategic stability through various tools, including arms control; however, it is worth remembering that arms control is but one tool for strengthening the condition of strategic stability and avoiding escalation to nuclear use. Other critical tools include deterrence and norms, which should also be considered in crafting new policy approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-return-to-us-russia-strategic-arms-control&quot;&gt;A Return to U.S.-Russia Strategic Arms Control?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most scenarios, there was no clear overlap in Russian or U.S. and European strategic objectives in arms control, nor in the capabilities they would want to see captured in any agreements. Moscow has indicated that it would want to see limits on nonnuclear capabilities, including long-range precision strike systems and missile defenses. An enduring Russian priority for decades has been to incorporate British and French nuclear forces into any future agreement, counting them toward “parity.” From the U.S. and European perspectives, the goal of future arms control agreements ranged from specific to conceptual. A primary specific interest was limiting and reducing Russian tactical nuclear weapons (TNWs). A 2024 State Department report on Russian TNWs stated that the United States “seeks to address Russian [nonstrategic nuclear weapons]” due to their ability to “alter the nature of a conflict, create the potential for uncontrolled escalation, and have strategic effects.” Other priorities could include re-establishing a commitment to existing agreements such as the OST and the CTBT. Broader objectives could include reestablishing transparency and implementing Transparency and Confidence-Building Measures (TCBMs) with Russia to improve predictability regarding the trajectory of its strategic forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realistically, treaty-based strategic arms control options may be extremely limited across the scenarios due to the crucial role of third parties. The United States will likely reject any nuclear arms control agreement that excludes China, while Beijing has maintained that it will not engage in negotiations as long as Russia and the United States possess substantially larger arsenals. A further complication arose in 2024 when China halted arms control consultations over U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, adding yet another hurdle to U.S.-China engagement on the issue. Similarly, Russia may continue to reject any nuclear arms control agreement that does not include European actors. Even within these constraints, however, opportunities for arms control may still exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One option might be for the United States and Russia to seek an agreement to continue abiding by the New START limits of 1,550 deployed warheads on 800 strategic delivery vehicles for up to three years. This would allow time for the lengthy and detailed process of negotiating a new strategic arms control agreement that includes additional actors. The agreement could be established through presidential directives, reflecting the increasingly close relationship between Trump and Putin. Such an agreement would have to rely on national technical means for verification but could also set up a standing arms control dialogue to provide transparency into the agreement’s implementation and explore opportunities for a more permanent, long-term agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, an agreement to abide by the limits set by New START could create momentum for a follow-on agreement and reduce the pressure to engage in an arms race on specific strategic systems. On the other hand, New START only limits strategic systems, meaning many of Russia’s most threatening systems in the eyes of Europe—such as novel and dual-use nonstrategic delivery vehicles like the Kh-47M2 Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missile—would likely remain unrestricted by any arms control treaty. Furthermore, while ensuring parity between Russian and U.S. strategic forces contributes to broader strategic stability, much of the treaty’s value lies in its extensive and invasive verification regime, which would be lost in a simple agreement to abide by its limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another option discussed in the scenarios was a performative arms control agreement, similar to the 2002 Moscow Treaty. Such an agreement might set an overall ceiling limit while allowing both the United States and Russia to determine their own strategic and sub-strategic limits. It could be negotiated relatively quickly, without verification, and with little or no engagement with allies. Such an agreement, however, would come with risks, including failing to account for Chinese strategic capabilities and, given Russia’s track record, potentially leaving the United States vulnerable to the consequences of Russian violations. A particular fear among Europeans is that the United States might grant Russia a sphere of influence in the Euro-Atlantic region as part of any arms control agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to any agreement, the United States will need to prepare to hedge. Specifically, it should enhance its nuclear deterrent by preparing to upload warheads if Russia no longer observes New START central limits, expanding capacity in the National Labs, and developing additional delivery platforms, to include nuclear sea-launched cruise missiles and a new standoff capability. In the past, the United States has created negotiating leverage by strengthening its conventional, nuclear, and missile defense capabilities to incentivize arms control engagement. A key advantage of many of these measures is that they can be paused or rolled back in the event of a breakthrough in arms control, providing both negotiating leverage and enhanced deterrence. If the United States can build leverage and offer opportunities for arms control engagement, the ball would remain in Moscow and Beijing’s court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;player-europe-strategic-stability-and-arms-control&quot;&gt;Player Europe, Strategic Stability, and Arms Control&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe is getting its house in order. For now, Europe seems relatively united in its objectives of deterring further Russian aggression in the region, though the specific means and sustainability of this approach are still being worked out. The real first step for Europe must be to develop a new strategy for deterrence, accounting for uncertainty in its relationship with the United States. This strategy will need to address a key question: How much strategic autonomy does Europe want vis-à-vis the United States? At one end of the spectrum is a relatively extreme form of autonomy, potentially including more independent nuclear capabilities (discussed in greater detail below), which may appeal to France and some Eastern European countries that feel the threat from Russia most acutely. At the other end is a hedging approach, in which European states maintain close relations with Washington—potentially on a more bilateral basis—while building the capacity and flexibility to act independently should the need arise. The relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom, for example, has withstood the test of time and historical challenges and should remain a priority on both sides of the Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A divide between the United States and Europe comes with significant risks. Greater strategic autonomy for Europe could lead to states unilaterally escalating with Moscow—either unintentionally or intentionally—such as by launching attacks inside Russia, whether kinetic or non-kinetic. This approach would be highly dangerous, as it could pull the continent into an uncoordinated and unwanted war while also carrying significant implications for the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, a reliance on bilateral alliances and a hedging approach could fracture European coordination in deterring Russia or leave the continent vulnerable to further aggression. This report does not offer a specific recommendation for where Europe should position itself on this spectrum of autonomy. Instead, it recommends that key European actors work together to develop a coherent strategy that enhances deterrence, allows for flexibility in the event of a U.S. withdrawal, and simultaneously strives to maintain strong ties with Washington, given the legacy of cooperation and the tangible benefits it has provided for European security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One recommendation that fulfills all of these objectives is for European states to continue increasing defense spending and coordinating their defense industrial bases. Europe could adopt a “comparative advantage” approach to defense planning by designating lead nations for specific defense investments and capabilities. For example, if one European country proves particularly efficient at producing drones, it should prioritize that capability, while another country that excels in munitions should focus on munitions production. Additionally, Europeans would need to make major investments to compensate for any withdrawal of U.S. conventional capabilities. For instance, most of NATO’s intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities rely on the United States, and Europe has yet to develop comparable capabilities. Ideally, this type of coordination could be conducted as part of NATO’s defense planning efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One key consideration for a new European defense strategy concerns independent nuclear forces. While the United States remains committed to its extended deterrence obligations to its allies, recent political shifts have prompted conversations in Europe about the credibility of that deterrent. France has been the most vocal of the European nuclear-armed states in openly discussing the concept of a European extended deterrence, with French President Emmanuel Macron repeatedly indicating his willingness to engage in such discussions with European allies. Statements from leaders in France, Germany, and Poland suggest that, in the absence of a credible and strong U.S. extended deterrent, they would be interested in pursuing additional nuclear capabilities—either through a European deterrent or independent nuclear weapons programs. Europe’s conventional investments, along with French proposals to expand its nuclear deterrent to include other European states, could complicate strategic decisionmaking for Russia. Options for enhancing European-led nuclear deterrence could include expanding French and British nuclear forces—such as adding an air leg to the British deterrent—or France becoming an observer in the NATO Nuclear Planning Group. As argued by CSIS experts Sean Monaghan and Doreen Horschig, however, debates about a European nuclear deterrent are a distraction from the real priority: strengthening conventional deterrence through increased combat power. The best option remains the continuation of a credible U.S. extended nuclear deterrent, both to prevent nuclear proliferation and to strengthen the NPT—a position that was universally acknowledged among U.S. and European workshop participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of its new strategy, Europe may also decide to develop a new arms control policy. Historically, European states have not been in perfect alignment on arms control. Countries in Eastern Europe and the Baltic states are typically skeptical of arms control, while Germany and the Netherlands are more positive, and France has historically focused its arms control efforts on the NPT, for example. But now, Europe can make or break future arms control efforts, whether that involves a new nuclear reductions treaty or conventional arms control, and it will cast a shadow over strategic considerations and balancing, especially for Moscow. A priority for the new arms control strategy should be flexibility, such as through time-limited agreements or the freedom to mix and match forces, or more informal approaches, like risk reduction measures within the P5 process. One specific opportunity might be a three-year limit on warheads in partnership with China, whereby the combined British and French nuclear forces, along with China, do not exceed a certain ceiling. Verification would rely on national technical means and open-source intelligence, so confidence in the agreement could be limited. It could provide some degree of predictability and gradually bring China into arms control dialogues. To be clear, the authors recognize that this proposal is highly unlikely not only because of China’s traditional position on arms control, but also due to France’s insistence on maintaining independence and not imposing constraints on its nuclear forces. Nonetheless, an openness to such discussions could increase pressure on Beijing and demonstrate an enduring commitment to arms control and the NPT on the part of Europe’s nuclear powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conventional arms control will also need to be a consideration in a European arms control strategy. European states remain committed to the Vienna Document, which provides a useful forum for information exchanges and transparency in conventional capabilities. The Vienna Document could prove particularly valuable in monitoring any ceasefire or peace settlement in Ukraine. A creative option, recently suggested by RAND, would involve geographic limits on conventional capabilities—specifically, limits “based on the geography of activities and deployments and perceived vulnerabilities” rather than explicit numerical caps on certain forces. The report suggests that “The sides could also agree to voluntary but coordinated self-restraint on naval and air activities in the Black and Baltic Seas and in the High North.” There are several reasons why Russia and Europe may have a common interest in geographical limits on the deployment of certain systems or activities. Russia has repeatedly linked its perception of strategic stability to the existence of a geographical buffer zone between itself and NATO. Limits on deployment locations, rather than numbers, would allow Europe to continue working toward qualitative and quantitative conventional superiority vis-à-vis Russia. This geographic approach, however, could exacerbate divisions within Europe because of different threat perceptions between Northern, Eastern, and Western European states. Such an agreement could leave one or more members of the alliance feeling left out in the cold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;risk-reduction-in-the-p5-process&quot;&gt;Risk Reduction in the P5 Process&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its challenges, the P5 process remains the best game in town for dialogue on risk reduction and laying the groundwork for multilateral strategic arms control. Established in 2009 as a signal that the P5 countries took their disarmament commitments under the NPT seriously, the P5 process has hosted a number of arms control proposals, including a missile launch notification regime, transparency into former nuclear test sites, and a formalized crisis communication channel between P5 capitals. While these have had limited success, the end of the war in Ukraine could provide a new impetus for such risk reduction efforts. An additional benefit of this approach will be the strengthening of the NPT in the process. There are at least three opportunities for the P5 process to advance arms control following the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, during the war in Ukraine, Russian military leaders apparently considered following through on their nuclear threats, bringing Europe closer to the nuclear brink than at any point since the Cold War. The war in Ukraine, therefore, should offer unique lessons for nuclear risk reduction efforts and crisis communication. The P5 should launch a Crisis Stability Initiative as a standing agenda item to first review the sources of instability during the war in Ukraine and perceptions among all parties about risks of nuclear use. The initiative should then identify tools for reducing these risks in the future by engaging a wider group of experts from nonnuclear weapon states, nongovernmental organizations, and next-generation researchers. This engagement-based approach can produce creative solutions, removed from many of the practical and political constraints of the P5 process itself, but then be tailored to the P5’s preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, based on the new Crisis Stability Initiative, the P5 could agree to a shared set of responsibilities and commitments to communicate and reduce the risks of misperception during a crisis. This might include a wider and renewed commitment to “hotlines” across all P5 members. These commitments could be included in the P5 deliverables to the NPT review process, further strengthening the nuclear order as a result. If such an initiative is too ambitious for the P5, an alternative would be a Track 2 dialogue or leveraging the P5 Track 2 and/or Young Professionals Network to identify potential shared commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final step would be for the P5 to expand their use of the common reporting form. As Mike Albertson, deputy director of the Center for Global Security Research, has argued, one of the greatest benefits of arms control is information exchanges. The common reporting form is a unique opportunity for such exchanges and would be particularly important in further socializing China with transparency building. China has become more involved in these efforts in recent years. In November 2024, for example, Chinese President Xi Jinping signed a joint understanding with then-U.S. President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to keep “human control” in nuclear decisionmaking. France and the United Kingdom have made similar statements, and Russia is the only member of the P5 refusing to make a “human in the loop” statement. Additionally, both the United States and China have notified one another of missile test launches, despite no formal agreement to do so. Continuing this trajectory with the common report form will be an important contribution to future arms control opportunities and again contribute to the NPT review process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strengthening-the-nuclear-order&quot;&gt;Strengthening the Nuclear Order&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next-generation experts asked the question, “What is worth fighting for?” among existing institutions. While it is tempting to say “all of it,” especially with regard to the nuclear order, that may be a challenge given the demise of traditional arms control tools in recent years. At least three treaties, however, remain and are worth a focused multilateral effort to maintain and strengthen: the NPT, the CTBT, and the OST. These treaties are important not only because they are some of the last remaining mechanisms with widespread international participation, including by nuclear possessors, but also because they are the foundation of nuclear norms. The NPT continues to have constraining power over nuclear proliferation, as withdrawal would likely come with extreme political and economic costs, as witnessed in the case of North Korea. This restraining power could be tested in the coming months and years, both because of Iran’s continued nuclear activities and increased enrichment, and because of concerns about allied proliferation in the face of questionable U.S. credibility. Maintaining the CTBT will not only strengthen the norm against a return to nuclear testing, which would include massive humanitarian and environmental consequences, but also slow the vertical proliferation of nuclear arsenals, especially in China. Finally, recent allegations against Russia highlighted the potentially catastrophic consequences of deploying a nuclear weapon in space, which could hold at risk international communication systems and the functioning of critical infrastructure in the United States and Europe. The OST is one of the best tools for pressuring Russia to refrain from such a move, but it requires a more robust international response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Global South or Global Middle Ground is poised to play an influential role in the arms control agenda and in upholding these treaties and norms. In addition to calling on all states to continue to observe existing treaties, these countries can take additional steps to strengthen the nuclear taboo and other nuclear norms. The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW), for example, currently has 73 full members and 94 signatories, and the treaty bans the threat of the use of nuclear weapons. While TPNW efforts to date have focused on the weapons themselves, resulting in a blanket approach that treats all nuclear possessors the same, a more targeted approach to norm-building—one that explicitly calls out bad behavior, such as threatening nuclear use as part of an illegal invasion—could both increase pressure on norm violators and strengthen the international order. States Parties to the TPNW should issue a joint statement in NPT forums condemning the role of nuclear threats in Russia’s war in Ukraine and stop treating all nuclear possessors as a monolith. Rather, they have a unique and powerful opportunity for strengthening strategic stability and reducing future nuclear risks by upholding norms of non-use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-coming-instability&quot;&gt;The Coming Instability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report has identified numerous opportunities for arms control after the war in Ukraine that prioritize enhancing deterrence and flexibility; however, these come with a host of challenges. First and foremost is the risk of an arms race, given that a buildup in U.S. and/or European conventional and nuclear forces could be perceived as escalatory by Moscow or Beijing. Not all buildups are created equal, of course, and not all buildups equate to an arms race. The risks associated with a buildup depend on its scale, speed, and perception. The buildups the authors recommend, therefore, should be accompanied by robust analysis of how they would be perceived by adversaries, inspiring risk reduction efforts to avoid escalation and falling into an action-reaction cycle. A related risk is groupthink: While this report has captured the overwhelming consensus of scenario-based discussions, there were occasional dissenters who suggested that Russia might change its course after a peace settlement in Ukraine. And while many of the report’s recommendations for enhancing deterrence can be scaled back in the event of rapprochement, they could be perceived as a lack of seriousness about arms control and inadvertently undermine dialogue or opportunities for cooperation, potentially becoming self-fulfilling prophecies. That is not in any way the authors’ intention, and above all, the authors recommend that the United States and Europe remain open to arms control opportunities and be prepared to capitalize on them when they present themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another challenge will be overcoming historical positions on what and who to include in arms control. While this report encourages flexibility in agreements to allow for hedging, some arms control positions may prove to be too entrenched to allow even short-term cooperation or dialogue. For example, missile defense has historically proven a sticking point in U.S.-Russia arms control negotiations and may be again. In reaction to the establishment of an Aegis Ashore battery in Poland in 2024, Russia lamented that U.S. missile defenses in Europe “leads to undermining strategic stability, increasing strategic risks and, as a result, to an increase in the overall level of nuclear danger.” To take another example, the above analysis demonstrates that European nuclear states could have leverage in negotiations with Moscow, which has repeatedly called for their inclusion in future agreements. But just because European nuclear states have leverage does not necessarily mean that they should, or are willing to, use it. In the era of competition, enhancing deterrence vis-à-vis Moscow will likely remain a priority, and Europe may choose to reject arms control altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coordination and unity within Europe will also be a challenge, particularly with regard to resourcing if European states refuse to raise taxes, cut domestic programs, or borrow money. Enhancing conventional and nuclear deterrence and generating leverage in arms control will require an unprecedented level of coordination among these states, particularly with regard to defense investments. The large, but not perfect, overlap between the two largest multilateral groups with the potential to shape European defense investment—the European Union and NATO—will require close coordination on the margins and a clear division of labor for all of Europe. Finding the resources to make these investments will be asymmetrically challenging for smaller European states and may require Europe to consider increasing its borrowing, taking drastic fiscal measures, or developing unprecedented coordination to increase efficiencies. A coordinated European position on arms control will also be a challenge, given historically divergent positions between Eastern and Western European states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these challenges, Euro-Atlantic stability is on the line. Many states in Europe perceive the coming years as decisive in determining whether Putin’s ambitions are checked and whether or not nuclear weapons are used. Putin has demonstrated that he is not someone to be trusted, so any future promises or arms control agreements should be accompanied by hedging and continued commitments to enhance deterrence in Europe. European states appear ready to lean in on deterrence and defense, and, as the authors argue, arms control should be part of a renewed competitive European strategy. Arms control remains a crucial tool for strengthening strategic stability and reducing the risks of nuclear use. The game is now on to develop new arms control solutions for an era of competition, and for Europe to step into a leading role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Six Scenarios for 2027&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scenarios 1–4 were based on an alternative futures approach with variation in alliance unity and adversary capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Table A-1: Scenarios for Euro-Atlantic Security&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The additional two scenarios are black swans, included to account for significant developments that could shape the future of arms control but were not covered in the alternative futures. Each scenario was analyzed to identify (1) Russian, U.S., and European strategic objectives; (2) potential points of leverage to incentivize Russian participation in arms control; and (3) specific arms control outcomes that could result from each scenario. Below is the scenario text provided to workshop participants, along with a summary of discussion points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scenario-1-bloc-competition&quot;&gt;SCENARIO 1: BLOC COMPETITION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine ends through a negotiated settlement. Russia cements its control over the territory it occupies as of December 2024. The United States and its allies provide Ukraine with security assurances in the event of future aggression, and Russia offers written negative security assurances. Ukraine renounces its aspiration to join NATO. Cooperation among U.S. adversaries deepens to include formalized technology transfers and increasingly large and frequent joint exercises, sometimes involving nuclear-capable delivery systems. Enhanced cooperation enables Russia and China to expand their diplomatic and economic inroads in Latin America and Africa. Russia, China, and North Korea announce a trilateral arrangement to develop and share technologies related to nuclear submarines. Iran declares that it has constructed a nuclear weapon but will remain in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The United States remains committed to NATO and its Indo-Pacific allies. The Trump administration maintains the United States’ existing agreements as of December 2024, including AUKUS, the Nuclear Consultative Group, and NATO. The United States, its allies, and its adversaries seek to rapidly expand their defense capabilities, leading to an arms race and a large military buildup on all sides. Both blocs make advances in potentially destabilizing delivery system technologies, including theater-range, dual-capable systems. European allies make limited progress in implementing a continental air and missile defense system, with some allies further ahead than others. U.S. nuclear modernization proceeds according to schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic Objectives:&lt;/strong&gt; In this scenario, Russian objectives could include a desire to buy time to rebuild its forces and make another attempt at seizing Ukrainian territory or elsewhere in the former Soviet space. Moscow does not appear to have learned a lesson on the value of cooperation from the war in Ukraine, and there have been no other signs that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s wider strategic ambitions have abated. As a result, Russia’s strategic objectives also include continuing to attempt to divide the United States from its European allies, such as through ongoing disinformation campaigns and gray zones attacks on NATO members, and continuing trends set by Russian cyber operators like COLDRIVER, which seek to leak potentially disruptive political information to sow political unrest in rival states. Perhaps ironically, one of Russia’s strategic objectives may be in perfect alignment with Washington’s in this scenario: a shift in U.S. resources from the European to Indo-Pacific theaters. For the United States and Europe, there are shared objectives of focusing on domestic stability and balancing budgets. For Washington, this will mean encouraging more burden-sharing with allies, such as increased conventional capabilities; however, European allies may have a contrary objective of limiting defense spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incentives and Opportunities for Arms Control:&lt;/strong&gt; In terms of arms control leverage, one of the best tools for incentivizing Moscow to participate in arms control in this scenario could include economic factors and relief, so as to avoid a costly arms race. This would not only free up resources for Moscow to rebuild conventionally following the war in Ukraine but also pause Western buildups, giving Russia an opportunity to attempt to gain some strategic advantage. One particular limitation for the United States in this scenario, based on statements by the previous and current Trump administrations, will be the importance of including China in any future strategic arms control limitations, as the current administration seems to be picking up where the previous administration left off, with its current position nearly identical to the one put forward by president Trump in 2020, when he called for arms control that “includes not only Russia, but also China.” To summarize, in this scenario experts assumed that Russia will be using arms control to buy time and gain strategic advantage over the United States and its allies, which will be struggling to devote the necessary resources to deterring renewed Russian aggression in Europe, particularly because of a U.S. shift to the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scenario-2-strategic-disadvantage&quot;&gt;SCENARIO 2: STRATEGIC DISADVANTAGE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine ends through a negotiated settlement that advantages Russia. Ukraine officially cedes the Donbas and Crimea, along with much of Kherson, Kharkiv, and Zaporizhzhia Oblasts. Western leaders warn Russia against further aggression in Ukraine but offer no formal security guarantees. Russia imposes limits on the size of Ukraine’s military and forces Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky out of power. Following the conclusion of the war, Russia begins to amass troops in Transnistria, on the border with Moldova. North Korea successfully tests a new nuclear warhead design, which it developed in partnership with Russia. Russia deepens its cooperation with China and Iran on disinformation efforts targeting the United States and its allies. The Trump administration hints repeatedly that it will withdraw from NATO unless allies increase their defense spending to 3.5 percent of GDP. The Trump administration maintains U.S. participation in AUKUS but withdraws from the Nuclear Consultative Group and considers downsizing the U.S. nuclear mission. U.S. allies face heated internal debates about defense spending; some hold defense spending constant, while a handful move toward anti-nuclear positions. The Netherlands considers joining the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. U.S. nuclear modernization falls behind schedule, with the Sentinel and Columbia programs experiencing multiyear delays. Russia rapidly fulfills its planned conventional military expansion, while Europe struggles to keep pace due to funding constraints and coordination challenges. Europe’s defense industrial base stagnates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic Objectives:&lt;/strong&gt; Having achieved a favorable peace settlement after the war in Ukraine, Russia’s strategic objectives in this scenario would likely include continuing to advance its regional ambitions and maintaining pressure on NATO so as to further divide Washington from its European allies. Moscow, and others, may take away a lesson from the war in Ukraine that nuclear bullying deterred Western intervention and divided allied support for extended nuclear deterrence. They may continue to rely on this strategy in pursuing other regional aggression, such as in Moldova or Georgia. With the war concluded, the Trump administration feels free to shift capabilities and focus to the Indo-Pacific, largely leaving the Europeans to deter for themselves and work out internal disputes. European strategic objectives thus include preserving the alliance, strengthening regional deterrence and security without U.S. conventional support (with the long-term prospects for extended nuclear deterrence in question), and balancing domestic pressure to cut defense spending now that the war in Ukraine has officially concluded. In this scenario, European states will have to become ruthlessly pragmatic and efficient: They will need to fill the U.S. conventional “deterrence gap,” coordinate their defense industrial bases, and decide how to maintain and strengthen extended nuclear deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incentives and Opportunities for Arms Control:&lt;/strong&gt; Leverage over Russia will likely be limited in this scenario due to U.S. disinterest in Europe and the shift of resources and focus to the Indo-Pacific. The best option for leverage would be a European conventional buildup, along with an increased British and French nuclear presence and commitment to deterrence. For example, if France joined the Nuclear Planning Group and/or extended a nuclear “umbrella” over states in Eastern Europe, including Ukraine, this could slow Russian ambitions in the region and force Russia to the negotiating table to avoid a costly arms race and dangerous standoff. Russia would likely insist on French and British forces being included in any nuclear agreement. As Russia seeks to rebuild conventionally, Europe could also have economic leverage, depending on what happens to seized Russian assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scenario-3-strategic-advantage&quot;&gt;SCENARIO 3: STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine ends through a negotiated settlement that favors Ukraine. Ukraine legally cedes Crimea without officially conceding the Donbas, most of which remains under Russian occupation. Russia cedes the other territory that it seized since its full-scale invasion on February 24, 2022. The United States and key European allies provide strong security guarantees in the event of future Russian aggression, and NATO commits to admitting Ukraine into the alliance by 2035. Cooperation between U.S. adversaries largely ends following the conclusion of the war in Ukraine. Russia provides no additional support to the Iranian and North Korean nuclear and missile programs, and Russia’s “no limits” partnership with China produces no meaningful outputs. The United States remains actively engaged in NATO and with its allies in the Indo-Pacific. There are no significant changes to the United States’ global force posture. NATO expands its conventional superiority over Russia, which faces economic troubles and struggles to rebuild and expand its conventional forces. The United States expands the NATO DCA mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic Objectives:&lt;/strong&gt; Rebuilding the Russian economy and ensuring domestic stability would likely be Moscow’s primary strategic objective in this scenario. If Russia chooses to continue pursuing its regional ambitions, it will need to rebuild conventionally and/or increase reliance on nuclear weapons, but will have limited resources for doing so. Another objective will be face-saving for the Putin regime following a less-than-favorable outcome of the war that cost hundreds of thousands of Russian lives. For the United States and Europe, one of the objectives will be pursuing an arms control agreement that codifies the state of play, limiting a return to conventional and nuclear competition in the Euro-Atlantic region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incentives and Opportunities for Arms Control:&lt;/strong&gt; This scenario offers the best prospects for arms control, whereby Russia could use arms control negotiations to demonstrate its great power status and parity with the United States, while also achieving cost savings that would allow it to focus on rebuilding the economy and domestic stability. Interestingly, even in this scenario, many of the workshop participants still doubted that Russia would give up its territorial ambitions in the region and thought that it could actually feel more encircled because of the outcome of the war. The short term, therefore, could prove to be a favorable environment for cooperation; but over the long term, the risk of a return to competition would remain. Arms control options for this scenario could include U.S.-Russia limits on tactical nuclear weapons either through a treaty or Presidential Nuclear Initiatives–style agreement, a new version of a Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty, along with informal risk reduction measures such as a joint commitment to maintain a “human in the loop” in nuclear decisionmaking, exercise and training notifications, and a recommitment to existing agreements such as the Outer Space Treaty. Assuming the United States maintains its position that China must be included in any strategic nuclear arms control, even in this scenario there would be limits on the ambition of an agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scenario-4-disordered-competition&quot;&gt;SCENARIO 4: DISORDERED COMPETITION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine ends in a settlement similar to that in Scenario 1, but Russia violates the agreement after a year in a renewed invasion, which quickly settles into a grinding stalemate. The West, facing economic constraints and flagging public support, fails to uphold its loose security guarantees to Ukraine. In response, Ukraine covertly initiates an indigenous nuclear program, which both Russia and the United States quickly discover. After the initial peace settlement in Ukraine, cooperation between U.S. adversaries largely ends. This cooperation remains limited despite Russia’s renewed invasion. Russia provides no additional support to the Iranian and North Korean nuclear and missile programs, and its relationship with China produces no meaningful outcomes. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran, dies, leading to a pro-democracy movement that drives a wedge between Russia and Iran. The Trump administration remains in NATO but significantly scales back U.S. participation and activity in the alliance. The administration makes it clear to both adversaries and allies that its primary focus is China and the Indo-Pacific. U.S. nuclear modernization falls behind schedule, with the Sentinel and Columbia programs experiencing multiyear delays. Russia faces economic challenges and struggles to rebuild and expand its conventional forces. European allies, facing similar challenges, struggle to expand the European defense industrial base. Meanwhile, U.S. and Russian nuclear modernization efforts face delays, while China rapidly expands and modernizes its nuclear force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic Objectives:&lt;/strong&gt; Russia, the United States, and Europe would all be facing economic and domestic pressure to de-escalate in this scenario; however, they may also be deeply entrenched in their positions. Russia’s objectives would include decisively defeating Ukraine on its third attempt at invasion and could include perceiving the U.S. shift away from Europe as a sign of success in its approach, if not tacit consent. Economic pressures and the continued loss of Russian troops put time pressure on Moscow to secure a decisive victory. For Washington, strategic objectives would include deterring China from starting an opportunistic war while Russia stirs up mischief in Europe, particularly as 2027 is the year Chinese President Xi Jinping indicated China should be prepared for a full-scale invasion of Taiwan. Europe’s strategic objectives would be deterring further Russian aggression and supporting Ukraine in winning the war and pushing back Russia, including through the provision of advanced conventional weapons and, potentially, European troops on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incentives and Opportunities for Arms Control:&lt;/strong&gt; In this scenario, leverage and prospects for arms control would likely focus more on crisis communication and risk reduction. For the United States, any nuclear arms control efforts would need to include Beijing, which would limit opportunities for treaties or strategic arms reductions or limitations in the scenario given the heightened tensions between Washington and Beijing. A key priority for all states would be avoiding escalation to nuclear use and the risk of a nuclear exchange over the outcome of the war in Ukraine. European capitals could appeal to Moscow and Washington to recommit to crisis communication channels and utilize the P5 process to increase transparency regarding threat perceptions and nuclear doctrine amid the ongoing war. Another opportunity would be leveraging existing nuclear treaties and engaging the broader international community to uphold the nuclear taboo and pressure all parties to refrain from nuclear escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scenario-5-change-of-leadership-in-moscow&quot;&gt;SCENARIO 5: CHANGE OF LEADERSHIP IN MOSCOW&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the spring of 2027, rumors spread across Europe that Putin is critically ill. The Kremlin does not respond; however, weeks of Russian inaction on the front lines of Ukraine and signs of intense activity within the Kremlin alert European countries that this time, the rumors may be more credible. Sensing an opportunity, Ukraine begins moving troops and matériel to support a second incursion into Kursk Oblast. Since Trump’s return to office, an uneasy peace agreement has kept the front lines of the war in Ukraine frozen in place since February 2025. Nearly two weeks after the rumors first circulate, Russian state media announces Putin’s death and the appointment of a temporary president. Elections for Putin’s successor are scheduled to take place in 14 days—exactly one month after the initial rumors of his death. Public support appears to be split among several status quo candidates, with no reformist contenders making it to the final rounds of voting, but a pro-war hardliner emerges as the winner. What at first appears to be a rapid and smooth transition of power quickly unravels amid allegations of fraud and electoral interference. A schism rapidly forms within the siloviki, who debate whether to double down on reopening the front in Ukraine or prioritize rebuilding the economy. Russian political decisionmaking is paralyzed for nearly a month, allowing Ukraine to expand its territorial gains in Kursk. As the dust settles in Moscow and the new leader consolidates power by mid-summer 2027, the Kremlin vows that “the Nazi regime in Ukraine and their co-conspirators in the West will pay an unimaginable price for meddling in the affairs of Russia” and declares that the Kursk offensive was “designed to take advantage of Russia at its most vulnerable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic Objectives:&lt;/strong&gt; For Russia, strategic objectives in this scenario would include solidifying the credibility of the new regime, which could involve securing a decisive victory in Ukraine and demonstrating a continued hardline stance to domestic political audiences. Washington may view the change in leadership as an opportunity for arms control, including efforts to ensure the security of Russian TNWs. European strategic objectives could include attempting to build a more favorable relationship with the new leadership in Moscow while preventing any major territorial ambitions or advances. However, they would also likely continue to prioritize a Ukrainian victory, leading European states to seize the opportunity to increase aid to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incentives and Opportunities for Arms Control:&lt;/strong&gt; This scenario could present unique opportunities for arms control. The new leadership in Moscow might view high-level arms control dialogues as a means to showcase regime stability and assert its role on the global stage. It may also take a different approach from Putin and prioritize stabilizing the economy over defense investments, in which case arms control could serve as a face-saving option for reducing strategic forces. Experts considered it to be just as likely, however, that the new regime will commit itself to a hardline approach to consolidate its political base within the Kremlin and reject any Western overtures for dialogue. One surprising finding from this scenario was that prospects for arms control appear to be largely personality-agnostic for Moscow, as leadership continues to be shaped by an oligarchy rather than a single individual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scenario-6-nuclear-use&quot;&gt;SCENARIO 6: NUCLEAR USE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early 2025, the Trump administration seeks to end the war in Ukraine through a negotiated settlement. While Ukraine is willing to negotiate, the Kremlin refuses to compromise on its maximalist demands. Following a year of deadlock, during which Russia gradually gains ground, the United States’ European allies provide Ukraine with a large number of long-range missiles in an effort to compel Putin to compromise. Despite the Kremlin’s threats to escalate, Ukraine uses the missiles to strike military and dual-use targets in western Russia. Two weeks into Ukraine’s missile campaign, in early 2026, a Taurus strike kills Chief of the Russian General Staff Valery Gerasimov at a command post in southwestern Russia. Twenty-four hours later, without warning, Russia detonates a sub-kiloton-yield nuclear weapon over a command post in central Ukraine. Putin declares that support for Ukraine has brought the West to “the precipice of Armageddon.” The strike inflicts limited civilian casualties. The United States, the United Kingdom, and France launch a conventional strike of limited effectiveness against the Russian military unit responsible, which is stationed in western Russia. Putin does not retaliate, and the war in Ukraine drags on with continued U.S. aid and restrictions on Ukraine’s use of Western missiles. The international community initially presents a united front in condemning Russia’s nuclear strike, with India discontinuing its purchases of Russian gas and China cutting off support for Russia’s defense industry. A year after the detonation, however, international outrage begins to fade. Many developing states, particularly in Africa and the Middle East, normalize relations with Russia, and China quietly resumes its support for Russia’s defense industry. Three years after the detonation, the war in Ukraine has ended, and—apart from the United States and its allies—most states have resumed normal relations with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic Objectives:&lt;/strong&gt; Nuclear use ultimately brought Russia military victory with only short-term political and economic costs; therefore, Russia’s objectives would include solidifying its gains in Ukraine, rebuilding economically, and potentially continuing to expand in the region, backed by nuclear threats that have now proven credible. For the United States and its European allies, the strategic objective will be deterring further Russian aggression and nuclear use in the Euro-Atlantic region. This will require building up both conventional and nuclear capabilities, along with strengthening the credibility of NATO’s deterrent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incentives and Opportunities for Arms Control:&lt;/strong&gt; Prospects for arms control in this scenario would be mixed and largely dependent on the international response. On the one hand, breaking the nuclear taboo after 80 years of non-use, along with the subsequent humanitarian and environmental consequences, should provide an opportunity to highlight the dangers of nuclear weapons and rally international support for new arms control initiatives, as occurred following the Cuban Missile Crisis. On the other hand, the lack of sustained international outrage and Russia’s justification that nuclear weapons use against a military target—when the “existence of the state” was perceived to be at risk—is permissible under international law could signal a normalization of nuclear threats and small-scale use. In this scenario, the broader international response could play a decisive role in prospects for arms control and preventing further nuclear use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When disasters strike, whether from natural causes like earthquakes, hurricanes, and typhoons, or man-made causes such as conflict or famine, the United States has swiftly responded by mobilizing funding, coordinating emergency responses, and deploying teams to directly alleviate suffering in countries around the world. The United States has reliably mobilized when allies and partners are in need of aid during their most vulnerable moments, such as its leadership during the 2014–2016 Ebola crisis, which led to fewer than a dozen cases being treated on U.S. soil, and its emergency responses to devastating storms like the 2004 tsunami in Aceh, Indonesia, and Typhoon Haiyan in 2013 in the Philippines, a key U.S. security partner. This has caused nations the world over to look to the United States for leadership during crises, understanding that the American people—among the world’s most generous—care about the lives of their neighbors near and far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This legacy has enjoyed bipartisan support in Congress for decades, but has recently become a flashpoint in the second Trump administration’s plan to “usher [in] a Golden Age for America by reforming and improving the government bureaucracy to work for the American people.” One of the president’s day one executive orders imposed a “90-day pause in United States foreign development assistance for assessment of programmatic efficiencies and consistency with United States foreign policy.” In the 80 days since, the order has already had serious consequences for humanitarian assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The executive order granted the secretary of state the authority to waive the pause for specific programs. Nevertheless, confusion reigns as to whether humanitarian assistance can continue, and if so, what kind, how much, and to what extent, as well as whether humanitarian agencies will get paid for their work. Subsequent efforts to shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) as an independent entity have added considerable turmoil into the mix, and a series of lawsuits have raised questions about whether government actions can continue. Most recently, the Supreme Court ruled that the U.S. government did not need to immediately pay $1.5 billion for work already performed in accordance with U.S. government contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that 83 percent of USAID agreements would be terminated, including many that had previously been granted a full or partial waiver. In late March, a leaked list reportedly shared with Congress indicated that the administration had terminated 5,341 programs, accounting for an even higher 86 percent of total USAID programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the Trump administration has revealed plans to “realign certain USAID functions” to the State Department by July 1, 2025. These functions include global health support and humanitarian assistance, albeit with a much-reduced footprint and an as yet undefined structure. This presents an opportunity for the administration to build upon what worked in the provision of humanitarian assistance and step away from what did not serve U.S. interests. In order to do so, the administration must take stock of the consequences of what it has dismantled and where confusion exists about its directives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the State Department, the primary goal of humanitarian assistance is to save lives and alleviate suffering by ensuring that vulnerable and crisis-affected individuals receive assistance and protection. It often entails providing for basic human needs, including shelter, protection from violence, adequate food, clean drinking water, sanitation services, medicine and medical care, education, and other needs during crises. Uninhibited humanitarian access is essential for delivering this aid. In his confirmation hearing, Secretary Rubio affirmed he would use “all the authorities” of his office to ensure that humanitarian organizations—including those funded by the U.S. government—have safe, unfettered access to conflict-affected populations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initial State Department guidance on implementing the aid pause exempted “emergency food assistance.” However, it seemed as though the freeze would cover broader humanitarian aid. It was also unclear whether “emergency food assistance” would include the cash-based Emergency Food Security Program or only the in-kind Food for Peace, which procures U.S. farm commodities and is politically popular on both sides of the aisle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten days into the near-total foreign aid “stop-work” order, Secretary Rubio issued a waiver for “life-saving humanitarian assistance.” This directive includes permission to provide, “core life-saving medicine, medical services, food, shelter and subsistence assistance, as well as supplies and reasonable administrative costs necessary to deliver such assistance.” In practice, the implementation of the lifesaving waiver has been much less straightforward. Implementing partners submitted requests for waivers but variably received no response; received responses from a variety of different individuals in the administration awarding them a partial waiver (sometimes framed as a “partial suspension”); saw the waivers they received reversed; or saw their programs previously under a waiver terminated, and then restated, sometimes multiple times. Some programs that had been granted lifesaving waivers were mistakenly terminated, then later reinstated, such as the World Food Programme’s work in 14 impoverished countries. An outgoing administration official involved in the waiver process testified to Congress that officials in charge were offering changing and increasingly narrow definitions of “lifesaving.” Even some programs with “lifesaving” in their award title that provided aid into countries such as Afghanistan were still ultimately terminated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the media coverage of the administration’s effort to suspend aid programs has focused on the attempt to roll USAID into the State Department, pare its staff down from thousands to a few hundred, remove the agency from the Ronald Reagan Building in downtown Washington, D.C., and ensure it follows orders originating from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by President Trump’s senior advisor, Elon Musk. Now that the Trump administration has notified Congress of these plans, the merger seems imminent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reports have also indicated the extensive knock-on effects on USAID’s partners, grantees, and contract recipients, including local organizations in countries receiving U.S. assistance. Tens of thousands of jobs at home and abroad are at risk, as are entire organizations and programs that support health, education, democracy, agricultural development, environmental protection, and entrepreneurship, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;humanitarian-implications&quot;&gt;Humanitarian Implications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aid pause and terminations are likely to have substantial short- and long-term effects on humanitarian assistance. The expanded waiver for “life-saving” activities is welcome, but thus far, program suspension remains the default standard operating procedure. Alarmingly, for a month, DOGE staff essentially shut down USAID’s payment system, meaning that even if humanitarian agencies received approval to work under the waiver, they could not obtain reimbursement for the costs of doing so. More than two months later, humanitarian organizations are still struggling to obtain payment for the work they have performed for a number of reasons. First, USAID leadership has prioritized payments for work performed prior to February 13 and deprioritized payments for terminated awards and awards that are continuing. In practice, this has meant that a number of organizations are not receiving payments. Second, DOGE has implemented a layered process for reviewing disbursements that are paid via the Department of the Treasury or the Department of Health and Human Services, the two U.S. federal government entities that traditionally disburse USAID payments, as USAID is not a disbursement agency. The extra layer of review without feedback going back to USAID officers familiar with programs or to implementing partners themselves has led to a rash of errors, further complicating payments to the partners that were authorized to receive them in principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This catch-22 situation has disrupted food and healthcare for vulnerable people in war-torn Sudan; schooling for Malian refugees in Mauritania; HIV/AIDS prevention worldwide; and response efforts to Marburg disease in Tanzania, Mpox in Central and Eastern Africa, and Ebola in Uganda. Commodities aimed at helping communities in dire need have piled up unused in places facing severe malnutrition and threat of famine, and items already procured remain stuck on ships, unable to be put to use upon reaching their intended destinations. Over the weekend of April 5, nearly all humanitarian programs in Syria were terminated, leaving only one remaining USAID-funded program left standing; the same weekend, all humanitarian programs in Yemen and Afghanistan were terminated. With 80 percent of Yemen’s population, nearly 70 percent of Syria’s population, and half of Afghanistan’s population in need of aid, these three crises alone represent nearly 64 million people in need of humanitarian assistance. The resulting suffering, illness, and death is entirely preventable. The likely long-term human capital losses pose a huge threat to economic growth and prosperity in developing and wealthy countries alike. U.S. citizens will feel this disruption in the coming months if disease outbreaks are unable to be stopped and permeate U.S. borders. Early estimates suggest that the global health impacts will be substantial, with more than 100,000 additional deaths from malaria expected, as well as sizeable increases in paralytic polio, tuberculosis, and drug-resistant tuberculosis. Likewise, 11.2 million newborns are likely to miss out on critical postnatal care within two days of their birth, and 1 million children will not receive treatment for severe acute malnutrition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vulnerable communities will also have to face a world, for the first time in decades, that is far less capable of responding to human crises, such as the violence, instability, and conflict that cause mass displacement, including the outflow of refugees into neighboring countries. U.S. humanitarian leadership and financing contribute to the implementing agencies that act as migration management tools and help people fleeing harm find assistance closer to home. Taking a preventative approach by addressing the root causes of suffering is also the more humane approach, as no person wants to flee their home due to violence or disaster. As the number of displaced persons balloons globally, having more than doubled over the last 10 years, the survival strategies people use will only become more costly and unpredictable absent U.S. support. This vacuum also puts these populations at even greater risk of sexual exploitation and abuse, trafficking, child marriage, and other exploitative situations. Although the waiver has allowed some humanitarian programming to resume, organizations find that even when they can carry on operations in one country, they cannot necessarily do the same thing elsewhere. In Ethiopia, the waiver allows for the provision of food aid to millions of people affected by multiple years of drought and the aftermath of civil war. But agencies have no guidance on whether they can rehire the program staff and truck drivers fired due to the aid pause. This leaves the available food rotting in warehouses in Djibouti, a scenario unfortunately duplicated in many other emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is likely that disruptions will continue to evolve, as four main lawsuits—J. Does 1-26 v. Elon Musk, Global Health Council v. Donald J. Trump, AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition v. Department Of State, and American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, et al. v. United States Office of Personnel Management—filed in response to the workforce cuts and aid freeze have now entered the U.S. courts of appeals. The administration has filed various “motions to stay” and thus will not be required to reinstate employees or disperse payments during the appeals process. Any repayments or employee reinstatements resulting from the litigation will likely occur months or years in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the humanitarian ecosystem is extremely fragile, with organizations often living paycheck to paycheck. Many organizations do not have the means to contest administration decisions and will simply need to cease operations entirely and potentially close their doors. Resources were vastly unevenly allocated between international implementing partners of USAID and local humanitarian organizations even before the review began, meaning that the partners closest to crises and communities on the ground may have a harder time advocating for their operations or filling the gaps left by U.S. disinvestment. The Network for Empowered Aid Response (NEAR) reported that more than 13.5 million people, including women, children, and marginalized communities, have lost access to services previously provided by 120 of its members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;humanitarian-brain-drain&quot;&gt;Humanitarian Brain Drain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;USAID has long invested in the knowledge systems needed to ensure effective humanitarian efforts. For example, to ensure that emergency food assistance (both cash and in-kind) addresses situations of acute food insecurity, the agency has invested in major data collection and analysis systems that provide accurate and timely information to support aid allocation decisions. These include the Famine Early Warning System Network (FEWS NET) and the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) initiative, both of which have greatly enhanced understanding of the global acute food insecurity situation and outlook. Researchers for FEWS NET provide forecasting information eight months prior to food security crises emerging and allow humanitarian workers and policymakers the opportunity to plan and prioritize where aid should go in line with the forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its important humanitarian role, FEWS NET received a stop-work order in connection with the aid suspension. As of this writing, its website is non-functioning. The absence of these data tools will have serious negative effects on the capacity to make intelligent humanitarian assistance decisions, particularly with regard to food aid, even where the waiver is available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;USAID’s own website is likewise inaccessible as of this writing, except for a notice that all direct-hire USAID personnel, with exceptions for mission-critical functions, have been placed on administrative leave globally, and the agency’s online knowledge management tools no longer provide real-time information. The Development Experience Clearinghouse (DEC) long provided online access to downloadable technical and program documentation dating back to USAID’s establishment in 1961, including many program and project evaluations. But its website is no longer functioning, abruptly leaving those documents inaccessible. The foreignassistance.gov site, which offers a wealth of budgetary and financial data on aid programs administered by USAID and other U.S. government agencies, remains up and running, and at the time of writing, was last updated March 7, 2025. And the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) program, which includes nationally representative surveys of households, malaria indicators, and data on health facilities in over 90 low- and middle-income countries, saw their USAID-funded programs terminated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent report on the state of open humanitarian data by the Humanitarian Data Exchange anticipates that some important humanitarian data is at risk of becoming inaccessible or out of date due to recent funding cuts. Timely humanitarian data is critical to inform real-time decisions about aid allocations, including where needs are most acute and what types of populations are in need. It also provides important insights into how other trends such as conflict or weather dynamics are impacting communities in need. These data inform aid implementers’ security considerations, ensuring that aid workers and recipients of aid have information that they need to safely continue their work. Other information channels that are crucial to ensure aid worker safety, such as the USAID-funded notification system in conflict zones, were affected by the aid freeze. This imperils aid workers, as it shuts down the channel they usually use to notify the U.S. military of their location so that they are not accidentally at risk in the course of a military operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;USAID and the Department of State have also historically funded important efforts relevant to monitoring, collecting, and reporting data related to global conflicts. One such effort whose data sources could be impacted by the widespread aid cuts is Armed Conflict Location &amp;amp; Event Data (ACLED), which previously received funding from the Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations at the Department of State and from several bureaus at USAID. According to Clionadh Raleigh, founder of ACLED, its researchers spend the majority of their time sourcing data from a variety of reliable local sources on crisis and conflict zones. Yet many of these local sources have scaled down operations or ceased them entirely due to funding freezes. U.S.-supported foreign-language media outlets have also been impacted, as well as humanitarian implementers who produce open-source data and researchers who create humanitarian datasets. Many of these are now not only unable to produce reliable open-source data but may be unemployed. Since these sources were designed to monitor conflict and produce data in areas that are hard to reach and where other sources are not available, the potentially permanent erasure of this data makes it even harder for those seeking to aid affected populations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The administration’s recent actions also affect weather and navigation data sources that may have impacts on humanitarian forecasting and national security more broadly. These foreshadow potential erosions in the quality of weather and atmospheric data critical to the functioning of the U.S. shipping, farming, and disaster response industries, as well as to U.S. allies and partners around the globe. The administration reportedly fired and then reinstated hundreds of employees from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. agency that provides critical data on weather patterns around the globe. This follows earlier cuts and retirements that, together, are set to decrease the total federal workforce by 25 percent. The implications of this for humanitarian aid are also significant. Through NOAA, the United States provided critical weather forecasting data and early warning on hurricanes, tsunamis, wildfires, floods, and other severe weather events to partner countries around the globe. In addition, it helps ships navigate by providing data on marine conditions, provides information to warn of space weather that could damage the U.S. electrical grid, provides information that helps farmers optimize their crops, and helps with disaster response, including responding to oil spills. There are substantial national security dependencies on NOAA as well, from its unmatched contributions to defense and operational readiness to its capture of data in harsh environments, including the Arctic and underwater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these functions help position the United States as a technological leader that other nations can rely on, a legacy which may now be at risk. The erosion of NOAA’s workforce may compromise the quality and breadth of the data it is able to provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This embargo on knowledge about foreign aid, including humanitarian assistance, makes a robust rational policy debate impossible. Even where there is consensus, or the potential to develop broad agreements, the sudden absence of documents and data precludes transparent, democratic governance of aid programs. While policymakers and humanitarian organizations are often operating with imperfect information about crises, eliminating key data sources or degrading the ones that exist could create blind spots for the United States and other countries about issues that could have impacts well beyond their borders, such as another global pandemic, a famine, or a conflict that could spur a refugee crisis. It could also fuel misinformation claims by parties to conflicts around the world who may claim that a conflict does not exist or cast doubt on its impacts. The people who are most harmed are those who are most vulnerable to the impacts of conflict and humanitarian crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;who-will-mind-the-gap&quot;&gt;Who Will Mind the Gap?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The humanitarian finance implications of freezing U.S. aid are devastating. The United States is by far the largest humanitarian donor globally. Last year, 42 cents of every dollar of humanitarian aid reported to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) came from the U.S. government. The $14 billion that the United States provided exceeded the $10 billion in total humanitarian assistance from the next five largest donors combined—Germany, the European Commission, the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Saudi Arabia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is highly doubtful that other traditional donors will step in to fill the gap created by the U.S. aid pause and the prospect of reduced resources going forward. Even before the Trump administration took office, the European Commission and the biggest donors among EU member states—Germany, France, and the Netherlands—announced aid cuts in light of faltering economies, and big chunks of the remaining resources are covering the costs of hosting migrants, many of whom fled due to the impacts of humanitarian crises. While a number of other EU members, including Greece, Spain, and Portugal, have boosted their aid, they remain small players, especially when it comes to humanitarian assistance. Outside the European Union, the United Kingdom is a significant humanitarian donor, but it also faces an anemic economy and has reduced aid. Turkey and the Gulf countries, including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, have stepped up their humanitarian giving in the past decade, but their contributions remain miniscule compared with the gap left by the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theoretically, China or Russia might see opportunity in the chance to become a major source of emergency relief. But over the past five years, both countries have reported minimal levels of humanitarian assistance to UNOCHA. China currently faces its own economic difficulties, and for the time being, Russia remains bogged down in its invasion of Ukraine and fledgling peace talks. Nevertheless, the recent response to the 7.7-magnitude earthquake in Myanmar featured visible contributions from both China and Russia. The United States fired the rest of its USAID workforce the same day the Myanmar earthquake response was to commence. Globally, other sources of humanitarian finance exist, including private charity and philanthropy, remittances, and funds collected from solidarity-based networks. Yet none of these sources of finance are likely to fill the gap left by the U.S. government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Populations in partner countries have long memories, passing down stories about the United States and the way it shaped their destinies and molded their nations through generations, in part due to the provision of foreign aid. The United States famously rebuilt Germany and other nations after World War II, countries that are now close U.S. allies. When a country is in its greatest hour of need, it has meant something that the U.S. president or another senior U.S. official was often a leader’s first phone call. The United States has used its soft-power tool of foreign aid, and humanitarian assistance, to be a trustworthy, reliable partner to nations across administrations. Today, polls in Germany indicate that only 19 percent of the population considers the United States an ally. In a separate poll in Germany, one in two respondents said their opinion of Trump has worsened since he assumed office. What happens to the United States’ long-term relationships when trust is broken?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;back-to-the-humanitarian-future&quot;&gt;Back to the Humanitarian Future?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the chaotic situation created by the aid pause, clunky humanitarian waiver process, terminations, and effort to shutter USAID, the Trump administration’s approach risks setting aid back to the 1980s and limiting the foreign policy tool kit the president has to respond to global crises as they emerge. This is because it rigidly siloes humanitarian and development assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is in contrast with four decades of good practice that focused on how best to link the two. Examples include efforts to boost investment in disaster risk reduction to help mitigate the effects of natural hazards before they become disasters and to integrate programming across the humanitarian-development-peacebuilding “triple nexus.” Humanitarian appeals for early recovery programming receive little funding from donors, so such an integrated approach to crisis response remains woefully under-resourced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along these lines, USAID and other donors have supported community-based resilience building in drought-prone areas in Kenya. This aims to help pastoralists and agro-pastoralists better cope with the effects of natural hazards. Such activities also include immediate relief but seek to reduce the need for emergency aid over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effective triple-nexus programming remains a work in progress, but there are encouraging recent examples. In West Africa, Chad hosts over a million refugees from Sudan and continues to provide an open door to uprooted people. The government has worked with donors, including the World Bank and the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), to address not only immediate needs among the refugees and their Chadian host communities, but also to obtain investment in longer-term development and secure livelihoods for both. It bears emphasizing that the United States is the biggest funder of both the World Bank and UNHCR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another innovative practice emerging in recent years has been the expansion in the use of anticipatory action. This smart innovation allows practitioners to better target aid to places in which data strongly suggest a natural hazard will strike by allowing funding to be allocated in advance. In a disaster, minutes matter, and this forward-looking approach allows humanitarian practitioners and community members to be prepared to hit the ground running in a disaster response, rather than waiting for funders to get their act together in the first few days following a rapid onset crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;does-where-aid-sits-matter&quot;&gt;Does Where Aid Sits Matter?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the discussion around the Trump administration’s aid freeze and personnel layoffs has focused on whether USAID will remain an independent agency or get folded into the State Department. President Trump himself has posted “CLOSE IT DOWN” on social media, and the Department of State has recently notified Congress of its intent to merge parts of USAID into the State Department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Administration critics rightly note that Congress established USAID as an independent federal entity, so an act of Congress is needed to change that. But the issue of where to house aid programs organizationally is, ultimately, a huge tangent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secretary Rubio recently said in a press conference that USAID “is unresponsive” to U.S. foreign policy, and presidential advisor Musk wrote more bluntly on X that it is “a viper’s nest of radical-left Marxists.” While some humanitarian workers highlighted the tension between upholding humanitarian principles and using humanitarian aid to promote U.S. foreign policy goals, anyone who has ever attended a meeting at USAID’s headquarters or visited its operations in the field is likely to come away with a different impression of the degree of alignment with U.S. diplomacy. The legal framework conferring independent agency status on USAID subjects it to the policy guidance of the State Department. In actual practice across multiple administrations, including during President Trump’s previous term, the collaboration between the two agencies is broad and deep. The State Department and USAID have long engaged in extensive joint planning of assistance strategies, as together they administer the vast majority of U.S. aid resources. Moreover, the State Department has the lead role coordinating foreign aid across its own programs (which include the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR), USAID, and 22 other U.S. government entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at other major humanitarian donor governments, there are a variety of aid governance mechanisms. The United Kingdom has moved away from an independent agency and runs aid through the integrated Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office (its ministry of foreign affairs). In contrast, Germany has a free-standing Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, where humanitarian assistance sits on the government’s organigram is far less important than the quality of programs. The key questions are whether those programs adhere to humanitarian principles, comply with internationally agreed-upon standards of aid effectiveness and accountability to affected people, and, in keeping with the Grand Bargain, embody a serious commitment to increasing the capacity and resourcing of local and national humanitarian actors in crisis-affected countries. Of course, to do so, the U.S. government must adequately train and staff those who are managing U.S.-funded programs. They must also ensure that their support for implementing partner organizations is consistent enough that those organizations can responsibly plan for their business operations and keep the lights on. In short, people matter. Without the specialized expertise and nimble response capacity of USAID’s humanitarian staff, foreign policy generalists within the Department of State may have difficulty overseeing humanitarian assistance and ensuring that it aligns with international best practice. Perhaps most importantly, it could be challenging for non-specialists to adhere to one of the most important humanitarian principles: “first, do no harm.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;building-on-past-reforms&quot;&gt;Building on Past Reforms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States can build on past reforms to address long-term critiques of U.S. humanitarian assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, what reforms are needed to take USAID’s longtime focus on localization to a new level? The agency has sought to support greater local leadership of humanitarian and development programming across multiple administrations from both parties. During the first Trump administration, USAID Administrator Mark Green sought to have aid support “the journey to self-reliance.” This reform effort addressed pain points to streamline USAID’s bureaucratic processes, enhanced USAID’s ability to partner with the private sector and faith-based organizations, and approached aid from the perspective that the organization sought to truly “work itself out of a job.” Under President Biden, Administrator Samantha Power set a goal of providing 25 percent of resources to local actors by 2025. Though USAID fell far short of this target, prior administrations from both parties agreed that to successfully partner with countries to achieve humanitarian and development objectives requires greater support for the entities and systems that already exist in partner countries and that will remain long after USAID and other global development partners have exited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only is localization an efficient and effective way to provide aid, but it is in the United States’ interest to do so, as it puts the people of aid-receiving counties in the driver’s seat to address crises and chart their own future. It can ultimately reduce dependency on foreign donors, including the United States, and allow crises to be handled locally before they have far-reaching, transnational implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big-picture question is whether consensus remains that U.S. international relations dependes on the “three Ds”: diplomacy, defense, and development. There once was wide bipartisan agreement that aid is a crucial “soft-power” instrument. Is that still the case? Does the United States still view saving lives as vital to its long-term security as a nation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Conclusions and Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration has recognized the value of maintaining a humanitarian assistance capability within the U.S. government. By notifying Congress that it intends to preserve humanitarian functions and situate them within the State Department, and by issuing a waiver intended to continue lifesaving aid, this administration has indicated that the parts of foreign aid—and U.S. soft power broadly—that it values include providing emergency relief to populations in need outside of the United States. Yet it has let go of most staff who have the expertise to carry out humanitarian missions and crippled the nongovernmental infrastructure that implements U.S.-funded humanitarian programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To take advantage of this moment, minimize and mitigate damage and unintended impacts, and shift course to a more effective approach to humanitarian aid, the Trump administration should pursue the following actions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommit to “first, do no harm.”&lt;/strong&gt; The administration should define its humanitarian objectives and immediately recommit to the principle of “first, do no harm” to ensure that its aid, or review of aid, does not result in loss of life or harm recipients of aid.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provide clarity on lifesaving waivers and increase their consistency and flexibility.&lt;/strong&gt; Provide public clarification about what qualifies under humanitarian waivers and ensure that partner organizations have access to contracting officers and other U.S. government officials who can promptly answer their questions. Make the waivers more flexible, and abide by waiver decisions to allow procurement and staffing to continue.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pay partners for work performed.&lt;/strong&gt; Promptly reimburse partner organizations that have incurred costs under U.S. partnership agreements prior to the aid freeze, and reimburse organizations operating under the waiver or that were approved to be “unfrozen.” Take stock of public-private partnerships and multi-donor funds and projects to ensure that people receiving aid are not left in a lurch if U.S. contributions are suddenly pulled.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restore data to inform decisionmaking and future humanitarian efforts.&lt;/strong&gt; Direct efforts to restore transparency and access to data about U.S. assistance, and restore funding for relevant data collection. Encourage the collection of specific data on vulnerable populations to ensure that localized needs are met and resources are distributed effectively. Partner with outside institutions to understand trends in data and create structures within the U.S. government to assess impact and ensure accountability over aid programs. Use this data to inform humanitarian policymaking and allow for a robust public conversation on the value of aid.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Require meta-analyses of already completed evaluations, third-party independent evaluations, and ex-post evaluations and make them public.&lt;/strong&gt; The U.S. government should not be grading its own homework when assessing the effectiveness of its programs. The United States should require that third-party, independent evaluations are conducted of aid programs and published in non-technical language and require ex-post evaluations for aid to understand the impact on communities after the completion of a project. It should also take stock of evaluations that have already been completed, including by the Multilateral Organization Performance Outputs Network, and create meta-analyses to better understand evidence. USAID had a rigorous evaluation requirement, but the State Department’s track record is less strong, so the administration should ensure that aid programs are clearly defining their intended impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restore emergency response expeditionary capacity.&lt;/strong&gt; Promptly reconstitute and adequately staff U.S. Disaster Assistance Response Teams and allow them to maintain readiness to deploy in case of an international disaster or emergency. Restore contracts with partners, including urban search and rescue teams.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Map partner capacity to understand new vulnerabilities.&lt;/strong&gt; Conduct a mapping analysis of humanitarian partner organizations’ capacities and gaps in capability, access, or reach to understand new vulnerabilities within humanitarian sectors such as water and sanitation, food, health, shelter, protection, and others. By identifying the areas in which organizations previously provided an essential service in humanitarian response, and can no longer do so, the United States can better tailor its assistance and set expectations for partners.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider smart reforms.&lt;/strong&gt; Use data-backed approaches to increase the use of more effective forms of humanitarian assistance, such as cash-based approaches to food assistance that stimulate local markets, better integration of humanitarian and development programming, deployment of anticipatory action, and provision of direct aid to local partners to reduce aid dependency.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embrace the responsible exit.&lt;/strong&gt; Humanitarian aid is a lifeline for populations in need, and a population will long remember the nation that reneges on a promise. The United States should learn from research on responsible exits from humanitarian settings to ensure that future aid stoppages use a phased transition plan that minimizes harm to aid recipients.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Convene humanitarian donors and encourage a new approach to burden sharing.&lt;/strong&gt; The United States rightly wants other countries to step up to take on more leadership in funding humanitarian responses. In order to urge action, the United States should convene implementing partners, donors, philanthropies, private sector partners, volunteer networks, and others to clearly articulate what it will fund and where it will step back. The United States should call upon other countries to define where they will step up and step in and develop a new approach to burden sharing that catalyzes increased commitments from partner nations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Urge the United Nations to lead true humanitarian reform.&lt;/strong&gt; Past humanitarian reform efforts from the Transformative Agenda to the Grand Bargain have avoided changing humanitarian response architecture globally. This architecture has weakened substantially and is not fit for purpose. A “next-generation” architecture is needed that prioritizes frontline needs and organizations and does not entrench existing power dynamics within the aid system. This should include efforts to establish predictable humanitarian financing. A new initiative by UN Humanitarian Coordinator Tom Fletcher called the “humanitarian reset” has promise to streamline aid delivery and build in greater accountability to local partners, but only if it takes aim at the United Nations in addition to others in the humanitarian system.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set guardrails for responses to protracted conflicts by working to resolve conflicts.&lt;/strong&gt; Humanitarian crises do not have humanitarian solutions. Protracted conflicts have grown exponentially, as countries fail to resolve their conflicts and displaced people remain displaced for decades. The United States should work with the UN Security Council and use bilateral channels and regional pressure to push for the swift resolution of conflicts so that they do not continue for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not underestimate human mobility.&lt;/strong&gt; The desire to migrate for a better life or to flee adverse circumstances is as old as humanity, and a variety of factors are pushing people out of their homes at an increasingly rapid pace. This is only set to increase. The Trump administration should ensure that it is providing aid strategically in locations where pressures increase the likelihood of widespread migration outflows. This requires maintaining expertise in refugees, migration, demography, and human mobility to ensure that U.S. responses are evidence-based.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communicate results to Congress and the American people.&lt;/strong&gt; The Trump administration should focus its aid efforts in key strategic areas and clearly communicate results to Congress, the American people, and recipients of aid in language that is accessible to them. Too often, aid programs are spread so thinly in such tremendous quantities that the forest gets lost for the trees.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work with Congress to create a Humanitarian Service Reserve Corps.&lt;/strong&gt; As the administration seeks to reduce the federal workforce, including humanitarian experts, health workers, and peace and conflict experts, it should create a Humanitarian Service Reserve Corps that allows humanitarian workers who work full-time in other fields to deploy voluntarily in service of the United States to perform professional humanitarian missions. Not only would this address some of the humanitarian brain drain, but it would also provide paid opportunities for the many generous American volunteers who would like to be professionally trained to provide a service that is committed to the principle of “first, do no harm.” This would improve upon USAID’s surge roster approach to provide additional capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congress should pursue the following actions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communicate legislative intent clearly&lt;/strong&gt; about appropriated funds for foreign aid, including humanitarian assistance, to ensure the administration understands the structures and purposes of aid that they should be implementing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enforce the requirement for the administration to meaningfully consult with Congress&lt;/strong&gt; on the foreign aid reforms proposed before they approve congressional notifications for structural changes. Recent appropriations legislation mandates prior consultation with appropriate congressional committees before structural changes to USAID can be made.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Request review by the Congressional Research Service&lt;/strong&gt; of the impacts of the foreign aid freeze on humanitarian programs, U.S. expeditionary disaster response capabilities, populations receiving aid, and humanitarian data availability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Require the administration to reinstate inspectors general&lt;/strong&gt; to provide oversight over aid administered by U.S. federal agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authorize and fund a Humanitarian Service Reserve Corps&lt;/strong&gt; to provide surge capacity for humanitarian responses by experts who work in other fields.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space technology plays a pivotal role in advancing the UK’s economic interests and ensuring national security. Space technology that has particular relevance to national security, and is being developed at pace by the UK’s flourishing small companies includes small satellites, indigenous launch and spaceports, sustainable space initiatives, space-developed biopharmaceuticals and secure communications. With a focus on making the intersection of space technology, security and sustainability readily understandable, this briefing aims to provide non-specialist policymakers with insights into the strategic opportunities and challenges shaping the UK’s technological space future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;demystifying-some-space-technology&quot;&gt;Demystifying (Some) Space Technology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;National and Geopolitical Relevance of Space Technology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s investment in space technologies underscores their importance in a rapidly shifting global landscape. Spacepower is a cornerstone of national security, with satellites supporting critical infrastructure such as finance, navigation and defence systems. Geopolitically, as espoused in the National Space Strategy, the Defence Space Strategy and the Space Industrial Plan, the UK aims to position itself as a leader in sustainable and responsible space use, balancing commercial opportunities with ethical considerations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By prioritising small companies and fostering innovation, the UK not only strengthens its national security but also contributes to a sustainable, inclusive global space economy. Doing so offers a strategic edge by providing resilience and adaptability in an increasingly contested and congested domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technologies underpinning the future of UK space power – small satellite design and manufacture, innovative bio-fuelled and reusable launch systems, sustainable space practices and space-developed biopharmaceuticals – are at the forefront of a global shift in how space assets are developed, deployed and used. These technologies have expanded access to space, enabling not only governments but also small companies and start-ups to participate in shaping the future of space-based capabilities and security interests pinned to space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand the foundational role of small satellite design and manufacture, launch systems and sustainable space practices in the UK’s National Security Strategy, the technical underpinnings of these innovations must be explored. These technologies are interconnected and mutually reinforcing, forming a cohesive framework for the UK’s ambitions in space power and national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Basics of Space Technology: Small Satellite Design and Manufacture, Core Components and Functions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK rightly maintains a focus on small satellites and their launch capabilities because they offer a cost-effective, agile platform for enhancing telecommunications, Earth observation and national security capabilities, driving technological innovation and economic growth in the burgeoning space sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small satellites have evolved and are designed to perform specific functions within constrained sizes, ranging from femtosatellites (0.001–0.01 kg) to minisatellites (100–180 kg). They are equipped with miniaturised sensors, processors and communication systems to fulfil specialised roles such as Earth observation or communication. A critical enabler of their functionality is the integration of advanced materials, miniaturisation technologies and efficient power systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small satellites in particular rely on advanced miniaturisation technologies to pack essential components into their compact frames. These are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Payload:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the functional heart of the satellite, including sensors, cameras and communication systems. For example, optical sensors are used for Earth observation, while radio frequency receivers can support signals intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Earth observation payloads: The UK excels in the development of advanced hyperspectral imaging sensors and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems, enabling satellites to capture high-resolution, multi-spectrum data for applications in agriculture, climate monitoring and disaster response. Surrey Satellite Technology Limited (SSTL) is renowned for developing hyperspectral imaging sensors and compact payloads for Earth observation, used in missions such as the Disaster Monitoring Constellation.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Communications payloads: UK firms such as Inmarsat and OneWeb are leading in designing next-generation communication payloads, incorporating phased array antennas and software-defined radio technologies to deliver flexible, high-bandwidth connectivity across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power systems:&lt;/strong&gt; Most small satellites are equipped with solar panels to generate power and rechargeable batteries for energy storage. Advances in efficient solar cell technologies allow even small satellites to operate robustly in space.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;While many small satellites operate passively, some include propulsion systems for orbit adjustments. Many UK-designed small satellites use electric propulsion technologies such as ion thrusters and Hall-effect thrusters, which offer high efficiency and precise manoeuvrability for tasks such as orbital adjustments and station-keeping while consuming minimal fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;UK companies such as Nammo UK are developing innovative green monopropellant propulsion systems that use environmentally friendly fuels, such as LMP-103S, to provide reliable thrust for small satellites while reducing toxic by-products and storage hazards associated with traditional propellants.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Onboard processing and communication:&lt;/strong&gt; Miniaturised processors and antennas enable satellites to perform data collection, processing and transmission autonomously, reducing dependence on ground stations.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;AAC Clyde Space develops onboard communication subsystems, including high-performance radios and transceivers, designed for reliable data downlink in smallsat constellations.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Archangel Lightworks is an innovative UK company focusing on free-space optical communications, enabling high-speed data transfer between satellites and ground stations using laser-based systems.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;applications-of-small-satellites-in-national-security&quot;&gt;Applications of Small Satellites in National Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small satellites are pivotal in national security due to their flexibility and deployability. The UK could use them for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ISR:&lt;/strong&gt; Satellites like those from SSTL provide real-time imagery and intelligence for military operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secure communications:&lt;/strong&gt; Small satellites can be used to form resilient communication networks, ensuring connectivity during emergencies or hostile actions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supplementing Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS):&lt;/strong&gt; Developed in tandem with multi-constellation GNSS receivers, by reducing reliance on prominent Medium Earth Orbit Positioning Navigation and Timing constellations such as GPS, the UK could increase PNT resilience and deterrence by denial.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early warning for disaster monitoring:&lt;/strong&gt; Small satellites could be used to enhance satellite capabilities to alert first responders and government officials within minutes of a disaster – such as floods, fires or landslides – at home or in overseas interests.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/uH7SFwP.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;space-launch-systems&quot;&gt;Space Launch Systems&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may seem obvious, but a satellite that remains tethered to terra has little purpose. Satellites need to be in space; thus, the success of small satellites depends on reliable and adaptable launch systems. The UK’s renewed focus on launch capability – highlighted by the development of spaceports such as Spaceport Cornwall and SaxaVord Spaceport – signals its commitment to ensuring sovereign access to space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Innovations in Launch Technology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launch vehicles designed for small satellites are smaller, lighter and more efficient than traditional rockets. Notable features include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dedicated launches:&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike shared launches, dedicated systems transport small payloads to specific orbits, offering greater control and responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reusable components:&lt;/strong&gt; As demonstrated by SpaceX and adopted by UK-based start-ups, innovations such as reusable rocket stages significantly reduce costs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eco-friendly propulsion:&lt;/strong&gt; Orbex, for example, a UK-based orbital launch services company, is developing rockets using bio-propane, a low-carbon alternative to traditional rocket fuels.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Applications in National Security&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launch systems enable rapid deployment of small satellites, which is crucial during crises or conflicts. For instance, if adversaries disrupt satellite constellations, quick-response launch capabilities can replace or augment assets, maintaining critical services such as communication and ISR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sustainable Space Practices&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With 40,500 pieces of debris (greater than 10 cm) and 130 million pieces of debris (between 1 mm and 1 cm) in orbit, sustainable space practices are no longer optional – they are imperative. The UK has already taken a global leadership role in promoting responsible space stewardship through policy, innovation and international diplomacy, and it should be noted that the UK led the work for UN General Assembly Resolution 75/36, “Reducing Space Threats Through Norms, Rules and Principles of Responsible Behaviours”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Technical Approaches to Sustainability&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Space debris mitigation:&lt;/strong&gt; Companies such as 3S Northumbria are designing sustainable space solutions, including space surveillance systems and supporting software, grounded in the principles of a circular economy for space, with space situational awareness at the heart of the work.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design for disposal:&lt;/strong&gt; New satellites are engineered for planned decommissioning. Lightweight materials and controlled de-orbiting mechanisms ensure minimal long-term impact.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Propellant-free manoeuvring:&lt;/strong&gt; Emerging technologies use solar sails or other innovative means for orbit adjustments without traditional propulsion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;National Security Implications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sustainability of space is not only about ethics; it should be a national security priority. Space debris directly threatens active satellites, including those essential to defence and intelligence. The UK’s emphasis on sustainability ensures its assets are protected while setting a global standard for responsible space exploration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;intersections-with-other-technologies&quot;&gt;Intersections with Other Technologies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technologies driving UK space power – small satellites, launch systems and sustainable practices – intersect with transformative fields such as AI, quantum technologies, advanced telecommunications and additive manufacturing. These intersections amplify the capabilities of these technologies, enabling innovative applications across civil and national security domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;AI&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI enhances the functionality of small satellites by enabling autonomous decision-making, real-time data analysis and efficient constellation management. For example, AI-driven algorithms can optimise satellite orbits to avoid collisions or adjust sensor focus for targeted intelligence collection. This reduces the need for constant ground control and increases operational resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quantum Technologies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum computing and quantum communication, as led by UK company Arqit, are reshaping satellite security. Quantum key distribution (QKD), a breakthrough in encryption, ensures unbreakable communication links. Integrating QKD into small satellites offers secure communications for defence applications, safeguarding critical infrastructure against cyber threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advanced Telecommunications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small satellites underpin the development of global communication networks, particularly in underserved areas. They intersect with 5G and future 6G networks to deliver high-speed, resilient connectivity. This capability supports not only commercial markets but also secure military communications and remote operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Additive Manufacturing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additive manufacturing, or 3D printing, accelerates the production of satellite components and launch vehicles. This technology enables rapid prototyping, lightweight designs and cost-efficient manufacturing, allowing UK start-ups to innovate and compete globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;relevance-of-technologies-for-national-security&quot;&gt;Relevance of Technologies for National Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The suite of technologies encompassing small satellite design, launch systems and sustainable space practices plays a critical role in enhancing the UK’s national security. These technologies contribute to strategic resilience, geopolitical influence and the safeguarding of critical infrastructure in an increasingly contested and competitive space domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strategic and Geopolitical Implications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space is recognised as critically important to national security. Small satellites and launch capabilities provide the UK with a sovereign ability to monitor, communicate and respond to threats, ensuring strategic independence from international providers. Geopolitically, the UK’s leadership in sustainable space initiatives, such as promoting norms of responsible behaviour at the UN (for example, Resolution 75/36), positions it as a global leader in ethical space governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dependencies and Supply Chains&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;National security is intricately tied to the resilience of supply chains for satellite components and launch systems. The UK relies on small domestic companies, such as SSTL and In-Space Missions, to build satellites. However, certain materials and technologies, such as high-performance processors and radiation-hardened components, still depend on imports. Mitigating these dependencies requires investment in domestic production capabilities and securing international partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Public Perception and Policy Questions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public discussions around space often centre on its benefits – connectivity, climate monitoring and disaster response – but awareness of its security implications is growing. Questions about the growing militarisation of space, space debris and competition with countries such as China and Russia are shaping policy debates. A transparent and balanced approach to national security, aligned with ethical and sustainable space practices, reduces the risk of security dilemma while strengthening public trust and political legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Collaborations and International Engagements&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK actively collaborates on international initiatives that bolster its space capabilities. Partnerships with organisations such as the European Space Agency, the Five Eyes intelligence alliance and NATO support the development of cutting-edge technologies and strategic interoperability. The UK Space Agency also engages with global investment programmes to fund innovation and ensure access to emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;UK Research and Development Hubs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK is home to a vibrant ecosystem of research and development hubs focused on space technology. Notable centres include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harwell Space Cluster:&lt;/strong&gt; A leading hub for satellite innovation, based in Oxfordshire, this group hosts more than 100 organisations working on small satellite development, AI integration and sustainable space solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Space North East England:&lt;/strong&gt; A cluster that brings together businesses, academia and institutions to unlock the opportunities within the space sector in the region. Includes vibrant multi-disciplinary research at NE universities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Satellite Applications Catapult:&lt;/strong&gt; Based in Oxfordshire, this organisation bridges research and industry, accelerating the commercialisation of space technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leading Companies and Promising Start-Ups&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s private sector is instrumental in advancing space power. Organisations include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SSTL:&lt;/strong&gt; A pioneer in small satellite development, providing platforms for national security applications.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Orbex:&lt;/strong&gt; A developer of eco-friendly launch vehicles, enabling rapid deployment of satellites while reducing environmental impact.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skyrora:&lt;/strong&gt; A business focused on small satellite launches, leveraging innovative propulsion systems for cost-effective solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3S Northumbria:&lt;/strong&gt; A start-up driving sustainable practices through debris mitigation and end-of-life satellite solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BioOrbit:&lt;/strong&gt; A company harnessing the benefits of microgravity for large-scale crystallisation of protein drugs, enabling the shift from intravenous (IV) to subcutaneous (SC) injection.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;future-developments-and-horizon-scanning&quot;&gt;Future Developments and Horizon Scanning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future of UK space power could be defined by accelerated innovation and strategic investment in transformative technologies, with small satellites, sustainable practices and advanced sustainable launch capabilities at the forefront.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;five-year-horizon&quot;&gt;Five-Year Horizon&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next five years, miniaturisation, AI integration and propulsion advancements will enable smaller, more efficient satellites with enhanced capabilities. The launch sector will become more agile, with domestic spaceports and eco-friendly propulsion systems, such as those developed by Orbex and Skyrora, enabling frequent and sustainable access to orbit. The UK could lead the space and pharmaceutical industry with companies such as BioOrbit, headed by Katie King, which aims to be the go-to pharmaceuticals factory in microgravity, part of the space manufacturing revolution, and is currently developing a platform for large-scale crystallisation of protein drugs. Sustainable space development from UK Space thought leaders such as Ralph “Dinz” Dinsley at 3S Northumbria could pave the way for the UK to be a world leader in circular economy in space – which in turn would increase soft-power elements of national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;10-year-horizon&quot;&gt;10-Year Horizon&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2034, small satellite constellations will dominate low Earth orbit, providing ubiquitous high-speed connectivity and supporting real-time global intelligence operations. Quantum communication and AI-driven autonomous satellites will further enhance civil and defence applications, while effective debris mitigation technologies will ensure sustainable orbital management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;20-year-horizon&quot;&gt;20-Year Horizon&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 20 years, fully autonomous satellite constellations, powered by AI, will transform space operations. Sustainable manufacturing and biotechnology innovations could enable in-orbit production of critical resources, reducing reliance on Earth-based supply chains. The UK’s investments today will ensure leadership in these areas, fostering a secure, innovative and sustainable space future. BioOrbit’s innovations could even extend to bioregenerative life support systems for long-duration space missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum physics is the branch of science that describes the behaviour of the world of the small; it defines the properties of atoms, molecules, electrons and photons. Quantum science has been explored for decades, but practical applications have only emerged in recent years. Through its National Quantum Technologies Programme and other investments, the UK is one of the leading countries driving innovation in quantum computing, security and sensing. These technologies promise transformative impact across multiple sectors, from healthcare to finance, defence, energy and national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with all technologies, quantum devices pose threats to national security: quantum computers can be applied to attack encryption standards; quantum security could keep communications by nefarious groups secure; and quantum sensors may be used to track military operations that would otherwise be considered covert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensuring that the UK retains its competitive position in developing quantum technologies and establishing a robust supply chain demands significant investment in specialised resources and expertise, both technical and operational.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-introduction-to-quantum-technology&quot;&gt;An Introduction to Quantum Technology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The defining capabilities of quantum devices are derived from the fundamental properties of quantum mechanics that they embrace. These include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Quantum confinement: the wave-like, probabilistic nature of “particles” such as electrons and photons and how restricting the motion of these influences their behaviour. This property also relates to a phenomenon known as quantum tunnelling, which can allow particles to pass through barriers forbidden in classical physics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Superposition: the fact that quantum systems can exist in multiple states simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Entanglement: the fact that quantum systems can behave as if they are joined or in a shared state, even when far apart.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These properties underpin the capabilities of quantum devices to compute, securely communicate and sense in ways that traditional technologies cannot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s National Quantum Technologies Programme kickstarted significant momentum in this domain by funding research, fostering industrial partnerships, and setting up dedicated quantum technology hubs. This approach aims to help the UK remain a key player in quantum research, patents, publications and industrial investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US and China dominate quantum technology development due to their massive research budgets and strong private sector involvement. China’s patent filings have been particularly prolific in recent years. Commercially, large US tech firms (such as IBM, Google, Microsoft, Honeywell and Intel) are pushing forward with quantum computing platforms, while Chinese corporations (such as Alibaba and Baidu) are accelerating their national efforts. In Europe, Germany, the Netherlands and France are front-runners, driven by substantial government funding. The UK has demonstrated a strong commitment to quantum technologies through substantial investment and a long-term vision, having invested more than £1 billion to date, with an aim at accelerating research, innovation and commercialisation to establish the UK as a global leader in the field. Private investment in the sector in the UK is rapidly approaching £1 billion pewr annum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;understanding-the-tech-in-quantum-technology&quot;&gt;Understanding the “Tech” in Quantum Technology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum technologies are emerging. Half a century ago, it was impossible to predict where the advent of the digital revolution would lead us – and we are in a similar position today when evaluating the future potential of the quantum technology revolution. It has branched into three primary subfields, each with distinct operational principles, implementation requirements, and applications. The subsections below give an overview of quantum computing, sensing, and security, emphasising the technical details that highlight how each technology works and why it is strategically relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/AX1esSg.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;quantum-computing&quot;&gt;Quantum Computing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Basic Principles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computers traditionally represent and store information in binary digits, 0s and 1s (bits). Quantum computers are fundamentally different, normally processing information in superpositions of a 0 and 1 state encoded on quantum bits (qubits, two-level quantum systems); measurements and reading out information from qubits collapses superpositions into binary states that can represent the results of calculations. In quantum computation, entanglement between qubits can be used to scale the complexity of the problems that can be tackled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Implementation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many different systems for realising qubits have been proposed. The leading contenders today are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Superconductors: cooled to temperatures close to absolute zero, superconducting circuits allow qubits to be manipulated via precisely timed microwave pulses. Companies like IBM, Google and Oxford Quantum Circuits are at the forefront of this approach – IBM and Google reported significant advancements recently, defining the boundaries of qubit performance and count. Figure 2 shows a photograph of IBM’s Quantum System One.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ions: electromagnetic fields can trap and manipulate charged atoms (ions). Lasers and microwaves are used to manipulate quantum states encoded on these ions. IonQ, Quantinuum and Alpine Quantum Technologies are pioneers here.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Photons: particles of light– photons– can be transmitted and processed through optical circuits. Photonic systems can operate at room temperature and allow for modular scaling. Xanadu, Quandela and ORCA Computing are pioneering companies here.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lack of a leading technology for implementing qubits for computation indicates that material advancement is still required in this field, as no qubit system is ideal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum simulators are an implementation used to model complex physical systems that are subtly different from general-purpose quantum computers. They use carefully controlled quantum systems to mimic the behaviour of other quantum or classical systems, which are then used to provide insights into phenomena that would otherwise be hard to model. Unlike universal quantum computers, these devices target specific problems, which makes them more resource-efficient. Through this direct mirroring of the quantum dynamics of the system under study, they offer powerful routes of investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Applications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cryptanalysis: large-scale quantum computers have long been heralded as having the potential to attack current public-key cryptography schemes such as RSA, elliptic curve cryptography and discrete log-based schemes (such as Diffie–Hellman). Thus, much of today’s encrypted communications are under threat.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chemical and materials simulation: quantum devices can accurately model molecular interactions, enabling breakthroughs in drug discovery, energy storage and weapon design.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Logistics and optimisation: quantum algorithms can tackle complex optimisation problems relevant to defence logistics, supply chain management and strategic planning.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;quantum-sensing-and-metrology&quot;&gt;Quantum Sensing and Metrology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Basic Principles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum sensors use quantum states, often entangled or in superpositions, to measure magnetic, electric or gravitational fields, electromagnetic radiation, or time. They target performance metrics, such as signal-to-noise ratios, that are better than conventional devices and, in some cases, better than the theoretical maximum classical performance that is possible. Quantum states are susceptible to small changes, and quantum sensors often exploit this to detect minute variations that classical sensors cannot detect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Implementation and Applications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Atomic clocks use atomic properties to precisely define a period (tick) to monitor time passing. They can be highly stable reference devices crucial for GPS, maintain synchronisation in high-speed telecommunication systems, and underpin transactions in financial ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gravimeters detect tiny fluctuations in gravitational fields with subterranean and subsea mapping applications.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Magnetometers measure extremely weak magnetic fields. They are used in biomedical imaging, submarine detection and the identification of concealed metallic objects.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Photon detectors are essential for many applications, from secure communications to gas and molecular sensing. Developments in photon detectors have driven applications in quantum imaging, which aims to achieve resolutions and signal-to-noise ratios beyond classical limits. Ghost imaging uses correlations between entangled photons to reconstruct an image, even when the detector does not directly view the object. Advancements here could be important in biomedical imaging and military contexts, offering advantages in surveillance, reconnaissance and target identification under low-light or adverse conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;quantum-security&quot;&gt;Quantum Security&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Basic Principles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common misconception is that quantum technology can only be used to decrypt data. The field of quantum security targets the opposite: applying quantum physics to keep information secure and provide solutions with provable metrics. The first example of this, proposed in the 1970s (although unplublished until 1983), is known as quantum money. The scheme stores randomised quantum states in banknotes. Unknown superposition states cannot be cloned or measured without errors, thus preventing counterfeiting. While not currently practical, this idea led to the invention of quantum key distribution, which uses a similar idea to prove that communications are free from eavesdropping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another simple, elegant application emerged from the realisation that the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics could be used to generate random numbers. The need for randomness in applications is widespread, from gambling to scheduling and simulations. However, it is critical in the security field: if the generation of cryptographic keys is predictable, then security is compromised. Many companies have developed and are developing quantum random number generators, ranging from scalable solutions for large-scale applications (such as the Internet of Things (IoT) to ones that do not require trust in the supplier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Applications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum states, encoded on photons, can be used to distribute encryption keys. Eavesdropping alters these states, alerting parties to the intrusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple pilot QKD links and networks have been implemented in the UK. Different protocols have been developed alongside methods to combine classical and quantum communications on the same communication links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, current implementations are still slow and inefficient. Current research aims to tackle practical challenges. Entangled photons, for example,can support more advanced secure communication protocols that lay the groundwork for a future quantum internet, where quantum states are transmitted and processed across distributed networks. Toshiba Europe, based in Cambridge, is the leading developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Applications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This field also encompasses applications for authentication, proof of provenance and anti-counterfeiting. Physically unclonable functions link imperfections, often introduced in a manufacturing process, to the identity of an object. They can harness quantum effects to generate “fingerprints” sensitive to atomic imperfections. Quantum Base is pioneering this technology in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;intersections-with-other-technologies&quot;&gt;Intersections with Other Technologies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum technologies are not being developed in isolation. They intersect with other nascent fields, forming synergies to realise novel capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ELeQKef.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4: Intersection between Quantum Technologies and Others.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: The author.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI:&lt;/strong&gt; today, quantum computers have limited resources and capabilities that are hamstrung by errors. AI may help identify problems that can be efficiently tackled with imperfect quantum computation and develop the algorithms employed. In the future, quantum computing may help accelerate the generation of machine learning models.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyber Security:&lt;/strong&gt; as quantum computing threatens cryptographic standards, post-quantum cryptography (PQC) has emerged to encrypt data using algorithms that cannot be practically attacked by either a classical supercomputer or a future “all-powerful” quantum computer. Some lattice-based schemes appear to be resistant to any computational attacks, and the US National Institute of Standards and Technology recently published FIPS 203, “Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism Standard”, a draft set of standards incorporating PQC algorithms. The institute also aims to select and recommend quantum-resistant key-encapsulation mechanisms for standardisation soon. Key challenges for PQC are efficient implementation, encouraging (or mandating) widespread adoption and, crucially, gaining confidence that the accepted standards are secure. There is a long track record of standardised encryption schemes being compromised.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5G/6G Telecommunications:&lt;/strong&gt; quantum computing algorithms can be applied to network optimisation, accelerating the allocation of spectrum and reducing latency in ultra-dense network environments. Wireless quantum communication has been demonstrated, primarily using laser links and telescopes, but there is potential for implementation using radiowaves/microwaves.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IoT:&lt;/strong&gt; quantum sensors may enable hyper-accurate geolocation or environmental monitoring when integrated into IoT networks. For instance, quantum clocks synchronised across an IoT network could improve the timing accuracy in smart city applications.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biotechnology:&lt;/strong&gt; quantum computing’s potential to compute complex molecular interactions far more efficiently than classical methods stands to accelerate drug discovery by simulating how potential compounds will bind to targets. This may enable personalised medicine. Quantum sensors could detect subtle variations in biological signals and biomarkers, enhancing disease detection. Quantum devices may be applied to secure valuable genomic data and patient records and maintain confidentiality in the data-driven biotech industry.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The confluence of quantum technology with AI, cyber security, telecommunications, IoT and biotech underscores its broader transformative potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;relevance-of-quantum-technologies-for-national-security&quot;&gt;Relevance of Quantum Technologies for National Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;National security concerns around quantum technologies revolve around opportunity and risk. Quantum computing, sensing and security boost intelligence capabilities and strategic defence operations, while adversarial use compromises cyber security and covert operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cryptography and Secure Communication:&lt;/strong&gt; perhaps the most immediate national security concern is the potential for quantum computers to break widely used public-key encryption protocols. An attack, often called a “harvest now, decrypt later” attack, could be employed today where valuable encrypted data is stored in anticipation of future decryption aided by more advanced technologies. In response, the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre supports initiatives in PQC that use algorithms that are believed to resist quantum attacks. However, such resistance is difficult to prove, and researchers are trying to develop quantum algorithms targeting lattice problems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR):&lt;/strong&gt; sensors underpin ISR, and the potential for quantum sensors to enhance ISR capabilities is important, especially in quantum imaging. UK-based start-up QLM Technology is developing quantum light detection and ranging systems for high-resolution gas sensing, which has potential implications for military intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supply Chain Dependencies:&lt;/strong&gt; quantum hardware implementation has specialised requirements. Quantum computers and sensors often require cryogenic refrigeration, advanced production facilities are needed for creating superconducting qubits, ultra-high vacuum chambers are used for ion traps, and advanced photonic components underpin most quantum communication devices. These requirements create dependencies on specific materials and manufacturing processes. Ensuring a robust domestic supply chain could be critical. Strengthening manufacturing capacity would mitigate apparent risks associated with supply chain disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK hosts a vibrant quantum ecosystem with numerous leading quantum technology companies and a collaborative environment for them to thrive, as provided by the UK’s National Quantum Technologies Programme and National Quantum Computing Centre. 771 UK-based quantum-related companies were studied in Beauhurst’s Quantum Ecosystem Mapping report, published in March 2025. Prominent examples in quantum computing include: Nu Quantum; ORCA Computing; Oxford Quantum Circuits; Quantinuum; Quantum Motion; Riverlane; and Universal Quantum. Example in quantum security include: Aegiq; Arquit; KETS Quantum Security; PQShield; Quantum Base; Quantum Dice; and Toshiba Europe. Examples in quantum sensors include: Cerca Magnetics; MoniRail; Peratech; QLM Technology; and Quantum Detectors. Key enabling technologies include Oxford Instruments and M Squared Lasers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;future-development-and-horizon-scanning&quot;&gt;Future Development and Horizon Scanning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trajectory of quantum technologies is evolving rapidly, driven by scientific breakthroughs and commercial investment. Predicting the shape and size of the iceberg, the tip of which we have only recently discovered, is difficult. Below are some short-, medium- and long-term predictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;five-year-horizon&quot;&gt;Five-Year Horizon&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, featuring hundreds of qubits, have demonstrated a quantum advantage. They will soon target useful, though modest, problems. These devices will not break classical cryptography and will target specific tasks such as drug discovery and materials design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early-stage commercial solutions will continue to emerge. Quantum-as-a-service models, offered via cloud platforms, will expand. These will enable businesses and government agencies to experiment with quantum algorithms without owning hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In quantum-ready cyber security, PQC standards will be increasingly adopted, and expanded pilots of quantum communication links in government and corporate networks will be implemented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;10-year-horizon&quot;&gt;10-Year Horizon&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum computers with 1-10k qubits and improved error correction will likely enable meaningful cryptanalysis of specific classical encryption schemes and broader logistics, as well as AI and cryptography applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small-scale quantum networks with entanglement-based secure communication could emerge in metropolitan areas or specialised government facilities. This evolution aligns with ongoing efforts to build quantum repeaters facilitating long-distance entanglement distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the quantum supply chain matures in the UK, it should also become more robust. Local manufacturing of key components like cryogenic systems, advanced photonic chips, and specialised electronics will reduce reliance on imports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;20-year-horizon&quot;&gt;20-Year Horizon&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advances in error correction, scaling and algorithm flexibility will enable large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers that can tackle classically intractable problems. Large-scale quantum computers could range from complex modelling to codebreaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum sensors may become ubiqitous, integrated into everyday technology such as atomic clocks in mobile devices, enabling unprecedented accuracy in navigation and communication bandwidths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Widespread adoption of global quantum protocols and standards will likely reshape global cyber security practices. Nations leading these standards may gain disproportionate influence, further elevating the strategic dimension of quantum technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McKinsey &amp;amp; Company estimates the potential quantum technology market size in 2040 to be over $100 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long-term investment in quantum research, talent development and enabling infrastructure is a strategic imperative for the UK. Quantum technologies will be pivotal in shaping the nation’s future technological and economic leadership, delivering transformative capabilities that drive innovation, productivity and growth. In an era of intensifying global competition, the UK’s national security and strategic preparedness will increasingly hinge on its ability to harness these technologies and remain ahead of global competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern telecommunications networks have the potential to enhance communication, deliver economic growth and innovation, transform certain industries and improve quality of life across the globe. Telecom networks underpin all national critical infrastructures, and their security and resilience are crucial to national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;future-telecom-technology-and-roadmap&quot;&gt;Future Telecom Technology and Roadmap&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern telecommunications networks, like 5G, have the potential to enhance communication, deliver economic growth and innovation, transform certain industries, and improve quality of life across the globe. Use cases foresee next-generation networks supporting millions of devices, powering smart cities and underpinning critical functions like power plants and emergency communications. Nonetheless, legacy mobile networks still play a crucial role in the development of modern telecommunications networks. They may support fewer devices and provide fewer critical services, but services such 2G, 3G, 4G and wired services still form part of existing infrastructure, have industry-specific applications, are used by rural communities, and provide back-up should modern systems fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Telecommunication networks, like any network, are prone to denial of service attacks. As a crucial part of daily life and a functioning economy, including the support of critical areas such as space, protecting telecommunications networks is a matter of national security. Most recently, a Chinese advanced persistent threat (APT) actor, dubbed Salt Typhoon, was said to have compromised major US telecommunications networks leading to widespread concerns over data and communications security. The group, linked to China’s Ministry of State Security, exploited vulnerabilities in telecommunication infrastructure, including wiretapping mechanisms used by law enforcement. Balancing the growth opportunities of modern telecommunications networks with national security risks is an enduring challenge for governments and societies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-mobile-cellular-systems-technology&quot;&gt;What is Mobile Cellular Systems Technology?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many technologies that can be categorised as telecommunications networks – including mobile cellular networks, WiFi, and space satellites. Other examples include HAPSs (High Altitude Platform Stations) which are airborne systems that typically operate 18-25km above earth, UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) which are drones that can enhance wireless connectivity, and Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) which is typically used at just outside the homes, inside homes or in offices. Finally, undersea fibre or cable networks are laid on the ocean floor to enable the high-speed transmission of data. Recently, there have been high-profile incidents where underseas cables have been damaged either accidentally or via sabotage. Overall, mobile cellular networks (including 5G) are the largest telecommunications network category in terms of global market share, scale and adoption. 6G is expected to be available on the market from 2030 onwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are typical mobile network sub-systems?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5RyxkjY.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: A mobile network system architecture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A mobile network is comprised of three sub-systems:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core Network&lt;/strong&gt; is where all system intelligence resides and controls many base stations (on the scale of thousands) in a network. It manages mobility and call forwarding to a user wherever they happen to be, regularly authenticates customers and devices when they want to set up a session, handles charging and billing and manages communications to other networks (such as fixed line network, internet and other mobile operator networks) nationally and internationally. Operation and management sub-system control radio access and core network operation. Core Network connects all these functions and databases using many switches and routers, which are interconnected usually with a network of fibre/cables. Core Network can be housed in a cloud or within a physical data centre. The connectivity (when between different boxes and functions) will vary from one generation to another. For operational and upgrade costs savings, mobile operators are gradually moving their Core Networks to a cloud platform.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Radio Access Network (RAN)&lt;/strong&gt; consists of Base Station (radio mast), wireless link and user equipment (UE) or mobile phones. Each Base Station (BS) provides service to a limited geographical location which is referred to as a cell. In a mobile network, thousands of cells are needed for a country-wide coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Service Platform&lt;/strong&gt; supports internet services and mobile network operator (MNO) own services.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a typical mobile network, there are millions of user equipments connected to thousands of Base Stations (BSs). Each generation from 1G to 5G consists of these three sub-systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evolution of mobile cellular systems is shown in Figure 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rNBueD7.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: Evolution of mobile cellular systems&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roughly speaking, every ten years a new generation is standardised and deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that mobile systems are based on global standards for achieving global roaming using the same device or SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) card anywhere in the world, as well as for reducing the cost thanks to economies of scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A SIM card contains all users’ identity and service profiles as well as information about their home network. A home network is the one that a user buys their subscription from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development of any generation is broadly divided into three phases, which sometimes overlap in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 2 shows evolution of mobile wireless through generations. The following five points are important to note:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each generation is researched, standardised and deployed approximately every 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each generation is deployed for about 20 years – roughly the span of time in which the capacity is saturated, or a more capable generation is introduced.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A new generation does not necessarily replace the previous generation. For example, 2G and 3G are still in operation. 3G can still provide voice services and medium rate data transfer (for example, mid-range speeds that can support lower resolution video streaming and basic household backups). However, as these services can also be provided by 4G and 5G, 3G is expected to be terminated in next few years by Vodafone and BT in the UK and in some other countries. 2G is now mainly used for services like smart metering in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The emergence of each generation is justified by market needs starting with new use cases which also have a clear business case.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every generation goes through new development phases with new capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;understanding-the-tech-in-telecom&quot;&gt;Understanding the “Tech” in Telecom&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5G as the current global standard:&lt;/strong&gt; The case for developing 5G emerged in 2015, based on need for higher data rate (10 times faster than 4G) and more capacity following the impressive success of 4G and smartphones. In addition, wireless technology was needed to enable the transformation of other industries to improve their productivity and cost effectiveness through the automation capability offered by 5G, including manufacturing, transportation and utilities. 5G also extended wireless communication for the automation of vertical industries. This automation, also called the Internet of Things (IoT), enables connecting and managing machines and robots (for example: vehicles, UAV, robots and machinery in factories). However, automation requires high wireless fidelity (reliability) and guaranteed low delay (latency) for control of machines (robots) specially for mission and time-critical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These new features of high reliability and low latency make 5G fundamentally different from previous generations. For example, 4G and previous generations were about primarily connecting people to people and connecting people to the internet through smartphones. People are tolerant to delay and delay variation (jitter) but machines are not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Industrial Application of 5G:&lt;/strong&gt; The needs of vertical industries are mainly for connecting machines rather than people. While the belief is that 5G will revolutionise other industries and the national economy with its automation capabilities, take up of 5G in industrial setting has been slower than was expected and the expected transformative effects remain to be seen. However, in China Industrial 5G is much more widely adopted compared with the rest of the world. Reasons for slow take up in other countries are due several factors: Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) lack experience in business to business (B2B) model; understanding of mobile ecosystem and evolution by vertical industries; and market scale for equipment vendors. MNOs fully understand the business to consumer (B2C) model which has been the case since 2G. Equipment vendors are used to nation-wide scales whereas for 5G industry use cases the coverage is local and of small scale to be profitable for vendors. Furthermore, governments are still grappling with the process of auctioning of the radio frequencies for local use as opposed to nationwide and exclusive licence use. For nation-wide license of spectrum, each MNO has its own piece of spectrum which makes it easy to manage interference between different networks. Local licensing of spectrum on the other hand raises the problem of co-existence of several networks that use same part of spectrum and can potentially interfere with each other. Interference management for co-existence of private 5G in industrial settings requires knowledge of wireless deployment and optimisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 5G technologies there are effectively three networks: Massive Machine-Type Communications (mMTC), Ultra Reliable and Low Latency Communications (URLLC), and Enhanced Mobile BroadBand (eMBB).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Massive Machine-Type Communications (mMTC)&lt;/strong&gt; 5G offers mass connectivity of devices in the form of IoT for various sensing applications. The target is to support 1 million devices per square km – which is beyond 4G capability. In 5G standards, it is commonly referred to as mMTC.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ultra Reliable and Low Latency Communications (URLLC):&lt;/strong&gt; It is important to note that the low delay or latency is better defined as guaranteed or deterministic delay. Guaranteed delay means low delay variation (jitter) must be very low. This capability of 5G in standards is referred to as URLLC.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced Mobile BroadBand (eMBB):&lt;/strong&gt; Another capability offered by 5G is mobile broadband communications – in 2015, the justification was that 4G was going to face a capacity crunch by 2020. There is urgent need for more capacity and higher speed as most applications are based on video and High Definition (HD) video. This aspect is named eMBB. 5G maximum speed is 10 times that of 4G.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The performance requirements of these three networks are extremely conflicting, in terms of data rate, number of users, reliability, latency, security and Quality of Service (QoS). These three networks are supported in one infrastructure using an innovative solution called “network slicing”, where all resources (computing, energy, bandwidth, processing etc.) are dynamically divided (sliced) and each slice carries one type of traffic. The slices do not interfere with each other and all conflicting requirements can be supported using network slicing. Each slice can have its own tailor-made technologies in support of the specific service it carries. There is extensive flexibility to have different security, latency, and data rate QoS mechanisms for each slice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The choice of frequency in deployment of any standard including 5G is important from many points of view such as capital cost, operational cost, capacity, energy consumption and coverage range. Three frequency bands were identified for 5G called the “pioneer bands”: 700 MHz (cost-effective coverage increase in less densely populated areas); 3.5GHz (for high population density environments); and 26 GHz (for environments with very high population densities such as in airports, sport and music venues). So far, the technology is not mature enough to support 26 GHz. MNOs globally have focused on rolling out 5G at mid-band of 3.5GHz and only mobile broadband (eMBB) service based on a B2C model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The use case of 6G:&lt;/strong&gt; Every generation has to bring about new dimension and capabilities to the market and 6G is no exception. In 2023, the ITU Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R) identified three important use cases for 6G (referred to as IMT 2030): ubiquitous connectivity, AI and communication, and integrated sensing and communication. The research community in industry and academia are working on technology solutions in support of these use cases. In 2025, use cases for 6G will be further discussed in 3GPP and refined in terms of value of these use scenarios and whether they can help reduce the cost as well as bring new revenue to MNOs and improvement to environmental sustainability and people’s quality of life. The standardisation on those selected use cases will start around June/July 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are the three use cases and why are they important?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ubiquitous Connectivity:&lt;/strong&gt; universal connectivity is intended to provide broadband communications anywhere. This will hopefully eliminate the problem of patchy coverage. The technical implication of this use case is that the future 6G network will be an Integrated Network of Networks between space (Satellite and UAV/HAPS) or Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN) with Terrestrial Networks (TN). This integration will make the 6G system a three-dimensional Network (3D Network). In a unified 3D network a user is connected irrespective of the user’s geographical location (including land, sea, air and remote locations).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI and Communication:&lt;/strong&gt; The incorporation of AI and Machine Learning (ML) in all layers of communications will lead to an intelligent mobile network that can self-manage and self-optimise communications resources (spectrum and energy consumption) and also enable smarter and more personalised services. Future networks will be so complex that today’s management of these networks by people will be untenable. AI should help to reduce network outages and improve its resiliency against intentional and unintentional incidents. It is also expected to reduce operational costs of a network.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrated Sensing and Communication:&lt;/strong&gt; The decisive difference between 5G and 6G is the importance of sensing. Sensing is an integral part of 6G, also referred to as “Internet of Senses”. Sensing can capture ambient information to be integrated into communication networks for smarter and personalised services to users as well as for the network to manage itself. Considering how dynamic mobile networks are in terms of users, vehicles and robots’ mobility, their variation in user traffic density as well as radio propagation sensing information helps the network to manage its resources more accurately and in time. Integration of sensing into communications offers other advantages: sensing information can enable new services such as locating objects and people, and their mobility, and thus provide more relevant services. For example, driverless vehicles can detect proximity of objects and other vehicles to avoid possible accidents. The combination of sensing data (information) with AI makes AI a more powerful tool. AI algorithms perform better with more – and more varied – data, which can be continuously provided by sensing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;intersections-with-other-technologies&quot;&gt;Intersections with Other Technologies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing technologies that meet 6G-use scenario and technical performance requirements demands that technologies and industries which have been traditionally developed or worked in silos come together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Space and Terrestrial Systems:&lt;/strong&gt; Development of 6G will need expertise in both satellite communications, UAV, HAPs, WiFi and cellular mobile systems. Common standards between these sectors are important for unification between them so that a user can roam between sectors without changing their devices. This requires expertise in system engineering for overall energy efficiency, spectrum efficiency, and a resilient and secure 6G. This also applies to the transportation industry for connected vehicles or eventually driverless vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IT and Communication Technologies:&lt;/strong&gt; Communication technologies are gradually adopting IT technologies in the softwarisation of the system. As with the IT industry, upgrading software is easier and quicker without changing expensive underlying hardware. This is referred to as virtualisation and is a common practice in the computer/desktop industry, where applications and software can be changed without changing the computer hardware. This is expected to reduce the capital cost of telecom networks and help with speeding up introduction of new services and functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Computer Science, Electronic Engineering and Physics:&lt;/strong&gt; Different disciplines of computer science and electronic engineering will need to work together in virtualisation of future telecom systems and more specifically combined expertise needed on AI, wireless (signal processing, RF components, and so on), Cloud, security, radio propagation, antenna and Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces technology, quantum networking and sensing is essential.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biology and Computing:&lt;/strong&gt; Inspired by the way neurons communicate with each other at extremely low energy, neuromorphic computing and communication is considered important in achieving several orders of magnitude in energy efficiency compared to traditional transmitter and receiver approach.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;relevance-of-the-technology-for-national-security&quot;&gt;Relevance of the Technology for National Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Protecting telecommunications networks is a matter of national security. Four risks to consider are highlighted below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;risk-1-supply-chain-risks-and-vendor-diversity&quot;&gt;Risk 1: Supply Chain Risks and Vendor Diversity.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ecosystem of telecommunications equipment providers is limited. This is further complicated by the exclusion of high-risk vendors (such as Huawei) based on concerns over their links to the Chinese state. The market is limited to Ericsson and Nokia, and to a limited extent, Samsung. These vendors already have difficulties in meeting global demand. There is a risk that vendor-specific vulnerabilities could easily spread across the whole network, which is a considerable risk to supply chain resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To counter this dependency in the UK ecosystem, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) assembled a “supply chain diversification task force” in 2020. The taskforce provided a set of recommendations which are being currently implemented in DSIT. The comprehensive recommendations to address the concentration of 5G suppliers in the UK’s infrastructure market cover:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Influencing telecoms standards.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Policy and regulatory measures.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;R&amp;amp;D investment and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Identifying opportunities to invest in long-term R&amp;amp;D and innovation to build UK capability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enhancing market transparency.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Greater international collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;risk-2-the-dominance-of-closed-or-proprietary-radio-access-networks-ran&quot;&gt;Risk 2: The Dominance of Closed or Proprietary Radio Access Networks (RAN)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open RAN is a standard for networks which makes them interoperable, meaning that hardware and software can be sourced from multiple vendors. In theory, this infrastructure model reduces the risk of reliance on one supplier in a telecommunications network. In contrast, closed network architecture means that components within a network are provided by one vendor with little flexibility for wider system integration using components from other suppliers. Traditionally, Huawei, Ericsson and Nokia provide both their own software and hardware for RAN in a closed environment. Consequently, OpenRAN initiatives face serious challenges. While creating long-term market diversity is an important aim, it may take a long time to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DCMS’ supply chain diversification taskforce emphasised a new strategy of “open networking” and more specifically “Open RAN”. It supports an approach where different network functions are disaggregated and connected with open standard interfaces. This open networking paradigm can achieve two important goals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Facilitate the entrance of new players in the ecosystem of vendors with their own niche product.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Put an end to black box telecom equipment which could carry insecure and illegitimate codes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a global level, the UK strategy of open networking is now being supported by different MNOs and governments. It has mobilised new small and medium size companies as well as IT companies to enter the telecom market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are still risks from using Open RAN. An open and disaggregated network might increase the risk of network failure and could be an easier target for network attacks and denial of services. For OpenRAN to succeed, R&amp;amp;D and innovation investment should focus on security, resilience and energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, satellite networks are an important component of 6G that will provide new opportunities for the UK’s satellite industries. A greater prevalence of satellite telecommunications networks may benefit the UK’s strong MNOs community (e.g. Vodafone, EE/BT, Virgin Media O2) while reducing reliance on the traditional group of infrastructure providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;risk-3-sensing-technologies&quot;&gt;Risk 3: Sensing Technologies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sensing technologies should drive improvements in automation, real-time decision-making and the user experience in telecommunications networks. One use case relates to sensing technology and autonomous vehicles which can detect objects, pedestrians or road conditions while leveraging 5G networks. The speed of modern telecommunications like 5G means that sensing technologies work instantaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The national security risks relate to the potential for espionage and vulnerability exploitation. One risk is that sensing technology processes significant amounts of real-time and personal user data. Another risk relates to high-resolution positioning information (below 10 cm accuracy). This technology enables threat actors to locate people and objects with high accuracy. Looking further ahead, as the number of data points increase from sensing technology, it could be used to profile individuals in terms of physical and mental capacities. Finally, as sensing technology is able to scan environments at speed, the impact of the application of this technology in military environments requires further understanding. Sensing of environments is similar to radar and provides more intelligence for operation of civil or military networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;risk-4-artificial-intelligence-in-telecommunications-networks&quot;&gt;Risk 4: Artificial Intelligence in Telecommunications Networks.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of AI and ML for telecommunications networks is in the early stages of R&amp;amp;D, much like other sectors. Current AI solutions are not reliable for time-critical applications such as self-organising and self-healing networks called here as Self-X. In Self-X networking, a network can detect potential network failures or detect anomaly behaviour in traffic, for example, and tries to correct or heal itself from possible outage with zero human operator intervention. Decision-making on possible network failure or prevention must be accurate and timely. Importantly, the combination of sensing technologies and AI is critical for AI training data, solutions and decision-making. At present, AI solutions and decisions are unexplainable and cannot be trusted in time for mission-critical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, critical national infrastructure (e.g. finance, health, utility services, government) are underpinned by telecommunications infrastructure. The 3D-Network of Terrestrial and Non-Terrestrial Networks is a conceptual framework that integrates various types of communications networks, over land, air and space. In theory, the interoperability of this framework provides greater resilience should one area fail. One risk is that satellite communication networks that use inter-satellite links can easily bypass certain countries. This may be a question of sovereign capability and control over communications which will require a Network Operation Centre for any satellite networks to be located in the UK to mitigate this risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;future-developments&quot;&gt;Future Developments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, future telecom development over the next 10-year horizon is briefly explained:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI and Sensing:&lt;/strong&gt; Future telecom starting with 6G will be intelligent, delivering personalised services to overall network management by combining sensing with AI. Current Large Language Models AI and Generative AI mainly use data available on the internet and are suitable for text. Future multi-modal AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) will support voice, text, video and other data. The UK needs to invest in high performance computing facilities and make available relevant data to develop foundational telecom models which are both reliable and explainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mega-constellation of satellite communications:&lt;/strong&gt; The future roadmap for satellite communications and their future generations, in addition to being based on common standards like terrestrial networks, is progressing from fixed broadband (current systems such as Starlink, EutelsatOneWeb) to users, and in support of connectivity for cellular terrestrial network (such as Rivada ) to mobile broadband directly to vehicles and eventually directly to handheld terminals. Direct to device (vehicles and handheld) will be a game changer for mobile systems and in particular satellite communication systems. This will truly unify NTN and TN into one network. There are also ongoing discussions that satcom networks should be providing Positioning, Navigation and Time (PNT) as well as broadcast services. Provision of high accuracy time in addition to GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) is critical for resilience of National Critical Infrastructures that rely on accurate and reliable time information.&lt;/p&gt;

Can industry play a role while contributing to industrial development?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, imported natural gas underpins the UK’s energy security strategy. The UK’s ambitious Clean Power 2030 Action Plan (CP2030) intends to reduce this dependency by delivering an electricity system that uses only 5% unabated natural gas by 2030, with 95% clean power - that includes renewables, nuclear, low carbon dispatchable (hydrogen and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)) supported by storage, interconnections and consumer-led flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as a transitional measure to support energy security, CP2030 retains 35GW of unabated gas capacity. In future, system reliability and energy security must reflect an increasingly electrified and variable system, which will make flexible energy consumption increasingly important. Indeed, demand flexibility may be one of the quickest ways to increase security while reducing energy costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CP2030 cannot sacrifice industrial competitiveness. A key challenge highlighted in the Invest 2035 Industrial Strategy is that UK electricity prices are higher than European countries like Germany and France. Meanwhile, in 2023 industry accounted for 27% of the UK’s electricity demand. Around 70% of electricity consumption from industry was supplied by the grid, with an additional 20% from combined heat and power (CHP), and 10% from onsite generation. Industry could be incentivised to play a bigger role in securing the CP2030 system with solutions that also support lower industrial energy costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2024, less than 27% of UK electricity generation was from unabated natural gas or coal, and at 30%, wind became the largest source of electricity generation. The UK electricity system can manage high levels of variable renewables; the challenge is having enough low carbon generation – such as wind, solar, biomass, hydropower, nuclear, imports and storage – when needed. Multiple solutions are needed, for example, to manage multiple dark days without wind as well as within-day variability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1.3 Low Carbon Generation share in Electricity Mix in 24 hour period&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 1.1 illustrates the monthly, daily, and within day share of low carbon generation in the electricity mix. The first chart shows the day with the lowest share of low carbon generation and the day of the highest share of low carbon generation for each month in 2024. The gap between the two lines shows the variability in that month. The biggest variability is in November, December, and January when there are dark days with little wind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 1.2 shows the daily percentage of low carbon generation in January and July. In the summer, electricity from solar increases and this generation profile is complementary to wind. Adding more wind and solar will shift the lines up, but there will still be a gap, particularly in the dark winter months. Reducing this requires more dispatchable (generation that can be turned on and off) low carbon sources, long-duration storage, or adjusting demand to match electricity availability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 1.3 shows within-day variability. The electricity system has managed 95% from low carbon generation sources and will be able to manage 100% when available in 2025 through digital operations, system services, interconnections, batteries, load following of hydropower, and demand response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the winter of 2022/2023, the demand flexibility service (DFS) enabled consumers and businesses to shift or reduce over 3,300MWh of electricity, reducing demand at key times. In the winter of 2023/2024, DFS was successfully adapted to allow more participation from commercial consumers. In CP2030, demand response is expected to provide 10-12GW of flexibility. Industrial facilities are already among the service providers in DFS, but there is much more potential.Given 61% of demand is industry, commercial, or energy industry, consumer-led flexibility capacity from these consumers will be critical in matching demand to supply in periods of system stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the increase in variable renewables should not increase total electricity costs, one result of Figure 1 is a change in the share of commodity vs. non-commodity electricity costs, with commodity costs (wholesale electricity prices) going down and non-commodity (e.g., system services, delivery, policy) costs going up. For example, constraint management is expected to cost £500 million to £3 billion/year, most of which is redirecting or turning off renewable power. Capacity market charges are also a significant non-commodity cost: the last T4 auction cleared at £65/kW.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;design-system-services-and-capacity-markets-with-energy-intensive-industry-in-mind&quot;&gt;Design system services and capacity markets with energy-intensive industry in mind&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;System services could better reflect the characteristics of industrial consumption: supporting industrials in stacking revenues (in other words, earning revenue and delivering multiple system services from the same asset simultaneously), reducing peak demand, and even participating in capacity markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“By working with industrial and commercial consumers to optimise demand loads (leveraging energy efficiency, storage, and other technologies) so the consumption profile is in harmony with the generation profile, demand flexibility can improve resiliency and be a risk management tool.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industrial facilities, particularly in energy-intensive sectors, have distinct constraints – such as continuous processes or temperature-sensitive production – but also hold significant potential to contribute to system flexibility. By designing demand-side mechanisms that recognise these operational realities, industry could participate more effectively while maintaining both operational and financial stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An ongoing research project by MIT, Accenture, and an industrial cluster in Spain is examining the potential for industrial demand management and flexibility. The study reviewed Spain’s Servicio de Respuesta Activa de la Demanda (SRAD) programme, a structured but initially underutilised demand response mechanism. Industrial participation was limited in the early stages due to uncertainty regarding interruption expectations and a misalignment with planning cycles. Engagement increased once the programme introduced clear expectations on interruption duration, structured compensation models, and well-defined activation timelines, ensuring flexibility requirements were predictable and could be integrated into business planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key finding from this research is that industrial flexibility mechanisms are more effective when they accommodate partial load reductions rather than requiring full facility shutdowns. For instance, forthcoming research conducted by SPRI and Accenture found that in the cement sector mills accounting for a substantial share of a plant’s energy consumption were curtailed while furnaces remained operational, allowing participation in demand response without compromising core production processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“By aligning flexibility mechanisms with industrial needs, we enhance energy efficiency, reduce emissions, and strengthen long-term competitiveness while ensuring industries play a central role in the clean energy transition”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK could enhance industrial participation in flexibility markets by supporting industry to integrate demand response into operational planning, for example, leveraging planned maintenance cycles and scheduled downtime to incorporate flexibility in routine operations; annual MW commitments with minimum and maximum participation thresholds to provide the certainty needed to align curtailment with operational requirements; and tiered activation notice periods, ranging from short-term response to day-ahead scheduling, to allow different industries to engage based on their ability to adjust operations within given timeframes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The growth in electrification of industrial processes supported by initiatives like Make UK’s Electrify Industry and incorporation of the electrification of fleets and heating (including renewable CHP, heat pumps, and emerging power-to-heat technologies) adds further optimisation opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incentive frameworks also need to reflect commercial realities. Conducting sector-specific financial break-even assessments for production adjustments would help tailor incentives to industrial constraints, making flexibility an attractive option rather than a risk to production continuity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industrial clusters are a core part of the UK’s industrial strategy. Although the UK’s industrial cluster approach has focused on CCUS and hydrogen, renewables and grid investments are already part of the cluster plants (e.g. offshore wind in Humber). NESO is trialling a Local Constraint Market in one of its most constrained boundaries to access new sources of flexibility. This could go further to include industrial facilities and fleets in constrained areas. Organisations like Regen have proposed “collaborative power pools” to allow clusters and regions to procure energy under longer-term power purchase agreements (PPAs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 2 shows the location of the industrial clusters and the electricity planning regions. The UKRI CCS and Clean Hydrogen Cluster Approach could be adapted for Clean Power 2030, for example with a competition for established clusters and distribution system and network operators to develop electricity cluster plans that optimise storage, local and/or co-located low carbon generation, infrastructure development, synergies between electricity and heat and transport, system services, peak power reduction, and capacity market participation to reduce electricity costs and support Clean Power 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We have to be pragmatic. We should not necessarily allow policy constraints to over-ride what is technically possible and which would support more efficient delivery of Clean Power [2030] – e.g., the 100MW limit on private wire transfers. We should also aim to maximise efficiencies of power across industrial clusters, which could include such steps as thoughtful co-installation of pipelines and cables to better connect clusters for a lower-carbon future.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to capital project efficiency, there is an opportunity to bring industry flexibility and regional resiliency into the planned work developments during the development of the Local Area Energy Plans (LAEPs), the NESO Regional Energy Strategic Plans, and in the creation of new industrial clusters/groupings through programmes like the Local Industrial Decarbonisation Plans Competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: Industrial Clusters and Electricity Planning Regions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other markets are exploiting cluster opportunities. Since May 2018, Dublin Airport Authority (DAA), the airport operator, has been participating in Ireland’s DS3 (“Delivering a Secure, Sustainable Electricity System”) programme. With the support of Enel X, DAA contributes more than 8MW of flexible capacity into EirGrid’s ancillary services programme by leveraging its energy assets. DAA is remunerated for its services and, by utilising their assets regularly, they improve the resilience of their operations. Airports are useful for energy security as their loads typically run countercyclical to a weather event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With demand growth from new loads (for example, data centres/AI hyperscalers, carbon capture plants), new sources of flexibility (for example, cooling of data centres), growth in onsite solar and renewable CHP, and the electrification of heat and fleets, there will be synergies between bottom-up local and regional solutions and top-down whole system planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The industrial sector is an important partner in delivering a Clean Power 2030 that supports competitiveness and growth. We want to work with industry and regions/clusters, so they have access to reduced electricity costs while improving the reliability, resiliency and security of the electricity and wider energy system.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;--fintan-slye-chief-executive-national-energy-system-operator&quot;&gt;- Fintan Slye, Chief Executive, National Energy System Operator&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industrial facilities are large demand centres that can also be generation, storage, and flexibility centres. There are opportunities to design system services products that match the operational realities of industrial facilities to reduce peak demand. Regional models could be leveraged to find synergies that will reduce electricity costs and reward industry while supporting a clean power system, for example, where on-site storage, local or on-site generation, and shared infrastructure could support thermal constraints, congestion challenges, demand growth, and system resiliency and security. These measures would potentially quite quickly build resilience into the energy system and to industrial operations, improving the ability of the system to cope with shocks and supply constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Flexible demand is too often overlooked as an enabler of progress towards a cheaper power system, which can accommodate variable renewables at scale. We have set an ambition for 12GW of consumer-led flexibility by 2030, in line with NESO advice. Since most electrical demand is industrial and commercial, this is now a critical component of government’s 2030 ambitions. Non-domestic consumer-led flexibility has fallen recently, reducing from 1.7GW in 2021 to 1.2GW in 2022 and then to 0.8GW in 2023. We see steps to support more flexible industrial demand, from industrial clusters and possibly data centres too, as key to reversing this recent trend.”&lt;/p&gt;
