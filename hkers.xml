&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;in-the-future&quot;&gt;In the future…&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;States will integrate artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) into their national security enterprises to gain decision advantages over their rivals.&lt;/strong&gt; The question will not be if a web of algorithms extends across the military, intelligence community, and foreign policy decisionmaking institutions, but how lines of code interact with the human clash of wills at the heart of strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New technology will change the character but not the nature of statecraft and strategy.&lt;/strong&gt; States will still combine diplomacy, economic coercion, and influence campaigns with threats of military force to signal rivals and reassure allies. Human decisionmaking, while augmented by algorithms, remains central to strategy formation and crisis management.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information about AI/ML capabilities will influence how states manage escalation.&lt;/strong&gt; Escalation risks will continue to emerge from how warfighting changes the balance of information available to update models and support human decisionmaking. Intelligence gaps on adversary algorithms increase the likelihood of escalation but only once states have crossed the Rubicon and fight beneath the nuclear threshold.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How will the adoption of AI/ML across a state’s national security enterprise affect crisis decisionmaking? For example, what would the Cuban Missile Crisis look like at machine speed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond current policy debates, congressional testimony, new strategies, and a drive to identify, test, and evaluate standards, there is a fundamental question of how computer algorithms will shape crisis interactions between nuclear powers. Further, will refined AI/ML models pull people back from the brink or push them over the edge during crises that are as much about fear and emotion as they are rational decisionmaking? How will humans and machines interact during a crisis between nuclear powers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;This edition of On Future War uses a series of wargames as an experiment to analyze how players with 10 or more years of national security experience approach crisis decisionmaking given variable levels of knowledge about a rival great power’s level of AI/ML integration across its national security enterprise.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer this question, the CSIS Futures Lab held a series of crisis simulations in early 2023 analyzing how AI/ML will shape the future of deterrence. The games — designed as a randomized control trial — explored human uncertainty regarding a rival great power’s level of AI/ML integration and how this factor affected strategic stability during a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two major findings emerged. First, across the simulations, varying levels of AI/ML capabilities had no observable effect on strategy and a general trend of trying to combine multiple instruments of power when responding to a crisis. While data science and the use of AI/ML to augment statecraft will almost certainly be a defining feature of the near future, there appear to be constants of strategy that will survive the emergence of such new technologies. Diplomacy, economic coercion, and influence campaigns will survive even as machines collect and process more information and help shape national security decisionmaking. AI/ML will augment but not fundamentally change strategy. That said, there is an urgent need to start training national security professionals to understand what AI/ML is and is not, as well as how it can support human decisionmaking during foreign policy crises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, how nations fight in the shadow of nuclear weapons will change as states selectively target the battle networks of their rivals. Even though the perceived risk of escalation is not likely to be affected by the balance of AI/ML capabilities, the criteria used to select flexible response options will change. States will need to balance countering adversary algorithms with ensuring that they do not blind an adversary and risk triggering a “dead-hand” — a fast and automated system developed by the Soviet Union to launch nuclear weapons — escalation spiral. This need to strike the right balance in military targeting will put a new premium on intelligence collection that maps how rival states employ AI/ML capabilities at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels. It could also change how states approach arms control, with a new emphasis on understanding where and how AI/ML capabilities augment crisis decisionmaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;deterrence-battle-networks-and-aiml&quot;&gt;Deterrence, Battle Networks, and AI/ML&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern deterrence literature focuses on how states bargain, short of war, through threats and commitments. These signals change how each side calculates the costs and benefits of going to war, implying that the less information each side has about the balance of capabilities and resolve, the harder it becomes to encourage restraint. Signaling and communication play a central role in how states seek to manipulate risk to deny an adversary an advantage, including incentives for seeking a fait accompli by military force. Even literature that stresses the psychological and cultural antecedents that shape how foreign policy leaders approach crisis diplomacy share this emphasis on the central role of information. Rational calculations break down based on past information (i.e., how beliefs shape expectations) and flawed weighting (e.g., bias and prospect theory).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In modern military planning and operations, information is managed through battle networks. The ability to conduct long-range precision strikes and track adversary troop movements all rests on aggregating and analyzing data. This logic is a foundation for the Coalition Joint All-Domain Command and Control (CJADC2) network, which is designed to push and pull data across distributed networks of sensors and shooters connected by faster communication, processing, and decision layers informed by AI/ML. The network is the new theory of victory at the center of the new Joint Warfighting Concept, which prioritizes synchronizing multidomain effects in time and space. For this reason, information is now a key component of military power and, by proxy, a state’s ability to bargain with a rival. The more information a state can process, assisted by algorithms, the more likely it is to identify windows of opportunity and risk as well as align ends, ways, and means to gain a relative advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, most of the emerging literature on AI/ML and the future of war focuses more on risk and ethical considerations than bargaining advantages. First, multiple accounts claim that AI/ML will create new risks, including “flash wars,” and are likely to produce destabilizing effects along multiple vectors. The thinking goes that the new era of great power competition will be marked by an “indelicate balance of terror” as Russia, China, and the United States race to acquire technological game changers. To the extent that AI/ML alters military power, it could affect how states perceive the balance of power. As perceptions about power and influence change, it could trigger inadvertent escalation risks. Inside the bureaucracy, defense planners could rely on brittle and black-boxed AI/ML recommendations that create new forms of strategic instability. At the tactical level, the speed of autonomous weapons systems could lead to inadvertent escalation while also undermining signaling commitment during a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two issues with these claims. First, arguments about the destabilizing role of AI/ML have yet to be explored beyond literature reviews, alternative scenarios, and illustrative wargames designed more for gaining perspective than for evaluating strategy. In other words, hypotheses about risk and escalation have not been tested. Second, accounts about emerging technology and inadvertent escalation often discount the role of increased information in reducing tensions. To the extent that algorithms applied across a battle network help reduce uncertainty, they are likely to support deterrence. You can never lift the fog of war, but you can make weather forecasts and describe what is known, unknown, and unknowable. This alternative logic sits at the foundation of the “wargame as an experiment” the CSIS Futures Lab constructed to analyze how AI/ML could affect strategic stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;would-you-like-to-play-a-game&quot;&gt;Would You Like to Play a Game?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, the CSIS Futures Lab conducted two tabletop exercises exploring a crisis scenario involving AI/ML’s effect on strategic decisionmaking. The tabletop exercise focused on a crisis involving a third-party state between two rivals, each of which had nuclear weapons and a second-strike capability. The rival states in the exercise were abstracted to remove bias about current rivalries that define the international system, thus reducing, but not eliminating, the risk of confounding factors skewing gameplay. As a result, players made choices about how to respond to a crisis and which elements of a rival state’s battle network (i.e., CJADC2) to target. The games consisted of 29 individual players, each with over 10 years of national security experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Two tabletop exercises analyzing how players develop flexible deterrent and flexible response options during a crisis between rival nuclear states&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Fake scenario to reduce bias&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Players all had at least 10 years of national security experience&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Players randomly assigned into different treatment groups&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Three rounds of crisis interactions, moving from competition to the early stages of a military conflict&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game design adapted an earlier tabletop exercise used to study modern competition and cyber escalation dynamics known as Corcyra. This game put players in a fictional scenario involving a crisis standoff between two nuclear rivals: Green State and Purple State over a small state, Orange State. Green State and Orange State are treaty allies. Purple State and Orange State have a maritime territorial dispute. Players, assuming the role of Green State, make decisions about the best mix of flexible deterrent (competition) and flexible response options as the crisis unfolds. The game scenario — involving a territorial dispute, enduring rivalry, and alliance networks — built in dynamics associated with escalation to focus on low-probability, high-consequence foreign policy events. The use of fake countries seeks to make players less likely to introduce bias in the results based on prior beliefs about current powers such as the United States and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unknown to the players, Purple State’s moves and decisions were predetermined to walk players up the escalation ladder, a technique known in the wargame community as a 1.5-sided design. This game design captures the uncertainty and interactive complexity (i.e., reaction, counteraction) of two-sided games but better supports capturing and coding observations about player preferences and assessments of risks and opportunities. Applied to Corcyra, a 1.5-sided game design enabled the CSIS Futures Lab to collect data on how players made decisions about competition and conventional conflict in the shadow of nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the game proceeded, players were randomly assigned into two different treatment groups and led into different rooms with a facilitator. Each group was given an identical game packet that included an overview of the crisis and military balance between Green State and Purple State as well as the standing policy objectives for Green State to deter Purple State’s actions against its treaty allies while limiting the risk of a broader war (i.e., extended general deterrent). The only difference between the two groups was in the intelligence estimate of the extent of Purple State’s AI/ML capabilities in relation to Green State. As seen in Table 1, this difference meant that everything was constant (e.g., military balance, policy objectives, and Purple State’s actions across the game) except for the knowledge the players received about their rival’s level of AI/ML capabilities. This design reflects a factorial vignette survey, controlling for whether AI/ML capability is known or unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the game, each group (i.e., Treatment A and B) responded to a set of adversary escalation vignettes. Unknown to the participants was that each subsequent move would see their rival escalate and move up the escalation ladder to ensure a more dynamic interplay between current decisionmaking and maintaining sufficient forces and options for future interactions. The design also ensured that players were forced to confront the threat of conventional strikes on the nuclear enterprise and the limited use of nuclear weapons in a counterforce role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/V6FPvbW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Excerpts from the Corcyra Game Packets&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first round of the game dealt with flexible deterrent options and crisis response. Afterwards, each group received a brief about a crisis — between their treaty ally (Orange State) and nuclear rival (Purple State) — and each player (Green State) was asked to craft a response using multiple instruments of power (e.g., diplomatic, informational, military, and economic) by picking three options from a menu of 24 preapproved flexible deterrent options. Each instrument of power had six response options based on the implied level of escalation. This design allowed the CSIS Futures Lab to see if varying levels of AI/ML capabilities had an effect on how players approached competition and campaigning as part of a larger deterrent posture. Specifically, it allowed the research team to test how the capability affected overall competition strategy and escalation dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second round began with a limited military strike by Purple State on Orange State. Players were briefed that Purple State conducted a series of limited strikes on an airfield and naval base in Orange State. Orange State intercepted 50 percent of the cruise missiles in the attack, but the remaining 20 — fired from a mix of Purple State aircraft and naval warships — damaged an Orange State frigate, downed two maritime patrol aircraft, and destroyed an ammunition depot. Initial reports suggested that as many as 20 Orange State military personnel were killed in action, with another 30 wounded. There were also four Green State military advisers working on the base at the time who were killed in the attack. The attacks coincided with widespread reports of global positioning system (GPS) denial, jamming, and cyber intrusions in both Orange State and Green State. Purple State said the attack was limited to the military facility Orange State had used in past provocations, but it vows broader attacks if Orange State or Green State responds. In this manner, Purple State’s conventional military response reflected core concepts in modern military theory about multidomain operations, joint firepower strikes, and sixth-generation warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After receiving this intelligence update, players were asked to nominate flexible response options. First, the players had to recommend which of the military responses from the menu of 24 options they recommended in response to a limited military strike by Purple State on Orange State. Players also had to specify which layer of Purple State’s battle network they wanted to affect through their recommended response: sensing, processing, communicating, decision, or effectors. This game design limited the range of options open to players to support statistical analysis and comparison between the two treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third round examined if players adjusted their military response options to conventional strikes on their nuclear enterprise. Players were briefed that Purple State conducted a series of conventional strikes against Orange State and Green State. In Orange State, the strikes targeted major military facilities and even the Orange State leadership (both military and civilian) with a mix of cruise missiles, loitering munitions, and special operations forces (SOF) raids. The attacks included striking Green State intelligence satellites and major early-warning radars as well as key airfields where Green State keeps the majority of its strike and bomber aircraft squadrons. The mass precision conventional strikes — launched largely by a mix of long-range strike and bomber aircraft and submarines — also targeted key port facilities in Green State used to reload vertical launch cells and support Green State submarine forces. Orange State lost over 30 percent of its military combat power and 50 percent of its civilian critical infrastructure related to water treatment, energy, and telecommunications. Its leaders survived the decapitation strikes but are enacting continuity of government protocols. Green State has suffered 10 percent attrition in its air and naval forces. Purple State has threatened that it may be forced to expand strikes, to include using nuclear weapons, if Green State conducts additional military strikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-the-game-revealed-about-the-future-of-deterrence&quot;&gt;What the Game Revealed about the Future of Deterrence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;flexible-deterrent-options&quot;&gt;Flexible Deterrent Options&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the game, each player had three options from any category (i.e., diplomatic, informational, military, or economic) to choose. Table 2 summarizes how frequently each player selected flexible response options linked to different instruments of power during the initial crisis response (i.e., Round 1). Analyzing these choices provides a window into how players with at least 10 years of national security experience approached the “ways” of crisis management toward the “end” of reestablishing deterrence. If AI/ML is inherently more escalation prone, one would expect to see a statistically significant difference between the treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no statistically significant difference between the two treatments. The balance of AI/ML capabilities did not alter how players approached their competitive strategy and crisis management. Across the treatments, players developed an integrated approach, often choosing multiple instruments of power to pressure their rival, as opposed to focusing on a strictly military response. No player in either treatment used only a singular instrument of power, such as only responding with military options. On the contrary, over 60 percent of players in each treatment selected multiple instruments of power. In other words, the level of AI/ML capabilities between rivals did not directly alter early-stage crisis response and the development of flexible deterrent options designed to stabilize the situation and reestablish deterrence. This finding runs contrary to perspectives that see AI/ML as inherently escalatory and risk prone. While AI/ML will augment multiple analytical processes from the tactical to the strategic level, national security leaders will still make critical decisions and seek ways to slow down and manage a crisis. The risk is likely more in how people interact with algorithms during a crisis than in the use of data science and machine learning to analyze information and intelligence. AI/ML does not pose risks on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/WhstiFg.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 2: Selected Deterrent Options&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During discussions in Round 1 for Treatment A (AI/ML Capabilities Known), players focused more on strategy as it relates to shaping human decisionmaking. In the first round, participants were divided over whether Purple State’s actions were hostile or not but conceded that Purple State was attempting to signal that Green State’s actions in the region were unwarranted. Of note, this focus on signaling was more about human intention than algorithmic assessments. The players generally saw the crisis as about human leaders in rival states seeking advantage through national security bureaucracies augmented by AI/ML capabilities. In their discussions, humans were in the loop and focused on finding ways to de-escalate the crisis without signaling weakness. The discussion was less about how algorithms might skew information and more about how to have direct communication and clear messages passed through diplomats to other human leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This logic drove the players to focus on developing the situation through diplomatic outreach while increasing intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) assets in the region. Although participants agreed upon the utility of diplomacy as a response to the crisis, they diverged in their opinion on whether the efforts should publicly call for de-escalation or privately use third parties or influence campaigns to warn Purple State’s elites about further escalation. Group members widely supported increasing ISR assets in the region to provide early warning of future Purple State military deployments and increase protection of friendly communications and intelligence-collection assets. Additionally, group members sought to privately share intelligence with allies in the region. Again, AI/ML was less a focal point than a method to gain better situational awareness and identify the best mechanisms for crisis communication with the rival state (i.e., private, public, or third-party). People, more than machines, were central to crisis management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where AI/ML did enter the discussion was with respect to how the rival battle networks with high degrees of automation could misperceive the deployment of additional ISR capabilities during a crisis. Although participants strongly believed that this action was essential, they recognized the possibility that Purple State’s AI/ML augmented strategic warning systems may not be able to interpret the difference between signaling resolve or deliberate escalation. At the same time, they thought the direct communication channels should augment this risk and that most algorithmic applications analyzing the deployment of ISR assets would be more probabilistic than deterministic, thinking in terms of conditional probabilities about escalation risks rather than jumping to the conclusion that war was imminent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put differently, since all AI/ML is based on learning patterns from data or rules-based logic, the underlying patterns of past ISR deployments would likely make the system — even absent a human — unlikely to predict a low-probability event (i.e., war) when there are other more common options associated with a ubiquitous event such as increasing intelligence. If anything, the reverse would be more likely. Since wars and even militarized crises are rare events, an AI/ML algorithm — depending on the training data and parameters — would treat them as such absent human intervention. This does not mean there is a zero probability of “flash wars” and misreading the situation. Rather, the point is that given the low number of wars and militarized crises between states, there are few patterns, and there will almost certainly be a human in the loop. No senior national security leader is likely to cede all decisionmaking to an algorithm in a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treatment B saw a similar discussion between players that focused on using multiple instruments of power and identifying de-escalation opportunities. Of note, it also saw more diplomatic outreach, with players wanting to ensure they could cut through the uncertainty about Purple State’s AI/ML capabilities through direct and indirect diplomatic engagements and crisis communication. In Treatment B, concern about the strengths and limitations of an unknown AI/ML capability in Purple State had a significant impact on group decisionmaking. Group members desired a mutual understanding of Green State and Purple State’s AI/ML capabilities, believing that greater clarity over the balance and use of AI/ML capabilities between rivals would lead to stability, rather than the current instability they faced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This focus led participants to recommend deploying ISR capabilities to identify how and if Purple State was using AI-assisted ISR that might misread their intentions. Some players expressed concern about whether the use of ISR would undermine their efforts at de-escalation. Players suggested that if Purple State detected increased deployment of collection and early-warning assets, they would feel pressured to deploy military forces to prevent the appearance of a capability gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, players believed that deploying additional ISR was worth the potential escalation risk because it was essential to analyze adversary actions as they unfolded. These groups sought to combine diplomatic, flexible deterrent options such as third-party mediation and redeployment of naval and aviation assets away from Purple State to signal a desire to de-escalate. In other words, national security professionals wanted to ensure there was a check on algorithmic reasoning during a crisis and were willing to deploy assets to that end and even slow down operations to buy time and space for diplomacy and clear signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reasoning runs counter to claims that AI triggers a security dilemma that leads to inadvertent escalation. In international relations, a security dilemma is a situation where efforts by one state to increase its security cause rival states to experience more insecurity. The concept is used to explain why states find themselves pulled into arms races, crisis escalation, and war. The security dilemma can become especially acute based, among other things, on new technologies that make it difficult to assess whether offensive or defensive military capabilities create strategic advantage. As a result, one would expect to see the emergence of AI/ML capabilities trigger a security dilemma and inadvertent escalation. Rival states would opt for more severe crisis response options in their selection of flexible deterrent options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, this dynamic did not emerge in the crisis simulations based on player discussions and statistical analysis. Players could select from a menu of 24 crisis response options varying by magnitude across each of the instruments of power. Using this magnitude, the CSIS Futures Lab could analyze whether there was more or less coercive pressure applied across the treatments. As can be seen in Table 3, there was no statistically significant difference in the magnitudes across the two treatments. The balance of AI/ML capabilities did not affect how rival states approached crisis management and competitive strategy. Based on discussions, players searched for ways to escape the security dilemma through diplomatic outreach and intelligence across both treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the average escalation level between the two treatments is not different, there appear to be inverse preferences for weak signaling and crisis probing that players adopted to manage crisis escalation. Table 3 below shows the levels of escalation magnitude, ranging from 1 (“low”) to 6 (“high”), that players opted for when they selected diplomatic, information, military, and economic instruments of power to signal their rival and shape the crisis. Lower magnitude signals (1) — which were predominantly diplomatic and intelligence activities — were more than twice as likely in Treatment A (10) than in B (4). Players assessed that AI/ML-enabled battle networks would detect weak signals and help support a defensive posture while searching for a crisis off-ramp. Inversely, in Treatment B (AI/ML Capabilities Unknown), players adopted more of probing strategy using mid-range signaling (i.e., level 3 escalation magnitude) to test adversary capabilities and resolve. In Treatment A (AI/ML Capabilities Known), only 36 percent (14) of the responses fell in this range while Treatment B (AI/ML Capabilities Unknown) saw 60 percent (23). This finding implies that the balance of knowledge about AI/ML capabilities could alter escalation dynamics in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/R2zmJge.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 3: Contingency Table Escalation Magnitude&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;battle-networks&quot;&gt;Battle Networks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the second round, players found themselves confronting a series of limited strikes by a rival state. In the third round, the situation escalated to theater-wide conventional strikes to evaluate how players shifted their military strategy. In these rounds, players recommended how best to attack their rival state’s battle network in terms of the optimal layer to target: sensor, communications, processing, decision, or effects. If the balance of AI/ML capabilities affects military operations, one would expect to see targeting differences across the treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet,there was no statistically significant difference across the treatments in relation to battle network targeting preferences. As seen in the contingency table below, targeting preferences varied across the treatments, but not as much as expected. In treatments where AI/ML capabilities were known and balanced, players preferred to try and target the processing and decisionmaking layers in an effort to deny the other side tempo and a decisionmaking advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9dBT491.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 4: Battle Network Targeting Preferences&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Player discussions drew out the logic behind the difference. When AI/ML was known, players discussed how targeting the decision layer could be a pathway to slow down a crisis and give humans a chance to respond and degrade the ability of a rival to retaliate at machine speed. At the same time, they wanted to limit targeting the processing layer. Players discussed how this layer, which consists of large data hubs, is a new form of critical infrastructure that is often co-located with energy and telecommunications infrastructure to support powering computers and distributing information. Hitting this layer could pull a rival state deeper into an escalation spiral due to concerns about civilian deaths and counter-value targeting. As a result, they discussed how best to target the decision layer, including introducing new forms of flexible deterrent and response options designed to spoof and confuse AI/ML applications that help senior leaders analyze a crisis. The goal was to gain an information advantage and use it for leverage without triggering inadvertent escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When AI/ML was unknown, participants opted to target effectors (e.g., conventional weapons) because it was assessed as the highest payoff target given uncertainty about adversary decisionmaking capabilities. In the absence of knowledge about the depth of AI/ML in a rival state’s battle network, players opted to change the correlation of forces in terms of neutralizing military capabilities capable of launching a retaliatory strike. Although players debated the use of cyber capabilities to degrade Purple State’s military capabilities, players wanted a kinetic strike because it was a visible signal, could be quickly executed, and could target a limited range of proportional targets to demonstrate resolve to the international community without significant escalation risk. This insight impliesaneed to rethink aspects of military targeting in an era almost certain to be defined by increasingly sophisticated AI/ML applications supporting crisis decisionmaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;escalation-risks&quot;&gt;Escalation Risks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite valid concerns about AI/ML and nuclear escalation, there were no statistically significant differences between the treatments in relation to how players assessed the risk. This finding is based on comparing assessments of nuclear escalation risks for Treatment A (AI/ML Capabilities Known) and B (AI/ML Capabilities Unknown). In each round, players selected how likely their flexible response option was to trigger nuclear escalation by picking a number from 1 to 6 with the following values: (1) no risk, (2) risk of limited conventional military confrontation, (3) risk of conventional strikes to degrade nuclear enterprise, (4) risk of limited nuclear attack, (5) risk of large-scale nuclear attack against nuclear enterprise, and (6) risk of large-scale nuclear attack against civilian targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Round 2, when players had to recommend a flexible military response option to counter a rival state, there was no statistically significant difference in their risk assessment. In both games, players assessed the risk as a rival state responding with nonnuclear, limited conventional retaliatory strikes. When AI/ML capabilities were unknown, it created a unique discussion about escalation dynamics. Some players expressed concern that targeting the communication layer in a battle network could lead bad algorithms to get even worse. Absent new information, a rival state’s AI/ML models would be more prone to provide bad or at least outdated advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Round 3, when players had to respond to widespread conventional military strikes, there was also no statistically significant difference in players’ risk assessment. Across both treatments, players saw an increased risk of a retaliatory conventional strike on their nuclear enterprise. When AI/ML capabilities were known, players expressed more concern about a limited nuclear strike and how to best understand the algorithms their rival integrated across the national security enterprise at the tactical, operational, and strategic level. More than technological advantage, players assessed that the key to understanding future AI/ML escalation risks during a nuclear crisis rests in mapping how algorithms inform decisionmaking at echelon. This requirement to understand the range of AI/ML systems augmenting a national security enterprise creates entirely new intelligence requirements critical to early warning and arms control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a statistically significant difference between the treatments with respect to conventional escalation. This finding (Table 5 below) is based on comparing which military response option players opted for in Round 3 in response to widespread conventional strikes. Treatment A (AI/ML Capabilities Known) players took a more measured response and conducted limited strikes on their rival’s military designed to manage escalation risk. During game discussions, players brought up the idea that they were signaling both the rival human leaders and their algorithms, trying to preserve the possibility of an off-ramp. Alternatively, in Treatment B (AI/ML Capabilities Unknown), players took a more aggressive, decisive response but still beneath the nuclear threshold. The findings are more nuanced than what the numbers tell. During the counteraction phase, participants were united in their belief that Green and Purple States were now in a state of war. All players assessed Purple State as “hostile” and considered “crisis escalation imminent.” Since players knew crisis escalation was imminent, they struggled to find an effective response that would signal resolve and commitment to their treaty ally Orange State that would not trigger strategic escalation. Treatment B players argued that “escalating to de-escalate” would be the most viable strategy to ensure a crisis would not lead to greater hostilities. For Treatment B, unknown AI/ML capabilities meant that Green State players were aware of the existence of Purple State’s AI/ML capabilities, yet they did not understand how these systems were being integrated into their decisionmaking process. The “escalate to de-escalate” approach of the Treatment B players was designed to offset the intelligence asymmetry gap with a stronger conventional military response. This finding suggests that a priority intelligence requirement in future crises will be the depth and extent of AI/ML systems across a rival state’s national security enterprise and operational battle networks. It also suggests a possible new form of inadvertent escalation risk associated with testing a rival’s capabilities to reduce uncertainty. This finding has significant implications for thinking about the future of arms control and how to approach national intelligence requirement generation optimized for an algorithmic future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-recommendations&quot;&gt;Policy Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings from these crisis simulations point to recommendations that the United States and its network of partners and allies should consider as they build interoperable battle networks where AI/ML supports decisionmaking at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Embrace experimentation and an agile mindset.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The national security community needs to stop worrying about Skynet, alongside other technology-related threat inflation, and start building applications that help people navigate the massive volume of information that is already overwhelming staff and decisionmakers during a crisis. There is a need for more experiments designed to calibrate how best to integrate AI/ML into national security decisionmaking that build on established efforts such as the Global Information Dominance Exercise (GIDE). These exercises connect combatant commands and test their ability to work along a seamless battle network moderated by AI/ML (i.e., human-on-the-loop) during a crisis and the transition to conflict. Each GIDE helps the larger Department of Defense think about how to support modern campaigning consistent with emerging doctrine, including the Joint Warfighting Concept and Joint Concept for Competing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States needs to expand the GIDE series and examine crisis response from an interagency and coalition perspective. These experiments should map how different executive agencies — from the Department of State to the Department of the Treasury — approach crisis management, with an eye toward enabling better decisionmaking through aggregating and analyzing data. Starting simple with a clear understanding of how each agency approaches flexible deterrent options and how these options are evaluated in the National Security Council will provide insight into where and how to best augment strategy formation and crisis response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Engage in campaign analysis.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A constant in war is the fight for information and how commanders employ reconnaissance and security operations alongside collecting intelligence to gain situational awareness, anticipate change, and seek advantage. That fight for information will take place along complex battle networks managed by AI/ML applications, creating a need for new concepts of maneuver, security, and surprise. How a state protects its battle network while degrading its rivals could well become the true decisive operation for a future campaign and an entirely new form of schwerpunkt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department of Defense needs to expand modern campaign analysis to explore how to fight a network. These studies should combine historical campaign insights with wargames, modeling, and strategic analysis, with an eye toward balancing military advantage with escalation dynamics. The studies should evaluate existing processes such as joint planning and joint targeting methodologies to see if they are still viable in campaigns characterized by competing battle networks. It is highly likely that the net result will be new processes and methods that both accelerate tempo and keep a careful eye on escalation risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. From open skies to open algorithms, start a broader dialogue about twenty-first-century arms control.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is a need to start thinking about what arms control looks like in the AI era. Managing weapons inventory may prove less valuable to the future of deterrence than establishing norms, regimes, and treaties governing military actions that target the decision and processing layers of modern battle networks in rival nuclear states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a crisis where software at echelon is searching for efficiencies to accelerate decisionmaking, there is a risk that senior leaders find themselves pulled into escalation traps. This pull could be accelerated by attacks on key systems associated with early warning and intelligence. The sooner states work together to map the risks and build in commonly understood guardrails, the lower the probability of inadvertent or accidental escalation between nuclear rivals. These efforts should include Track 2 and Track 3 tabletop exercises and dialogues that inform how rival states approach crisis management. For example, it would be better to have officials from the United States and China discuss how multi-domain strike networks and automation affect escalation dynamics before a crisis in the Taiwan Strait rather than after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the use of AI/ML capabilities in national security is almost certain to increase in the coming years, there needs to be a larger debate about if and how any information technology augments strategic and military decisionmaking. The stakes are too high to walk blindly into the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, the national security community needs to accelerate its experimentation with how to integrate AI/ML into modern battle networks, with an eye toward better understanding crisis decisionmaking, campaigning, and arms control. It is not enough to optimize joint targeting and how fast the military can sense, make sense, and gain an advantage. The new world will require rethinking military staff organizations little changed since Napoleon and legacy national security bureaucratic design and planning processes. It will require thinking about how best to support human decisionmaking given a flood of information still subject to uncertainty, fog, and friction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the findings here that AI/ML is as likely to play a stabilizing role as it is a destabilizing role, there is a still a risk that the world’s nuclear states inadvertently code their way to Armageddon. As a result, it is important to challenge the findings and acknowledge the limitations of the study. First, the observations are still limited and could be subject to confounding effects caused by age, gender, and each player’s type of national security experience. Future efforts should increase the full range of participants. Second, the results need more observations to analyze not just the balance of known versus unknown AI/ML capabilities, but also if risk perception and escalation change based on a larger number of treatments addressing different AI/ML levels (e.g., “no AI/ML capability,” “more AI/ML capability,” etc.). Last, experts tend to get things wrong and may not see change. Future research should open the experiment up to a wider range of participants and compare how perceptions in the general public compare to those of experts. In the ideal case, these games would also involve more non-U.S. players.&lt;/p&gt;

As policymakers grapple with the “two-near-peer” challenge, a crucial question remains: How should the United States mitigate the risk of opportunistic aggression?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;foreword&quot;&gt;Foreword&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the ongoing war in Ukraine, growing conflicts in the Middle East, and potential for war with China or North Korea, the United States and its allies are facing an enormously complex geopolitical landscape — one further complicated by the changing ways in which adversaries are leveraging nuclear weapons. As the risk of a large-scale conflict increases, particularly with China or Russia but also with North Korea, so too does the potential for nuclear weapons to be used, meaning each individual conflict carries increased risks of nuclear use. At the same time, increased cooperation among China, Russia, and North Korea makes it more likely U.S. adversaries could coordinate or take advantage of potential conflicts with the United States or its allies, increasing the likelihood U.S. forces will have to fight a two-theater or two-front war. Without sufficient conventional forces to deter conflicts from breaking out in the first place, the United States may be forced to rely more heavily on nuclear weapons to deter or respond to aggression on a second front, whether Washington intends to or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these dynamics increase the risk that nuclear weapons will be used in a future conflict — an outcome the United States has tried to avoid for more than 75 years. Managing these challenges requires deeper interoperability with U.S. allies, a clear prioritization of U.S. resources, and a willingness to make tough decisions about where to accept risk. It also requires a better understanding of how opportunistic aggression — or the possibility a second adversary could confront the United States and its allies while they are already engaged in a conflict elsewhere — would complicate U.S. and combined force planning in new and unexpected ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why the Project on Nuclear Issues (PONI) at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) convened an inaugural Mid-Career Cadre Task Force on Understanding Opportunistic Aggression in the Twenty-First Century. This effort was designed to showcase the exceptional talent and expertise of members from the Mid-Career Cadre and generate new insights on one of the central challenges associated with deterring two nuclear peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report should serve as a wake-up call for senior leaders. War is not inevitable, but if it occurs, the United States and its allies will face very real constraints on how they can deter and respond to aggression on a second front. Such scenarios could place significant demands on U.S. nuclear forces in a way that many policymakers today do not appear to appreciate. Understanding what decisions senior leaders might be asked to make in certain scenarios and what forces might be available — or not — could have a significant impact on future planning, resourcing, and policy decisions. Toward this end, the task force identified several recommendations that deserve serious consideration and action, from establishing a statutory nuclear policy council to developing an engagement plan for discussing opportunistic aggression scenarios with U.S. allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We cannot underestimate the enormity of the challenges the United States is facing or the difficulty of the decisions senior leaders must make now and in the coming years. CSIS and PONI are grateful for the task force’s time and energy on this important issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-questions-and-scope&quot;&gt;Key Questions and Scope&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States faces an increasingly contested strategic environment that raises significant, unanswered questions about the role nuclear weapons will play in U.S. national security strategy going forward, and the forces that will be required to deter — and, if necessary, defeat — adversaries. For the first time in its history, the United States must contend with not one but two major nuclear powers. This poses several challenges, chief among them how the United States and its allies might confront simultaneous or sequential high-end conflicts with multiple nuclear-armed adversaries. As policymakers grapple with the “two-near-peer” challenge, a crucial question remains: How should the United States mitigate the risk of opportunistic aggression?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To explore these issues and generate new thinking on a central issue affecting future nuclear strategy and posture, the Project on Nuclear Issues (PONI) at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) launched the Mid-Career Cadre Task Force on Understanding Opportunistic Aggression in the Twenty-First Century. For the purposes of this report, opportunistic aggression refers to the use of force against the United States or its allies while they are already engaged in a conflict. The task force differentiates between opportunistic aggression and the broader concept of opportunism. While opportunistic states could take advantage of a distracted United States in many ways (e.g., economic actions), actions that fall short of launching an attack are not opportunistic aggression and deserve attention elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group, comprising mid-career experts from both governmental and nongovernmental organizations, represents a diversity of views and backgrounds. Through a series of four multiday intensive workshops in the first half of 2023, the task force explored how the United States and its allies can best deter opportunistic aggression; what, if any, changes to force structure and posture are needed to address the two-near-peer problem; and how planning for opportunistic aggression scenarios in the future might affect extended deterrence commitments, strategic stability, and arms control efforts. Discussions centered on four overarching questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What challenges does opportunistic aggression create for the United States and its allies?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the United States is engaged in a conventional conflict against a nuclear-armed adversary in one theater, how might that affect U.S. planning and force posture in a second theater, and what role might nuclear weapons play in each contingency?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What are the implications for U.S. allies, and how might this affect extended deterrence commitments in the future?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Does the United States need to be prepared to fight two simultaneous nuclear wars? How might this affect arms control and strategic stability efforts?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report is the culmination of the group’s effort to outline key findings and recommendations for policymakers to consider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The task force focused primarily on the implications for U.S. nuclear strategy and forces. It did not focus on what specific steps the United States and its allies might take to strengthen conventional deterrence and defense in both the European and Indo-Pacific theaters, nor did it seek to engage in the growing debate on whether and how U.S. support to Ukraine affects the military’s ability to wage a potential conflict against China — a subset of the broader challenges posed by opportunistic aggression. Strengthening conventional deterrence and nonnuclear planning and operations, as well as the broader U.S. defense industrial base, is critical, but the specific parameters for doing so are outside the scope of this report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;summary-of-findings-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Summary of Findings and Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deterring and potentially responding to two separate conflicts or contingencies presents unique challenges, depending on who initiates or takes advantage of a conflict. The task force determined that understanding the specific resource conservation and distribution challenges the United States and its allies might face, as well as the reduced response capability and insufficient resource challenges certain scenarios might bring about, will be critical to identifying and better preparing for the most consequential opportunistic aggression scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Understanding the specific resource conservation and distribution challenges the United States and its allies might face, as well as the reduced response capability and insufficient resource challenges certain scenarios might bring about, will be critical to identifying and better preparing for the most consequential opportunistic aggression scenarios.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding when a leader might initiate aggression or use nuclear weapons — and what might deter them from doing so — is one of the most difficult intelligence requirements. Assessing how a leader’s calculations might shift if the United States and its allies are already engaged in a conflict elsewhere complicates this matter significantly. The task force identified four key factors in determining the likelihood a state will opportunistically initiate an aggressive action while the United States is already involved in a conflict. An adversary’s perception of a significant change in U.S. and allied capabilities, will, or alliance strength could lead an adversary to determine that there is an opportunity to initiate aggression to achieve its objectives. Changes or failures in signaling could also lead to this conclusion. Improving collection on and assessment of these dynamics will be essential and will allow the United States and its allies not only to better anticipate when opportunistic aggression might occur but also to provide a critical baseline for better tailoring deterrence strategies and understanding how those strategies might interact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In analyzing the wide range of possible opportunistic aggression scenarios the United States might face, the task force concluded the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Policymakers appear unaware of the risks they are accepting in regard to opportunistic aggression and the demands certain scenarios could place on U.S. nuclear forces in the impending two-nuclear-peer threat environment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Opportunistic aggression could create unique challenges for U.S. nuclear forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Current planning for opportunistic aggression scenarios is insufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is insufficient awareness of how threats in one theater might affect U.S. allies’ security interests in a separate theater and the ability of the United States to meet its extended deterrence obligations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is not clear whether the necessary processes and structures are in place to make difficult and informed prioritization decisions across the nuclear enterprise and broader defense industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address these challenges, the task force recommends the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Policymakers and senior leaders should review intelligence priorities to ensure adequate intelligence collection and assessment on what factors might influence the likelihood a leader will initiate aggression if the United States is already involved in a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Congress should work with the administration to establish a statutory Nuclear Policy Council to serve as a bridge between operational and acquisition-focused decisions and broader National Security Council–led interagency deliberations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Department of Defense (DOD) should prioritize war games, tabletop exercises (TTXs), and scenario-based discussions that focus on opportunistic aggression scenarios and facilitate interagency, allied, and outside expert participation, where possible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Departments of State and Defense should develop an engagement plan for allies to empower more detailed and transparent conversations on opportunistic aggression scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The executive branch and Congress should address critical conventional shortfalls and work with allies to devise complementary investment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Departments and agencies should prioritize nuclear deterrence education for senior leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DOD and National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) should diversify U.S. nuclear forces to ensure the president has a full range of options if deterrence fails in one or more theaters.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Policymakers should accept calculated risks and ensure the necessary processes and structures are in place to make difficult prioritization decisions. They should also allow the advanced development communities within DOD laboratories and NNSA national laboratories to experiment more aggressively.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;defining-the-problem&quot;&gt;Defining the Problem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;force-planning-and-the-challenges-of-a-two-front-war&quot;&gt;Force Planning and the Challenges of a Two-Front War&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time in its history, the United States must contend with not one but two major power rivals with nuclear weapons. As policymakers grapple with how to manage this two-near-peer or tripolar deterrence challenge, a key question is how the United States should approach the prospect of opportunistic aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the 2022 Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) points out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Opportunistic aggression could create deterrence challenges. Should we find ourselves in a large-scale military confrontation with a major power or regional adversary, the Joint Force will need to be postured with military capabilities — including nuclear weapons — that can deter and defeat other actors who may seek to take advantage of this scenario to engage in opportunistic aggression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address these challenges, the NPR and National Defense Strategy (NDS) outline a broad force planning construct:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To deter opportunistic aggression elsewhere, while the United States is involved in an all-domain conflict, the Department will employ a range of risk mitigation efforts rooted in integrated deterrence. These include coordination with and contributions of Allies and partners, deterrent effects of U.S. nuclear posture, and leveraging posture and capabilities not solely engaged in the primary warfight — for example, cyber and space. Additionally, the Joint Force will be shaped to ensure the ability to respond to small-scale, short-duration crises without substantially impairing high-end warfighting readiness, and to conduct campaigning activities that improve our position and reinforce deterrence while limiting or disrupting competitor activities that seriously affect U.S. interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there is little evidence the United States is prepared for such scenarios. Due to policy and strategy decisions made years ago in very different security environments, today’s Joint Force is not sized or shaped to address two simultaneous or sequential high-end conflicts borne out of opportunistic aggression scenarios. In addition, the United States already struggles to fully integrate with allies when preparing for a single crisis or conflict, let alone work through the implications for U.S. allies if large elements of U.S. conventional forces are tied up in a separate theater and the United States is forced to rely more heavily on its nuclear forces and allies to confront a second aggressor. Addressing these challenges requires policymakers to first understand what risks they are accepting today and in the future as a result of strategy and force structure decisions made years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The notion that the United States needs to be prepared to prosecute two simultaneous conflicts is not a novel concept. After the Cold War, the United States could fight regional wars in places like Iraq and Afghanistan while maintaining sufficient capabilities to deter military adventurism by other adversaries. In fact, multiple presidential administrations reaffirmed that the United States must be able to prevail in two simultaneous (or near simultaneous) conflicts, including President George H. W. Bush in his Base Force concept and President Barack Obama in his defense strategy. But a decade ago, experts and officials often discussed two-war force sizing in the context of two simultaneous medium-sized or regional conflicts. In 2014, then secretary of defense Chuck Hagel asserted that U.S. forces, provided they were funded at the levels called for by the administration’s pending budget request, would be “capable of simultaneously defending the homeland; conducting sustained, distributed counterterrorist operations; and in multiple regions, deterring aggression and assuring allies through forward presence and engagement.” He went on to state that if deterrence should fail, “U.S. forces could defeat a regional adversary in a large-scale multi-phased campaign and deny the objectives of — or impose unacceptable costs on — another aggressor in another region.” Soon, however, the growing threat from China changed this thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2018, the NDS adopted what was functionally a one-war force-sizing construct and recommended only modest increases in force capacity. This approach recognized the reality of what it would take to execute a high-end war against a large nuclear-armed adversary such as China or Russia but arguably created operational and strategic vulnerabilities. As noted by the 2018 NDS Commission,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Department has largely abandoned the longstanding “two-war” construct for a “one major war” sizing and shaping construct. In the event of a large-scale conflict with Russia or China, the United States may not have sufficient remaining resources to deter other adversaries in one — let alone two — other theaters by denying them the ability to accomplish their objectives without relying on nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This warning largely went unnoticed, however, in part because it seemed unlikely the United States would be forced to confront simultaneous conflicts. Moreover, the United States intended to rely on its allies’ growing conventional capabilities and increased burden sharing to offset some of the risks a two-theater or two-front war might entail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as this report details, the changing geopolitical environment, the presence of two powerful nuclear-armed adversaries, the growing threat from states like North Korea, and the increased cooperation among those states means that it may be infeasible to conventionally deter one adversary while committing sufficient conventional capabilities to fight and win against the other — let alone fight and win against both simultaneously. This has significant implications for U.S. nuclear forces as well as for U.S. extended deterrence guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Addressing major-power opportunistic aggression in a second theater requires understanding what a large-scale conventional conflict (or conflicts) might involve and how such a conflict would constrain U.S. ability to flow forces and support logistics into a second theater or area of operations if a second adversary initiated aggression on a separate front. It also likely requires some combination of greater optimization of U.S. and allied conventional force structures, increased allied force contributions, improved industrial base efforts to reconstitute critical conventional capability deficiencies as well as the nuclear enterprise, and improved U.S. theater nuclear capabilities and integration. Deconflicting and prioritizing these efforts will be essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;opportunistic-aggression-in-the-current-strategic-environment&quot;&gt;Opportunistic Aggression in the Current Strategic Environment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next decade may be among the most strategically challenging in U.S. history. Facing the prospect of two near-peer competitors for the first time in the nuclear era, the United States continues to maintain significant global commitments. These include managing a complex network of alliances, including promises to protect these allies against aggression and potentially use U.S. nuclear weapons to defend them. While the Joint Force remains the most capable conventional military organization on the planet, this complex strategic picture entails myriad contingencies that could require the United States to commit or expend some or nearly all of its nonnuclear capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the United States were to commit a significant portion of its conventional forces to a war, it would necessarily reduce the strength of its conventional deterrent against other adversaries, who might take advantage of perceived U.S. weakness or distraction. For instance, a series of 24 war games conducted by CSIS indicated that the United States would likely flow a significant portion of its forces to the Pacific in the event of a conflict with China over Taiwan. And even if the United States, Taiwan, and Japan were successful in repelling a Chinese invasion, the United States would likely still lose “dozens of ships, hundreds of aircraft, and tens of thousands of servicemembers.” The United States would also likely run out of long-range precision-guided munitions in less than one week during a Taiwan contingency. Amid such hostilities, the ability to respond to aggression in another theater — by Russia, for instance — could be sharply curtailed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;If the United States were to commit a significant portion of its conventional forces to a war, it would necessarily reduce the strength of its conventional deterrent against other adversaries, who might take advantage of perceived U.S. weakness or distraction.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stockpile shortages resulting from U.S. support for Ukraine have amplified concerns about the state of the U.S. industrial base. These forecasted and current shortages raise serious questions about the speed with which the U.S. defense industry can replenish depleted stockpiles, what stocks would be available to respond to a crisis or conflict in a second theater, and the ability of the United States to provide allies with indirect aid while fighting a major war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While opportunistic aggression is not a new concern — both the 2018 and 2022 NDSs identify deterring opportunistic aggression as a priority for the Joint Force — the question remains: How can the United States deter other adversaries from striking when it is already committed to a conflict, and what implications might this have for U.S. nuclear forces if deterrence fails?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two-nuclear-peer problem and the increasing partnership between China and Russia (as well as North Korea) compounds the risk of opportunistic aggression. Not only is conventional deterrence increasingly challenged, but changes in how nuclear-armed adversaries are integrating nuclear coercion and potential use into their theories of victory present unique operational dilemmas for the United States and its allies. Russia’s growing reliance on nuclear weapons amid its conventional losses in the war in Ukraine, China’s unprecedented expansion and diversification of its nuclear forces, and the continued risk of North Korean nuclear use all pose unique deterrence challenges. But the United States cannot deal with these threats in isolation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recently released report of the Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States took note of this problem in its findings: “The new partnership between Russian and Chinese leaders poses qualitatively new threats of potential opportunistic aggression and/or the risk of future cooperative two-theater aggression.” Indeed, cooperation on military matters between China and Russia — as well as North Korea — has expanded significantly in recent years, particularly since Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Even if these adversaries do not formalize their alignment through treaties or deliberately coordinate aggression against the United States, their growing ties complicate U.S. defense planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one of the most overt signs of growing cooperation, Russia and the People’s Republic of China (PRC) have significantly expanded their joint military activities. Since 2018, the PRC has regularly sent forces to participate in Russia’s annual district-level exercises, which focus on high-intensity conventional war fighting, often against fictional opponents that resemble the United States and its allies. Russia and the PRC have also expanded cooperation between their air forces: the Russian and People’s Liberation Army (PLA) air forces conducted their first joint bomber patrol in 2019 and have since continued these patrols, often flying through Korean and Japanese air-defense identification zones. The Russian and PRC navies have engaged in joint exercises since 2012, including an exercise in the Baltic Sea in 2017 and, most recently, an exercise in the Sea of Japan in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond military exercises, Russia and the PRC are reportedly increasing ties between their nuclear industries and programs. In early 2023, Western media reported that Rosatom — Russia’s state-run nuclear energy corporation — was supplying the PRC with thousands of kilograms of highly enriched uranium to fuel fast breeder reactors. U.S. officials believe these reactors will produce weapons-grade plutonium for the PRC’s nuclear weapons program. Although the precise motivations for this cooperation are unclear, the deal is a further sign of growing military cooperation between the two countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has also strengthened its ties with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Russian and DPRK officials have made visits to Pyongyang and Moscow, and the Kremlin has reportedly purchased millions of artillery shells and rockets from the DPRK to support its war effort in Ukraine. The DPRK has also provided Russia with ballistic missiles for use in Ukraine. In return, Russia is assisting the DPRK’s efforts to develop and launch military satellites, though the precise nature and impact of this assistance is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many ways these growing ties could complicate and stress U.S. planning. When detailing plausible conflict scenarios associated with the two-near-peer problem, a study group through the Center for Global Security Research (CGSR) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory highlighted that an adversary taking advantage of U.S. engagement in one theater (via crisis or war) may instigate opportunistic aggression in a second region or even pose a joint aggression threat. The report notes multiple possible permutations of opportunistic aggression, with dynamics likely to be context specific. Conflicts could result from inadvertent or coincidental actions, or via actions undertaken by one of the two parties involved in the first conflict. In other words, opportunistic aggression will not play out in predictable or identical pathways but, rather, could be sequential, uncoordinated, coordinated, or even the result of an alliance between the two aggressors. Notably, an adversary may act as though it is preparing to initiate a crisis or conflict, even if it does not intend to do so, merely to complicate U.S. force planning and draw U.S. forces away from a surprise attack by the other adversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States must be prepared for such scenarios. As the recent Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States makes clear:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The objectives of U.S. strategy must include effective deterrence and defeat of simultaneous Russian and Chinese aggression in Europe and Asia using conventional forces. If the United States and its Allies and partners do not field sufficient conventional forces to achieve this objective, U.S. strategy would need to be altered to increase reliance on nuclear weapons to deter or counter opportunistic aggression in the other theater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the prospect of a two-front war against Russia and China is a worst-case scenario for opportunistic aggression, it is not the only concerning scenario. Other regional actors such as North Korea or Iran could prove difficult to deter if the United States were to find itself fighting either of its peer competitors. Conversely, if the United States found itself in a war against a minor power, even a limited conflict could impose significant resource constraints on the Joint Force that might create windows of opportunity for a peer competitor state. As a recent Atlantic Council study concluded:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;US thinking about war in East Asia often neglects the possibility that the United States would have to fight the PRC and North Korea simultaneously rather than separately. Furthermore, conventional wisdom in the United States underestimates the risk that either the PRC or North Korea would resort to a limited nuclear strike in the event of a conflict in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Addressing these issues requires a more detailed understanding of how U.S. and allied resources might be constrained in various opportunistic aggression scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;resource-challenges-and-opportunistic-aggression&quot;&gt;Resource Challenges and Opportunistic Aggression&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenges that opportunistic aggression presents are myriad. However, certain configurations of adversaries are more likely to present challenges than others. Whether the first or second adversary is a nuclear peer matters for whether the United States must conserve or reallocate resources and how much it might be forced to rely on nuclear weapons in its strategy. While U.S. conventional capabilities are likely sufficient to deter most adversaries in peacetime, the prospect of opportunistic aggression is a reminder that the U.S. conventional deterrent might be significantly degraded by even a brief high-intensity conflict. This creates four primary challenges: resource conservation, resource distribution, reduced response capability, and insufficient resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resource conservation challenge:&lt;/strong&gt; First, in the event of a war with a non-peer state, the United States would face a resource conservation challenge. For example, the Joint Force might be called upon to reserve a significant portion of critical resources (e.g., Long Range Anti-Ship Missiles [LRASMs]) to preserve the conventional deterrent against a Chinese amphibious invasion of Taiwan. Committing (and consuming) high-end or low-density conventional capabilities would diminish U.S. capacity to respond to additional threats. While the NDS appears to acknowledge this dynamic, in practice, combatant commanders will almost certainly push for any and all resources to respond to extant crises, which makes a decision to conserve or withhold certain assets both politically and operationally challenging. Failure to make such a decision, however, could leave the United States with fewer nonnuclear capabilities to deter or respond to aggression on a second front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resource distribution challenge:&lt;/strong&gt; If a second non-peer adversary took advantage of a perceived weakness to engage in opportunistic aggression, the challenge would deepen. In addition to the resource conservation challenge, the United States would face a resource distribution challenge. Capabilities would need to be diverted to the new conflict while maintaining an effective deterrent against adventurism by other actors, especially peer competitors. This might require the United States to adopt riskier strategies to end the non-peer conflicts quickly, accept suboptimal conflict outcomes, rely more heavily on allies, or, if subsequent aggressors are nuclear-armed states, rely more on nuclear weapons to deter further opportunistic aggression. Such a scenario could also force the United States to revisit its policy regarding the employment of nuclear threats or operations against Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT)–compliant states to provide more flexibility as threats evolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1gs0V0g.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1. Resource Challenges and Opportunistic Aggression&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced response capability challenge:&lt;/strong&gt; By contrast, if the initial adversary were a nuclear peer (i.e., Russia or China), opportunistic aggression would pose a different set of challenges. The United States could not afford to reserve significant capabilities in a high-intensity conventional conflict against a peer and would therefore face a reduced response capability challenge in the event of opportunistic aggression by a non-peer adversary. The United States might be limited in its ability to fulfill commitments to allies or might be forced to adopt a more hands-off strategy against the new aggressor to help hold the line, perhaps following the model of current U.S. support for Ukraine. With its conventional forces committed to fighting one peer competitor, the United States may need to lean heavily on its nuclear arsenal to deter the other from entering the fray or taking independent action against U.S. or allied interests. It may also be forced to rely more heavily on allied capabilities and will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insufficient resources challenge:&lt;/strong&gt; Finally, if both the initial adversary and the opportunistic aggressor are nuclear peers, the United States would confront an insufficient resources challenge. Lacking the conventional capabilities to fight and win against two near-peer adversaries simultaneously, the United States would either need to back down (in either or both conflicts) or face the prospect of fighting a conventionally superior adversary in one or both theaters, depending on resource allocation. This strategy would likely require the greatest reliance on nuclear weapons and result in the greatest likelihood of U.S. first use, as the United States might need to employ tactical nuclear weapons to offset conventional weaknesses. Table 1 outlines the four configurations of adversary types and the associated challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the peer/non-peer status of the initial and opportunistic aggressors helps inform the nature of the challenge, the task force recognizes that opportunistic aggression may take many forms. Although the authors limit the definition of opportunistic aggression to military action against the United States or its allies, different types of attacks, depending on their nature and target, would require different and proportionate responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scope and scale of a U.S. response to opportunistic aggression would also be informed by the nature of the conflict. In accordance with the threat posed to U.S. interests and in keeping with the law of proportionality, the United States is unlikely to respond to a minor conventional incursion with a nuclear strike. Similarly, it is unlikely to defer a response to a case of nuclear use against an ally, even if the United States is already embroiled in a peer conflict. While this report primarily focuses on conventional crises that have the potential to escalate to nuclear use, the task force notes that it is possible a crisis might start with nuclear use — for example, a North Korean nuclear attack on a U.S. ally intended to swiftly achieve capitulation, or even a Chinese or Russian demonstration strike to show resolve and deter U.S. intervention. Such crises would put even greater demands on U.S. conventional and nuclear capabilities in order to successfully restore deterrence and manage (de)escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;factors-that-influence-opportunistic-aggression&quot;&gt;Factors That Influence Opportunistic Aggression&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The task force identified four key factors in determining the likelihood a state will opportunistically initiate an aggressive action while the United States is involved in a first conflict. These factors are capability, will, alliance strength, and signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capability.&lt;/strong&gt; An adversary who believes that U.S. capabilities have been so compromised by an initial conflict that the United States could not meaningfully respond to new aggression will demand more, be less willing to compromise, and be more likely to resort to force if its demands are not met. The timing and scale of the initial conflict will determine the extent of this problem. Adversaries are very likely to scale the aggressiveness of their actions based on the severity and visibility of U.S. losses. However, an adversary may be emboldened even if the Joint Force is seeing success on the battlefield if that success has exhausted high-end limited resources like precision-guided munitions or long-range fires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will.&lt;/strong&gt; Similarly, an adversary who believes the United States lacks the will to risk involvement in a secondary conflict may be emboldened to act. The appearance of war weariness in an administration or the U.S. public would send a message that the United States would rather concede than engage in additional conflict. Adversaries would also take cues from the length of the initial conflict, as wars that stalemate and drag on for years are more likely to lose public support over time. Widespread antiwar activism or a rise in populist ideas of isolationism could also signal a waning interest in continued or expanded fighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alliance strength.&lt;/strong&gt; Opportunistic aggression may not be targeted at the U.S. homeland. Aggressors may view a distracted United States as an opportunity to attack a U.S. ally with potentially fewer repercussions than during peacetime. This factor is exacerbated if U.S. alliance commitments appear to wane as a result of the initial conflict. This might take the form of public statements by the U.S. administration questioning the strength, necessity, or fairness of an alliance, but even the reallocation of resources could send the message, perhaps unintentionally, that the United States has deemphasized an alliance. For example, if the United States pulled capabilities from South Korea to respond to a Taiwan contingency, North Korea might perceive both a weakening of U.S. capabilities on the peninsula and, if done against the protest of the South Korean government, a weakening of the U.S.–Republic of Korea alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Signaling.&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to the message sent by changes in capabilities, will, and alliance strength, changes in or failures of U.S. signaling might encourage or discourage opportunistic aggression. How Washington handles strategic communications and signaling geared toward other potential aggressors could be critical in shaping perceptions of whether the United States is vulnerable to an attack on a second front. The ability to effectively communicate consequences and distinguish escalation control signals aimed at one adversary from deterrence signals aimed at a second adversary could also shape an adversary’s perceptions of whether the United States is likely to respond in a second theater or on a second front. Escalation dynamics and signals could therefore have a significant impact on an adversary’s thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;when-deterring-opportunistic-aggression-fails&quot;&gt;When Deterring Opportunistic Aggression Fails&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the challenges of responding to opportunistic aggression, the United States should aim to deter adversaries from opening a second front whenever possible. Maintaining a high level of conventional and nuclear readiness, demonstrating the will to fight, showing strong commitment to allies, and engaging in unambiguous messaging should all contribute to effective deterrence. Should deterrence fail, however, the United States may face the difficult prospect of trying to manage escalation and keep a conventional conflict conventional in one theater while simultaneously relying on the threat (or even employment) of nuclear weapons in a second theater. If, in such a scenario, the United States were forced to employ nuclear weapons — for example, if the United States has just used tactical nuclear weapons to stop a Chinese invasion of Taiwan or respond to a crisis on the Korean peninsula — it would be extraordinarily difficult to argue that Russia should not use tactical nuclear weapons in the face of conventional defeat. The challenge of concurrently managing intra- and inter-conflict deterrence is therefore both understudied and undertheorized but increasingly relevant in a two-near-peer world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The challenge of concurrently managing intra- and inter-conflict deterrence is therefore both understudied and undertheorized but increasingly relevant in a two-near-peer world.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;findings-and-conclusions&quot;&gt;Findings and Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The task force identified five broad findings over the course of its deliberations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;policy-findings&quot;&gt;Policy Findings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Policymakers appear unaware of the risks that they are accepting in regard to opportunistic aggression and the demands that certain scenarios could place on U.S. nuclear forces in the impending two-nuclear-peer threat environment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming current spending rates and force constructs remain relatively constant, policymakers will be accepting future risks, whether or not those risks are identified and understood. As a result, in the event of future opportunistic aggression, it is unlikely policymakers will have the number of options they assume will be available to them. Significant changes or decisions related to conventional force generation can take years to implement and, once operational, often reflect a security environment from prior years. As such, if U.S. policymakers and decisionmakers do not take action now, they may be forced to rely on nuclear weapons to compensate for shortfalls in conventional capabilities in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The threat of opportunistic aggression may challenge the current U.S. policy of “reducing reliance on nuclear weapons.” In fact, if changes are not made, the current force posture and structure may well require the United States to rely more on nuclear weapons in a second theater or on a second front in the event of a future opportunistic aggression scenario. This threat demands policymakers to address the disconnect between extant policy and current capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;capability-findings&quot;&gt;Capability Findings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Opportunistic aggression could create unique challenges for U.S. nuclear forces.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussed, if the United States and its allies are engaged in a major conventional conflict with a nuclear-armed adversary, the United States may be forced to rely more on nuclear weapons to deter and potentially respond to aggression in a second theater or on a second front. If an adversary perceives a benefit to threatening nuclear escalation in one or both conflicts, it will present even greater challenges for the current U.S. nuclear force posture. Thus, while current capabilities may provide sufficient deterrence in the near term, the current nuclear force structure is insufficient, given current U.S. nuclear strategy, to respond to conflicts with two near peers or in two theaters simultaneously if deterrence fails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, the current mix of U.S. nuclear capabilities is insufficient in its versatility to proactively deter and retroactively respond to opportunistic aggression in a second theater or second area of operations. The nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missile (SLCM-N) program will help fill certain gaps in nuclear capabilities that are not easily met through any other current or developing option. However, the development and fielding timelines within the nuclear enterprise today do not support closing that gap within the next 10 years. This leaves a significant challenge in the Indo-Pacific theater, where regional nuclear capabilities could play an outsize role in an opportunistic aggression scenario, especially in terms of deterring Chinese or North Korean coercion or escalation. Responding to opportunistic aggression in the Indo-Pacific region after a conflict has already broken out elsewhere — that is, dealing with a second crisis or conflict — would further exacerbate this gap given the lack of forward-deployed nuclear assets in the region and the demand that would already be placed on certain capabilities given the initial conflict. Introducing greater diversity and versatility in modernized nuclear systems, as well as additional options for the extant U.S. stockpile, would provide more credible response options for dealing with acts of opportunistic aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;planning-findings&quot;&gt;Planning Findings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Current planning for opportunistic aggression scenarios may be insufficient.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combatant commanders must prepare for various opportunistic aggression contingencies, including scenarios that require them to coordinate forces and plans (including deterrence strategies and operations) in new and different ways across multiple geographic combatant commands, including United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM). This requires a comprehensive understanding of the forces available — conventional, nonnuclear, and nuclear, including nuclear support assets — and a better process for testing plans and assumptions if the assumed or preferred level of forces is not available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this type of planning is limited given the current planning approach. Despite the focus the 2022 NPR places on integrated deterrence, nuclear planning is often segregated rather than integrated within the DOD. Because nuclear plans are segregated by a combatant command (CCMD), geographic combatant commanders plan and execute conventional operations, while nuclear planning is largely relegated to USSTRATCOM. This separation stems from force design: most combatant commands do not have the necessary skill sets and personnel to conduct nuclear planning. Those skill sets mostly reside in USSTRATCOM, though there are some positive changes in United States Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) — for instance, as the Air Force attempts to bolster its deterrence posture for strategic competition with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More detailed and realistic planning is also hindered by the reticence of the DOD — and the U.S. government as a whole — to talk about nuclear planning and operations. Policymakers may need to “think the unthinkable” when it comes to opportunistic aggression, especially for scenarios involving possible low-yield nuclear use. Geographic combatant commanders (GCCs) need to prepare for the possibility that low-yield nuclear use in one theater or situation would affect force flows and decisionmaking in another theater, especially as it pertains to deterrence operations with nuclear forces. Would more or different nuclear assets be needed in one region to maintain deterrence or reestablish it? How might nuclear use change force flows and operations for the conventional side in either theater? Reluctance to work through these difficult issues ahead of time stifles planning and could encourage adversaries to exploit perceived gaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;extended-deterrence-and-alliance-management-findings&quot;&gt;Extended Deterrence and Alliance Management Findings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. There is insufficient awareness of how threats in one theater might affect the security interests of U.S. allies in a separate theater and the ability of the United States to meet its extended deterrence obligations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most U.S. allies are understandably focused on potential crises and conflicts on their territory or in their own backyard. Although the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) began to consider the impact of China’s rise on the security of the alliance in 2022, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine derailed many of these discussions. The United States must lead difficult — but critical — conversations with allies regarding the threat of opportunistic aggression to better prepare for such contingencies. While existing dialogues and formats could enable such conversations, current forums are insufficient or lack the candor needed. Opportunistic aggression will likely require the United States to rely more heavily on allies to respond simultaneously in two theaters. In advance of such an extreme circumstance and in a precrisis setting, the United States can work with allies and partners now to define requirements while balancing assurance concerns. There will be different implications and asks for each ally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The United States must lead difficult — but critical — conversations with allies regarding the threat of opportunistic aggression to better prepare for such contingencies.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, if large elements of U.S. forces are tied up in the Indo-Pacific theater and the United States is forced to flow certain assets out of the European theater, NATO allies need to understand the potential implications. Likewise, the United Kingdom and France, in particular, may need to be prepared to respond to queries about whether there are specific, credible actions they could take to reinforce the alliance’s nuclear posture and readiness in the absence of a more visible presence of U.S. assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. It is not clear the necessary processes and structures are in place to make difficult — and informed — prioritization decisions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prioritization of the nation’s resources to account for the possibility of opportunistic aggression is needed. Not addressing U.S. force posture to accommodate the most likely opportunistic aggression scenarios could make such scenarios more likely due to an adversary perceiving a weakness in U.S. military strength. The U.S. defense industrial base — both in terms of its production capacity and workforce — likely cannot quickly accommodate major changes in U.S. military force posture to account for the risk of opportunistic aggression. The U.S. military’s budget is stretched in many ways, and significant adjustments have proved difficult in the past and will likely be difficult in the future. These challenges point to the need for prioritization when considering how to mobilize the defense industrial base to address this problem. But it is not clear the necessary processes and decisionmaking structures are in place across services and departments for making informed resourcing decisions — not just for the nuclear enterprise but also across the broader defense industrial base. Congress and the executive branch need to address this gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Review intelligence priorities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding when a leader might choose to initiate aggression or use nuclear weapons — and what specifically might deter them from doing so — is already one of the most difficult intelligence priorities. Assessing how a leader’s calculations might shift if the United States and its allies were already engaged in a conflict elsewhere complicates this matter significantly. Policymakers should review current intelligence priorities to ensure the intelligence community is also considering what factors might influence the likelihood a state will opportunistically initiate aggression while the United States is already involved in a conflict. Improving collection on and assessment of these dynamics not only will allow the United States and its allies to better anticipate when opportunistic aggression might occur but will also provide a critical baseline for better tailoring deterrence strategies and understanding how those strategies might interact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Establish a Nuclear Policy Council.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The task force recommends creating a senior interagency group with statutory authorities to more consistently and over longer periods review deterrence policy and ensure planning is congruent with nuclear policymaking in a dynamic threat environment. This group would serve as the interagency policy counterpart to the existing DOD-NNSA Nuclear Weapons Council (NWC), which oversees the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile management process and ensures alignment between DOD delivery systems and NNSA warheads. The new group would serve as a bridge between the NWC and higher-level National Security Council–led policy discussions. Among the many benefits of such a standing group, continuity is the most crucial advantage. Rather than wait for the NPR process to take place every several years, a policy-focused council would ensure ongoing long-term analysis without undercutting an administration’s ability to conduct independent reviews at its discretion. The council could also more closely track operational considerations and how policy translates to planning, resourcing, and programming decisions, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Prioritize war games, TTXs, and scenario-based discussions that focus on opportunistic aggression.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the DOD conducts numerous war games each year, the vast majority of them are limited to conventional operations. To further complicate the issue, the DOD does not maintain an annual war game in which an adversary employs limited nuclear weapons or in which a second adversary launches an attack during an existing regional conflict. Limited nuclear use and opportunistic aggression scenarios are often addressed only in localized exploratory TTXs, resulting in shortfalls across the DOD in understanding theater-level strategy and escalation management approaches for scenarios in which an adversary uses limited nuclear attacks or U.S. forces must also contend with opportunistic aggression from a nuclear adversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;War games and TTXs that focus on a range of opportunistic aggression scenarios could help senior leaders, combatant commands, and planners understand challenges and resource constraints, as well as force management limitations. However, these cannot just be games led and attended by USSTRATCOM; interagency and senior administration officials outside of the DOD should also be included. This can help senior leaders feel more comfortable making decisions in resource- constrained environments and better understand the trade-offs and potential opportunity costs of certain capability investments. Running through scenarios with allies and diversifying the participant base can also improve understanding of the potential constraints. Unclassified games outside of official channels can also help increase the overall understanding of these challenges and provide a platform for engaging key allies on these issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Develop an engagement plan for allies to empower more detailed and transparent conversations on opportunistic aggression.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States needs to develop an engagement plan for deepening planning and consultations with allies on opportunistic aggression scenarios. Opportunistic aggression scenarios need to be on the agenda with allies in existing dialogue structures. These could be added as an agenda item or incorporated into scenario-based discussions or TTXs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open and honest conversations with allies could improve understanding of what might be asked of them in certain scenarios. To do this effectively, the United States must take the lead on normalizing theoretical conversations with allies while managing perceptions of assurances. Hypothetical conversations will enable allies to better understand the threat environment, limitations on U.S. capabilities, and the kind of burden sharing that will be expected or necessary. This discussion could occur via existing mechanisms and channels, or it could be a wider effort that the DOD and the State Department co-lead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Prioritize nuclear deterrence education for senior leadership.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD does not sufficiently educate Joint Force leaders on nuclear issues. This gap in knowledge stems from a lack of standardization and mandatory instruction on nuclear issues across professional military education (PME). Many Joint Force officers receive little to no exposure to nuclear issues, including effects, policy, deterrence theory, escalation management, and opportunistic aggression, unless taken as an elective. In fact, when a leader becomes a senior flag officer, it may be the first time they are exposed to nuclear planning and operational concepts. This needs to change. Officers need exposure to these issues much earlier in their careers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policymakers and planners also need deeper expertise on both nuclear issues and planning for conventional conflicts. In the diplomatic realm, policymakers leading consultations and conversations with allies often lack detailed understanding of nuclear (and conventional) planning and operational concepts, making it difficult to have frank conversations about what might be needed, by whom, and when. Further, senior leaders and political appointees need better exposure to how integrated planning, including nuclear planning, is undertaken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Diversify U.S. nuclear forces.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. policymakers should strive to diversify U.S. nuclear forces through investments in new capabilities, possibly in smaller numbers. This would provide the president with a broader range of credible options, particularly if an adversary threatens limited nuclear attacks. Strategic deterrence is, and should remain, the primary mission of the U.S. nuclear force, and the triad is essential to the success of that mission. Nonetheless, nuclear capabilities with the following attributes will likely contribute significantly to U.S. ability to deter opportunistic aggression prior to it occurring in a second theater, or aid in restoring deterrence should it fail or if limited nuclear use occurs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;survivability (ability to penetrate enemy air defenses and maneuver)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;persistent presence&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;lower yield&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;responsive and effective across a spectrum of targets&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These capabilities should also serve certain objectives, such as the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;regional assurance&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;operational flexibility&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;deterrence (both prior to conflict and within it)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The task force concludes that sea-launched weapons with these attributes are likely the best option to meet the opportunistic aggression threat posed by China in the Indo-Pacific and may also serve other roles in a European theater depending on the circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Address critical conventional shortfalls.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The risk of opportunistic aggression is increased by conventional shortfalls in key capabilities, including long-range fires, precision-guided munitions, and heavy airlift and refueling. While current stockpiles may be sufficient to achieve victory in a single brief war, the war in Ukraine demonstrates the difficult task of replacing expended munitions and destroyed platforms in sustained high-intensity conflict. The United States and its allies must acquire enough of these key capabilities to fight and win one war while maintaining a sufficient conventional deterrent to prevent a second. To do so, officials should solidify a clear division of labor and investment strategies with allies. Building the defense industrial base and workforce capacity both in the United States and within allied nations to support shifting force structure plans will be key. The United States must rely on allied nations to fill the conventional weapons gaps they are capable of filling, such as lower-end munitions to support the war in Ukraine. That is not to say that allied nations should always have the role of low-end munitions production. But this is a near-term ask, and division of labor can help fill key gaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Accept calculated risks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A viable strategy for addressing the four resource challenges posed by opportunistic aggression, previously described in this report, is not to simply build more but to build different. The key decision here is determining how the United States is committing itself to engage in a simultaneous two-conflict scenario and where it is willing to accept risk. U.S. nuclear modernization efforts are largely focused on one-for-one replacement programs, which will put new versions of extant weapons in the triad into service. The main lines of effort of the nuclear modernization program should continue as planned, but the authors advocate for increasing diversity in the modernized triad, in terms of both of baseline and regional deterrence capabilities. This may drive hard decisions to reprioritize some modernization programs that offer the same deterrent benefit as the weapons they are replacing. The United States should be willing to accept calculated risks in limited circumstances to free up resources for the development and fielding of systems that offer greater nuclear force diversity. This requires improved processes and structures to make difficult — and informed — prioritization decisions across both the nuclear enterprise and the broader defense industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policymakers should also shift their cultural mindsets and become more risk tolerant — from both a technological perspective and a political perspective — and allow the advanced development communities at DOD laboratories and NNSA national laboratories to experiment more aggressively. This means lowering the barrier to starting and canceling new weapons programs. The national laboratories should be encouraged to experiment and explore various options for the U.S. nuclear stockpile, even when those experiments do not lead to an established weapon in the stockpile every time. Given the trajectory of the global security environment, new technologies could provide policymakers with more flexible options to meet U.S. national objectives — if U.S. scientific and technical communities are permitted to do so. Policymakers should be willing to accept calculated risks to expand opportunities, including the risk of capability failure. The ability to more easily start and cancel programs and embrace truly flexible acquisition strategies would allow U.S. nuclear posture to better adjust to military needs and be more responsive to both positive and negative changes in the security environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late March 2024, the Centre for Finance and Security (CFS) at RUSI, with the support of Copenhagen-based policy centre Think Tank EUROPA, hosted a roundtable in Copenhagen. The roundtable, along with a series of one-on-one meetings, discussed the state of sanctions implementation and enforcement in Denmark. None of the discussions in the event are attributable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gatherings included representatives from national authorities with sanctions-related competences, as well as sanctions and compliance experts from financial institutions and Danish industrial groups, compliance experts from leading law firms, representatives from the industry group Danish Shipping, and other advisers. These included, among others, representatives from the Danish Ministry of Industry, Business and Financial Affairs; the Danish Customs Agency (DCA); the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark (MFA); the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority; the National Special Crime Unit; and other relevant agencies. This event is part of the in-country engagements conducted by the CFS-led European Sanctions and the Illicit Finance Monitoring and Analysis Network (SIFMANet), supported by the National Endowment for Democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;denmarks-decentralised-sanctions-implementation&quot;&gt;Denmark’s Decentralised Sanctions Implementation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roundtable began with a discussion of the division of authority and responsibility for sanctions in Denmark, and the significant adaptations required since 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conversation considered Denmark’s preparedness for the Russia sanctions following the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) fourth round of mutual evaluations, the scope of which included implementation of targeted financial sanctions. Denmark’s mutual evaluation report was concluded in 2017 and its subsequent follow-up process ended in 2021, which a government representative at the roundtable said had helped the country to prepare for expanded sanctions. They noted that Denmark was evaluated as “partially compliant” for Recommendation 7 related to targeted financial sanctions for proliferation financing, but was upgraded to “largely compliant” in the follow-up report in 2021. Addressing these gaps had, a representative said, helped the country’s preparations, but it had not been possible to prepare fully for the sanctioning of a country with which the EU as a whole had such significant economic ties, compared to jurisdictions that are subject to sanctions regimes covered by the FATF Standards and have been for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Denmark has more than 25 authorities with some role in or oversight of sanctions responsibility – relatively higher than other member states where SIFMANet has held similar roundtables. The MFA is the authority with overall responsibility for coordinating the sanctions policy of the Danish government. Since 2022, the Danish “EU-Special Committee on Sanctions” and taskforces have expanded to include additional government bodies, ranging from utilities to cultural ministries. Government representatives highlighted the enhanced coordination that had been put into practice in Denmark. Steps included the establishment of a central sanctions coordinator team, vested in a newly established economic security unit in the MFA, and new intra-governmental procedures, as well as a governmental taskforce to counter circumvention, with participation from relevant national Danish authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although government representatives said that this coordination between a wider group had improved effectiveness, dividing responsibility for implementation and guidance across numerous national competent authorities may also increase the risk of fragmentation in approach. This was underscored by comments from private sector participants, who said that there had been “inter-agency problems on who’s responsible for what”. One participant said that some questions had “circled for some time” as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lacking-national-guidance-on-eu-regulations&quot;&gt;Lacking National Guidance on EU Regulations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One source of frustration expressed by private sector participants at the roundtable was the Danish government’s reluctance to interpret European law and regulations or provide answers to specific questions, given that the debate had taken place in Brussels. One participant said that while interpretation of Danish law would take into account written remarks about the law, no such written remarks are provided for EU law and, they said, “we can only look at what the law says”. This representative also said the Danish government’s role was to provide guidance, “not counselling”. Other government representatives said they had provided as much guidance as possible, but that the scale of requests had been unprecedented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private sector participants were frustrated with this position. They agreed that they found the EU FAQs helpful, but insisted these should be expanded further. While they appreciated the guidance that had been shared by the Danish government, they said it was both too limited and too slow. One representative of a Danish maritime industry group said that they had sent 75 to 100 requests to Danish authorities and had not yet received a clear response. Another participant, from a law firm, said the process was time-consuming and that it “can be difficult to get answers”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to this, some participants said that, over time, they had stopped seeking formal clarification on the sanctions, because of concerns about privacy in the event of freedom of information requests being made to the government. One participant said they preferred to liaise through informal discussions. A business association representative also said companies had stopped seeking clarification on other matters for fear of receiving an answer that blocked a particular transaction. Overall, some private sector participants expressed their frustration that their community continued to have more experience and expertise in sanctions implementation than the public sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;private-sector-information-sharing&quot;&gt;Private Sector Information Sharing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these obstacles, a business association representative said there was an overall positive public–private dialogue, and a general perception that Danish business wants to do right thing. Participants from both public and private sectors reiterated several times the importance of trust in the business environment, and a government representative said they were highly aware of companies’ willingness to comply, as well as the public support for their doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another positive aspect highlighted was sharing information within the private sector, with more experienced companies sharing tools and information with smaller businesses, in order to support their compliance with the regulations. This was seen as an important support for business, given the “huge gap in compliance readiness” that a business association representative noticed among smaller companies. One participant from a multinational company said this information-sharing practice had been much more widespread in Denmark than in other European member states, an assertion supported by SIFMANet visits to other EU member states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government-led efforts include not only the establishment of sanctions taskforces among authorities, but also substantial outreach to the private sector. This outreach included a notification that Danish authorities sent to over 1,500 companies containing information on their sanctions obligations and encouraging them to get in touch and ask for support. In addition, the Danish Business Authority has sent out targeted letters in relation to circumvention, including compliance guidance, to approximately 200 economic operators. Danish authorities had an existing relationship with obliged entities, but the government decided to engage with all companies, given the expansive nature of the Russia sanctions regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;misalignment-between-banks-and-corporates&quot;&gt;Misalignment Between Banks and Corporates&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representatives from the corporate sector, including industrial and shipping companies, expressed frustration with the banking sector, which they said had taken an overly narrow approach to allowing certain transactions – beyond what was required by the law. One participant said it was as if “every taxi driver had to ask clients what they were doing before accepting their fare”. A bank representative said the requirement to comply on the product side had fundamentally changed how financial institutions approach sanctions risk, while another participant said that they now viewed certain types of business activities as high risk, where these would not have been before 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another participant, from a business association, said that several of their members had completed all compliance steps required for a certain transaction, but the banks had still refused to allow it. However, a representative from a bank said that non-US companies “need to step up”. They referred to the risks highlighted in the December 2023 amendments to US Executive Order 14024, which strengthened the US’ ability to sanction financial institutions facilitating and funding supplies to the Russian military–industrial complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, representatives from corporates also acknowledged that there was a lack of regulation of that sector, compared to the financial industry. There is no specific “know your customer” requirement for much of Danish industry, which meant that it was challenging to convince boards to allocate resources to sanctions compliance. Meanwhile, banks now demand more compliance procedures, and have higher standards for their corporate clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, participants from both banks and corporates cited a perception that the strictness of their compliance was harming their competitiveness compared to their European peers. They said this was a “significant” concern. Representatives of the shipping industry said that the country as a whole was now a “risk-poor environment”, with many shipping companies taking overly conservative approaches to international business, resulting in a negative impact on both that industry and the business environment overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One area that was highlighted several times was product classification. Given the dominance of the shipping and trade sectors in Denmark, classification was a significant issue, with participants highlighting the difficulties of getting a classification on tariff codes from customs and a dual-use designation decision. Some participants agreed that there continued to be public sector resourcing issues relating to the EU sanctions over the critical goods and technologies listed under Annex VII of Council Regulation (EU) 833/2014. However, another participant mentioned that the DCA can provide Binding Tariff Information decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;enforcement-and-the-shadow-of-the-dan-bunkering-case&quot;&gt;Enforcement and the Shadow of the Dan-Bunkering Case&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion then turned to the topic of enforcement, and numerous participants referred to the case of Dan-Bunkering, which was prosecuted in Denmark in 2021 for shipping $101 million in jet fuel to Syria from Kaliningrad. This case was seen by several participants as a model of enforcement. However, a representative of a business association said this represented a specific case, in which a business “wilfully turned a blind eye” to government guidance. In this way, they said, the Dan-Bunkering case was not representative of Danish business practices. Nevertheless, the experience clearly cast a shadow across public and private sector alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Procedural questions of how investigations were initiated were also discussed, with prosecutors highlighting that many cases began with administrative infractions, escalating into cooperation between police and competent authorities. This procedure, another government representative said, had been set up after the Dan-Bunkering case, which had provided many opportunities to clarify procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative from the Ministry of Industry, Business and Financial Affairs said many investigations began with the relevant Danish authority conducting a review of the news media for negative reports or requesting documents from exporters to identify suspicious information. This information was then evaluated for potential indications of misconduct before the authority decided whether to escalate the matter to police (and potentially onwards to prosecutors). Since 2022, Danish authorities have evaluated 140 potential breaches, they said, and there were around 40 open cases. So far, six matters had been reported to police. At the same time, a customs representative said there were other steps before any potential breaches were reported, including a hearing on customs declarations, and so there was “a lot of enforcement going on behind the scenes” before any case is reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants said these statistics highlighted the difficulty of comparing enforcement between different EU member states, with no centralised reporting of enforcement from the EU’s Directorate-General for Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union. A participant from a business association said these figures were also likely to be much higher than the number of actual criminal cases, since many issues related to goods that were unintentionally misdeclared, due to the aforementioned classification difficulties, rather than deliberate evasion or circumvention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this point from the business association, the customs representative responded that, in the majority of cases relating to possible breaches of import and export prohibitions, the DCA will go through several steps ahead of any potential filing of a police report. This includes a consultation process with the responsible party (usually the declarer), in which they are informed that the customs declaration is in possible breach of sanctions. The party will then be able to provide documentation for potential misdeclarations, so that the declaration can be corrected. Only if the responsible party is unable or unwilling to provide sufficient documentation that their goods are not in violation of sanctions will a police report be filed. Therefore, they argued, the figure is unlikely to be inflated by “unintentional misdeclarations” and similar declaration-related mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, participants discussed Denmark’s criminal enforcement regime for sanctions breaches, which requires proof of negligence or intent. Some participants found Denmark to have relatively high standards for criminal enforcement, and advocated for civil enforcement or other mechanisms with lower standards for deployment. Private sector representatives added that they would welcome a civil enforcement regime in Denmark, as this would allow voluntary self-disclosures and more dialogue between the public and private sectors, allowing companies to “come clean” if they have inadvertently breached sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, other participants said that widening enforcement action could damage the collaborative and cooperative nature of the public–private dialogue as well as the dialogue between private sector actors. They instead urged the government to publish findings from its investigations and reviews, even those that do not reach the standards for a criminal prosecution, as these would allow companies to learn from issues other entities have faced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Danish authorities and the private sector clearly reiterated their commitment to implementing and enforcing sanctions within Denmark at this roundtable. One particularly positive aspect of this was the commitment to information sharing in the private sector, both within business associations and between peers within industry. The roundtable discussions also demonstrated open and frank dialogue regarding the need for more guidance and support from the public sector, and authorities’ receptivity to these messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government’s ability to provide guidance and clear responses to queries appeared to be hampered by the spread of sanctions implementation responsibility across a large number of national competent authorities, to the degree that private sector actors complained of questions “circling” among various agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, the Danish authorities’ limitation on providing guidance on EU regulation, beyond what is stated in the wording and FAQs as adopted in Brussels, also poses practical difficulties and raised frustration within the private sector. Business representatives urged the government to share more information on its interpretations, including potentially on anonymised determinations by customs and other authorities in pre-enforcement investigations and analyses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussions also highlighted the potential gap in enforcement for sanctions breaches that occur due to conduct that falls below Denmark’s criminal standard. This may create a gap between Danish enforcement practice and that of other member states. At the same time, Danish business perceived its own practice as overly compliant, in comparison to other EU member states, raising concerns about Denmark’s competitiveness. Further alignment with other member states would address such concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, like many EU member states, Denmark has discovered that the key to successful sanctions implementation starts with coordination across the wide range of agencies and departments that find themselves involved in the Russia sanctions regime. It has also discovered that investment in relations with the private sector – the frontline of implementation – is critical if the country is to play its part in restricting the funding, and particularly the resourcing, of Russia’s illegal war of aggression in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has significantly increased pressure on Taiwan in recent years, stoking fears that tensions could erupt into outright conflict. Much attention has been paid to the threat of an invasion, but Beijing has options besides invading to coerce, punish, or annex Taiwan. One major step China could take is a “gray zone” quarantine led not by its People’s Liberation Army (PLA) but by its coast guard and other law enforcement forces. Rather than sealing off the island, a quarantine would aim to demonstrate China’s ability to exert control over Taiwan. A quarantine is more feasible for China and more likely than an invasion or blockade in the near term; it also presents unique challenges in terms of how Taiwan and the international community can respond. This brief explores two hypothetical maritime quarantine scenarios that are informed by in-depth research, tabletop exercises, private consultations, and expert surveys conducted by the CSIS China Power Project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has significantly increased pressure on Taiwan in recent years. China’s military frequently flies aircraft within the island’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ) and across the Taiwan Strait median line. In August 2022 and April 2023, China escalated in response to U.S.-Taiwan political engagements by staging unprecedented large-scale military exercises around Taiwan. China has also deployed its navy and coast guard in increasing numbers around Taiwan and its outlying islands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cross-Strait tensions further intensified in the wake of William Lai’s inauguration as Taiwan’s president on May 20, 2024. Three days after Lai delivered his inauguration address, China commenced two days of large-scale military exercises surrounding Taiwan, called “Joint Sword-2024A,” and accompanied them with “comprehensive law enforcement operations” (综合执法演练) involving China’s coast guard. Chinese officials stated that the drills were intended to “serve as a strong punishment for the separatist acts of ‘Taiwan independence’ forces and a stern warning against the interference and provocation by external forces.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These Chinese escalations against Taiwan are raising concerns that Beijing could take even more significant steps to “punish” and coerce Taiwan going forward. One major action China could take against Taiwan is a gray zone quarantine of the island. Quarantine scenarios have received far less attention than other contingencies, such as an invasion, but a quarantine is likelier in the near term and therefore warrants increased scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-a-quarantine&quot;&gt;What Is a Quarantine?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term quarantine is sometimes used interchangeably with “blockade.” However, this report differentiates between the two, defining a quarantine as a law enforcement–led operation to control maritime or air traffic within a specific area while a blockade is foremost military in nature. A quarantine would entail China’s coast guard and other forces conducting gray zone operations intended to stay below the threshold of an armed conflict. Thus, the military would play a supporting role — not a leading role — in such operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The political and operational goals of a quarantine are not to completely seal Taiwan off from the world but to impose a system of controls over the island’s maritime and/or air commerce. In a quarantine, key necessities like food and medicine could continue to flow into Taiwan, enabling China to assert that its law enforcement operation is imposing no hardship. A quarantine could target the delivery of specific goods, such as shipments of U.S. weapons to Taiwan, but such a move would risk provoking a more direct U.S. response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key goal of the quarantine approach is to obtain compliance from international companies and other countries to demonstrate China’s power over Taiwan. This is similar, in some respects, to China’s 2013 declaration of an ADIZ over much of the East China Sea. Many airlines, including U.S. companies, complied with Beijing’s demands then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quarantine of Taiwan could involve a change of Chinese domestic policy to establish new rules or requirements for regulating trade or traffic into Taiwan, or it could simply involve Chinese law enforcement forces stepping up activities against Taiwan on the basis of existing laws. Thus, a quarantine would focus on forcing compliance with Chinese rules and strengthening China’s asserted sovereignty claims over Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to law enforcement–led quarantines, this brief defines a blockade as a military-led operation. China’s PLA would be leading a blockade by encircling parts or all of Taiwan, while forces such as the coast guard and maritime militia play a supporting role. More intense versions of a blockade could involve missile strikes against Taiwan as well as mining of waters around Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A blockade would, by nature, involve much more escalatory operations than a quarantine. A quarantine would not intentionally involve the use of kinetic force to attack targets, though it is possible that escalation could lead to an exchange of kinetic attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no publicly available doctrinal writings on how exactly China could execute a quarantine. However, China has conducted several maneuvers and exercises that are indicative of how it can use law enforcement operations to assert control over traffic to Taiwan and complicate Taiwan’s maritime environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August 2022, when then speaker of the house Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, China’s Maritime Safety Administration (MSA) deployed a large patrol vessel, the Haixun 06, to conduct operations off the coast of China’s Fujian Province and in the Taiwan Strait for the first time. In April 2023, after Taiwan’s president Tsai Ing-wen transited through the United States, the Haixun 06 deployed again. This time, it sailed farther into the Taiwan Strait, and the Fujian Province MSA announced that the vessel would carry out “on-site inspections” of vessels, though there were no reports that inspections occurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, China increased coast guard patrols near Taiwan’s outlying Kinmen Islands after an incident there. In February 2024, a Taiwan coast guard vessel chased and collided with a Chinese vessel that Taiwan asserts was illegally fishing near Kinmen. The incident resulted in the death of two crew members. China responded by increasing coast guard patrols near what Taiwan calls “restricted” and “prohibited” waters around Kinmen. At one point, Chinese coast guard personnel boarded a Taiwan-owned tourist boat to check its licenses and paperwork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid this uptick in activity around Kinmen, China conducted a series of combat activities in which naval and air forces from the PLA Eastern Theater Command conducted drills jointly with the China Coast Guard (CCG). Chinese official outlets described the exercises as simulating “emergency scenarios” and focusing on enhancing forces’ “interoperability and joint strike capabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China again stepped up the involvement of the CCG in May 2024 during its latest round of large-scale exercises around Taiwan. Alongside the PLA exercises, the CCG conducted its own operations around two of Taiwan’s outlying islands. On the same day that the PLA exercises started, the Fujian Province Coast Guard launched a “comprehensive law enforcement exercise” in waters around Wuqiu and Dongyin “to test its joint patrol, rapid reaction and emergency response capabilities.” The CCG indicated that its patrol vessels came as close as 2.8 nautical miles from Wuqiu’s islands and as close as 3.1 nautical miles from Dongyin, marking the first time CCG vessels have entered waters there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/IW7hrxm.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to patrolling around Taiwan’s outlying islands, four CCG vessels sailed east of Taiwan and another three sailed southwest of Taiwan near the southern entrance of the Taiwan Strait. As part of the exercises east of Taiwan, videos released by official Chinese outlets showed multiple CCG ships encircling a target vessel and spraying water cannons, though the vessel appeared to be Chinese-flagged, and the video did not show the water cannons actually hitting the vessel. This represents a marked increase in intensity compared to previous CCG activities around Taiwan, and it is the latest and clearest indication that China is preparing its law enforcement and military forces to operate together in the context of a Taiwan Strait crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-china-might-quarantine-taiwan&quot;&gt;Why China Might Quarantine Taiwan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quarantine of Taiwan would represent a substantial escalation of coercion against the island, but it offers China several distinct advantages. First, a quarantine allows China to impose greater political and administrative control over Taiwan. China’s efforts to restrict air or maritime traffic to the island could allow Beijing to assert its sovereignty claims and demonstrate that Taiwan does not have control over its own claimed sovereign space. This could undermine Taipei’s ability to self-govern and erode the Taiwan public’s confidence in Taiwan’s military and coast guard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, China could use a quarantine to intervene in Taiwan’s domestic politics by imposing economic costs on the island. If the disruptions stemming from a quarantine are sustained for a lengthy period, elements within Taiwan’s society could leverage this to portray Taiwan’s leaders as ineffective. This could either lead to a loss of public support for Taipei or increase political pressure on Taiwan’s leaders to negotiate or improve relations with Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, a quarantine is more limited in scope than a blockade or other large military operations. A quarantine led by China’s coast guard is not a declaration of war against Taiwan. Because a quarantine is not overtly PLA-led, there is a lower risk that escalation will lead to direct military confrontation. If the quarantine is cast as a law enforcement operation, China can easily announce the end of the operation and claim its objectives were met. Relatedly, China could choose to target only certain types of products, or the quarantine could be scaled to cover all air and maritime flows to Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If China successfully conducts a limited quarantine, it would set a political precedent and establish a new normal of Chinese activity, setting the stage for it to carry out more expansive operations in the future. The unprecedented scale and complexity of a quarantine operation would also provide a valuable opportunity for Chinese law enforcement, maritime militia, and the PLA to train and test their capabilities and identify weaknesses for subsequent operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, a quarantine could have impact without full and sustained implementation. Although China has significant capabilities to use law enforcement and other assets to physically disrupt trade to Taiwan, it may only need to demonstrate intent and some capability for the quarantine to be effective. The announcement of a change in Chinese policy — or the beginning of law enforcement actions — is likely to have a chilling effect on the willingness of businesses to invest or operate in Taiwan. Similarly, demonstrated Chinese willingness to search and seize only a handful of commercial ships could have an outsized deterrent impact and discourage similar transgressions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many commercial airlines and shipping companies are likely to comply with Chinese pronouncements. Even if some shipping companies do not comply with quarantine regulations, adherence by most of them would significantly strengthen China’s narrative that it has control over Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, China’s use of the coast guard and civilian law enforcement complicates the ability of the United States and regional actors to respond. A quarantine does not require closing off or restricting international traffic through the Taiwan Strait — an action that other countries could use as a justification to intervene to assist Taiwan and defend international legal rights to freedom of navigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States also does not have sufficient coast guard forces forward deployed to the Indo-Pacific to respond in kind. The United States could lean on other forward-deployed forces, including air and maritime assets, to help Taiwan respond, but it is likely to be cautious to avoid the optics of using “gray-hulled” U.S. Navy vessels to confront “white-hulled” CCG vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recent survey of experts from the United States and Taiwan, the China Power Project found that most are skeptical of U.S. and allied willingness to intervene in a quarantine. Only 13 percent of surveyed U.S. experts and 9 percent of Taiwan experts were “completely confident” that the United States would intervene militarily to defend Taiwan from a quarantine. An even smaller percentage had confidence that allies and partners would support a U.S.-led multinational military intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinas-ability-to-quarantine-taiwan&quot;&gt;China’s Ability to Quarantine Taiwan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quarantine would be an immense and unprecedented undertaking for China, requiring it to overcome complex logistics hurdles and jointly command law enforcement, maritime militia, and military forces. Nevertheless, China has immense capabilities at its disposal that would enable it to conduct a quarantine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With over 150 oceangoing vessels and more than 400 smaller vessels at its disposal, the CCG is the largest coast guard in the world. The CCG is a quasi-military organization that reports to China’s highest military authority, the Central Military Commission. Many CCG ships were transferred from the navy and still carry some military-grade weapons, such as 76 mm cannons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s coast guard would be at a major quantitative and qualitative disadvantage. It has just 10 oceangoing ships and approximately 160 smaller vessels. These vessels are responsible for protecting the over 300 harbors and ports on Taiwan’s coast and for law enforcement activity within 24 nautical miles of the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/cRv69To.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s MSA, which is the primary non–coast guard civilian agency responsible for maritime security and navigation, would work alongside the CCG to lead a quarantine. The MSA’s fleet consists of at least three dozen oceangoing vessels and hundreds of smaller patrol craft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the CCG, China also possesses a large maritime militia: a force of organized, trained, and armed personnel aboard fishing vessels and other craft. These vessels operate under the official guise of commercial fishing activity, but in actuality, they work in tandem with China’s law enforcement and under the shadow of the PLA to support Chinese maritime operations. Because the maritime militia is not officially a law enforcement or military entity, it is challenging for other countries to respond to its activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is little information about the full size of the maritime militia, but some estimate that it consists of more than 100 large vessels and as many as 3,000 smaller vessels. The lion’s share of the maritime militia is concentrated in the South China Sea, where militia vessels often swarm by the dozens or hundreds to defend China’s territorial claims in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is unclear how many Chinese maritime militia operate near the Taiwan Strait, but those that would be involved in a Taiwan contingency may be based at ports in China’s Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Shandong Provinces. Meanwhile, Taiwan does not have an equivalently large force similar to China’s maritime militia. This means Taiwan would largely need to lean on its coast guard to respond to militia activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, China’s military forces also significantly overshadow Taiwan’s. As of 2023, the PLA Navy comprises a battle force of over 370 vessels, many of which are based in areas close to the Taiwan Strait. The PLA Air Force and Navy also boast thousands of aircraft, which support China’s ability to project power and conduct intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) around Taiwan. If the situation around Taiwan goes kinetic, Taiwan would face a much larger force than its own, limiting its ability to effectively respond to aggressive Chinese activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hlP4Pdz.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-role-of-geography&quot;&gt;The Role of Geography&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geography is a major factor at play in a quarantine scenario. At its narrowest point, the Taiwan Strait is only about 130 km (81 miles) wide, meaning China does not have to deploy forces at long distances from China’s own shores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding to Taiwan’s exposure is the fact that the island has only a handful of major international ports. Most of the busiest ports — including Kaohsiung, Taichung, Taipei, Keelung, and Mailiao — are also the closest to mainland China. There are two less-busy ports — Hualien and Su’ao — on Taiwan’s east coast, as well as additional smaller harbors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Port of Kaohsiung stands out among these. In 2022, an estimated 57 percent of Taiwan’s maritime trade entered through the Port of Kaohsiung, making it an indispensable commercial hub for the island. It is by far Taiwan’s busiest port for containerized goods and oil, and the nearby Yung-An Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Terminal is Taiwan’s largest facility for importing LNG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Lj5oHvG.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this means it is easier for Chinese forces to reach Taiwan’s most important shipping ports. In fact, if China can effectively control traffic into just one port, Kaohsiung, it can achieve significant influence over what gets into Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-china-could-implement-a-quarantine&quot;&gt;How China Could Implement a Quarantine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scenarios outlined below are only two examples of potential maritime quarantines. There are many other conceivable approaches China could take, but these scenarios align with activities and capabilities China has demonstrated through past operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scenario-1-limited-maritime-quarantine&quot;&gt;Scenario 1: Limited Maritime Quarantine&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this first scenario, Beijing leverages its law enforcement forces to conduct a limited maritime quarantine of some of Taiwan’s ports. This is not aimed at choking off Taiwan’s access to trade, but a gray zone operation to achieve more limited — but still significant — objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/dn93XhE.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Days or weeks before the start of quarantine operations, China readies maritime law enforcement forces within its coast guard and MSA. Beijing also mobilizes portions of its military and calls up maritime militia fishing vessels in the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China begins by publicly announcing “enhanced customs inspection rules.” It avoids using terms like “quarantine” or “blockade” to describe its actions. In order to enter Taiwan, all cargo and tanker vessels must file advance customs declarations with relevant Chinese authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese law enforcement vessels will be authorized to board vessels, conduct on-site inspections, question personnel, and undertake other measures against noncompliant ships. Chinese authorities also threaten fines and market access restrictions for companies flouting the new rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quarantine is set to enter into force 48 hours after announcement. This allows China time to deploy forces into position after they have been mobilized. It also allows shipping companies with vessels in transit warning time to comply, lending some credibility to China’s actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese authorities do not announce a specific location for the inspections, but they intend to target the Port of Kaohsiung, Taiwan’s busiest port. China positions more than 10 law enforcement patrol vessels off the coast of Kaohsiung. China also deploys a smaller contingent of law enforcement vessels within the Taiwan Strait off the coast of other major ports at Taichung and Taipei. About 48 hours after the initial announcement, Chinese authorities issue notices that enforcement is beginning and that its patrol ships will stop noncompliant vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vessels intrude into Taiwan’s 24-nautical-mile contiguous zone and occasionally approach the 12-nautical-mile territorial seas boundary. This is symbolically important since China does not recognize Taiwan’s claims to these boundaries. During large-scale military exercises around Taiwan in April 2023, several PLA vessels intruded into Taiwan’s contiguous zone in a maneuver intended to delegitimize Taiwan’s claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supporting these law enforcement vessels are approximately 20 maritime militia fishing vessels extending along Taiwan’s contiguous zone. These maritime militia vessels are not authorized to conduct boarding or search operations against commercial vessels. Instead, they fill in gaps in ISR and complicate Taiwan’s maritime domain awareness by swarming in certain areas. China could deploy significantly more militia forces — as it has done in the South China Sea — but the militia forces are not as well trained as the coast guard, and Beijing may worry about their discipline and ability to face off against Taiwan’s coast guard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this quarantine is ostensibly a law enforcement operation, the military plays a key supporting role. China’s navy deploys five surface action groups (SAGs) to encircle Taiwan from a distance. Each SAG comprises three to six ships — including destroyers, frigates, support vessels, and covertly deployed attack submarines — for a total of nearly 30 warships. They are primarily meant to deter intervention by foreign coast guard or military forces and to respond if Taiwan’s navy escalates or attempts to escort vessels into the island. They also provide ISR, extending China’s air and maritime domain awareness farther into the Pacific, helping Beijing monitor U.S., Japanese, or other movements. In addition to naval operations, the PLA constantly flies sorties of manned and unmanned aircraft around Taiwan to monitor traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1l4Jaic.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing does not need universal compliance with the customs rules in order to claim success. Compliance by around 75 percent of shipping companies would be a considerable success for China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese-flagged shipping vessels — which account for a significant share of the total traffic — universally comply with Chinese authorities, and Beijing permits them to enter Taiwan’s ports. Beijing counts on most foreign shipping companies complying with the “enhanced customs rules” to avoid reprisals, but several companies headquartered in Taiwan, the United States, and certain other countries publicly oppose and disregard the rules. Over the course of one week, Chinese law enforcement vessels only stop and search one or two vessels in total and focus solely on Taiwan-owned vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If China meets relatively limited pushback and most companies comply with Chinese customs rules, China begins to draw down operations after about one week. However, a considerable law enforcement and military presence persists around Taiwan in the weeks that follow — an indication of the new normal China has established.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scenario-2-full-maritime-quarantine&quot;&gt;Scenario 2: Full Maritime Quarantine&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scenario is a significantly scaled-up version of the first scenario. Like the first scenario, China declares new “enhanced customs inspection rules” that will require advance notice with Chinese authorities to ship goods into Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/e7JbzZM.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time, however, China publicly announces a quarantine area covering the entire island of Taiwan. The zone extends 24 nautical miles from Taiwan’s territorial baseline, matching with Taiwan’s claimed contiguous zone. This is intended to delegitimize the contiguous zone and demonstrate China’s willingness and capability to impose its will in an area ostensibly under Taipei’s jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese authorities announce that the inspection regime will go into effect 48 hours after declaration. China will require the shipper of any cargo destined for Taiwan to file advance notice with Chinese customs and law enforcement officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China again deploys law enforcement vessels to lead the quarantine, but this time it sends a much larger overall contingent. The greatest concentration, consisting of more than 10 coast guard and maritime safety vessels, is positioned off the coast of Kaohsiung. It also deploys a dozen vessels off the west coast ports of Taipei and Taichung and sends nine near the northern Port of Keelung — Taiwan’s second-busiest import hub. Finally, it sends another six to the smaller eastern ports of Hualien and Su’ao.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This deployment of more than three dozen law enforcement vessels amounts to an unprecedentedly large maritime operation for China. It would constitute approximately one-fourth of China’s oceangoing CCG and MSA fleet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roughly 40 maritime militia vessels also swarm Taiwan’s coastal waters, along the contiguous zone, to fill in gaps between law enforcement vessels. As in the limited quarantine scenario, the maritime militia vessels do not participate in conducting boarding and inspecting activities. They focus primarily on conducting ISR for China and complicating Taiwan’s maritime domain awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in the limited quarantine scenario, China’s navy deploys five SAGs to extend China’s ISR, intimidate Taiwan, and deter U.S. and other forces that may try to intervene. PLA aircraft also fly regular sorties to conduct ISR around Taiwan. This time, China supplements its naval deployment by positioning the Shandong aircraft carrier and its strike group southeast of Taiwan. It launches frequent sorties of J-15 fighters east of Taiwan, repeating operations that the PLA exercised in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/qbrTy2f.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, China is much more active in terms of boarding and searching vessels. Chinese forces stop at least one or two vessels per day for the period of the quarantine, focusing mostly on Taiwan-flagged ships. There also appear to be inspections of vessels belonging to some of the dozen countries that still maintain official diplomatic relations with Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese forces seize several noncompliant ships and impound them at nearby ports within China. Commercial vessels that have filed the appropriate paperwork and had their requests approved are allowed into Taiwan. However, due to heightened uncertainty about the nature of China’s enforcement, many shipping companies choose to delay their shipments, causing a significant and noticeable decline of merchandise trade into Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the operation stretches into multiple days, Chinese ships and personnel need to be rotated. After the large initial deployment, China can fluctuate the number of forces depending on factors like capacity, the level of compliance with the quarantine, Beijing’s desired intensity, and U.S. military posturing, if any.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These operations continue at varying levels for over two weeks before beginning to wind down. However, a significant CCG and PLA presence continues to operate indefinitely around Taiwan at a greater level than before the quarantine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For both these maritime scenarios, Beijing’s goal is not to hermetically seal off Taiwan. Instead, these campaigns are designed to punish Taiwan, assert Beijing’s claimed sovereignty over the island, test the response from international shipping companies, and put significant pressure on Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While China has the capabilities to successfully execute these and other quarantine variations, these would require operations that are far more complex than anything China has demonstrated to date. Such moves would carry significant risk for China, and its success would depend to a large degree on how Taiwan, the United States, and others respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if successfully implemented, there are limits to what a quarantine can achieve. If Beijing’s goal is to inflict enough pain to force Taiwan’s surrender, China would need to move beyond the gray zone into overt military action. A military blockade would be a key option for China if it seeks to forcefully unify Taiwan without launching an all-out invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【蘋果案】黎智英指新冠肺炎致人命經濟損失 料美國人民會支持對中國實施制裁懲罰&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（4日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第88日審訊。昨日辯方指黎身體不適及發抖，至今日黎如期出庭應訊。控方繼續播放國安法生效前黎智英受訪片段，在2020年6月與美國神父 Robert Sirico 的對談中，黎指經過新冠肺炎疫情之後，西方國家不再信任中國，並以審慎的態度與中國貿易；而且中國經濟變得衰弱，對美國來說是一個好時機去改變中國，乃至拯救全世界。黎又指新冠疫情導致很多美國人喪失親友、企業倒閉和蒙受金錢損失等等，他們對於中國忿忿不平，必定會支持時任美國總統特朗普制裁中國。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英對談節目稱初來香港感受到自由-八九民運後創辦壹週刊雜誌&quot;&gt;黎智英對談節目稱初來香港感受到自由 八九民運後創辦《壹週刊》雜誌&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;昨日辯方指黎身體不適及發抖，法官指黎需要送院作進一步檢查，遂押後至今日續審。今日黎如期出庭應訊，辯方指黎感覺比昨天好轉，因此審訊繼續。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方播放2020年6月18日美國智庫 Acton Institute 的節目影片，當中黎智英與美國神父 Robert Sirico 對談。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎憶述他年輕時初到香港，看到早餐有很多選擇，感到這個地方有自由、深受感動，雖然晚上要在工廠留宿，但他感到日子過得十分開心，因為感到這裡享有自由，獲得所有機會去證明自己、奮鬥、成就他想做的事。黎在工廠打工，期間自學英語，後來因為懂得英語而獲得機會晉升至推銷員。1969年，黎再獲得機會赴美國工作，當時正值胡士托音樂節舉行，後來演變成暴動，黎指他當時正在前往紐約，惟路途被截斷。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;直至27歲，黎成立自己的小型工廠，後來工廠規模變大，黎亦創立了成衣品牌「佐丹奴」。1989年北京爆發民運，黎全力支持，六四鎮壓之後他去信譴責李鵬，之後開始被中國打壓，被禁止在中國經營門市，黎因而被迫賣出「佐丹奴」，轉做傳媒生意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;八九民運之後，黎創辦《壹週刊》雜誌，並打正旗號作為一個反對中共的雜誌，黎形容業務非常成功。他指當時所有人都自我審查、不敢得罪中共，而他在那時創辦雜誌，是一個很好的時機去填補市場的空白。黎其後創辦香港《蘋果日報》，成為香港最大報紙之一，後來再創辦台灣《蘋果日報》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英指很多主教替中國說好話-只有陳日君敢於與中國唱反調&quot;&gt;黎智英指很多主教替中國說好話 只有陳日君敢於與中國唱反調&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;談到天主教徒身份，黎指其太太對他影響甚大，因為太太是一名虔誠的天主教徒，每逢星期日，黎與太太一同前往教堂，直至1997年黎皈依天主教。他表示從來不是以一種「為了社會或為了其他人」的心態而去爭取民主自由，而是他覺得自己應該去做，便去做，有時可能做得對，有時亦可能做錯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到何時認識天主教香港教區榮休主教陳日君樞機，黎指當他皈依天主教的時候，陳日君仍是一名主教，由於二人追求自由的理念一致，所以多年來是好友。黎引述陳曾說過「梵蒂岡出賣了地下教會」，使陳十分傷心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎又指很多主教都親中國、不時替中國說好話，甚至有的羅馬天主教會的樞機主教立場保守，希望避免得罪中國，唯一敢於與中國唱反調的樞機是陳日君。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎指，香港人的價值觀與西方一致，惟中國有著截然不同的價值觀，當中國以截然不同的價值觀與外界進行貿易來往時，世界將永無寧日。黎又指，當中國愈來愈富裕的時候，他們並不會愈來愈接近西方價值，反而會愈來愈不同，甚至想轉過來改變西方。他形容習近平是「人類史上最極端的獨裁者」，想帶領中國變回毛澤東時代，甚至懂得利用科技來監控人民。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英指疫情令美國人蒙受損失-若特朗普推制裁會支持&quot;&gt;黎智英指疫情令美國人蒙受損失 若特朗普推制裁會支持&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎形容美國是唯一「救星」，他提到經過新冠肺炎疫情之後，西方國家不再信任中國，並以審慎的態度與中國貿易；而且中國經濟變得衰弱，對於時任美國總統特朗普來說，這是一個好時機去改變中國，乃至拯救全世界。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎指，若然特朗普推行一連串的制裁和懲罰措施，他會得到很多來自美國人民的支持，因為新冠疫情導致很多美國人喪失親友、企業倒閉和蒙受金錢損失等等，他們對於中國忿忿不平，必定會支持制裁中國。黎形容這是一個絕妙的方式去促使中國改變。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方接著播放黎智英whatsapp搜獲影片-大部份為羅傑斯發言片段不涉黎&quot;&gt;控方接著播放黎智英WhatsApp搜獲影片 大部份為羅傑斯發言片段、不涉黎&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後播放多段由黎智英 WhatsApp 接收的影片，大部份為「香港監察」創辦人羅傑斯（Benedict Rogers）的受訪和公開發言片段。播片前，法官李運騰質疑影片不涉及黎智英，控方有什麼基礎播放這些影片，又指影片是在海外拍攝，可以怎樣協助控方舉證。控方代表、高級檢控官徐倩姿則指，這些影片是在黎智英的 WhatsApp 發現，能夠顯示黎對影片內容知情，而且影片內容能夠讓法庭了解案發時的背景。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在2019年7月19日，羅傑斯向黎智英傳送一段《大紀元時報》節目「美國思想領袖」（American Thought Leader）片段。當時反修例運動已爆發，羅傑斯在節目中指香港在97年主權移交以後，自由逐漸被侵蝕，而政府推動《逃犯條例》修訂，該草案容許政府將所有「眼中釘」從有法治的香港，去到沒有法治、只有「以法治國」（rule by law）的中國，不少香港人視草案為「最後一根稻草」，若修訂草案通過，中港之間的「防火牆」將會消失，形容這是主權移交22年以來最差的時候。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到近年中國情況，羅傑斯指中國對基督教教堂、法輪功和西藏進行打壓，沒有宗教自由，難以理解為何一個主張「真、善、忍」的信仰系統，會遭受中國當局如此殘酷的回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;羅傑斯又稱，不知名人士曾寄送恐嚇信給他的鄰居和家人，要求羅傑斯停止繼續發聲。在一次公開場合中，有義工遭受襲擊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;羅傑斯指，中國問題不僅限於中國內的人權和自由問題，如今更已對外國構成了威脅。他形容香港站在戰線前沿，因香港作為國際金融中心，也是亞洲最開放的城市之一，如果失去香港則後果不堪設想。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;羅傑斯英國有責任帶頭呼籲制裁中國&quot;&gt;羅傑斯：英國有責任帶頭呼籲制裁中國&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另播放羅傑斯在2019年12月9日於倫敦「國際人權日」的發言、同月呼籲劍橋大學撤銷前特首林鄭月娥榮譽院士名銜的行動發言，以及2020年3月5日的受訪片段。羅傑斯指懂得區分「反中」與「反中共」是很重要，他18歲時曾到中國居住6個月，在當地認識了不少內地朋友，他強調在文化和朋友的層面上很喜歡中國。至於前特首林鄭月娥，羅傑斯指她不願聆聽6月9日一百萬上街市民的聲音，也不願聆聽6月16日二百萬上街市民的聲音，因此不值得擁有榮譽院士名銜。另外，在2019年11月25日的影片中，羅傑斯指英國有責任帶頭呼籲制裁中國。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審，控方表示尚餘6小時影片需要播放。&lt;/p&gt;

The paper analyses how the EU is using arguments linked to upholding values and appealing to the interests of third countries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diplomacy and strategic communications are key to making sanctions effective. Tackling the challenge of sanctions circumvention requires the cooperation of non-sanctioning (or third) countries, and sanctions diplomacy plays an important role in persuading them to cooperate. This paper offers a data-driven analysis of the EU’s strategic communications on sanctions against Russia, showing that the EU relies mostly on addressing interests (such as EU accession and economic interests) and framing support for sanctions as economically or politically desirable for third countries. To a lesser degree, values also play a role in the EU’s outreach, mostly in relation to protecting the principles of international law. This is in line with EU foreign policy’s broader shift to focusing more on interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the issue of sanctions circumvention, EU sanctions diplomacy applies a “stick and carrot” approach to both warn third countries of the potential negative impact on their economies if they allow such activities, and praise the efforts of countries that pledge to tackle circumvention. This communication implies that becoming a platform for circumvention can lead to reputational damage, resulting in fewer investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the EU takes a different communication approach towards EU candidates than towards other third countries. Regarding the wider set of third countries, the EU generally accepts their wish not to align on sanctions, and only aims to compel them to tackle circumvention. On the other hand, EU candidate countries are reminded of their commitment to align with the EU’s Common Foreign and Security Policy as part of the accession process, including alignment on sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On values, the EU links cooperation on sanctions to defending the values of international law, offering third countries an opportunity to frame their support for sanctions as a way to help uphold the principles of international law, rather than framing them as explicit measures against Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU should focus on tracking policy developments in third countries, following their pledges to tackle circumvention, and adjust EU sanctions diplomacy accordingly. The EU should also resort more strongly to highlighting the requirement for EU candidate countries to align with sanctions. For other third countries, the EU should offer framings that highlight international norms and explore different options, such as environmental concerns surrounding Russia’s shadow fleet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since February 2022, the EU and its allies have adopted a series of sanctions to respond to Russia’s illegal war of aggression against Ukraine. A key challenge of making these restrictive measures effective is the tackling of circumvention, as redirecting trade of sanctioned goods through third countries can diminish the impact of sanctions. However, beyond stricter enforcement within the EU, this also requires the cooperation of non-sanctioning countries, as taking action to hinder circumvention through their territory is their sovereign choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper examines the following question: How does the EU use strategic communications to persuade third countries to cooperate on sanctions? The paper analyses how the EU is using arguments linked to upholding values (supporting sanctions to protect the values of international law) and appealing to third countries’ interests (such as EU accession and economic interests) in its strategic communications on sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU has taken several steps to close loopholes and strengthen the role of sanctions diplomacy – in other words, diplomatic efforts “to persuade [third] countries to follow suit”. As the paper demonstrates, however, in the case of the EU, sanctions diplomacy has been used not only to persuade countries to follow suit, but also to incentivise third countries to address circumvention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 12th sanctions package of the EU, adopted in December 2023, has strengthened its anti-circumvention measures, which were already put at the top of the agenda in the 11th sanctions package in June 2023. Furthermore, the 13th package, adopted in February 2024, listed several companies in third countries that have been involved in sanctions circumvention. The EU’s diplomatic efforts to tackle sanctions evasion have also been supported by the appointment of the International Special Envoy for the Implementation of EU Sanctions (EU sanctions envoy) at the end of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, several third countries have been expressing their reservations about and even opposition to sanctions. Latin American countries reportedly advocated for omitting mentions of support for Ukraine from the July 2023 EU-CELAC summit declaration. South Africa claimed sanctions against Russia were causing collateral damage to “bystander countries”. India has been denying criticisms that the country would be facilitating sanctions circumvention by reselling refined Russian oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These developments underline the need for constructive dialogue between the sanctions senders and third countries. They also highlight the importance of the public element of the EU’s sanctions diplomacy, namely the EU’s strategic communications as a “goal-directed communication activity”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research on the perceived challenges of the EU’s strategic communications on sanctions has been relatively sparse. Nevertheless, existing literature contends that the EU’s strategic communications on sanctions have been driven by values rather than interests. This also led to the suggestion that the EU should reformulate its sanctions diplomacy “with more focus on the interests of states in joining the collective sanctions against Russia”. This paper argues that the EU’s strategic communications on sanctions have been focusing on interest-based arguments, in line with a shift towards highlighting interests in the EU’s foreign policy, as discussed in Chapter I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper is comprised of three chapters. Chapter I examines the role of sanctions diplomacy, the factors influencing third countries’ approaches to sanctions, and the EU’s shifting foreign policy, which form the context of the EU’s strategic communications on sanctions. Chapter II breaks down the communications strategies of EU officials in relation to Russia sanctions using a data-driven approach including an expert survey and word frequency analysis. Chapter III interprets the results and examines how the EU’s strategic communications on sanctions have balanced values- and interest-based communications in relation to the countries visited by the EU sanctions envoy. The paper concludes with a set of recommendations on how the EU can optimise its strategic communications on sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper is based on a review of speeches, press conferences and interviews: strategic communications that create expectations ahead of meetings between the EU and third countries, and frame outcomes after such meetings. The paper analyses the communications outputs of two key EU representatives: the EU sanctions envoy, David O’Sullivan; and the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of the Commission (EU HR/VP) Josep Borrell. The analysis looked at EU communications issued between February and September 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The definitions of strategic communications and public diplomacy are not universally accepted. For Philip M Taylor, public diplomacy is one of the four pillars of strategic communications, while for Michael Vlahos, “public diplomacy” and “strategic communications” are synonymous. According to Guy J Golan and Sung-Un Yang, public diplomacy is the “management of communication” among diplomatic actors which have an objective of reaching foreign publics to promote national interest. However, for Nicholas J Cull, strategic communications is just one of many terms that describe what is essentially “conducting foreign policy by engaging foreign publics”. For Ali Fisher, strategic communications is the “telling” end of the spectrum of public diplomacy, messaging directly to foreign audiences. As this paper examines the EU’s direct messaging to foreign audiences through press releases, blogs and media interviews, it relies on Fisher’s definition, and employs the term “strategic communications”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the wider category of third countries targeted by strategic communications, the paper focuses on countries where the EU sanctions envoy has led negotiations. Within this group of countries, the paper examines six countries (out of nine) in which the EU sanctions envoy and third country officials communicated publicly around the negotiations: Armenia; Georgia; Kazakhstan; Kyrgyzstan; Serbia; and Uzbekistan. Three of the nine countries had to be omitted from the analysis as no public statements could be identified on the EU sanctions envoy’s visits to the following jurisdictions: Türkiye; Pakistan; and the UAE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The review relied on desk-based research to retrieve the relevant communications materials and compile an analysis of academic literature. In its analysis of communications of relevant EU officials, the paper relies as much as is feasible on direct quotes, and not on reporters’ interpretations or descriptions. This ensures that only the language directly attributable to the EU officials is analysed, with the exception of Armenia and Serbia, for which the analysis sources did not reveal direct quotes by the EU sanctions envoy; the paper therefore uses secondary sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper introduces the typology of “values-based” and “interest-based” communications, building on international relations and public diplomacy literature. For the purposes of this paper, “interest-based” communications focus on appealing to strategic interests, including political, military, economic and trade. “Values-based” communications focus on culture, values and ideals (political, economic and social systems), which can create an enabling environment for national interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The methodology is inspired by Gry Espedal and colleagues’ book on researching values, with a special focus on Arild Wæraas’s chapter on making values emerge from texts and Benedicte Maria Tveter Kivle and Gry Espedal’s chapter on identifying values through discourse analysis. Furthermore, Paul Baker provides valuable insights on employing frequency analysis and using occurrences in discourse analysis. The paper’s methodology builds on two key approaches: the term “frequency analysis” as used by Steven Louis Pike; and Francis A Beer, Barry J Balleck and Ricardo Real P Sousa’s classification of idealist and realist vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the use of frequency analysis, Kathleen Ahrens found that “narrowly focused corpora are suitable for identifying different viewpoints through an examination of lexical frequency patterns”. Pike used frequency analysis to research the narrative-driven shifts in US public diplomacy messaging and strategy. According to Baker, discourse analysis can point to “patterns in language (both frequent and rare) which must then be interpreted in order to suggest the existence of discourses”. To identify the main framings used by the EU to compel third countries to cooperate on sanctions, the paper builds on a frequency analysis of terms (collocations) used in EU sanctions communications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the main analysis, the author worked with 23 texts (10,921 words) published between February and September 2023 (see Annex). The texts were published online, on EU institutional websites, on governmental websites in Armenia and Serbia, and through media outlets in Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To mine the most often-used terms, the statistical programme “r” was used, which can be used to measure term and document frequency and the co-occurrence of words, among other things. This allows for the calculation of possible collocations, which, according to Andreas Niekler and Gregor Wiedemann, “comprise two (or more) semantically related [words] … which form a distinct new sense”. Two terms, if they occur “significantly more often as direct neighbours as expected by chance”, can be treated as collocations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most-often used collocations were listed in a survey which asked respondents to assign each collocation a score from 1 (values-based) to 7 (interest-based), based on their perception. This Likert scale allowed respondents to express the nuances of the level to which they perceived that collocations were falling towards a more values-based approach (scores 1–3), or a more interest-based approach (scores 5–7), or whether the collocations were neither explicitly values- nor interest-based (score 4).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survey was completed during January 2024 by 15 members of the European Sanctions and Illicit Finance Monitoring and Analysis Network (SIFMANet), experts who have worked on sanctions within the framework of the network and focus on international relations studies. They represent think tanks from the UK and eight EU member states: Czechia; France; Germany; Hungary; Latvia; Lithuania; Poland; and Sweden. This covers perceptions from across different regions of the EU and the UK, thereby attempting to reflect geographic diversity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survey presented the respondents with the topic of the paper, a description of the corpus and the definition of values- and interest-based communications as described above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;challenges-and-limitations&quot;&gt;Challenges and Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key challenges for the research included the sample size of texts that could be analysed, as the sample is limited by the number of countries that the EU sanctions envoy has visited and where public communications were part of the envoy’s visit. Furthermore, sources being in the third countries’ languages posed a challenge, which was surmountable through the use of online translation tools, cross-checking against dictionaries and translation applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another challenge was developing a list of concepts to be used in the analysis to better understand the mode of communication (values-based or interest-based) employed by the EU in its sanctions diplomacy. The “coding” or classification through experts in the field of international relations from across the EU and the UK allowed for minimal cultural bias and an independent assessment of the terms employed in EU strategic communications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-eu-sanctions-communications-towards-third-countries&quot;&gt;I. EU Sanctions Communications Towards Third Countries&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU has consistently used strategic communications as part of its sanctions diplomacy towards third countries, aimed at reinforcing its sanctions policy. This is critical, as “active non-cooperation by [third] countries can sabotage the effort by providing offsetting assistance to the targeted regime”. This shows that third countries’ positioning in the dispute between the sanctions sender (EU) and the target (Russia) is highly relevant for the efficacy of sanctions, with “multilateral” sanctions deemed more successful than “unilateral” sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strengthening sanctions diplomacy efforts, the EU appointed David O’Sullivan as sanctions envoy in December 2022. The role of sanctions diplomacy was further reinforced by the 11th package of sanctions, adopted on 23 June 2023, which set out a multi-step approach to tackling sanctions circumvention, starting with the strengthening of “bilateral and multilateral cooperation through diplomatic engagement with, and the provision of increased technical assistance to, the third countries in question”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the first round of diplomatic efforts yields no results, the EU can employ targeted proportionate measures aimed solely at depriving Russia of strategic resources. If this approach still fails to deliver results, the EU pursues re-engagement with the relevant third country. However, if these diplomatic efforts to tackle circumvention still fall short, the EU can adopt exceptional last-resort measures, including the restriction of sale, supply, transfer or export of sensitive dual-use goods and technology to the third country. At the time of writing, the EU has not yet resorted to the use of such last-resort measures for a third country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;eu-strategic-communications-to-third-countries&quot;&gt;EU Strategic Communications to Third Countries&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going beyond tackling circumvention, the EU has also been attempting to incentivise certain third countries to align with its sanctions policies. Alignment has no legal definition, but in diplomacy, it is used to signal a third country’s public willingness to adopt sanctions similar to those of the EU. Between February and September 2023, the EU offered the opportunity for 14 non-EU countries to align with EU sanctions, and those which did were listed in declarations and statements issued by the EU HR/VP. While these declarations and statements are not legally binding, they offer a way for the EU to communicate the international support for its sanctions regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EU Candidate Countries, EEA Member Countries and Eastern Partnership Countries&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As sanctions form part of the EU’s Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), candidate countries are formally required to progressively align with those sanctions, reaching full alignment prior to accession. This expectation of candidate countries was also expressed in the European Council conclusions of 24 June 2022. However, as the evidence shows, not all candidate countries have been aligning themselves with the EU sanctions regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU’s attempts to see countries join its sanctions efforts are most successful in its immediate neighbourhood, specifically among certain EU candidate countries and European Economic Area (EEA) countries. The declarations and statements by the EU HR/VP on the “alignment of certain countries” show that from February 2022 to September 2023, EU candidate countries Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Ukraine, and EEA members Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway have been consistently aligning themselves with EU sanctions. The candidate countries Georgia (potential candidate country until December 2023), Moldova (candidate country since June 2023) and Serbia were listed in certain declarations, while candidate country Türkiye and Eastern Partnership countries Armenia and Azerbaijan were not listed in any declarations regarding the alignment on sanctions against Russia between February 2022 and September 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EU Partner Countries&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While certain regional partners of the EU are not invited to join the declarations on alignment, they still communicate their adherence to the sanctions policy on Russia. Switzerland, for example, has issued its own announcements on its alignment with EU sanctions packages, without joining the EU HR/VP’s declarations. In the case of the 10th sanctions package, this “room for manoeuvre” was used in the Swiss Federal Council’s announcement to highlight that while the country was implementing the package, it also “introduce[d] a new means of safeguarding Swiss economic interests in specific cases”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For third countries, the alignment with EU sanctions depends both on a political evaluation of adopting the sanctions as a national foreign policy measure and on the political consequences of expressing public support for the EU’s sanctions regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;factors-influencing-third-countries-approaches-to-eu-sanctions&quot;&gt;Factors Influencing Third Countries’ Approaches to EU Sanctions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section examines the factors that third countries take into consideration when deciding whether to support sanctions regimes. This can offer valuable insights into the factors that can also determine the success of the EU’s sanctions communications towards third countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research for this paper demonstrates that the economic links between the third country and the sanctioned country play a key role. For countries with close economic ties to Russia, sanctions present high costs and incentives to bust sanctions and provide indirect access to the sanctioned economy. Countries that are more economically dependent on Russia could therefore have limited means to implement sanctions, especially where social and economic groups have vested financial interests in continuing trade with the sanctioned country and lobby against sanctions implementation. Similarly, countries close to Russia in a vulnerable financial situation may fear economic disruption from the implementation of sanctions. Furthermore, the geopolitical orientation of third countries can also influence their decision on whether to support sanctions regimes. Another approach has been to look at the role of commercial and other actors in third countries, as “sanctions imposed against a target can make trade more profitable for a third party, presenting commercial opportunities”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case of Georgia showcases the interplay of several elements of the factors described above. The country did not decide to adhere to the sanctions against Russia, but introduced certain restrictive measures, particularly in the financial sphere. For Georgia, Russia is the third-largest trade partner, and the EU’s share, while it is still the main trade partner, is decreasing. The circumvention challenge in Georgia is further complicated due to its trade with the Eurasian Economic Union, which is used by Russia to conceal the destination of trade flows. Furthermore, Georgia is economically benefiting from the inflow of Russian citizens and capital to the country. These factors, among others, contribute to Georgia’s complex approach to sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the efforts of the EU to incentivise third countries to join its sanctions policies and the considerations influencing third countries’ choice of whether to support sanctions, it is important to analyse the type of goals EU sanctions diplomacy can attempt to achieve. Returning to the challenge of tackling circumvention, another avenue is for the EU to incentivise third countries to commit to tackling evasion through their territory, without asking them to align themselves with the EU’s sanctions regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-eus-shifting-foreign-policy-and-strategic-communications&quot;&gt;The EU’s Shifting Foreign Policy and Strategic Communications&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the EU’s approach to foreign policy and strategic communications is fundamental for a more comprehensive study of the EU’s sanctions policy. The EU’s foreign policy has been analysed, to a limited extent, through the prism of discourse analysis, finding that its foreign policy and identity are articulated by referencing liberal values. Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union presents these as the values that the Union is meant to defend and further internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the role of the EU’s public diplomacy and strategic communications, it has been noted that while the European External Action Service (EEAS) should be key to helping “ethical Europe” grow, it should also provide a keen sense of strategic direction and interests. The EU has been described in the literature as a “normative power”, as it “was constructed on a normative basis, [which] predisposes it to act in a normative way in world politics”. However, the 2016 EU Global Strategy set out the “principled pragmatism” approach, which considers the combination of interests and values as a guiding principle of the EU’s external action. The focus on interests was reinforced in the 2022 EU Strategic Compass, in which Borrell stated that the EU has to learn lessons from recent crises, including “finally getting serious about threats to our strategic interests that we have been aware of but not always acted upon”. The shift in the EU’s strategic communications to interests is also in line with the view of Allan Rosas, who highlighted that “sanctions should not be seen as value imperialism … as the Union is taking them to pursue not only its values but also its interests”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-expert-perception-of-eu-sanctions-communications-on-the-values-interest-spectrum&quot;&gt;II. Expert Perception of EU Sanctions Communications on the Values-Interest Spectrum&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better understand the role of the EU’s sanctions communications as a foreign policy tool, the paper assesses them along the values-interests spectrum. To this purpose, the paper examined the speeches, interviews and other communications outputs of the EU sanctions envoy and the EU HR/VP from February to September 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysis of the communications led to identifying the most frequently used pairings of two words in communications outputs, or “collocations”. Using the statistical programme “r”, the analysis computed 395 collocations using the “quanteda.textstats” package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The programme identifies collocation candidates based on the co-occurrence of patterns of words. The programme takes out the most frequently used word fillers or “stop words”, including “of”, “to” and “but”, which therefore do not appear in the 395 collocations that were computed. Of those, 116 collocations occurred three or more times and 279 collocations occurred two times across the 23 texts analysed. To focus only on collocations that occur a significant number of times across the 23 texts, the paper does not consider the 279 collocations that occurred only twice in EU communications. This process led to the reduction of the number of collocations to 25 and four synonyms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next in the analysis, the collocations were to be categorised on the values-interest spectrum. Respondents completed the survey asking them to assign each collocation a score from 1 (values-based) to 7 (interest-based) based on their perception, reflecting the subjective judgement of each anonymous respondent. The responses were recorded anonymously and exported to Excel. The analysis used the rounded median of the responses to avoid the result being skewed by outliers. Table 1 shows the rounded median of the survey’s ratings and the number of times the collocation occurred in the 23 texts analysed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Most-Often Used Collocations in EU Sanctions Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a better understanding of where the collocations lie on the values-interest spectrum, the results are summarised in Figure 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/l2NVZzq.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Collocations on the Values-Interest Spectrum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 1 plots both the number and the occurrence of collocations in each of the seven categories along the values-interest spectrum, ranging from strongly values-based to strongly interest-based. The number of collocations (dots) shows how many of the terms were perceived to fall into each of the seven categories by the expert respondents to the survey. The occurrence of collocations falling into each category (bars) shows how many times the terms appeared across the analysed texts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 1 demonstrates that interest-based collocations occurred significantly more often (91 times in total, including both weakly and moderately interest-based collocations) than values-based terms (17 times in total, including both weakly and moderately values-based collocations) or terms that were perceived as neither values- nor interest-based (16 times). The 11 moderately interest-based collocations occurred 60 times across the 23 texts analysed, making them the most commonly occurring terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of analysis demonstrate that the EU’s strategic communications on sanctions strongly rely on interest-based terms. However, values and particularly the norms of international law also play a role in its communications – this is examined in more detail in Chapter III. Furthermore, the EU also employs terms that are neither values- not interest-based among the most-occurred terms in the analysed communications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-the-balance-between-values--and-interest-based-eu-communications-on-sanctions&quot;&gt;III. The Balance Between Values- and Interest-Based EU Communications on Sanctions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of the survey demonstrate the complexity of the EU’s sanctions diplomacy. While collocations that are perceived as interest-based by experts occur more often in quotes by O’Sullivan and Borrell, the use of values-based communication adds a nuance to the picture and raises the following questions. How are the collocations used in EU communications? How can they be interpreted in the context of the EU officials’ declarations? What do they divulge about the EU’s sanctions diplomacy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;preventing-circumvention-targeting-third-countries-interests&quot;&gt;Preventing Circumvention: Targeting Third Countries’ Interests&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collocations related to circumvention and evasion have a central importance in EU sanctions diplomacy, playing a particular role in conveying a message targeting the interests of third countries. The EU is warning third countries that allowing their territories to be used for circumvention could damage their economies. Conversely, third countries’ efforts to tackle circumvention are met with praise in EU communications, setting a clear expectation for third countries. The circumvention- and evasion-related collocations were perceived to be moderately interest-based by the expert respondents to the survey, further confirming the role of these expressions in appealing to the interests of both the EU and third countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Platform [for] circumvention” was a particularly often used expression, with 10 occurrences. It was used to point out a threat and underline how becoming a platform for circumvention would go against the interest of third countries. O’Sullivan underlined the importance of the reputational damage that ensues when a country is proven to be a platform for sanctions circumvention, noting that “it will have a chilling effect on the companies of other countries. They no longer want to work with a country that helps them circumvent sanctions”. This was a clear message to third countries, highlighting the fact that allowing for circumvention will damage their investment prospects. In Georgia, the government’s efforts were highlighted by O’Sullivan in June 2023, who noted that the “Georgian authorities are taking very seriously the issue of not allowing this country to be used as a platform for circumvention”, noting that the country has put in place export-controlling measures on the most sensitive battlefield products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Addressing the challenge of “platform [for] circumvention” was also used to describe the very focus of the mission of O’Sullivan, who declared that “cooperating and engaging in a dialogue with third countries that could be used as a platform for circumvention is vital”. The expression was also used when describing the expectation of EU sanctions diplomacy, with O’Sullivan declaring about third countries that “what they usually say is that they don’t want to align with EU sanctions, but at the same time they don’t wish to be a platform for circumvention or evasion of sanctions, and therefore they will cooperate with us in trying to prevent that”. However, there are differences between the expectations towards EU candidate countries and non-candidate countries, as demonstrated below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the expressions “circumvent sanctions” and “circumvention [of] sanctions” occurred exceptionally often in EU sanctions communications – in total, 13 times in the texts analysed – and those expressions were perceived as moderately interest-based. They fulfilled a similar role to the expression “platform [for] circumvention” in EU communications, warning of the negative impact of allowing circumvention, and praising efforts to tackle it. O’Sullivan focused on the former when he declared that “we are particularly concerned if there’s any circumvention of the sanctions on these [battlefield] products. This has led us to visit a range of countries in the last few months”. In Uzbekistan, for example, O’Sullivan used circumvention in the context of commending the country’s assurances on being against having its territory used for sanctions circumvention, while “respect[ing] Uzbekistan’s desire to remain neutral [in Russia’s war against Ukraine]”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two expressions linked to evasion, “sanction evasion” and “evade sanction”, occurred seven times in total, placing them among the most-often used collocations in the analysed texts. They were used in the same way as expressions mentioning circumvention, focusing on warning and praising third countries. O’Sullivan highlighted that “our legal powers now enable us to sanction an entity in a non-EU country that is aiding a European company to evade sanctions”. As a positive assessment, he underlined that, for Georgia, “there are various ways in which people can try to evade sanctions, whether that’s at customs points or false declarations. And the Georgian authorities have put in place, as I say very impressive measures of trying to monitor this and make sure that it doesn’t happen”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;beyond-tackling-circumvention-addressing-implementation-and-alignment&quot;&gt;Beyond Tackling Circumvention: Addressing Implementation and Alignment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EU communications addressed the options beyond tackling circumvention through third countries, including the questions of implementation, adoption and alignment on sanctions. These play an especially important role in the difference between the EU’s communications towards EU candidate countries and its communication towards other third countries. EU candidate countries are formally required to progressively align with the EU’s CFSP, which includes sanctions. A full alignment on sanctions needs to be reached prior to accession. This provides the EU with a tool to use regarding EU candidate countries to appeal to their political and economic interests in pursuing the EU accession process successfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EU sanctions communications used three key collocations to describe how far countries potentially could go in supporting EU sanctions. On one hand, these expressions offered a way to remind EU candidate countries of their commitments. On the other, they offered a way to demonstrate that in most third countries, the EU is not asking for alignment, but only for help in tackling circumvention. These can be seen as a “compromise offer” by the EU to non-candidate countries, highlighting that while it could ask for more efforts, it is accepting tackling circumvention as a commendable policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The terms used for communicating these interests are the weakly interest-based terms “implement sanctions”, along with its synonym “sanctions implementation” (among the most-used terms, occurred eight times) and “impose sanctions” (six times) and the moderately interest-based term “align sanctions” (four times).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking about his country visits, O’Sullivan highlighted that in the cases of EU candidate countries, “the context is always different of course in … Serbia and Türkiye … candidates for accession to the European Union, so there is actually potentially an obligation on them to align with our sanctions”. In the same statement, he also underlined that non-candidate countries, such as countries in central Asia or certain countries in the Caucasus, have no obligation to align with EU sanctions. This point was repeated by Borrell in September 2023, noting that “we expect our partner countries and, in particular those who aspire to become members, to align with our foreign policy decisions”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU’s relationship with candidate and potential candidate countries demonstrates that the issues of implementation, adoption and alignment on sanctions can be used to appeal to EU candidate countries’ interests on joining the EU. It also allows the EU to express disapproval of certain policies, including engaging with sanctioned entities. In September 2023, Borrell noted that the EU regretted the Georgian government’s decision to resume flights to and from Russia and allow sanctioned individuals to enter the country, highlighting that “these decisions go against EU’s policy and international efforts to isolate Russia internationally due to its illegal war”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;naming-the-war-stopping-russias-war-machine&quot;&gt;Naming the War: Stopping Russia’s War Machine&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU has countered Moscow’s continuous refusal to call the war in Ukraine by its name, referring to it as a “special military operation”, by clearly referencing “the war” and Russia’s “war machine” in its communications. The terms “war machine” and “invasion [of] Ukraine” were perceived as neither values- nor interest-based and are therefore seen as more descriptive expressions by the expert respondents to the survey. However, the importance of these terms is signalled by the number of times they occurred (“war machine” seven times and “invasion [of] Ukraine” six). They offer a clear way for the EU to steer third countries towards using the same framing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expression “war machine” was primarily used to describe the “Russian war machine” as a concept. It was employed to underline that most third countries do not wish to contribute to fuelling the Russian war machine, while remaining neutral in the conflict. In general, the aim of the EU’s restrictive measures is described in terms of “crippling Russia’s war machine”, targeting both the material and financial means of the Kremlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mentioning the “invasion [of] Ukraine” fulfilled a similar role in the EU’s sanctions diplomacy. While “war machine” was used in relation to the aim of sanctions, “invasion [of] Ukraine” was used in the context of describing the reason for the sanctions being put in place. O’Sullivan noted that the EU’s most important message is that “we oppose Russia’s invasion of Ukraine”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;appealing-to-values-the-role-of-international-law&quot;&gt;Appealing to Values: The Role of International Law&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the results of the analysis show that the EU predominantly communicated by addressing interests, its sanctions diplomacy also contains an important element of values-based communications, focusing primarily on international law. Three values-based collocations, “UN Charter”, “war crime” and “international law”, were used to appeal to the values of international law. These terms were used both to remind third countries of the importance of upholding these principles and to praise third countries’ cooperation by specifically referring to international law. By linking the cooperation on sanctions to international norms, the EU offers an opportunity for third countries to frame any support for tackling circumvention as a positive effort to strengthen the norms of international law. This can be an attractive framing for third countries that have close geopolitical or economic ties to Russia and might be reluctant to communicate cooperating on these measures explicitly as steps against Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Borrell noted that he “appreciated the ‘principled position of Kazakhstan based on respect for the UN Charter and the territorial integrity of all UN members, including Ukraine’”. He also highlighted that the EU is asking “all countries … to stand on the side of the principles and values of the UN charter and international law”. This demonstrates the EU’s expectation of third countries to support its sanctions efforts not only because it is in their economic interest, as the use of circumvention-related expressions shows above, but also because it is essential for upholding the norms and values of international law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underlining this approach, O’Sullivan summarised the EU’s message as “we believe that Putin’s actions are completely contrary to the UN charter, it is a war crime” and noted that “in the case of Russia, we are dealing with a particularly egregious breach of international law”. Similarly, Borrell noted that “what is happening in Ukraine is a blatant violation of the UN Charter and the international rules-based order”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Support Ukraine” and its synonym “Ukraine support” were perceived as the most strongly values-based terms among the 25 collocations analysed, with six occurrences in total. The term was primarily used to express that the EU is “supporting Ukraine, and we will support Ukraine for as long as it takes”, framing it as a goal of the EU’s sanctions policy, linking the support for the EU’s sanctions to supporting Ukraine. This can differ from the approach of highlighting international law, as it links the support for sanctions more explicitly to supporting Ukraine, not just international law in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EU strategic communications on sanctions rely heavily on addressing economic and political interests. As the results of the data-driven analysis show, the most-often occurring terms in EU communications are perceived to target political and economic interests. Only a minority of terms appeals to values, mostly related to international law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper’s use of data analytics and an expert survey on perceptions offer a unique contribution to the discussion on EU sanctions communications, allowing for a more structured analysis along the values-interest spectrum. This data-driven approach provides a more informed understanding of EU communications and formulates more targeted and evidence-based recommendations on how to improve EU sanctions diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper presents the following findings and recommendations to EU policymakers and diplomats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;1-eu-sanctions-communications-overwhelmingly-rely-on-appealing-to-interests&quot;&gt;1. EU sanctions communications overwhelmingly rely on appealing to interests.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU tends to frame support for tackling sanctions circumvention as an economic interest of third countries. It employs a “stick-and-carrot” approach – the stick is a warning to third countries of the potential negative economic consequences and reputational damage of allowing circumvention, which can lead to fewer investments, while the carrot is the EU’s praise of the efforts of third countries which pledge to tackle circumvention through their territory, which can help bolster their reputation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: The EU should hold third countries to their promises.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “carrot” of positive reputation through the EU’s praise can only be credible if the EU revises its communications consistently. As the EU can strengthen third countries’ reputations by praising their efforts, the EU also needs to withdraw its praise in public communications when third countries do not enact effective and enforceable policies. The EU needs to adapt this communication by expressing either continued praise if third countries indeed implement and enforce the announced anti-circumvention policies or change course and highlight shortcomings when the announced policies do not become reality or are not enforced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: The EU should not fear using its economic power to compel countries to tackle sanctions circumvention.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU needs to continue warning countries of the negative impact of allowing sanctions circumvention and use the designation of third country companies as a credible threat. The “stick” of warning third countries of the consequences of allowing circumvention only works if the negative impact is demonstrated credibly, including through the listing of third country companies that facilitate sanctions circumvention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;2-the-eu-communicates-different-expectations-for-eu-candidate-countries-and-other-third-countries&quot;&gt;2. The EU communicates different expectations for EU candidate countries and other third countries.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countries on the path to join the EU are formally required to progressively align with the EU’s CFSP, including sanctions, reaching full alignment prior to accession. This expectation is expressed in references to imposing, implementing and aligning with EU sanctions communications, which are among the most-often used terms. Non-candidate countries have no obligation to align with the EU’s sanctions regime, and consequently, the EU communicates their efforts to address circumvention as a sufficient policy step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: The EU should continue to use accession as a motivation for EU candidate countries to ensure they align with EU sanctions against Russia.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU should make more explicit reference to the accession process in its communications to make EU candidate countries move forward with their alignment on sanctions against Russia. The communications around accession negotiations and other meetings of EU officials with EU candidate countries should be used as a platform to remind EU candidate countries of the clear incentive to adopt EU sanctions and signal their commitment to the accession process. This needs to be highlighted in public communications in the candidate countries, informing the public of this requirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;3-the-eu-uses-the-referencing-of-russias-invasion-of-ukraine-in-eu-sanctions-diplomacy-as-a-tool-to-counter-russias-narrative-in-third-countries&quot;&gt;3. The EU uses the referencing of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in EU sanctions diplomacy as a tool to counter Russia’s narrative in third countries.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU uses the referencing of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in neither a values-based nor interest-based manner. However, it can serve as a tool to counter Russian narratives in third countries which have a high degree of political and economic ties to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: The EU should continue to use all available forums to counter Russia’s narratives, including press conferences and other public statements from the EU sanctions envoy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU sanctions envoy regularly visits countries with different degrees of ties to Russia, where the EU’s messages might not get the desired visibility. These visits can offer an opportunity to highlight the EU’s narrative and counter Russia’s disinformation. By giving interviews and being featured in the press, EU officials can create more visibility for the EU’s narratives in third countries, therefore the EU sanctions envoy and other officials should use all channels at their disposal to engage with the media during their in-country visits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;4-while-values-play-a-less-important-role-than-interests-in-the-eus-sanctions-communications-the-communications-employ-a-valuable-framing-tool-related-to-international-law&quot;&gt;4. While values play a less important role than interests in the EU’s sanctions communications, the communications employ a valuable framing tool related to international law.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU addresses values mainly by referring to international law and linking the support for sanctions to strengthening these values. The EU HR/VP has explicitly commended the “principled position of Kazakhstan based on respect for the UN Charter” and, in this context, acknowledged Kazakhstan’s “efforts to ensure its territory is not used to circumvent European and international sanctions against Russia”, which demonstrates the impact of values in EU strategic communications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: The EU should continue to use the values of international law in its strategic communications, which would help third countries to frame their efforts against circumvention.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU should reinforce its focus on the values of the UN Charter as it can offer an opportunity to third countries to frame their anti-circumvention policies as a contribution to upholding the principles of international law. This could be especially useful in third countries that have close geopolitical or economic ties with Russia. In these countries, a framing referring to strengthening international law might be more attractive than a more explicit framing of anti-circumvention policies as measures directed against Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;5-eu-sanctions-communications-could-explore-an-environmental-framing&quot;&gt;5. EU sanctions communications could explore an environmental framing.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are certain dimensions that were not addressed in EU strategic sanctions communications analysed for this paper, including Russia’s “shadow fleet”, mostly made up of uninsured old ships that transport oil to evade the oil price cap. The shadow fleet therefore presents a real environmental threat that could affect any of the littoral countries along the fleet’s routes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: The EU should explore referencing the environmental threat posed by Russia’s sanctions circumvention by sea in its strategic communications.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would offer another incentive for third countries to support the EU’s sanctions efforts by tackling circumvention. Similar to the values of international law, environmental framing would allow third countries to frame their efforts to collaborate on tackling sanctions circumvention as a response to environmental concerns, rather than a measure directed more explicitly against Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（3日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第87日審訊。控方打算繼續播放黎智英在《國安法》生效之前的受訪片段，惟辯方指黎身體不適，明顯可見正在「打冷顫」，又指昨晚黎見了醫生，惟只獲處方止痛藥。法官杜麗冰提議安排黎送院接受檢查，並且今天不應在黎缺席下續審，遂押後至明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;甫開庭，代表黎智英的資深大律師彭耀鴻表示不幸地有一個壞消息要報告法庭，因黎智英身體不適，現時明顯地可見被告欄內的他正在「打冷顫」，又指昨晚黎見了醫生，惟只獲處方止痛藥（Panadol）。庭上所見，黎能夠自行步入及步出被告欄，他今天身穿啡色大褸上庭，而非平日所穿的普通外套。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰聽罷指，黎需要送院接受進一步身體檢查，不認為今天的審訊要在黎不在場下繼續，又表示理解黎有相當年紀及最近天氣不佳。杜官指示辯方律師在今日下午4時再了解情況及醫生意見，並且通知法庭。控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行則表示會與懲教人員和警方溝通以作出安排。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎一度在被告欄內與律師團隊溝通，其後彭耀鴻向法官轉述黎智英擔心自己浪費在座所有人的時間。法官杜麗冰則稱沒有問題，最重要是黎在感到舒服的情況下才能繼續審訊，最終押後案件至明日不早於上午11時續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overnight on 30 May, media reporting claimed that US President Joe Biden had apparently relaxed restrictions on the use of US weapons against targets in Russia. This followed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky voicing his frustration at the continued existence of such limitations. The issue has been given extra relevance by Russian forces based in Belgorod launching a new operation around Kharkiv, and has been taken up by the NATO Secretary-General and the NATO Parliamentary Assembly. Journalists and analysts have been left to parse the meaning and phrasing of every (ambiguous) sentence uttered by Western politicians on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;current-ukrainian-operations-and-existing-constraints&quot;&gt;Current Ukrainian Operations and Existing Constraints&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The start point, on which everyone seems to be in agreement, is that it is both legitimate and legal for Ukraine to attack military targets on Russian territory. It is defending itself against a Russian attack and can respond under Article 51 of the UN Charter, having been engaged in an International Armed Conflict since 2014. Provided it acts in accordance with International Humanitarian Law, it has a wide range of targets from which to choose, including oil and fuel production facilities which, while they may have a civilian function, are also contributing to the Russian war machine – so-called “dual use facilities”. Added to this would be the airbases for long-range Russian bombers that have been launching strikes against Ukrainian infrastructure and other civilian targets; military production facilities; ammunition dumps and storage facilities for other materiel; and a variety of military bases including the Russian ports for the Black Sea Fleet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The suggestion of caveats first appeared with the provision of sophisticated and mostly longer-range weapons that arrived in mid-2022 and early 2023, from multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) like the US HIMARS and UK M270, to cruise missiles like the UK Storm Shadow and French SCALP. Biden stated at the time that HIMARS would not be used against targets in Russia, and it later emerged that technical alterations had been made to ensure this was not possible. Meanwhile, UK statements on the use of Storm Shadow heavily emphasised its use inside Ukraine (including areas illegally annexed by Russia, like Crimea), mirroring apparent restrictions on the use of UK M270. The overriding concern in these early debates was the risk of escalation involved in any Russian response to the provision of more sophisticated and more threatening weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Removing restrictions on HIMARS and other MLRS systems, as well as Ukrainian artillery firing Western-supplied ammunition, would allow Ukraine to strike massing Russian forces and conduct counter-battery fire against artillery situated just over the border&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That debate continues to rage, with the benefit of two years’ observations on Russian rhetoric and actions, including strikes against Ukrainian civilian targets and growing suggestions of a Russian sabotage campaign inside Europe. But alongside the serious consideration of managing this escalation (or calling Russia’s bluff) should be a discussion on the military utility of – and possible targets for – such weapons. Ukraine is already running a deep strike campaign using drones against a range of targets, occasionally hitting Moscow itself, but more frequently striking refineries and production facilities. These attacks reduce supplies going directly to Russian forces, and also cut revenue used to fund the war. In addition, a campaign against bomber airfields has destroyed both long-range bombers and smaller fighter-bombers. Some of these attacks have used drones and have taken place at extreme ranges of over 1,000 miles, but there also appears to be an element of infiltration and ground sabotage against bases and rail links, including some over 3,000 miles from Ukraine. Finally, Ukraine’s use of both air and maritime drones against the Black Sea Fleet has sunk a number of ships and even threatened the port at Novorossiysk. What, then, would other weapons add?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-value-of-deep-strike&quot;&gt;The Value of Deep Strike&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is that the types of targets and the defences around them work against the drone programme. First, the drones used by Ukraine tend to be slow and have limited payloads. They use sheer numbers to get through to targets, and although they have very long ranges – it can be hard, especially in the face of Russian air defences – to get sufficient numbers through to cause major and long-lasting damage, especially against hardened targets or those under cover. Flight time can vary, but for long-distance targets is sufficient to give the Russians early warning, which necessitates Ukrainian mass or much closer (and riskier) infiltration operations. For the long-distance and relatively predictable targets, this may be enough, but Ukraine needs firepower that it can bring to bear rapidly and with little warning. This is where ATACMS – with multiple variants – comes into play, and it could provide a valuable weapon for striking airbases hosting both fighter-bombers and attack helicopters, as well as rear-area logistics and ammunition dumps. Depending on which variants have been provided, both cluster and unitary warheads have ranges of up to 190 miles, providing a threat to static locations, such as in Belgorod, Voronezh, Kursk and maybe even Lipetsk oblasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Longer-range air defence systems could also play a role, albeit with some significant risks involved. Russian bombers mostly launch their cruise missiles within Russian airspace, so the launching aircraft are outside the ranges of systems like IRIS-T (15 miles) or point defence like Starstreak (5 miles). The same is true of some aircraft launching glide bombs, which are currently being used to devastating effect both on civilian areas and Ukrainian forces on the front line. Some can be released from 25 miles away; in the north this can be done from Russia. They are almost impossible to intercept, and this can only be achieved at great cost with expensive missiles used for multiple incoming bombs. Ideally, launch aircraft would be caught on the ground, but as a fallback, a surface-to-air missile (SAM) system like Patriot – with a range of around 100 miles (depending on the target) – could be pushed closer to the front line to shoot down Russian aircraft before release. So-called “SAMbushes” involve removing launchers from around infrastructure and putting them at greater risk of attack, but pose a challenge to Russian aircraft which currently fire from airspace where they believe themselves to be safe. There is some doubt over the extent to which this represents a “strike” on Russian “territory”, but media reporting suggests there has been disquiet over the use of German systems, which at least indicates the expectation of some kind of existing constraint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new development which raises the question of a potentially unintended constraint being rendered nonsensical by changes on the ground is the Russian assault towards Kharkiv and the massing of forces over the border from Sumy. Up until now, the “close” fight has largely been conducted unambiguously on Ukrainian territory. In the case of Kharkiv, the proximity to the border means that Russian assault forces have been able to mass and assemble inside Belgorod, and artillery fire from within Russia can reach Ukrainian forces along the front. Removing restrictions on “standard” HIMARS and other MLRS systems, as well as standard Ukrainian tube artillery firing Western-supplied 152mm and 155mm ammunition, would allow the Ukrainians to at least strike massing Russian forces and conduct counter-battery fire against artillery situated just over the border. In the case of HIMARS it would allow the Ukrainians to out-range the equivalent Russian guns (although reporting has indicated there is effective Russian interference with guided projectiles).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The lesson of the past 18 months is that the deep battle complements fighting close-in and along the front line, but is not a substitute for it&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps surprising by their absence from this priority list are the Storm Shadow and SCALP missiles. While these would be useful for arms dumps, command locations and logistics targets with protection against drones, their (publicly-acknowledged) range of around 160 miles means that the launch point for the Ukrainian aircraft carrying them comes uncomfortably close to Russian air defences if the target is deep within Russia. For this reason, both have been used on targets much closer to the front line, including in and around Crimea. The provision of German Taurus, with a slightly larger warhead and a range up around 300 miles, could make striking deeper targets in Russia much more feasible, or bring additional firepower to bear on targets further south around Crimea, including the Kerch Bridge, where Russian air defences have already been degraded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;keeping-the-russians-guessing&quot;&gt;Keeping the Russians Guessing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth concluding with an acknowledgement of the military benefits of ambiguity and what a change in policy would not achieve. The public Western position around the use of such weapons has been hugely variable; UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron, for example, did not explicitly say UK-supplied weapons could be used in Russia, and many of the recent statements of support have been generic. Beyond the question of escalation management, it would be prudent to keep Russia guessing about what sophisticated weapons may or may not be used against its forces, because this poses dilemmas about what mix of air defence systems to deploy and what level of dispersal or early-warning systems may be necessary. We can assume that Storm Shadow (for example) has not yet been fired against a Russian target as no components have emerged from debris, but the potential exists if the right tone is struck. It may also be the case that, behind the scenes, some constraints have already been lifted. At sea, the UK has retrospectively claimed credit for the use of maritime drones against the Black Sea Fleet. Given the UK’s role, alongside others, in providing support to Ukrainian drone programmes, it is possible that a number of countries have already provided components for weapons that have struck Russian targets. The ambiguity over this support not only evades questions of escalation, but also provides few clues for Russia that would allow it to prepare countermeasures until after such weapons can be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;larger-challenges-remain&quot;&gt;Larger Challenges Remain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, caution should be taken not to see a change in policy as a panacea for Ukraine’s current challenges. The successful campaign against Russian energy infrastructure has not forced Russia to reassess its campaign overall. The long-range bomber force has had to disperse and has reduced its strike capabilities, but has not ended attacks on civilian infrastructure. The decimation of the Black Sea Fleet has reopened exports from Odesa, but made little contribution to the ability of 2023’s counteroffensive to retake lost territory. And strikes on arms dumps behind the front lines and sabotage within Russia have reduced the flow of materiel going to the Russian army, but not to the extent that it has had to fall back. The lesson of the past 18 months is that the deep battle complements fighting close-in and along the front line, but is not a substitute for it. Striking forces across the border from Kharkiv will provide some immediate relief to Ukrainian forces and be of significant tactical benefit; in doctrinal terms, this is a “close battle” that happens to straddle the border with Russia. Overall, the challenges for Ukraine in 2024 and potential answers remain the same as before this decision: resupply of equipment and ammunition, recruitment and training of personnel, and effective defences to prevent or slow down Russian ground advances. Deep strike is not a silver bullet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名組織及參與初選的民主派，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16名不認罪被告中，劉偉聰、李予信2人罪名不成立，其餘14人則罪名成立。本案指控被告串謀以「非法手段」，取得立法會過半議席後無差別否決財政預算案，迫使特首解散立法會及辭職。辯方提出多項法律爭議，包括控罪中的「非法手段」應僅限於武力相關及刑事罪行，又認為被告否決預算案不構成濫權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官於長達337頁的判詞一一反駁，指《國安法》目的是防範及制止危害國安罪行，而立法會運作可被武力以外的手段癱瘓，例如網絡攻擊立會系統、生化或放射性物質攻擊議員，批評辯方狹窄詮釋會造成法律漏洞，是「荒謬、不合邏輯且有違《國安法》的目的」。法官亦認為，「非法手段」不限於刑事罪行，亦可涵蓋「違憲」行為。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官續指，立法會議員集體肩負憲制責任，需據預算案利弊作審核和通過，雖然立法會不應「自動及機械式地」通過政府議案，但大多數議員蓄意無差別否決預算案，明顯是違反《基本法》下的議員職權；而議員藉此迫政府回應五大訴求，亦違反擁護《基本法》的規定，構成濫權。法官又指，控方指控被告無差別否決預算案造成的「憲制危機」，令政府不能推出新政策等，必然構成「嚴重干擾、阻撓、破壞香港特別行政區政權機關依法履行職能」，足以構成「顛覆國家政權」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，辯方曾爭議被告案發時相信「35+」不可能，惟法庭認為只屬「事實上不可能」，而非「法律上不可能」，該罪行客觀上不可能成功，不構成辯護理由。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方於本案指稱各被告達成協議參與一項謀劃，即串謀取得立會過半後，無差別否決預算案，迫使特首解散立法會及辭職。控方指控，被告違反《國安法》第22條，任何人組織、策劃、實施或參與實施「以武力、威脅使用武力或者其他非法手段」旨在顛覆國家政權行為，即屬犯罪，當中第3項「嚴重干擾、阻撓或破壞香港特區政權機關依法履行職能」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官拒納非法手段僅限武力-稱非武力可癱立會詮釋致法律漏洞&quot;&gt;官拒納「非法手段」僅限武力 稱非武力可癱立會、詮釋致法律漏洞&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「非法手段」的定義，辯方爭議，根據「同類原則（Ejusdem Generis）」，控罪中的「非法手段」，應限於「使用武力或威脅使用武力」的非法手段，惟法庭不接納。法庭指，《國安法》首要目的是維護國家安全，而根據全國人大常委2020年5月22日作出的「說明」，鼓吹港獨自決、侮辱國旗國徽、煽動公衆仇恨、及癱瘓政府管治和立法會運作等「非暴力」行為，均可令國家安全受到破壞，《國安法》正是在此背景下制定；而全國人大5月28日通過制定《國安法》的「決定」，也指出要防範、制止及懲治「任何」分裂國家、顛覆國家政權等嚴重危害國安的行為和活動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法庭認為，5.22說明和5.28決定提及「任何」活動，非單指武力相關的活動，因此辯方將「非法手段」狹義詮釋為限制於武力相關，是「荒謬、不合邏輯且有違《國安法》的目的」。法庭指，不難預計，立法會運作可被「武力或威脅使用武力」以外不同方式、形式或方法癱瘓，例如針對資訊科技、通訊和能源系統的網絡攻擊，能令立法會完全停止運作；立法會議員和職員，也可受到生化或放射性物質的攻擊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法庭又指，若就「非法手段」採用狹義詮釋，則以非暴力手段如放火、放毒氣及散播病原體等攻擊政府設施，即使與武力手段造成同等後果，甚至更為嚴重，在《國安法》下也不會被懲治。辯方曾稱可以恐怖活動罪處理，惟法庭指兩者目的非常不同，除非將「非法手段」的意思擴至「極限」（breaking point），否則辯方詮釋會造成法律漏洞（lacuna）及荒謬，會過份地限制《國安法》的範圍，亦因此減低其用作維護國安的有效性，有違立法目的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官拒納非法手段僅限刑事罪行-稱可涵蓋違憲行為&quot;&gt;官拒納「非法手段」僅限刑事罪行 稱可涵蓋違憲行為&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方亦爭議，「非法手段」應限於刑事罪行，否則會令《國安法》22條範圍過於廣泛和有欠肯定。法庭同樣不接納，認為此詮釋同樣有違《國安法》立法目的。法庭指，立法會運作能被不屬刑事罪行的手段癱瘓，亦「不能想像任何旨在顛覆國家政權的行為或活動，不論其形式及方法，可被視為可接受和可容忍」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法庭又指，如條文僅限於指刑事罪行，全國人大立法時可列明「刑事手段（criminal means）」，惟最終使用較一般（generic）的字眼，明顯與辯方陳詞相反，指辯方解讀不僅令第22條過份複雜、甚至多餘，亦是要求控方在罪行中證明罪行（prove a crime with a crime），嚴重減低第22條防範和制止危害國安罪行的有效性。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法庭續指，《國安法》中出現了5次「非法」字眼，認為「非法」一詞足夠廣闊，可涵蓋違反憲法（unconstitutional）、違反法律的行為，或其他不跟隨正當程序（not following the proper procedure）而屬一般意義上「非法」的行為；但若採用辯方解讀，則會導致「非法」在《國安法》條文內有不同意思，令條文內部不一致。考慮到《國安法》目的是建立健全維護國安的法律制度和執行機制，及防範顛覆國家政權，因此「非法手段」不限於刑事行為及刑事罪行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於民事過失是否足以構成非法手段，法庭認為無需就此事表達肯定意見，指在本案中，法庭只須指出違反《基本法》是否足以構成非法手段。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官毋須證被告知手段屬非法&quot;&gt;官：毋須證被告知手段屬「非法」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於辯方爭議，被告或真誠誤信戴耀廷提倡的手段屬合法，控方須證明被告知悉行為屬非法。法庭也不接納，認為條文中的「非法」只是形容罪行中的犯罪行為（actus reus），而非犯罪意圖（mens rea），就如與13歲以下女童發生性行為罪行，亦無須證明被告案發時知道其行為是非法，否則被告可基於對法律的無知提出辯解。法庭認為，控方無須證明被告知道有關手段屬「非法手段」，但須證明被告作出行為時具意圖「顛覆國家政權」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官嚴重干擾破壞政權機關履行職能-足構成顛覆國家政權&quot;&gt;官：嚴重干擾破壞政權機關履行職能 足構成「顛覆國家政權」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;針對控罪提及「旨在顛覆國家政權」，辯方爭議，「顛覆國家政權」沒有清晰定義。法庭認為應按立法目的詮釋，將《辭海》中「政權」的定義，以及《釋義及通則條例》和《基本法》中就「國家」和「權、權力」的定義，應用在《國安法》，認為「國家政權」意指特區政府的各種權力，及政府不同組織例如政府部門所履行的職能。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「顛覆」，法庭援引《辭海》及《牛津英語辭典》，當中「顛覆」指「顛倒，倒翻，傾敗」、「干擾（disturb）或推翻（overthrow）」、「弱化或破壞（weakening or destruction）」國家或政府等。法庭又引5.22說明，提到各樣針對政府的敵對行為，令香港國安風險「日益突顯」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法庭認為，考慮到「顛覆」的通常及字面涵義、導致《國安法》制定的社會背景，以及法庭對「國家政權」的理解，認為《國安法》第22條所指「嚴重干擾、阻撓、破壞香港特別行政區政權機關依法履行職能」的行為，足以構成「顛覆國家政權」的行為；而意圖作出相關行為的人，亦必然意圖顛覆國家政權，形容《國安法》第22條是一條「自我定義（self-defining）」的條文，意味意圖干犯條文下行為的人，便會構成顛覆。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官無差別否決迫政府回應五大訴求-明顯違基本法構成濫權&quot;&gt;官：無差別否決迫政府回應五大訴求 明顯違《基本法》、構成濫權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法庭就「非法手段」及「顛覆國家政權」的定義作出了其詮釋，那到底被告本案被指無差別否決預算案、濫用《基本法》第73條下的議員職權，是否構成「非法手段」、「顛覆國家政權」？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據《基本法》第73條，立法會職權為「根據政府的提案，審核、通過財政預算」。法庭指根據《基本法》第48條、62條及73條，是由政府編制財政預算案，立法會審核，再由行政長官簽署後報中央人民政府備案。法庭認為，立法會議員「顯然集體肩負憲制責任，在需要時依據財政預算案的利弊，對之審核和通過」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法庭續指，雖然立法會不被期望亦不應「自動及機械式地」通過政府提出的議案，但大多數議員蓄意拒絕按預算案的內容與利弊作審核，明顯是違反《基本法》第73條及《國安法》第3條；而如大多數議員計劃無差別否決預算案，以迫使政府答應他們的政治議程，那便會構成濫權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就辯方爭議被告擁有議會特權，法庭不認為適用於本案，指控方是指控被告在當選立法會議員前已達成協議，他們並未享有任何特權；而被告行為違反《基本法》，議會特權明顯不會涵蓋這些公開表明意圖違反憲制責任的立法會議員。法庭又強調，無論如何，議會特權並非絕對特權，又指《國安法》第3條賦予行政、立法及司法機關責任防範、制止和懲治危害國安行為，「有見及此，法庭看不出審訊一宗如本案，即涉及顛覆國家政權指控的案件時，為何不能審視背後的動機或意圖」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官2021年釋義修訂助本案詮釋何謂濫權&quot;&gt;官：2021年《釋義》修訂助本案詮釋何謂「濫權」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法庭又指，《基本法》第104條要求立法會議員必須宣誓擁護《基本法》，以及宣誓效忠香港特區。雖然政府在2021年5月才於《釋義及通則條例》新增第3AA條，列明「不屬」擁護《基本法》及效忠香港特區的行為，包括「無差別地反對特區政府提出的議案」，意圖要脅或推翻政府等，但法庭認為修例並非新增法例，只是令現行條文更加清晰、鞏固和更清楚解釋以往原則，法庭認為該條文對於本案詮釋什麼構成「濫權」提供了支持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法庭續指，因此無差別否決政府提出的預算案或公共開支，以迫使政府回應五大訴求，一直（all along）都違反《基本法》第73條和104條內擁護《基本法》的規定，「若此等行為具有嚴重破壞政府或行政長官權力和權威的意圖，更不在話下」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官無差別否決必嚴重破壞政權機關履行職能&quot;&gt;官：無差別否決必嚴重破壞政權機關履行職能&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就被告被控的串謀罪，法官指，控方須證明被告同意與至少一名共謀者，串謀作出一連串行為，並干犯《國安法》第22條的罪行；而本案所指的行為，就是在2020年立法會選舉取得立會過半，無差別否決預算案，以迫使特首回應五大訴求，特首若拒絕就須解散立法會，並須按《基本法》的機制辭職。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而法庭認為，被告懷涉案犯罪意圖，無差別否決預算案，造成控方指控的「憲制危機」，以迫使特首回應五大訴求，是必然導致「嚴重干擾、阻撓、破壞香港特別行政區政權機關依法履行職能」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官續解釋，就辯方根據《基本法》第50至52條，爭議立法會否決預算案後，特首仍可申請臨時撥款、政府亦可再提出另一個預算案；法官認為若被告協議不按預算案優劣否決，迫使政府回應五大訴求，則不可能批准臨時撥款申請，亦會不顧議案優劣否決第二份預算案。至於特首在立法會被解散時，可按上一財政年度的開支標準批准臨時短期撥款，法官指這代表政府不能推出任何新政策或為改善人民生活增加開支，會嚴重破壞或阻撓特區政權機關履行職能。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官35不可能非辯護理由&quot;&gt;官：35+不可能非辯護理由&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法庭續指，辯方曾爭議被告案發時相信「35+」不可能，因政府或DQ民主派，或未能在功能組別取得足夠議席，惟法庭認為，此議題只是「事實上不可能」（factual impossibility），而非「法律上不可能」（legal impossibility），考慮到控罪的所有元素，該罪行客觀上不可能成功，不會構成辯護理由，該串謀仍可被納入罪行。不過法庭補充，控方除了須證明被告有意無差別否決，亦要證明他們有意顛覆國家政權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/xkJvwuJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名組織及參與初選的民主派，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16名不認罪被告中，劉偉聰、李予信2人罪名不成立，其餘14人則罪名成立。就本案事實爭議，法官裁定，戴耀廷是「35+計劃」大腦及主要推手，首先提出立會過半的構想，並提倡運用否決權作手段，迫使特首對五大訴求讓步，若不回應就須辭職；惟法官指，五大訴求實際上不可能，戴終極目標是推翻現行政治制度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，公民黨最初未有決定，但其後改變立場，於3月召記招表明否決所有政府議案，涉案串謀協議最早於2020年3月已存在；其後戴繼續游說協調會議參與者跟隨其理念和目標，並向所有人發協議文件，聲明運用否決權。法官指，所有協調會議參與者均清楚知道計劃目標，而曾對否決權有保留的社民連、民主黨其後也改變立場，在初選提名期結束前，運用否決權已成絕大部分參選人達成的共識。至戴耀廷稱毋須簽協議後，鄒家成等人發起的「墨落無悔」聲明，進一步證明各區已就運用否決權達成協議，並加強參選人基本決心，以宣揚戴的目標。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被指以非法手段犯案-1&quot;&gt;被指以「非法手段」犯案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、陳仲衡、李運騰頒下的337頁判詞，主要處理法律爭議、整體案情、及各被告案情，本文處理整體案情一部分。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方於本案指稱各被告達成協議參與一項謀劃，即串謀取得立會過半後，無差別否決預算案，迫使特首解散立法會及辭職，違反《國安法》第22條顛覆國家政權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;判詞指，就本案的事實裁定，關乎案發時是否有控方指稱的串謀協議存在；以及如有，被告對謀劃是否知情、是否謀劃一分子，及有否意圖顛覆國家政權，並以該意圖參與謀劃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官戴耀廷首先構想爭立會過半&quot;&gt;官：戴耀廷首先構想爭立會過半&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就串謀的起始，法官指無爭議在立法會贏取過半數議席的構想，是源於戴耀廷。他2019年12月在《蘋果日報》發表〈立會奪半、走向真普選重要一步〉一文，其想法引起泛民主派的注意；而2019年區選大勝後，民主派開始探討2020年立會選舉取得過半數議席的方法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;判詞指，2020年1月數名民主派人物的飯局，探討設立協調機制以免浪費選票，戴較堅持舉行初選，構想出「35+計劃」，戴會上亦提及否決預算案和製造「大殺傷力憲制武器」。戴耀廷與區諾軒其後一同籌備計劃，會見不同政黨和人士，判詞形容計劃有兩名組織者，戴作為大腦，區負責協調聯絡。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官協議最早於2020年3月存在&quot;&gt;官：協議最早於2020年3月存在&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;判詞指，二人先與公民黨會面，該黨當時尚有猶豫，但於3月25日的記者會完全改變取態，時任黨魁楊岳橋稱若特首不回應五大訴求，「以後每一個法案、財政撥款申請、財委會撥款申請，我哋都會否決，呢個亦都係一個莊嚴嘅承諾」，又指望達成35+，一同否決預算案。法官認為毫無疑問，至少楊岳橋、或譚文豪、郭家麒當天已成為協議一分子，涉案協議最早於2020年3月已存在，否則就是同年6月9日的初選記者會開始。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官35計劃終極目標推翻現行政治制度&quot;&gt;官：「35+計劃」終極目標推翻現行政治制度&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官續指，戴發表多篇文章宣傳「35+計劃」、及行使否決權作為手段迫使特首對五大訴求讓步，包括〈立會過半是大殺傷力憲制武器〉及〈真攬炒十步 這是香港宿命〉。2020年3及4月時，「35+計劃」的終極目標和用意已非常清晰，戴亦已向公眾表明，就是要利用涉案謀劃破壞、摧毀或推翻香港特區根據《基本法》和「一國兩制」原則，所建立的現行政治制度及體制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官爭立會過半只是手段非目標&quot;&gt;官：爭立會過半只是手段非目標&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官續指，控方證人區諾軒強調辦初選初心只是爭取立會過半，而「攬炒」則是否決預算案致政府停擺，惟法官不接納，認為基於戴耀廷清楚表明的終極目標，區會知道「35+計劃」就是第一步（starting point），會引起連鎖反應。法官又指，爭取立會過半「只是手段，不是目標」，而區一直知道戴「35+計劃」的目標，不單是取得立會過半。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官運用否決權成絕大部分人共識&quot;&gt;官：運用否決權成絕大部分人共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就涉案協議是否存在，控方於本案依賴協調會議及不同文件舉證。法官指，戴出席了所有協調會議，「的確是『35+計劃』的大腦和主要推手」，並信納戴耀廷曾向所有協調會議參與者發放有關「35+計劃」文件，當中列明只有認同五大訴求的人能參與。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又指，無爭議各區協調會議後，共有4個項目達成共識，包括辦初選、辦選舉論壇、目標議席數目及替補機制；而它們全屬正式選舉前的實際流程安排、「非政治性」，與如何達成「五大訴求，缺一不可」無甚關係，純粹是盡量增加民主派立會議員數目的機制、與上述「手段」相關。雖然當中不包括「運用否決權」，但法官認為協調過程絕非止於協調會議；又肯定「目標」應是戴耀廷和參與者關心的更重要議題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官續指，戴耀廷當然知道不是所有人認同否決預算案，但他繼續努力推廣對他至為重要的理念，毫無疑問，在所有協調會議結束直至提名期完結前，除少數仍有保留及無參與初選的人士外，「運用否決權」已成為絕大部分（vast majority）參選人達成的共識。雖然部分政黨如社民連和民主黨曾表達保留或反對，但他們不知何故（somehow）決定改變立場，戴耀廷亦繼續游說參與者跟隨他的理念和目標。根據所有 WhatsApp 訊息，沒有被告曾明確反對運用否決權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官信戴曾向所有人發協議聲明運用否決權&quot;&gt;官：信戴曾向所有人發協議、聲明運用否決權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就協調機制文件，雖然除施德來外的作供被告均稱無收過，但法官指，考慮到戴耀廷曾索取所有協調會議參與者的電話號碼，無理由該文件不會被派發，信納戴在每次會議後均準備摘要並向所有參與者發放。法官又指，在所有由戴製備的協調機制文件中，均清楚說明初選的作用及目的，參與者聲明一旦當選，會「積極運用」或會「運用」《基本法》賦予立法會的權力否決預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官墨落無悔顯示已達協議否決加強參選人決心&quot;&gt;官：「墨落無悔」顯示已達協議否決、加強參選人決心&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官續指，6月9日初選記者會前，戴耀廷曾向所有組織者發訊息，指經過3個月的協調，泛民主派終於達成協議；而戴在當天記者會宣布不要求參選人簽署協議，因不想製造更多人被DQ的風險。法官認為，若協調會議只就上述4項達成共識，看不出有任何理由足以成為DQ的風險。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官續指，當戴聲明不要求簽署協議時，鄒家成、梁晃維及張可森決定製作「非官方」協議，肯定組織者的決定令較進取的參與人，即使不至於不滿和憤怒，也難免失望。誠如鄒家成所稱，其財政資源緊絀，沒有主流政黨支援，對他來說，抗爭意志及初選敗選者承諾不參選正式選舉，至為重要，法庭肯定上述3人發起「墨落無悔」聲明起源於此。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又指，聲明內容與各區最終協議相似，無疑是對戴稱毋須簽聲明的回應；而3人曾受訪稱對戴決定失望，若協調會議無就運用否決權達成共識，懷疑3人不會有如此大反應。法官又指，其他被告其後簽署聲明，更進一步支持所有選區已就運用否決權達成協議，而「墨落無悔」與協調協議互相補足，前者是附加機制（additional mechanism），進一步加強參選人宣揚戴耀廷目標的基本決心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官所有參與者均清楚知道計劃目標&quot;&gt;官：所有參與者均清楚知道計劃目標&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就所有參選被告均提交的提名表格，法官指，戴耀廷非常小心，提名表格僅列出「我確認支持和認同由戴耀廷及區諾軒主導之協調會議共識，包括『民主派35+公民投票計劃』及其目標」。區諾軒曾稱如有人問及「目標」是什麼，會答是共同綱領，但無人問及，法官認為，所有協調會議參與者均清楚知道（knew perfectly well）計劃目標是什麼。按金收據同樣列明，如違反共識將不發還按金，法官指，可見組織者強調除非該人同意他們的意圖和理念，否則不應前來。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官續指，透過參與協調會議、聽戴耀廷說話、收到協調文件、簽署「墨落無悔」和提名表格，所有參與者均知道運用否決權及其目標，所有參與者均成為謀劃的一分子。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官戴國安法後稱參選人達協議否決共謀者原則適用&quot;&gt;官：戴《國安法》後稱參選人達協議否決、「共謀者原則」適用&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官續指，《國安法》生效後，戴在2020年7月的記者會上提到，「35+計劃」其中一個目標是取得立會過半，運用權力否決預算案，亦提到解散立法會。而在初選後的7月13日記招，戴指參選人將遵守已達成的協議，及承諾運用權力否決預算案；翌日再發帖稱參選人已在協調會議達成否決預算案的協議。法庭認為，「共謀者原則」適用，戴所說的話可用來指證所有被告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官五大訴求實際上不可能&quot;&gt;官：五大訴求實際上不可能&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;立法會正式選舉最終因疫情延期，法官指若「35+計劃」得以進行，被告意圖造成的後果，是迫使特首對五大訴求讓步，若不回應就得辭職。法官認為不應忽視的是，口號不只是「五大訴求」，而是「五大訴求，缺一不可」，即五項訴求必須俱全；而要求特首下台一直都是訴求之一。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官續指，五大訴求實際上是不可能的追求，正如區諾軒所指，即使最容易達成的訴求，即成立獨立調查委員會，亦於2019年被時任特首拒絕；而直至現在，除撤回逃犯條例修訂草案外，其他訴求皆不獲回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官戴推想特首下台並非如辯方稱空洞&quot;&gt;官：戴推想特首下台並非如辯方稱空洞&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官續指，否決預算案一次本身，並不能達到戴耀廷計劃的終極目標，亦難以形容為「大殺傷力武器」；因此當戴提及否決預算案概念時，毫無疑問他指的是《基本法》第50至52條中整體否決權力及其後果，即解散立法會及特首辭職。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官續指，運用否決權僅為手段，特首因預算案否決兩次後別無他選須辭職，因此戴推想的「攬炒十步」，引申至特首下台的第七步，當中想法「或許並非如辯方所說般空洞（hollow）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官無差別否決造成憲制危機&quot;&gt;官：無差別否決造成憲制危機&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又指，即使特首選擇不解散立法會，但過半民主派仍會否決任何臨時撥款；而即使《基本法》容許特首在立法會被解散時，按上一財政年度開支標準批准臨時短期撥款，這亦代表政府執行任何新政策都必遭嚴重阻礙、基本上都要煞停，「政府及特首的權力和權威會被大大破壞」。法庭套用區諾軒的說法，指這會造成香港的「憲制危機」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法庭終指，若各方懷有如控罪所指的意圖來進行涉案謀劃，必然構成「嚴重干擾、阻撓、破壞香港特別行政區政權機關依法履行職能的行為」，或令成功的候選人參與。&lt;/p&gt;

In Syria, however, its presence has long since evaporated. What went wrong?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wagner Group, a private military company (PMC) funded by the Russian state, deployed to Syria in 2015 and spent six years there. Its role in the country’s conflict was most clearly highlighted by the Battle of Khasham in February 2018, during which a mixed force of Wagnerite mercenaries and Syrian militiamen tried to seize control of an oil field from the US army and its allied militias. The Wagnerites and their allies were badly bruised by a thorough US air and artillery bombardment, and the incident was seen as very puzzling at a time when US-Russian deconflicting arrangements were still fully operational. In fact, the key question about the incident is whether the Russian command in Syria was aware of the Wagnerite plan or not. Wagner’s boss Yevgeny Prigozhin alleged that the Russian command knew, while the latter denied knowledge – hence claims by Prigozhin and his supporters that already at that time a jealous Russian Ministry of Defence (MoD) was trying to undermine Wagner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prigozhin’s claims can be interpreted as evidence of friction with the MoD, dating back to the early years of the Wagner Group. The narrative that emerges from both Syrian government and Russian government sources indicates, however, that until 2023, things were not so bad. Even after Prigozhin’s mutiny and subsequent death, Russian diplomatic and military sources rated Russia’s experience with mercenaries in Syria as quite positive. Syrian diplomatic, military and oil and gas industry sources were also adamant that the Russian authorities always defended Wagner against Syrian criticism and blocked Syrian attempts to take existing contracts, especially in the oil and gas sector, away from the group. It was only after the mutiny that the Russian authorities lifted their protection of Wagner and converged with the Syrians in terms of getting Wagnerites to leave the company or indeed the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said this, Syrian sources all agree that they never had the impression that the Russian authorities were involved in Wagner’s expansion beyond the private military business and into oil and gas and related industries. The sources might, of course, have been unaware of Wagner’s arrangements with the Russian authorities, but it seems clear that Prigozhin was not sharing the bulk of his profits with the Kremlin authorities, other than paying some taxes in Russia. Given the shadowy nature of the business, one suspects that the taxes paid were a relatively small amount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syrian views of Wagner and its operations in their country are not entirely negative. Wagner’s operations as a commando or shock force were seen as useful, given the shortage of aggressive, combat capable units in the Syrian armed forces and the unwillingness of the Russian MoD to commit regular Russian forces. Syrian businessmen who worked with Prigozhin were also generally happy about the collaboration: the extraordinary profits made by not paying taxes or customs were shared with Syrian business partners, who today describe that time as a bonanza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Wagner’s role in reclaiming control over Syrian oil and gas fields legitimised the exceptionally favourable conditions under which it was able to operate them afterwards&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a period, Prigozhin also took care of keeping the political elites happy. The Assad family was rewarded by contracting companies it controls, for example. Over time, however, the jealousy of the Syrian economic and political elite grew, not least because the oil and gas sector is one of only a few ways to make any money in Syria. Prigozhin, perhaps reassured by the protection he enjoyed from the Russian authorities, did not feel he had to distribute Wagner’s profits beyond a narrow number of Syrian business partners and the minister of oil and gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial justification for Wagner’s entry into the oil and gas sector was of course that it played a key role in reclaiming control over the fields. This legitimised the exceptionally favourable conditions under which Wagner was able to operate them afterwards. By June 2020, however, with the war effectively over, both Syrian powerbrokers, who were not receiving their share, and Syrian officials, who were not seeing any gains for a Syrian state struggling to raise enough revenue to sustain itself, grew critical of Wagner and its privileges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a stark contrast here with the situation that emerged in Mali after Wagner’s 2023 mutiny. In Mali, the Russian government tried to take the contract with the Malian government away from Wagner, but Bamako objected and insisted on keeping Wagner in the country. In the end, a compromise was worked out where 80% of the old contract stayed with Wagner. The Malian government did not want Russian PMC Redut, which is in fact a branch of the MoD, to take over from Wagner. It assessed that Wagner would be a more pliable tool in its hands than Redut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Syria, not only did the government not object to the Russian government’s plans to expel Wagner from the country, but it actively endorsed them. As in Mali, however, the government showed little interest in an expansion of the role of Redut (which already operated in the country in parallel with Wagner). The Russian authorities are still trying to “sell” an expanded Redut role to the Syrians, but the lengthy negotiations demonstrate a distinct lack of enthusiasm on the Syrian side, which would rather do without any Russian private military or security involvement in the oil and gas sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It is clear that by and large Russia was never in a position to offer full, pervasive and long-term protection for Wagner across the geographic range of its operations&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems to suggest that Wagner might only be replaceable by the likes of Redut to a limited extent, because customers do not want the Russian government to have too much say over how mercenaries are used. There are other reasons, too, as to why Wagner is hard to replace. According to senior staff of both Russian and Syrian companies previously operating under Wagner, once the Russian MoD took control of Wagner’s operations in the oil and gas sector, the profitability collapsed. This is not a matter of technical or managerial competence, because the staff have changed little, but of the shadowy business skills that were Prigozhin’s own turf. The Syrian authorities are now demanding that Russian companies in Syria pay taxes and customs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paradox of the Wagner modus operandi in Syria was that it worked because of Prigozhin’s ability to break every rule, but it failed for the same reason. Prigozhin’s “wild capitalist” model was always bound to generate resistance, jealousies and criticism. Only by relying on the protection of the Russian state, which had huge leverage over the Syrian elite in 2015–20, could Prigozhin’s system work. Now the question is whether that model – assuming his son Pavel intends to continue with it – can operate autonomously and still turn out a profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Syria, the Prigozhin model was acceptable as long as the situation of extreme crisis allowed for little or no alternatives. Such a situation cannot last forever – it must evolve in one direction or another. Even if the model appears to be still viable for now in Mali and Central Africa, it is clear that by and large Russia was never in a position to offer full, pervasive and long-term protection for Wagner across the geographic range of its operations. Indeed, beyond Syria, the presence of the Russian state alongside Wagner deployments was always much thinner, and typically limited to diplomatic and technical support. This is a key difference between Prigozhin’s business model and that of, say, the British East India Company. Both models are/were driven by extreme rapaciousness, but the East India Company relied on a comparatively much greater ability of the British state to back up the Company’s “investments”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, Prigozhin’s model was only really viable for relatively short burst of very intensive profit making. It might well have been designed with that in mind: in Syria, according to sources within Wagner’s financial operation, the organisation earned a war chest that continues to fund Wagner adventures elsewhere. As a venture capitalist, Prigozhin appears to have assumed that several of his operations would result in losses, but expected a few immensely successful ones to cover that and still leave a hefty profit, which might well have been the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the most dramatic types of democratic backsliding, such as coups d’etat, have been on the decline in Latin America, democratic backsliding, in a more insidious way, has taken its place in the form of executive aggrandizement. Executive aggrandizement, according to scholar Nancy Bermeo, is when the executive branch weakens checks and balances by enacting institutional changes that hamper the ability of the opposition to challenge executive preferences. Heads of state who partake in executive aggrandizement are typically electorally popular and therefore justify these changes as carrying out the people’s mandate. Such aggrandizement aims to secure one’s political position and enable the implementation of a political agenda with minimal pushback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Case studies of executive aggrandizement in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) include Ecuador’s Rafael Correa from 2007 to 2017, but more recently Mexico has many wondering whether the United States’ neighbor to the south will be effective in insulating its democratic institutions from this trend. The research in this report relies on Bermeo’s definition of executive aggrandizement and creates 16 indicators based on actions that the executive can take to suppress legislative and judicial bodies while simultaneously targeting other institutional sources of accountability, such as a free and independent press, civil society groups, and civilian oversight over defense and security bodies. Of the 16 indicators the authors lay out, Mexican president Andrés Manuel López Obrador (colloquially known as AMLO) has exhibited 14.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-case-of-mexico&quot;&gt;The Case of Mexico&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mexico has had a tumultuous and complicated history in terms of the abuse of power. The 1917 constitution, crafted to benefit the political elite at the time, provided presidents with “meta-constitutional” and “anti-constitutional” privileges granting them the ability to select and remove elected politicians from office, maintain tight control over financial resources, and directly intervene in the administrative and financial affairs of local and state governments. This led to the exertion of unitary party control by the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which heavily concentrated power in the executive branch. To correct this abuse of power, reforms in the 1980s decentralized power by expanding Mexico’s Chamber of Deputies and implementing proportional representation. Additionally, the reforms mandated the creation of the Federal Electoral Institute (IFE) — the precursor to the National Electoral Institute (INE) created in 2014 — which was in charge of overseeing and regulating the electoral process. These changes ensured competition in congressional seats and empowered the supreme court to challenge unconstitutional abuses of power. The reforms are credited with Mexico’s multiparty democracy and the historic win of the National Action Party (PAN) in the 2000 general election, followed by a second victory in 2006 and the unprecedented victory of AMLO, the first presidential candidate of the National Regeneration Movement (Morena), in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;amlos-historic-presidency&quot;&gt;AMLO’s Historic Presidency&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout his 2018 campaign, then candidate AMLO promised to bring Mexico into its “Fourth Transformation,” aimed at ending corruption, growing the economy, reducing violence, building infrastructure, and expanding social programs designed to reduce poverty and inequality. This follows three historic transformations: Mexico’s War of Independence, the Reform War, and the Mexican Revolution. AMLO’s historic election stood out as the most recent demonstration of the people’s discontent with the status quo of the economy and high levels of corruption, as he became the latest leftist leader in Latin America to be elected on a platform of social reforms seeking to eradicate poverty and inequality, similar to Brazil’s Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and later Colombia’s Gustavo Petro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Close to the end of his six-year term, an assessment of AMLO’s policies — measuring their impacts not only on the political, economic, and security situations in Mexico but also on its democratic institutions — suggests that Mexico “appears far more battered and bruised than the Mexico AMLO took the reins of in 2018.” AMLO politicized the office of the attorney general, attempted to curtail the INE’s budget, and has continued to militarize Mexico’s security forces, following in the steps of his predecessors. AMLO sees himself, not Mexico’s congress, as the direct and sole manifestation of the will of the people, and his disregard for checks and balances is troubling. The following sections seek to quantify AMLO’s efforts to centralize power and assess the impacts of these efforts on Mexico’s democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;evaluating-amlos-administration-and-democratic-backsliding-in-mexico&quot;&gt;Evaluating AMLO’s Administration and Democratic Backsliding in Mexico&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Bermeo’s work as a guide, the authors have examined four dimensions of democratic backsliding to assess the situation in Mexico: (1) executive influence over the electoral system, (2) executive influence over the judicial branch, (3) executive encroachment on national and civilian security, and (4) executive undermining of established political liberties. Each dimension contains four indicators that illustrate the different ways in which the executive branch can influence other branches, alter institutions, and centralize power. All dimensions and indicators are highlighted in Table 1, where a checkmark (✓) indicates that AMLO has exhibited this behavior and an x (X) means he has not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Dimensions and Indicators of Democratic Backsliding in Mexico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;executive-influence-over-the-electoral-system&quot;&gt;Executive Influence over the Electoral System&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AMLO has consistently voiced his opposition to the INE, an entity which he blames for losing the 2006 and 2012 presidential elections, and he has sought, through budgetary reforms, to significantly reduce the INE’s presence throughout the country. The president has also violated electoral laws by using his platform to campaign for other party members. Of the four indicators in this dimension, AMLO exhibited executive aggrandizement in three: manipulating budget allocations for the electoral system, restricting voter access, and hampering electoral procedures. AMLO has not attempted to place political appointees in positions responsible for electoral oversight, making it the only indicator in this dimension for which there is no evidence of democratic backsliding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;budget-manipulation-related-to-electoral-oversight&quot;&gt;Budget Manipulation Related to Electoral Oversight&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AMLO has weakened the electoral system by reducing the INE’s budget by 3.5 billion pesos ($209.6 million). This has affected not only the INE’s staff but also its ability to set up, monitor, protect, and regulate federal, state, and local elections. AMLO declined to provide additional funding to the INE during the 2021 Mexican midterm elections, which significantly delayed results; he has spoken about removing the institute altogether; and he has called for the INE’s director, Lorenzo Córdova, to resign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;restriction-of-voter-access&quot;&gt;Restriction of Voter Access&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2021, a national referendum asking Mexicans whether to investigate former presidents for corruption had a 7 percent voter turnout. Some observers credit such low voter turnout to a reduction in polling stations, which went from the 104,667 originally planned to 56,465, due to budgetary constraints. The referendum, pushed in part by AMLO himself, was estimated to cost around 500 million pesos (around $29 million), equivalent to a third of the INE’s budget that year. Similarly, a referendum seeking to put AMLO’s recall on the ballot in 2022 cost the INE 1.5 billion pesos (around $89 million) and yielded a mere 17 percent voter turnout, potentially due to a reduced number of polling stations. NGOs and domestic organizations criticized both referenda as political exercises by AMLO to increase his popularity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;hampering-of-electoral-procedures&quot;&gt;Hampering of Electoral Procedures&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AMLO has also frequently used the presidential platform and podium to publicly and openly campaign for fellow Morena party members while also verbally attacking candidates from other political parties, which is in direct contradiction to the principles stated in the Mexican constitution. Overall, AMLO has not been supportive of the country’s electoral infrastructure, and he has failed to provide additional security and support for poll workers amid Covid-19 and the high rates of violence in many states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;executive-influence-over-the-judicial-branch&quot;&gt;Executive Influence over the Judicial Branch&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite his campaign promises of accountability and transparency, AMLO has hampered the judicial system for his political benefit and weakened Mexico’s checks and balances in the process. Throughout his term, AMLO has politicized and weaponized the federal judicial system with politically driven investigations and prosecutions. He has made politicized appointments to the supreme court, harassed judges, and threatened political figures with incarceration. AMLO’s actions to advance his personal and political interests have weakened the rule of law and tainted the judicial system with allegations of impunity and widespread corruption. In this dimension, AMLO has exhibited executive aggrandizement in all four indicators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;appointment-of-ideologically-aligned-or-loyal-judges&quot;&gt;Appointment of Ideologically Aligned or Loyal Judges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AMLO has appointed 4 of the 11 current supreme court justices during his presidency: Loretta Ortiz Ahlf, Juan Luis González Alcántara Carrancá, Yasmín Esquivel Mossa, and Ana Margarita Ríos Farjat. Ortiz Ahlf, before becoming a minister of the supreme court, was a congresswoman for the Labour Party (PT), Morena’s ally in the Mexican legislature. Although she was appointed by López Obrador, Ortiz Ahlf did recuse herself from the hearing on Mexico’s Electricity Industry Law and was prevented from sitting in the corruption case against AMLO’s brother due to concerns over conflicts of interest. In contrast, Esquivel Mossa, a supreme court justice since 2019, granted AMLO’s attorney general a suspension through which she prevented the delivery of the investigation file on his brother to the electoral authorities due to concerns related to human rights violations of his data (AMLO himself would later infringe on these same laws by doxing a New York Times journalist, and when questioned, he argued the law doesn’t apply to the president).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;use-of-executive-decrees-to-restrict-judicial-oversight-of-the-presidency&quot;&gt;Use of Executive Decrees to Restrict Judicial Oversight of the Presidency&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of Mexico’s most recent presidents, AMLO has used executive decrees on the widest range of topics. AMLO has recently proposed constitutional reforms that, if passed, would give the executive branch control of the wages, evaluations, and promotion tracks of all judges — even those in the supreme court. The Mexican Bar Association, the Stanford Law School Rule of Law Impact Lab, and the Inter-American Dialogue’s Rule of Law Program strongly condemned the proposed reforms as a threat to judicial independence in a report released this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;blockage-of-investigations&quot;&gt;Blockage of Investigations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the campaign trail, AMLO promised to bring to justice public officials who have relations with drug cartels. However, during his administration, he refused to open an investigation into the former secretary of national defense under Enrique Peña Nieto, Salvador Cienfuegos, who is known to have received bribes from the H-2 Cartel. Additionally, AMLO, who was initially eager to investigate the truth of the Iguala mass kidnapping in 2014, has instead allowed multiple investigations under the “truth commission” he created to stall. AMLO has therefore shielded key military officers from being held accountable and has been criticized by the Interdisciplinary Group of Independent Experts for hampering domestic and international efforts to uncover connections between government officials, cartels, and the military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;harassment-or-removal-of-judges&quot;&gt;Harassment or Removal of Judges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and the international community have harshly criticized AMLO for using the attorney general’s office to harass and prosecute political opponents. For example, the López Obrador administration’s Financial Intelligence Unit allegedly harassed former supreme court justice Eduardo Medina Mora, leading to his subsequent resignation. After Mora’s resignation, AMLO filled the vacancy with his desired appointee, Margarita Ríos Farjat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;executive-encroachment-on-national-and-civilian-security&quot;&gt;Executive Encroachment on National and Civilian Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AMLO has rhetorically adopted a policy of nonviolence toward Mexico’s diversified criminal groups, a policy he dubbed abrazos no balazos (“hugs not bullets”). In actuality, however, he has continued to militarize the security forces and has vested them with expanded powers. A 2021 report by the Center for Investigations and Economics (CIDE) found that between 2006 and 2021 more than 245 governmental functions had been transferred from civilian authorities to the Mexican armed forces. Furthermore, the creation of the national guard, accompanied by a refusal to transfer the body to civilian control, heralds what experts have called “new militarism,” that is, the normalization of expanded roles of the military and of the handover of civil matters to the military. Lastly, while a 2023 investigation revealed that Mexico was the first country to use Pegasus spyware during the Peña Nieto administration, there is little evidence to suggest that AMLO has significantly expanded the surveillance capabilities of the state. Based on this assessment, AMLO has exhibited executive aggrandizement in three out of four indicators in this dimension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;transfer-of-resources-to-the-military&quot;&gt;Transfer of Resources to the Military&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While an increase in the national security budgets is a common policy decision, especially amid security crises, the López Obrador administration has transferred functions that typically fall under the purview of other government departments to the military and, in particular, to the newly minted national guard. According to reports, AMLO has transferred 15 state companies, and arguably their proceeds, to military management, including Mexico City’s two airports, a new airline, and the new Tren Maya. Throughout his presidency, López Obrador has approved the expansion of the military’s budget by 150 percent, primarily to absorb the costs of such projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;expansion-of-institutional-impunity&quot;&gt;Expansion of Institutional Impunity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AMLO has sought to expand the role of the military in Mexico without providing safeguards to prevent the abuse of power. In 2020, Attorney General Alejandro Gertz Manero, with the president’s backing, proposed a judicial reform plan that would allow suspects to be detained without charges for up to 40 days and would decrease the number of judges needed to monitor defendants’ rights. While AMLO later withdrew his support for the plan, his administration has failed to implement crucial accountability mechanisms under the Organic Law of the Attorney General of the Republic. Manero has allowed the expedited appointment of legal officials and experts without the approval of congress and civilian committees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;militarization-of-civilian-security-forces&quot;&gt;Militarization of Civilian Security Forces&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though AMLO initially claimed he would not use the military under his administration, he has deployed the military to drug-related operations and civilian security tasks since 2019, including for supporting the construction of certain projects, securing ports of entry, building banks to disperse social programs to the elderly and the poor, stopping illegal immigrants, policing large public areas, guiding traffic, and dispersing demonstrations. Furthermore, AMLO has resisted calls to hand over control of the national guard to a civilian. It is currently under the jurisdiction of the Secretariat of Security and Civil Protection despite earlier attempts to transfer it to the Secretariat of National Defense (SEDENA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The national guard has been widely condemned for its use of tear gas on innocent protesters and asylum seekers from Guatemala. To make matters worse, between January 1 and August 17, 2022, the National Human Rights Commission (CDNH) registered around 32 complaints of torture and 94 complaints of arbitrary detention, 43 of which were against the national guard. Moreover, over the same time period, the CDNH received an additional 120 complaints of inhumane treatment that were committed by the national guard and other related government entities, including the Secretariat of Security, the attorney general’s office, SEDENA, and the National Migration Institute. In 2020, the CDNH also received complaints about forced disappearances, inhumane treatment, and arbitrary detention. In April 2020, photos circulated on social media of members of the national guard eating with cartel members, and a video surfaced in early May that year of the national guard extorting citizens in Sonora, further augmenting concerns about the force’s abuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;executive-undermining-of-established-political-liberties&quot;&gt;Executive Undermining of Established Political Liberties&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AMLO not only has failed to protect journalists but also has attacked the press and independent organizations and defunded independent agencies that seek to protect civil liberties. AMLO has also sponsored and promoted laws that harshly repress demonstrations and has routinely used the national guard to repress civilian protests. Overall, AMLO has contradicted himself in declaring himself a champion of the people while simultaneously being punitive toward citizens and civil society. In this dimension, AMLO has exhibited executive aggrandizement in all four indicators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;attacks-on-the-media&quot;&gt;Attacks on the Media&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AMLO’s presidency has been characterized by the establishment of a daily press briefing, also known as the “Mañanera,” an hours-long daily briefing that the president has instituted in the name of transparency. However, AMLO most often uses this platform to respond to negative coverage of his administration, oftentimes by attacking or doxing journalists who publish negative stories about him. During his six-year term, he disclosed the income of journalist Carlos Loret de Mola and the phone number of New York Times reporter Natalie Kitroeff, and has referred to journalists as “thugs,” putting journalists in acute danger. Mexico has been one of the most dangerous countries for journalists, including active warzones, with around 37 journalists killed during AMLO’s term alone. With little political appetite for extended protections, journalists continue to suffer not only verbal attacks by the president but also physical violence with no end in sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a report by the New York Times, Mexico was the first country to deploy Pegasus, during the Calderón administration. While AMLO has also openly criticized the use of spyware by the Calderón administration, there is no evidence that he is has stopped its use. In fact, during his six-year term, the armed forces deployed the software on human rights defender, Raymundo Ramos, accusing him of seeking to “discredit the armed forces.” Raymundo was in fact, investigating an unlawful killing by the military that took place in Nuevo Laredo when his phone was infected. Two other cases, both undertaken by the armed forces, are salient during AMLO’s presidency: the surveillance of Alejandro Encinas, Mexico’s undersecretary for human rights, and constant monitoring of over 15 feminist groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;interference-with-political-actors-and-others-in-opposition&quot;&gt;Interference with Political Actors and Others in Opposition&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the run-up to the Mexican presidential election, AMLO has continuously attacked candidate Xóchitl Gálvez, thus breaking with long-standing tradition of Mexican presidents not commenting on candidates in the presidential race. AMLO has also used his attorney general’s office to threaten to incarcerate more than two dozen professors and scientists for alleged money laundering and organized crime charges, which were quickly shot down in court due to a lack of evidence. AMLO has also used lower federal courts and tax authorities as well as financial crime units to harass political opponents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;repression-of-protests-and-demonstrations&quot;&gt;Repression of Protests and Demonstrations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AMLO, ironically, became popular for protesting Pemex operations in the early years of his political career. Now, AMLO is supportive of punitive laws that increase pretrial detention and tougher penalties for those who are arrested during protests and demonstrations. In July 2019, AMLO and Morena Party members proposed legislation that would permit prison sentences of up to 20 years for obstructing access to business and 13 years for blocking progress on public works projects. AMLO has also used the national guard to disperse crowds and protests, an institution that in its young tenure has already faced complaints of excessive use of force, abuse, and even torture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-uncertain-future-for-mexico&quot;&gt;An Uncertain Future for Mexico&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On February 5, 2024, Mexico’s Constitution Day, AMLO proposed 20 new political changes, 18 of which require changes to the constitution, with the remaining two seen as legal reforms. Key changes include a reduction in the number of seats in Mexico’s national legislature, and a reform to elect judges by popular vote. While the proposed reforms are currently being reviewed in the lower house of congress, it is important to note that AMLO’s party, Morena, does not have the necessary two-thirds majority in both chambers to pass them. Many fear that, should Morena win a supermajority in both houses and the presidency, AMLO’s legacy of executive aggrandizement and democratic backsliding will continue even after he leaves office. Considering Latin America’s history of democratic backsliding through executive aggrandizement, the question of how countries can best safeguard institutions and maintain checks and balances is one Mexico must grapple with should it wish to continue to be considered a robust democracy in the hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】初選47人案將於今（5月30日）早裁決，有市民在西九龍裁判法院外通宵排隊。據《獨媒》現場觀察，晚上11時半已有逾35人在庭外排隊。排在隊伍較前位置有被告劉偉聰的朋友，不久前出獄的他認為有需要到場旁聽，又表示「呢啲共業嚟，一齊承受」。「女長毛」雷玉蓮則帶同平安包到場，希望各被告能「平安大吉，大步檻過」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，由隊伍中段開始，近30名排隊人士均戴上口罩及帽，部分人背向街道而坐。記者上前逐一詢問有關排隊目的、聽審內容、是否「有錢收」等，惟他們均拒絕回答記者提問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;兩人與劉偉聰相識-望為47人打氣&quot;&gt;兩人與劉偉聰相識 望為47人打氣&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳先生（化名）昨晚約8時半已到達現場，是被告劉偉聰的朋友，稱放工後便到場排隊。他表示有傳訊息給劉表達關心，考慮到今日可能是最後機會看到被告，希望到場為他們打氣，並拍下被告的照片，「始終在公在私都想送佢一程，可能真係聽日 bye bye。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳先生上月剛出獄，坦言擔心會被警員監視，但認為裁決需要到場旁聽。他表示在獄中一直有留意47人案的消息，「咁嘅時勢冇擔心，呢啲共業嚟，一齊承受。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳先生在現場偶遇同樣剛出獄的朋友加入隊伍。該名朋友表示知道有關案件內容，關注3名指定法官理解案件的邏輯，以及他們如何回應辯方的論點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同樣是劉偉聰朋友的 Mark 同樣排在隊伍較前。Mark 指，看到審訊過程覺得生氣、無奈，「因為嬲，心唔舒服，傷心」，所以來支持被告，希望最好「聽日一齊走呀」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「女長毛」雷玉蓮因擔心排隊黨再度出現，所以昨晚約9時帶同平安包和平安飾物到場。她笑言，希望能過法庭安檢，令庭上讓被告看到，祝願「平安大吉，大步檻過」。蓮姐稱之前因工作而無法旁聽，但認為判決很重要，所以今次請假兩天到場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;雷玉蓮亦表示，對每一位被告都十分留意，包括戰友「長毛」梁國雄。她認為今次案件很大規模，如何判決都會引起社會很多關注。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;外號「姨婆」的69歲旁聽師昨日下午6時許已擺放折凳在隊頭。她表示常常旁聽47人案審訊，形容被告何桂藍供詞「非常銳利」。她又指，最近的英國《國安法》案件容許所有被告保釋，相比之下香港令人感覺「肉酸」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】初選47人案今早迎來裁決，日前被指涉嫌利用「某個將至的敏感日子」前持續發布煽動帖文，違反《維護國家安全條例》，於本周二被捕的牙醫李盈姿，在昨晚約11時獲准保釋後，梳洗過後，今早約4時到庭外排隊等候聽審，「橫掂都無瞓，就不如出嚟啦，同埋都想報吓平安、見吓大家。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李盈姿認為，初選47人案無實質證據指控，「好唔公平、好離譜。」她預計能入正庭聽審，但如若有親友需要輪候籌，會不介意讓出。她坦言對裁決不感樂觀，寄語各人「我們喺外面等你哋」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;《獨媒》通宵在庭外守候，日出之後排隊人數明顯增加，而且多是身穿「街坊裝」，有身穿黑「莊tee」的排隊校媒成員被警員查身份證。截至早上7時半，已有約70人在排隊等候聽審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李予信好友作為朋友盡一份力有得陪就陪&quot;&gt;李予信好友：作為朋友盡一份力，有得陪就陪&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其中一名被告李予信的朋友 Stanley，今早6時便到場排隊。他提及李在被檢控後，仍有不時曝光，「佢從一而終咁實踐自由意志，呢點我係 respect 嘅。」他自言已做好心理準備，「無理由我哋喺出面仲預備得差過佢」，希望能陪對方一同面對，「作為朋友都盡一份力，有得陪就陪。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;有曾排隊聽審學生今早自發到場派糧食&quot;&gt;有曾排隊聽審學生今早自發到場派糧食&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;家在法院附近的港大法律系二年級生 Keith（化名），坦言「做到嘅真係無乜」，但因在去年2月亦曾排隊聽審。他指排隊人士會感肚餓，故今早清晨帶同食水及餅乾等食糧到場，派發予通宵等候的排隊人士。他稱一直有了解案情，認為辯方「拗嘅有point」，惟最終判決仍取決於法院，估計辯方勝算機會較微。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;科大編委成員 Richard 今早亦有到場排隊，坦言對裁決不感樂觀。他打算報道案件，以引起學生關注。身穿科大編委的「莊tee」的 Richard，在接受訪問期間一度有警員上前打斷，被要求查其身份證。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李予信的朋友 Wendy 昨凌晨3時半已到場排隊，打算進入正庭親身鼓勵李，「起碼可以真人望到佢」，但未知能否拿飛進入正庭。Wendy 表示以泰然及平穩的態度面對裁決，並會與李共同面對結果，因兩人相信堅持理念是最重要。Wendy 表示，裁決前兩人分別撰寫信件給對方，以表達內心說話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wendy 認為，李的信念堅定，即使面對制肘仍然在不同方面追求進步，並對李的所有決定有信心及會支持。她認為最重要的是清楚自己所追求的。Wendy 指，在審訊期間面對着更多挑戰，她一早已經預計結果，會為不同情況作好準備。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「獵人書店」店長黃文萱於約早上8時到場排隊，表示想親身見證裁決，亦想「陪下大家」。她指審訊過程漫長，現時心情複雜，對於結果不太樂觀，只希望能還被告公義。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;前立法會議員邵家臻亦到場，他表示對結果「唔敢樂觀」，不停提醒自己要沉着面對結果、控罪、判刑、或往後日子。被問到有什麼想跟47人說，邵僅表示：「唔使怕，我哋有彼此。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】初選47人案今早裁決，一眾獲准保釋的被告今早先後到達法西九龍法院。被告之一、本身是大律師的劉偉聰，他在進入法庭前接受傳媒訪問，他對記者表示：「多謝大家關心，希望大家繼續關注，後會有期。」社民連定今早在法院外示威，但主席陳寶瑩及成員曾健成等人，卻在請願前遭警方帶至遠離法院的行人路調查。陳寶瑩認為警方做法不能接受，稱今早原定只有四名成員簡單表達意見，卻遭剝奪權利。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;聆訊今早10時開始，李予信最早到達，他在8時58分便到達法庭，他穿上老虎圖案的藍色恤衫，並配戴了金鏈，特地在法院門外停下讓記者拍照。另一被告柯耀林則在9時01分到達。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其他被告及後陸續進入法院，鄭達鴻與女友手拖手進入法庭，劉偉聰在進入法庭前對記者表示：「多謝大家關心，希望大家繼續關注，後會有期。」曾因旺角騷亂案入獄的盧建民亦有到場，他更特地為劉偉聰拍照，後者曾擔任盧建民的代表律師。施德來亦與妻子拖手抵達，何啟明則向記者揮手。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;早上約8時30分，一名身穿深藍風衣、黑色衫褲、攜黑色袋的女士在西九龍法院大樓地下，被約5至6名警員截查，搜查其隨身物品。她向記者表示，昨晚到場時排在隊伍頭10人以內，惟在步入法庭時便手勢後，隨即被警員帶到法院大樓地下近升降機位置截查。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;她指警員向她稱「你都知而家敏感日子，無謂要上頭做嘢，呢啲嘢唔好講喇」，另有國安警員口頭警誡她剛才行為已涉意圖煽動，如有相同情況會立即拘捕。警員其後要求她直接離開法院重新排隊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名組織及參與初選的民主派，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（30日）於西九龍裁判法院（暫代高院）裁決。3名國安法指定法官今早裁定，16名不認罪被告中，劉偉聰、李予信2人罪名不成立，其餘14人，包括鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、黃碧雲、施德來、何桂藍、陳志全、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄、柯耀林、余慧明及吳政亨，均罪名成立。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方表示，擬按《刑事訴訟程序條例》第81DB，提出上訴，並要求法庭維持二人保釋狀態直至下午2時半再開庭。其餘罪成被告則須即時還柙。該條例為政府去年修訂，就沒有陪審團的高院國安案，若有被告罪脫，律政司可「緊接」提出擬上訴，法庭可應申請，命令無罪被告還柙或准予保釋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李予信聞判後表現平靜，微微戚眉和搖頭望向女友。劉偉聰獲悉結果後與律師相擁痛哭。柯耀林聞結果後「O嘴」驚訝，鄒家成則平靜望向旁聽人士。鄭達鴻一直望向旁聽親友。彭卓棋向李予信舉拇指，李點頭回應。梁國雄用手摸頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李予信步出被告欄時右手撫胸向其他被告點頭，劉偉聰步出庭時，獲旁聽人士握手祝願，並著他保重。劉的親友與他擁抱時不禁落淚，但劉未就結果發表感受。他只是說：「多謝大家關心，繼續關心其他人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;罪成被告均須還柙，離開時林卓廷向親友微笑，彭卓棋飛吻和揮手，鄒家成揮手，柯耀林舉交叉手勢。有旁聽親友見被告被押走時拭淚。黃碧雲透過玻璃向親友微笑揮手。楊雪盈步入囚室時向父親說：「睇住啲貓呀爸爸，你同貓都要平安呀！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;各被告於9時45分起陸續進入被告欄，欄內氣氛頗為輕鬆，黃碧雲與柯耀林交談一會，楊雪盈則向親友微笑後步入，又在欄內雙手放頭做兔仔手勢。李予信一度向女友揮手及舉出拳頭手勢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於還柙中的被告，何桂藍束起頭髮、手持文件出庭。林卓廷穿西裝出庭，鄒家成向公眾揮手。旁聽人士站起揮手時，法庭職員大喊：「麻煩公眾人士唔好揮手！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;開庭前，各被告在庭外與親友道別，劉偉聰搭着陳志全肩膊，有朋友上前與劉握手說：「我哋晏啲去飲嘢」，劉微笑不語；鄭達鴻與其代表大律師潘熙握手，又與彭卓棋交談。楊雪盈則與親友相擁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉偉聰表示自己並非焦點-冀公眾關注其他人&quot;&gt;劉偉聰表示自己並非焦點 冀公眾關注其他人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉偉聰步出庭時，獲旁聽人士握手祝願，並著他保重。劉的親友與他擁抱時不禁落淚，但劉未就結果發表感受。他只是說：「多謝大家關心，繼續關心其他人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉步出法院時被記者包圍，警方隨即阻止記者，並由數名警員「護送」劉過馬路。劉向記者指，自己並非是日裁決的焦點，他冀公眾繼續關注其他人，以及詳細閱讀判詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李予信離開法庭時表示「多謝大家關心」，他指因現時律政司表示可能會上訴，所以現階段「唔可以 comment 任何嘢」，心情「都係一樣，冇乜特別」，被問得悉其他被告罪成的感受，他神情凝重指：「大家明白，我都好難講太多。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李予信向記者豎起拇指，又右手輕拍胸口。多名記者上前包圍拍攝，警方隨即陪同李離開，逾20名警員一度築起人鏈阻隔記者，又拉着記者背包要求移開。李向記者表示，「我講嘅嘢唔多，多謝大家咁多年嘅關心，我哋係睇到同感受到大家嘅愛。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到會否擔心律政司上訴需即時還押，李僅回應現階段不能評論或表達意見，他指現時心情平和，只想與家人見面：「我宜家只係想同屋企人飲下茶，因為我仲未見到屋企人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;胡志偉聞畢裁決後，神色凝重；梁晃維、伍健偉、李嘉達、馮達浚四人則低頭交談；黃之鋒不時望向觀眾席。除了徐子見外，其餘七人離開時均有向觀眾席揮手。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官今早宣布裁決結果後，押後至下午再開庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;下午開庭前，罪脫的李予信坐在被告欄外，劉偉聰則繼續坐在律師席。至於罪成的14被告，各人精神不俗，林卓廷向公眾席微笑點頭，並向親友做手勢，示意「我OK」；黃碧雲、何啟明均微笑揮手；楊雪盈束了低馬尾，向親友點頭和展露燦爛微笑，又做心形手勢；施德來穿上風衣，雙手合十抱拳。陳志全戴上了眼鏡。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方就兩無罪被告提上訴&quot;&gt;控方就兩無罪被告提上訴&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;甫開庭，刑事檢控專員楊美琪表示，擬根據《刑事訴訟程序條例》第81DB條，就兩名無罪被告以「案件呈述」方式上訴，並望維持二人原有的保釋條件，以待上訴。劉偉聰沒有反對，代表李予信的大律師關文渭則表示反對。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關文渭陳詞後，法庭押後考慮，終下令二人續准以原有條件繼續保釋，包括不得離港，不得直接或間接以任何方式發放或作出任何可能被視為危害國安的言論和行為等，但警署報到次數則由每周一次減為一個月一次，李予信亦獲撤銷人事擔保10萬元。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;暫定625求情&quot;&gt;暫定6.25求情&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉續宣布，就本案求情暫定於6月25日開始進行，求情陳詞不可多於20頁，需於求情前14天呈交。代表彭卓棋的大律師盧敏儀其後為彭申請保釋候判遭拒。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】初選案16名不認罪被告當中，只有劉偉聰及李予信罪脫。就劉偉聰，法官指他並沒有在競選活動中，主張否決預算案及迫使政府回應五大訴求。而就劉早前稱無簽署「墨落無悔」聲明，法官認為，即使劉的名字出現在聲明中，但不能確定是他親自簽署，或是授權他人簽署；亦接受劉稱，他發現自己名字出現在聲明時，處於進退兩難的局面，若然他將名字刪除或作出澄清，在當時的政治氣氛而言，等同於「政治自殺」。法官認為，無法從證據獲得唯一合理的推論，來指出劉同意涉案謀劃，亦不肯定他在任何階段有顛覆國家政權的意圖，因此裁定他罪脫。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官劉沒有在政綱提及否決財案&quot;&gt;官：劉沒有在政綱提及否決財案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官於判詞指，實際上劉並沒有在選舉政綱或競選活動中，主張否決預算案及迫使政府回應五大訴求，因此有理由懷疑劉是否同意無差別否決預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官不能確定劉親自簽聲明或授權他人&quot;&gt;官：不能確定劉親自簽聲明或授權他人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉早前稱並非他親自簽署「墨落無悔」聲明。法官認為，即使劉的名字出現在聲明中，但不能確定是他親自簽署，或是授權他人簽署。雖然控方認為，劉未能就為何名字會在聲明出現作出令人相信的解釋，但法官肯定，若然劉的員工因知道他將會參選故將其名字貼在聲明裏，而員工卻表示不知誰負責，那劉就只能作出上述解釋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官接受劉所稱，他發現自己名字出現在聲明時，處於進退兩難（catch-22）的局面。若然他將名字刪除或作出澄清，在當時的政治氣氛而言，就等同於「政治自殺」。劉並沒有將聲明張貼在自己 Facebook，亦無在選舉工程中運用聲明。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在選舉論壇上，劉問何啟明為何首先簽署聲明，但法官同意他這樣問，是希望對方能夠在論壇上顯示大放異彩；而這個提問確實沒有透露出劉對聲明的立場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官接受劉稱沒有使用fb-員工負責專頁及初選群組&quot;&gt;官接受劉稱沒有使用FB 員工負責專頁及初選群組&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官接受劉所指，他並非 Facebook 用戶，而關於區議會工作的專頁是由其員工操作。對於劉表示只會在工作時使用 Facebook，法官看不出有何不合理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官亦接受劉所指，他並非 WhatsApp 使用者，他只會用 iMessage，但法官指，這不代表他沒有留意到其義工屬於九西 WhatsApp 群組一員。法官續指，能夠確定劉有透過義工等人收到初選的協調文件，並已閱讀內容，但該義工並沒有在群組直接提及「五大訴求」或否決預算案，只是問及初選安排。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官接受劉參與首次九西協調會議後，並沒有再留意大部分與初選有關的後勤更新。法官亦接受劉所指，他沒有閱讀《蘋果日報》、戴耀廷的文章或 Facebook 帖文、或其他泛民參選人的最新發展。劉在參與初選前，並沒有充分理由去留意相關資訊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，無法從證據獲得唯一合理的推論，劉同意涉案謀劃，亦不肯定他在任何階段有顛覆國家政權的意圖，因此裁定他罪脫。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】初選案16名不認罪被告當中，只有劉偉聰及李予信罪脫。就李予信，法官接納他是黨內新人和低級成員，直至2020年5月底仍無意參與初選，也沒有參與超區協調會議，是在6月13日才被公民黨徵召出選；而公民黨於6月11日簽署「墨落無悔」聲明，但李當時尚未參選，法官接納他對公民黨內部討論應否簽署不知情，控方未能證明他同意作為聲明的聯署人。法官又指，李在論壇或 Facebook 均沒有提及利用否決權迫政府回應「五大訴求」，無法確定李是謀劃的一份子，亦不能肯定他有意圖顛覆國家政權，因此裁定他罪脫。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官接納李中途才獲公民黨徵召參與初選&quot;&gt;官接納李中途才獲公民黨「徵召」參與初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李予信一方爭議，即使他曾經參與涉案協議，但在《國安法》生效前已經退出。就李予信參與初選的時間，法官接納，李沒有參加公民黨記招前的籌備會議，對此一無所知，亦沒有人將細節告知他。法官亦接納，直至2020年5月底，李亦無意參與初選，也沒有參與戴耀廷等人舉辦的協調會議。而李是在2020年6月初公民黨開始「徵召機制」後，才表示對出選有興趣。直至2020年6月13日，他因6.12一周年示威案獲保釋後，在公民黨副主席賴仁彪要求下才參與初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官公民黨簽署墨落無悔聲明時-李尚未參選&quot;&gt;官：公民黨簽署「墨落無悔」聲明時 李尚未參選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官認為，區諾軒稱李曾出席5月協調會的說法並不可靠，因當時李尚未成為候選人，他亦不會收到戴耀廷發送的協調文件。法官又指，公民黨於2020年6月11日簽署「墨落無悔」聲明，但李尚未參選，接納他與公民黨簽聲明一事無關，對公民黨就聲明的內部討論不知情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指李作為黨員必然同意聲明-官論點沒有說服力&quot;&gt;控方指李作為黨員必然同意聲明 官：論點沒有說服力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就控方強調，李必然知道公民黨認同聲明，因此他作為黨的一份子，必然也會同意。惟法官反駁，上述論點沒有說服力，相反，法官認為控方未能證明李同意作為聲明的聯署人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官李沒有提及否決或五大訴求&quot;&gt;官：李沒有提及「否決」或「五大訴求」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官認為，雖然李在提名表格上簽署，當中同意並支持謀劃，但他沒有出席唯一一次的協調會議。另外，即使李於3月在 Facebook 上轉發公民黨關於「議會過半 反制政府」的帖文，但他當時尚未成為候選人。法官又指，沒有足夠證據證明，李事先知道公民黨其他代表將在記者會上發表甚麼言論，李就否決權方面亦沒有發言。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方強調，另一成員鄭達鴻在6月23日在 Facebook 表示，將與其他成員使用否決財案等手段，以實現五大訴求。而李是鄭專頁的追蹤者之一，因此他會同意其言論。然而，法官不認為上述推論是強而有力，因為選擇追蹤 Facebook 可出於多種原因。法官留意到，李即使與鄭參與同一街站活動，但他卻沒有在 Facebook 帖文提及「否決」或「五大訴求」的相關字眼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官李明顯採用公民黨所有候選人的範本&quot;&gt;官：李明顯採用公民黨所有候選人的範本&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官認為，李的政綱明顯是基於公民黨所有候選人使用的範本，而李較遲才參與初選的競選活動。對於李是否有選擇，還是只可採用其他人的範本，法官抱有保留態度。另外，當李看過《國安法》後，他立即通知黨員停止派發舊單張，並設計一款沒有提及「五大訴求」的新單張。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官也留意到，李在選舉論壇中並沒有提及利用否決權迫使政府回應「五大訴求」。法官指，由於李是黨內新人，在公民黨的地位較低；若他無法獲得黨的支持，就別無選擇，只能退出選舉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官最後指，無法確定李是謀劃的一份子，亦不能肯定他有意圖顛覆國家政權，因此裁定他罪脫。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】初選案16名不認罪被告當中，自行發起「三投三不投」、並非初選候選人的吳政亨，被判罪成。法官指，吳與戴耀廷就初選事宜頻繁交流，即使「三投三不投」可能是吳自行發起，但他並非單獨行事，肯定吳在《國安法》前，已與戴同意推行涉案謀劃並有意實施。法官又指，雖然其他參加者不知道吳的參與，但吳知道有其他候選人，亦知道他做的事情已超出與戴的往來範圍，他自願並有意確保只有初選勝出者才能參與立法會選舉，協助民主派取得大多數議席，否決預算案迫特首回應五大訴求，令特首下台。法官認為，吳與戴之間的協議，跟戴和其他人之間的協議是相同；而吳擁抱「攬炒」概念，《國安法》生效後仍繼續懷有顛覆政權的意圖，因此裁定他罪成。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9VsFhFT.png&quot; alt=&quot;image34&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官吳無出席會議-但知道及同意運用否決權&quot;&gt;官：吳無出席會議 但知道及同意運用否決權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊期間透露，吳政亨曾發起「三投三不投」，他並非初選的候選人，並選擇不作供。法官指，吳清楚知道35+計劃的目標，是要運用否決權，迫使特首回應「五大訴求」，雖然他沒有出席任何協調會議、也不是候選人，但證據顯示他清楚知道五個地方選區的協議中，包含「會運用」或「會積極運用」否決權，因他曾在 Facebook 發布相關帖文。此外，吳在訪問中明確表示知道民主黨沒有簽署「墨落無悔」聲明，顯示他知道聲明內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官認為吳是同意涉案謀劃，並逐一列出原因，包括吳並不反對否決所有議案這個想法；雖然他提及在初選與「墨落無悔」聲明之間，會選擇前者，但不代表他不同意涉案謀劃，這只顯示他認為取得35+是可行策略的基礎。此外，吳得悉選區協調會議有共識「會運用」或「會積極運用」否決權後，形容這是「好消息」；他又對於有人願意簽署「墨落無悔」聲明表示高興。法官認為，若然吳不同意聲明，就不會覺得高興。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;吳發文同意攬炒官不能詮釋為選舉言論&quot;&gt;吳發文同意「攬炒」官：不能詮釋為「選舉言論」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，警方在吳政亨的電腦上發現他用筆名「李伯盧」撰寫的文章，當中提及「在中共這強大敵人面前，我們不單要做『攬炒行動者』……要議會攬炒，首要條件是人數過半，35+」。法官認為由此可見，吳同意那些擁抱「攬炒」概念的人，即若政府拒絕回應訴求，就會破壞其職能。而吳和其他擁抱「攬炒」的人，兩者分別只在於優先順序及策略。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又指，吳在網上將中共形容為「不擇手段的對手」，並呼籲選民抵抗及戰鬥；他亦強調初選目的是「踢走共產黨」。另外，吳轉發文章並同意戴耀廷所說，取得立法會多數議席後，需運用否決權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，考慮上述證據後，發現吳在網上的言論，不能單單以「選舉言論」來解釋。唯一合理推論是吳實際上同意民主派一旦進入立法會，就會履行謀劃並採取行動對抗政府及共產黨。至於吳在訪問中聲稱對否決預算案等保持中立的說法，僅是未經盤問的開脫性言論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，只要吳同意戴耀廷懷有必要意圖進行謀劃，控方即可證明對吳的指控。若上述能夠被證明，那麼其他共謀者是否知道吳的參與，則不重要。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官續指，吳與戴除了在案發期間使用 WhatsApp 頻繁溝通初選事宜外，還有電話交流及親身會面。吳對於戴為香港的付出表示感謝，並提出會盡力幫忙，又表達希望初選能夠成功。其後，吳向戴發出宣傳初選的文件，戴回應指兩人想法很接近。直至5月，雖然吳沒有參與任何協調會議，但戴仍然向吳匯報會上內容。吳又告知戴自己將會撰寫公開信件，呼籲選民不要投票予未能遵守協議的候選人，最後吳將草稿傳給戴，並獲其同意及使用。直至《國安法》頒佈後，吳告知戴他已放置頭版廣告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，吳一直了解並同意謀劃，唯一合理推論是他並非單獨行事。即使「三投三不投」的計劃可能是吳自行發起，但能夠確定的是，吳在2020年7月1日即《國安法》實施前，已經與戴有協議實行涉案謀劃，其後繼續提供積極幫助。而儘管35+計劃其他參加者並不知道吳的參與，但吳知道還有其他候選人參與，亦知道他做的事情已超出與戴的往來範圍。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官認為，吳自願並有意圖，繼續採取行動確保只有初選勝出者才能參與立法會選舉，協助民主派取得大多數議席；又指毫無疑問，吳知道謀劃目標是否決財政預算案，迫使特首回應「五大訴求」。法官肯定吳有意實施謀劃，並充分意識到謀劃結果是兩次解散立法會、令特首下台。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;基於上述，法官認為吳與戴之間的協議，跟戴和其他人之間的協議是相同；而吳擁抱「攬炒」概念，懷有顛覆意圖。法官並指，不論是《國安法》生效前後，吳亦屬協議一份子；即使在《國安法》生效後，吳仍對與戴執行謀劃的協議知情，繼續懷有顛覆政權的意圖，並執行謀劃中屬於他自己的部分。法官考慮上述因素後，裁定他罪成。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】初選案16名不認罪被告當中，共有14人罪成，部分被告任立法會議員多年，包括民主黨的黃碧雲及林卓廷、社民連的梁國雄。法官指，以他們任立法會議員及政治人物的豐富經驗，其中黃碧雲一定知道政府永遠不會同意落實「五大訴求」，而上述被告亦會知道否決財政預算案將帶來嚴重後果，令政府運作癱瘓。而雖然黃碧雲及梁國雄在初選中落敗，並沒有參選，但兩人仍表明支持獲勝團隊爭取35+。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃曾派代表出席兩次協調會議，當中戴耀廷提及〈真攬炒十步〉一文。警方在黃的電腦內，找到九西的最終協調文件，因此法官確信黃當時收到並曾閱讀文件，文件內列明當選者將否決財政預算案。另外，電腦內亦有民主黨的帖文截圖，內容表示民主黨會尊重及遵守協調機制。法官相信，黃提交提名表格的時候，必定注意到民主黨會遵守協議。此外，黃屬於九西訊息發佈區的成員之一，因此可以肯定黃知道計劃目的包括無差別否決預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官黃任議員經驗豐富必然知道政府不會同意五大訴求&quot;&gt;官：黃任議員經驗豐富、必然知道政府不會同意「五大訴求」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，黃與組織者同意推行相關謀劃，根據她的行為言論，以及提交報名表格時，她已經成為謀劃的參與者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官認為，以黃擔任立法會議員的經驗，以及作為經驗豐富（seasoned）的政治人物，她一定知道政府永遠不會同意「五大訴求」；故如果取得35+，勝選者必然會因政府堅拒屈服於威脅（never yield to their threat），而無差別否決預算案，因此肯定立法解散和特首下台，是黃意圖導致的結果。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又指，黃必然知道，預期政府無法或拒絕回應五大訴求，只是用作否決預算案的藉口。以黃的議會經驗，她亦必定知道無差別否決預算案會引發憲制危機，令政府運作陷入癱瘓。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黃在選舉論壇表明採納民主黨立場-官非受壓之言&quot;&gt;黃在選舉論壇表明採納民主黨立場 官：非受壓之言&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃曾在選舉論壇上表示，如戴耀廷認為需簽協議，民主黨願意簽；又指時任民主黨主席胡志偉和所有議員，會用盡憲制裡所有權力，包括否決預算案，以爭取五大訴求。法官肯定，黃的言論反映其真實立場，而非受其他參選者壓力之下所說的話；亦認為其立場與胡的提倡呼應，顯示她採納了民主黨的立場，即過半後無差別否決預算案。而且黃的言論與組織者在《國安法》後的說法是吻合的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在《國安法》生效後，胡志偉曾在論壇表明所有參選人均會運用否決權，迫使政府回應五大訴求。雖然黃不在場，但法官認為在「共謀者原則」下，相關言論可用來指證黃。而法官肯定於案發期間，在運用否決權的議題上，黃跟胡持相同立場，即會無差別否決預算案，迫使政府回應五大訴求。即使在《國安法》後，黃亦繼續在 Facebook 發布相關帖文。法官確信黃有意推行謀劃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃最終在初選中落敗，她與林卓廷、胡志偉、尹兆堅及其他黨友一同召記招，表明不會參選，但仍會支持獲勝團隊爭取35+。黃並呼籲進入議會的民主派團結，以落實「五大訴求」。法官指，她在落敗後仍然與其他黨員保持團結一致立場，黃在《國安法》生效後仍然是謀劃的一份子。考慮到黃有顛覆政權意圖，並藉參加初選意圖執行謀劃，故裁定她罪成。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於另一民主黨成員林卓廷，他亦選擇不作供。證據顯示，林沒有出席其參選的新界東選區任何協調會議，只是由莊榮輝代表出席，但林仍可透過群組接收協調文件。法官裁定，林已經了解35+計劃的目標。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;林曾經參與選舉論壇，在其辯論筆記可見，他提到民主黨前主席李柱銘反對「攬炒」，而林認為其意見不正確，法官認為顯示林與主席胡志偉同樣認為政權需要付出代價。筆記又提及「胡志偉一再公開回應話會積極運用。況且，其實我立法會四年沒有贊成過財政預算案」；又指不簽署聲明是基於對戴耀廷的尊重，「在會上都有講過如果戴教授真係有份嘢，我哋承諾咗會簽。」不過筆記沒有提及否決財案，因當時預算案還未出台，但法官指無可抗拒推論是林打算無差別否決預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方力陳，沒有證據顯示筆記由林作出。但法官不同意，因筆記是在林的住所被發現，而且林在論壇中的回答，與筆記內容大致相同。法官指筆記是林為出席論壇而準備的，內容代表了他的信念、認知及立場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官林必定知道否決財案負面後果&quot;&gt;官：林必定知道否決財案負面後果&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;綜合上述原因，法官認為林充分了解計劃的目的是否決財案，他亦知道和同意民主黨就否決預算案上的立場，而林指願意簽署由戴耀廷發起的聲明，這顯示他對於否決預算案沒有問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;林最終在初選中獲勝，並提交了立法會選舉的表格。而在初選後林和黃碧雲也在場的記者會上，胡志偉表明過半目的是迫使政府回應「五大訴求」，這進一步支持林在《國安法》後繼續參與計劃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官並提到，以林作為立法會議員的經驗，他必然知道否決預算案會對政府履行職能造成嚴重負面後果。而林雖在論壇筆記提及過往4年從未支持預算案，但「他過往提出任何原因，並非本案審訊的重點」，法官肯定林將無差別否決預算案，因此裁定罪成。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官梁國雄轉發fb帖文提否決財案-肯定知悉目標&quot;&gt;官：梁國雄轉發FB帖文提否決財案 肯定知悉目標&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;社民連的梁國雄選擇不作供。證據顯示，梁沒有出席新界東任何協調會議，而是由社民連副秘書長陳寶瑩代為出席。在第二次協調會議前，社民連主席黃浩銘致電區諾軒，要求他不要向任何人承諾否決財案。會上鄒家成提出要運用否決權，但陳寶瑩對此表達不同意，戴耀廷最後提議「積極運用」。由於這個議題引起激烈討論，因此法官相信社民連包括梁會關注。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官留意到，社民連的立場發生變化，他們在5月〈爭奪全面否決權持續不斷抗暴政 — 社會民主連線回應當前香港政治形勢變化的決議文〉提及，有人主張爭取過半議席，以取得全面否決權，而社民連必須審時度勢，檢討過往的立場，共同對抗中共暴政。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而梁國雄曾於 Facebook 轉發社民連帖文，提到無論35+或35-，泛民主派都應否決預算案以令政府回應五大訴求，法官肯定，梁收到協調文件，亦完全知道謀劃的目標，是取得立會過半後運用否決權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官過去否決原因非重點&quot;&gt;官：過去否決原因非重點&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，梁在提交提名表格時，同時附上「五大訴求，缺一不可，抵抗惡法，您我同行」的競選政綱。梁提到，人大常委會以政治逼害為目的，篩走涉危害國家安全的候選人，並強調35+和否決權的重要性。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;梁在論壇表示自己沒有簽署「墨落無悔」聲明，只是因為聲明重複了35+計劃的目標，又指他過往曾否決財案，對於再次實行並沒有問題。法官認為，梁作為資深政治人物，肯定會知道過半數議員持續否決對政府運作帶來的嚴重後果。他過去或有很多原因、或沒有原因否決，但不是本案的重點，法庭關注2020年的情況。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;梁最終在初選中落敗，他轉發社民連發表的聲明，表示自己不會參選，但會繼續支持35+。法官考慮上述因素，裁定他有顛覆政權的意圖而罪成。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ba8wfSf.png&quot; alt=&quot;image43&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】初選案16名不認罪被告之中，3名「抗爭派」何桂藍、鄒家成和余慧明均被裁定罪成。法官形容，何桂藍是「擁有最激進政見的參與者之一」，何參選是望將香港現行制度「連根拔起」、反對「一國兩制」，無疑意圖令特區陷入完全停頓並「破局」。至於發起「墨落無悔」的鄒家成，法官指他較激進、不接受中央對港主權，而他作為本土抗爭派，無疑入立法會是要以任何方法對抗政府或建制派，推翻現有政府。至於余慧明，法官指她參選目的是透過「破局」為政治制度帶來巨變，拒信她稱願意與政府談判；又指無疑若政府拒絕答應其訴求，余會連同其他民主派無差別否決預算案，破壞政府權力和合法性。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，就鄒家成發起「墨落無悔」，當中提及否決預算案，法官認為是填補戴耀廷稱毋須簽署協議的空白，反映各區均達成的共識，拒納鄒稱聲明與協議文件相似是「純粹巧合」。而就岑敖暉等在抗爭派記者會提否決預算案，法官指何桂藍無提出反對，正因他們說出她心中所想。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍是新東參選人，她選擇作供。何曾出席所有新東協調會議，法官指戴耀廷有何的電話號碼，無疑會向她發出新東協調文件，認為何有收到，亦完全知悉文件提及「會運用」否決權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何供稱，曾期望就參與者達成的協議簽署並公開，但最終該文件無出現，因此認為就運用否決權無達成共識。法官接納沒有任何簽署的共識，但認為以何對協議的態度，若組織者未能提供任何書面文件，例如新東協議，難以相信她無向組織者跟進；又留意到何在法庭上，曾數次因某些說話或事情明顯不符她理解或指示，而提出反對，認為何在法庭的證供不可信也不可靠。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官認為，何當時沒有投訴，實因她滿意所收到的協議文件內容；何聲稱是單一議題候選人，望將反修例運動精神帶入選舉，文件上「會運用」否決權條款正好反映此點。法官認為，何清楚知道謀劃目標及協議存在。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官拒納參選僅為鼓勵投票-實望入議會破局&quot;&gt;官拒納參選僅為鼓勵投票 實望入議會「破局」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何供稱參選只想鼓勵人投票以得到最大票數，令外界不會忽視，法官不接納是她參選的唯一理由。法官指，何不曾在競選集會、論壇、訪問、競選單張提及相關看法，亦從未聽過何向公眾提及，立法會取得35+、迫使政府答應五大訴求是不實際或不可能。相反，她曾稱要爭取立會過半，逼出北京不能接受的局面，又指議會不再是議事殿堂、是抗爭陣地，要文攻武鬥等，共同主題是運用權力否決預算案、反對政府及進行抗爭，認為她在法庭的證供與其帖文不一致。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官認為，何實希望實現行政長官及立法會雙普選，正如她反覆表示現行制度失能、無法為港人服務，她真正想要的是一個全新的政治制度及架構，而為了達成此點，她想獲得高票數進入立會抗爭、「破局」，令外界注意。法官認為，何最終提交提名表格參與初選，可證她是謀劃的一分子。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍最終勝出初選，並發文稱最重要是利用立會選舉製造政治張力及觸發憲政危機。法官指，無疑何所指的與戴耀廷提倡的一樣，並與她庭上稱35+不可能完全相反。法官指，若她向選民稱參選目標是取得多票數，認真懷疑她會否仍首位勝出；又指取得高票數但無立會過半，並不會直接觸發憲制危機。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍於7月15日出席抗爭派記者會，法官指岑敖暉會上提倡運用否決權癱瘓議會、會拒絕通過預算案，但何沒有提出反對；又指從片段可見，岑在回答應否否決預算案時，曾轉向何的方向，二人亦曾於競選活動一同出現，又共用選舉單張。同樣地，王百羽會上稱「其實我哋嗰個最大公因數就一定係堅決反對《財政預算案》，如果五大訴求冇落實的話」，但何事後無提出反對，供稱認為無需要，惟法官認為，何沒有投訴是因他們正正說出何心中所想。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何在8月4日於《洛杉磯時報》發文，表示反對派過半便會對北京造成惡夢，因可否決政府所有議案。法官認為，何在整個計劃的立場非常一致，無疑何不僅想破壞政府機能，亦想破壞政府的合法性。法官重申，雖然何供稱35+不可能、參選是望鼓勵投票，但她所做和所說的並不這樣反映。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官最後指，從何桂藍的言行可見，她是擁有最激進政見的參與者之一，希望能將香港現行政治架構及制度「連根拔起」（uproot），並反對「一國兩制」原則，可能她是那些會形容戴耀廷為不激進和不進步的人。法官認為，毫無疑問她參與謀劃的意圖，就是要嚴重干擾、阻撓、破壞特區政權機關依法履行職能，旨在顛覆國家政權，令特區陷入完全停頓（complete halt），望其「破局」主張會發生，因此裁定她罪成。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官鄒家成與社民連爭論後-戴才以積極運用迎合&quot;&gt;官：鄒家成與社民連爭論後 戴才以「積極運用」迎合&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成案發時是新東參選人，他選擇作供。鄒曾出席所有新東協調會議，但就第二次會議情況，法官不接納鄒稱是戴耀廷先提議「會積極運用」否決權，鄒才建議改用「會運用」；而是接納區諾軒說法，會前社民連副主席黃浩銘曾着區不要答應否決預算案，認為是鄒與社民連的爭論後，戴才提議以「積極運用」迎合不同意見。而「會運用」這個較確定的立場，最終在協調文件採納。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又指，鄒會後曾就不禮貌向戴道歉，戴向他索取電話號碼，戴沒理由不會向他發送協調文件，故肯定鄒有收到。而文件提及會運用否決權、其後亦可見於「墨落無悔」，故鄒清楚知道謀劃存在、其目標是否決預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官拒納墨落無悔與協議相似純粹巧合鄒是填補戴的空白&quot;&gt;官：拒納「墨落無悔」與協議相似純粹巧合、鄒是填補戴的空白&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成與梁晃維、張可森3人，在戴耀廷表示為免增DQ風險而毋須簽聲明後，發起「墨落無悔」聲明。法官認為，3人來自3個選區，但聲明提及「已取得共識的共同綱領」、「最大公因數」，認為合乎邏輯的推論，是當中運用否決權兩點聲明，是五區協調會議均達成的共識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又指，就辦初選、論壇、目標議席、替補機制4項共識，不具爭議性、亦非政治性，如真屬共同綱領，沒什麼阻止戴要求參選人簽署。法官拒納鄒指「共同綱領」僅指會上討論過的事項，指「墨落無悔」若非代表已達成的共識，3人無需花一個下午準備。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又指，隨着更多人簽署「墨落」，鄒甚至製作 Google 文件讓他人簽署，認為鄒不僅發起聯署，更是聲明的監護人（custodian and guardian）。法官不接納鄒稱，「墨落」與最終協議文件字眼相似，是「純粹巧合」，考慮到製作日期、字眼相似，「墨落」明顯是用來填補戴耀廷留下的空白，裁定鄒不可信也不可靠。而3人其後要求組織者回應，訊息亦清楚提及否決預算案的目標。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官鄒不接受中央對港主權&quot;&gt;官：鄒不接受中央對港主權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，鄒的競選口號為「拒絕殖民，民族抗暴」，亦曾於參選宣言形容香港被中國「殖民」，「說這個帖文的內容為激進，是說得保守了。」鄒又曾發文提到「同殖民者設計嘅議會制度攬炒到底」，雖然鄒稱要守護本土價值，但法官認為他實際上是不接受中央政府對香港的主權。法官亦認為，鄒庭上稱會以「五大訴求」作為唯一優先標準審視預算案、從無想過癱瘓政府，與其FB帖文非常不同，法庭拒絕接納。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官認為，從鄒的言行，他提交提名表格參選時，已是謀劃一分子。而鄒稱一直認為35+不可能，卻選擇繼續參選，明顯他一直都是和戴耀廷一樣，對「35+計劃」樂觀和有信心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官鄒較激進-參選為推翻現行政治制度&quot;&gt;官：鄒較激進 參選為推翻現行政治制度&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，明顯鄒抱有較為激進的理念或立場，他認為五大訴求有壓倒性民意支持、合法合理，自視為本土派、願景是確立香港民族地位。法官相信他會用盡所有方法迫使政府回應五大訴求，亦因此拒納他稱入議會後不會用武力、只會自衛。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，作為本土抗爭派，毫無疑問鄒家成入立法會的目的，是以任何方法對抗建制派或政府，他參加初選的意圖清晰，就是作為推翻現有政府和政治架構的第一步。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒最終勝出初選並出席抗爭派記者會，岑敖暉會上稱會否決預算案，法官拒納鄒稱不同意岑的說法，並認為毫無疑問鄒參選目的與戴耀廷一致，就是要破壞和推翻現行政治制度，無疑鄒有意圖顛覆香港政府，因此裁定他罪成。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官余慧明知悉及同意謀劃參選目的為政治制度帶來巨變&quot;&gt;官：余慧明知悉及同意謀劃、參選目的為政治制度帶來巨變&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於參選衞生服務界、時任醫管局員工陣線主席余慧明，法官認為有充份證據顯示她知悉及同意涉案謀劃，包括她簽署「墨落無悔」聲明，以及競選材料。法官指，毫無疑問，余參加「35+計劃」的目的，是要透過「破局」，為政治制度帶來「巨變（sea change）」，例如余3月曾發表〈踏上這攬炒旅途〉，提到「要破局，必須由制度上的變革開始，甚至把制度推倒重來也在所不惜」；同年8月又受訪稱若真要作出改變，「攬炒」是手段，望「破局而立新」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官余有意圖顛覆國家政權-不信願與政府談判&quot;&gt;官：余有意圖顛覆國家政權 不信願與政府談判&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官亦指，毫無疑問地，余有意圖嚴重干擾及阻礙政府職能，以達致新的政治制度，即是她所提及的「破局」，裁定她有意圖顛覆國家政權。其中余4月〈攬炒的時代革新意義〉曾稱，「全面否決所有政府提出的議案，藉此觸法基本法第五十條，令特首宣布解散立法會，製造憲政危機」；又曾受訪稱：「一定要用任何方法去推翻而家呢個政權、呢個政府，先可以做到一個改變。」而余盤問時沒有否認她有說過上述的話，僅稱訪問不夠仔細。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官認為，基於余在不同場合的公開說法、及其選舉材料，不接受余庭上稱願意與政府談判和作出讓步；相反，毫無疑問地，若政府拒絕答應余的政治訴求，她有意圖連同他人運用否決權，嚴重干擾、阻撓、破壞政權機關，意圖顛覆國家政權。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 余慧明（左）、岑敖暉（右）（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於余稱她不認為自己意圖所做的事是違法，法官不接納她當時真誠地相信透過無差別否決財案、故意導致「憲政危機」是合法的。無論如何，即使她真的如此相信，也不能構成合理辯解。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官余視政府為極權無意與之談判&quot;&gt;官：余視政府為「極權」、無意與之談判&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;《國安法》生效後，余曾受訪稱議會是「抗爭戰場」、要將抗爭意志帶入議會、不會為了當選而選擇暫時隱藏「攬炒」、「抗爭」等信念，又形容政府是「極權」；余亦曾於FB發文，指：「抗爭派參與選舉，早就下定決心無論議會內外都要用盡一切手段令暴政付出沈重代價⋯⋯極權面前，我地要團結一致，我地休戚與共。一息尚存，抗爭到底！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官認為，上述並非純綷余所稱的「談判策略」；相反，余視政府為「極權」，並無意與之談判。法官肯定余會將她所說的付諸實行，即在立法會連同其他民主派，無差別否決預算案，以圖破壞政府的權力和合法性；並深信《國安法》生效之後，余的想法也沒有改變。雖然余無參加過任何協調會議，但法庭信納《國安法》前被告已達成協議推行謀劃，而余是一分子，遂裁定罪成。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】初選案16名不認罪被告當中，共有14人罪成。罪成的民協施德來、何啟明及人民力量陳志全均稱，理解「墨落無悔」聲明沒有綑綁候選人須運用否決權，他們可自行選擇是否運用；但法官認為該解讀難以置信、荒謬，認為聲明字眼簡單直接，被告簽署是意圖無差別否決預算案。就施德來和何啟明稱認為否決權是《基本法》賦予，是與政府談判落實五大訴求的籌碼，法官亦指以二人從政經驗，肯定知道政府永遠不會接受「五大訴求」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又指，施德來於論壇多次提否決預算案，與其證供相反，其言行亦違背他稱認同民協的「維護中國主權」原則。而同為民協的何啟明指與施德來沒有統一立場，法官不接納，反指若兩人立場不一並發表不同言論，只會引起「政治災難」。至於陳志全街站提到否決預算案，解釋語氣較重，惟法官認為他是淡化自己參與。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施德來稱聲明無綑綁用否決權-官指解釋難以置信&quot;&gt;施德來稱聲明無綑綁用否決權 官指解釋難以置信&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案發時為民協主席的施德來，在初選中落敗，因此沒有參選。施作供時強調，理解「35+計劃」及「墨落無悔」聲明均沒有綑綁參選人使用否決權，他們可自行決定是否使用。法官認為其解釋令人難以置信，故不接納，認為聲明清晰表達簽署目的是展示抗爭意志，如果就運用否決權一點無約束力，毫不合理。法官又舉例反駁，指施在 Facebook 帖文表示已簽聲明，並承諾會運用立法會權力，包括否決預算案。這顯示他明顯知道聲明具約束力，因此才承諾簽署。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施視否決權為籌碼-官指必知政府不會接受五大訴求&quot;&gt;施視否決權為籌碼 官指必知政府不會接受五大訴求&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施亦供稱，認為否決權是《基本法》賦予的權力，視否決財案只屬「籌碼」，是迫特首回應「五大訴求」並解決社會矛盾的策略。惟法官指，施作為民協主席，及以其任區議員及從政的經驗，必然知道政府永遠不會接受「五大訴求」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施強調認同民協原則維護中國主權-官言行已違背&quot;&gt;施強調認同民協原則維護中國主權 官：言行已違背&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就施強調無意否決財政預算案，會考慮及討論預算案的優劣才決定，又指自己認同民協堅持的原則，包括維護中國主權及「一國兩制」、改善民生及服務基層等，他認為與政府維持工作關係非常重要，一旦當選將會和政府談判及溝通。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過法官指，施曾在選舉論壇上表明會兩次否決預算案、與政府沒有談判的餘地，又在FB帖文、選舉單張等多個場合表示會否決預算案，與其庭上證供相反，法官拒納他稱無意否決，亦不接納只是「選舉策略」。法官認為，施的言行，顯示他已違背民協秉持的價值觀，包括維護中國主權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官亦拒納施稱會與政府談判，指施望透過稱否決預算案而爭取選民支持，亦會繼續保持民協進步的立場和新形象，若他收回承諾，就與「政治自殺」無異。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，《國安法》後，施仍在選舉論壇稱要「全面攬炒」、仍無撤回「墨落無悔」帖文，而他初選落敗後無參選，但仍發文要求獲勝的候選人達到35+。法官肯定，施與組織者一致同意，將會無差別否決財案，並相信他會實行，而施在《國安法》後仍然參與，具意圖顛覆，因此罪成。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何啟明理解墨落可選擇用什麼權-官批解讀荒謬&quot;&gt;何啟明理解「墨落」可選擇用什麼權 官批解讀荒謬&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案發時為民協副主席的何啟明，最終在初選中獲勝，並有參選。法官認為，何了解「35+計劃」的目標，是要否決財政預算案。何供稱以其理解，否決權是《基本法》所賦予，又認為「墨落無悔」聲明沒有綑綁否決，參選人可自行選擇運用哪一項《基本法》權力。法官認為其解讀「荒謬（absurd）」，又認為如聲明只是陳述明顯的事（state the obvious），即議員可運用《基本法》賦予的權力，是多餘（otiose）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又反駁指，若參選人能自行選擇運用什麼權力，將會很難達致大多數，集體向政府討價還價。而何稱會用任何《基本法》權力迫使政府回應五大訴求，但不會運用否決權，是與聲明的字面意思和脈絡相反。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官指何啟明證供不合理認為民協就否決有統一立場&quot;&gt;官指何啟明證供不合理、認為民協就否決有統一立場&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官批評何是不可靠證人，其證供不合理。法官不接納何所指，他與民協主席施德來在初選事宜上沒有溝通，而且沒有統一立場。雖然兩人的選區不同，但不會導致兩人缺乏溝通；而且運用否決權是大家都關心的話題，法官認為兩個競選團隊之間無溝通是不合理，相反他們更需要互相協調。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/PJ6SuOx.png&quot; alt=&quot;image51&quot; /&gt;
▲ 何啟明（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又指，根據施所稱當時民協是一個小政黨，亦逐漸被邊緣化，因此對兩人來說，最重要是需在選舉中至少得到一議席，亦即至少其中一人在初選中獲勝。法官認為兩個團隊採取不同競選策略是有違常理，因為若兩人在否決權上立場不統一，並發表不同言論，對民協而言只會是政治災難。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官確信兩人就選舉策略曾進行協調，並需確保在公開場合發表的言論是一致，包括否決財案，兩人必需有一致防線以抵禦預期中候選人會作出的攻擊。對於何表示他與施採取不同的選舉策略，法官認為這與何曾表明支持「墨落無悔」聲明的說法不相符，何不單止簽署聲明，更在轉發聲明時提及施的名字，這顯示兩人之間存在協調，在運用否決權上有統一立場，即會無差別否決財案。法官拒絕接納何所稱，民協核心小組沒有討論過否決權，同時不接納他稱成員可以自行決定有關立場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官亦拒絕接納何表示不知道「35+計劃」的目標，因協調會議上張崑陽和戴耀廷曾討論否決權，但何沒有提出反對。何供稱覺得「35+」可在立法會產生制衡，與政府談判以實現「五大訴求」，但法官不接納其說法，因憑着何在政治領域上的經驗，肯定他知道政府永遠不會接受「五大訴求」，這只是用作否決預算案的藉口；而若真的否決也會令政府運作癱瘓。法官進一步指，何曾在選舉小冊子中表示獲得否決權才可以實現訴求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又指，若何理解共同綱領只是區諾軒所指的4點，而不包括否決權，那他在論壇上被問到為何首先簽署聲明時，就不會回答指香港人希望見證民主派達致35+。何之所以簽署，是完全同意無差別否決財案。在《國安法》生效後，何並沒有在 Facebook 上收回對聲明的支持，他仍堅持初選目標之一是展現民主派團結對抗政權的決心。何在初選獲勝後，即宣布參選並表明自己會站在立法會前線對抗政權。法官相信何知道無差別否決財案是不合法，這構成濫用權力。最後裁定他罪成。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官指人民力量同意民主派之間有共同政治理念&quot;&gt;官指人民力量同意民主派之間有共同政治理念&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案發時為人民力量主席的陳志全選擇作供。他沒有出席任何新界東協調會議，只是派代表出席，事後對方向陳匯報。陳得知會上談及否決權，他們將字眼由「運用」改為「積極運用」，但陳認為兩者沒有太大分別。法官認為，即使陳沒有出席會議，但他仍充分了解計劃會運用否決權。雖然陳不同意自己會無差別使用否決權，但他承認有閱讀戴關於〈真攬炒十步〉的文章，因此他必然了解計劃目的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳提及人民力量過往拒絕參與民主派任何初選，但今次他們同意參與，是基於一個條件，即民主派候選人之間必須有共同政治行動綱領。人民力量在 Facebook 重申，如各方要舉行初選的話，他們應該制定共同的政治行動，以對政府作出制衡。法官確信人民力量同意民主陣營的政治理念，即運用否決權。另外，人民力量曾在 Facebook 轉發「墨落無悔」聲明。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官陳淡化對計劃了解和參與&quot;&gt;官：陳淡化對計劃了解和參與&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳強調，雖然他簽署聲明，但內文沒有提及將所有候選人綑綁為同一立場，即運用否決權。法官並不接納此說法，因內文簡單直接，亦正是共同政治行動綱領，即陳參選的原因。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就陳於街站曾提否決預算案，陳庭上稱語氣較重，是「隨口噏」，法官拒絕接納，認為陳採用的字眼和語氣與他此前一致，認為陳只是在庭上淡化自己對計劃的了解和參與。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/EDQe91z.png&quot; alt=&quot;image52&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又指，人民力量副主席譚得志曾在論壇上表明會否決預算案，法官認為二人以相同政綱參選；而初選前一天，兩人亦在宣傳片提及否決預算案、解散立法會及迫特首下台。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳在初選中獲勝，並提交提名表，同時附上「抗爭到底」的宣傳單張。陳其後收到選舉主任提問，但法官指其回答迴避問題、遠非誠實（evasive and far from frank），只是避免被DQ。法官確信陳知道計劃目的，繼續參加是顛覆政權，故裁定罪成。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/yOztZiF.png&quot; alt=&quot;image53&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】初選案16名不認罪被告之中，時任灣仔區議會主席楊雪盈被裁定罪成。沒有作供的楊，無在FB發布「墨落無悔」聲明，但名字出現在其他人帖文，法官認為在無相反證據下，唯一合理推論是她知悉聲明內容，亦是強烈證據她同意及有意推動涉案謀劃；又指她雖無將否決預算案與五大訴求綑綁，但考慮到她不同場合提及爭取過半落實五大訴求的決心、對謀劃的認知和作為區議員的經驗，無可抗拒推論是她意圖聯同其他民主派，無差別否決預算案，並知道會嚴重破壞政府職能。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同被裁定罪成的區政聯盟柯耀林，法官拒信其選舉助理證供，認為柯對涉案謀劃完全知情，而他曾發文表示立法會不再是討論政治事務的場所，無可抗拒推論是他不會審核任何預算案；加上柯認為政治制度腐敗，簽署「墨落無悔」不足為奇。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官楊雪盈fb無發布墨落-惟無相反證據下推論知悉內容&quot;&gt;官：楊雪盈FB無發布「墨落」 惟無相反證據下推論知悉內容&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊雪盈是港島參選人，沒有作供。3次港島協調會議中，楊派代表出席首次，並親身出席之後兩次，其辦公室電腦被搜到「35+立會過半計劃 民主派港島協調機制（初稿）」，提及「會積極運用立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案」，迫使特首回應「五大訴求」。法官指，在沒有其他相反的證據下，唯一合理推論是楊知道「運用」或「積極運用」否決權，是「35+計劃」的重要元素。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;雖然楊雪盈無在FB發布「墨落無悔」帖文，但其名字出現在其他聯署人的帖文上，法官再次指，在沒有其他相反證據下，唯一合理推論是她知悉「墨落無悔」的內容，及知悉其他參選人支持該聲明，而她對「墨落」的贊同，是強烈證據她同意及有意推動涉案謀劃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又指，《國安法》後，楊與戴耀廷等出席7月9日記者會，戴會上稱35+目標是爭取立法會控制權，行使憲制權力要求政府問責。法官認為，楊當時必然知悉，「35+計劃」目標是取得立會過半，迫政府回應五大訴求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官電腦文件指政府不公-一定會否決財案&quot;&gt;官：電腦文件指政府不公 「一定會」否決財案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官續引述楊的參選宣言，提及「五大訴求、議會過半是我們共同呼喚的將來……」；而從其電腦搜獲的文件，問及是否一定會否決預算案時，提及「是。政府多年來提出的財政預算案，都是由上而下，幫唔到真正有需要既人……提出預算案既政府亦唔係直選，整個過程本身就唔公義。看不到非民選的政府，會提出符合香港人利益的財政預算案」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官認為，相關文件是為楊初選準備的「統一口徑（lines to take）」或論壇筆記，楊知悉並同意。雖然楊沒有政治聯繫，亦沒有將否決預算案與五大訴求綑綁，但上述文件提及她「一定會否決」預算案，因政府不公，不會提出符合港人利益的預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，「知悉」不等於「同意」或「協議」，但考慮到楊在不同場合及文件提及協助民主派立會過半，以落實五大訴求的決心，以及她對謀劃目標的認知、作為區議員的經驗，無可抗拒推論是她意圖聯同其他民主派，在立法會無差別否決預算案，亦知道如預算案否決，會造成嚴重干擾、阻撓和破壞政府職能。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官落選後fb帖文-證意圖按協議及墨落行事&quot;&gt;官：落選後FB帖文 證意圖按協議及「墨落」行事&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官續引楊雪盈在初選落選後的帖文，提及得票不足，「我一定會尊重選民的決定，遵守初選協定，跟從民主派協調的安排」，又指「希望大家一定要在未來的正式選舉中，給各位初選勝出的代表，投下支持的一票！民主派能團結地在議會發揮最大的抗爭力量，難道不是我們共同的願望嗎？」法官認為，帖文不單與港島區協調協議一致，亦證明楊意圖按協議及「墨落無悔」行事；楊亦知道她支持的其他候選人，同樣意圖無差別否決預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方證人趙家賢曾稱，就戴耀廷提否決預算案，楊曾向他稱「咪由佢講吓囉」，認為議員入立會後也是自主行事。惟法官不給予任何比重，認為相關陳述是「混合式陳述」，亦沒有楊的證供支持，無可抗拒推論是她意圖顛覆國家政權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，在沒有楊的解釋下，肯定她是謀劃的一分子，意圖顛覆國家政權。法庭無忘記楊於2020年7月底報名參選立法會正式選舉，明顯違反協調協議及「墨落無悔」，惟法官指，那是在區諾軒和趙家賢宣布退出初選後發生。法庭不會揣測楊是否「靈童」，但無論如何，楊報名參選的行為，並無影響法官裁定她案發時知道並同意參與謀劃，因此裁定她罪成。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官指柯耀林選舉經理陳展浚非誠實可靠-認為柯有關注初選動態&quot;&gt;官指柯耀林選舉經理陳展浚非誠實可靠 認為柯有關注初選動態&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於參選新東的區政聯盟柯耀林選擇不作供，只是傳召其選舉經理陳展浚作供。法官裁定陳並非誠實可靠證人，其證供與真相有差距。陳表示柯工作繁忙，故沒有密切關注政治動態的習慣，但法官不接納，指柯活躍於政壇多年。法官亦對陳稱柯閱報時只會留意其物業管理工作方面的廣告感懷疑，認為陳證供嘗試令柯與初選保持距離，但實際上柯非常留意最近的政治動態，亦密切關注戴耀廷說的話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官亦指，由於初選涉及大量資金，約30至50萬，因此柯肯定會密切關注組織者的一言一行，因一旦組織者作出政治方向或後勤安排的改變，都會影響其選舉策略、財政資源及成功機會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳表示無收到組織者的文件-官批評不合邏輯&quot;&gt;陳表示無收到組織者的文件 官批評不合邏輯&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳展浚表示自己沒有出席協調會議，但法官認為他也是嘗試讓自己與初選保持距離。對於陳表示沒有收到協調文件，法官批評是不合邏輯及令人難以置信，因戴耀廷有柯的聯絡電話。法官肯定柯有收到文件，知道當中提及運用否決權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對陳指組織者有責任通知協調會議內容，法官批評說法荒謬，指陳只是嘗試描述柯對謀劃的認知有限；就陳稱留意到柯沒有將戴儲存為聯絡人，法官亦質疑他並非一個如此注意細節的人。法官亦不相信陳聲稱沒有看過戴的文章、及戴在初選記者會上說的話，因若屬實，陳作為選舉經理的任務便是失敗。法官因此裁定柯對謀劃完全知情，清楚知道案發時有協議取得立會過半。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官柯認為政治制度腐敗-簽署墨落無悔不足為奇&quot;&gt;官：柯認為政治制度腐敗 簽署「墨落無悔」不足為奇&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官留意到，柯曾發文指立法會不再是討論政治事務的場所，無可抗拒的推論是他不會審核任何預算案和政府議案。柯亦提及民主派取得35+後，會獲得主導權，又表明會團結抗爭力量，支持抗爭陣營對抗敵人，並肯定自己會參與協調。法官指，柯覺得當時的政治制度已經腐敗，柯因此簽署「墨落無悔」聲明也不足為奇，而他支持聲明，是因聲明反映了他對協調會議上達成共識的理解。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，柯發文向選民表明自己堅決抵抗的立場，又表示即使可能入獄亦不會退縮。法官確信他參與謀劃，意圖嚴重干擾、阻撓及破壞政府履行職能。柯亦在選舉政綱中表示，香港人不能再以被動態度對抗極權。法官認為，在他提交提名表時，他已經是謀劃一份子。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指柯政綱提出項目需用財案撥款-官拒接納&quot;&gt;辯方指柯政綱提出項目需用財案撥款 官拒接納&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方力陳，柯在政綱中提及的項目需用到財政預算案的撥款，因此他不會無差別否決。法官不同意說法，因他在選舉單張中表明暴政鎮壓越趨加劇，高壓殖民統治會令香港人抗爭更加激烈；而香港人需要勇於抵抗的立法會議員。法官認為他對「殖民統治」的看法與鄒家成相近。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，柯列出的政治議程沒有細節，法官指很難判斷屬於過往工作還是當選後的追求，即使是後者，這些項目也可以在當時政治體制被取代之後繼續執行。法官認為，柯參與初選及立法會選舉的意圖顯而易見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官柯無表示不支持攬炒-任議員必知否決財案後果&quot;&gt;官：柯無表示不支持「攬炒」 任議員必知否決財案後果&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方亦強調，柯與不支持「攬炒」的參選人劉凱文聯合宣傳，因此他並無顛覆意圖。法官不同意，因柯沒有在選舉單張中表示不支持「攬炒」，而劉受訪時亦曾表示以香港的政治局勢而言，「攬炒」是必然的結果。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官相信，柯作為經驗豐富的區議員，深知持續否決財案會對政府履行職能上造成嚴重負面後果。而他初選落敗後呼籲選民繼續支持其他勝出者，法官認為他是呼籲他人繼續支持謀劃，具意圖顛覆政府，因此裁定他罪成。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】初選案16名不認罪被告之中，公民黨鄭達鴻被裁定罪成，其黨友李予信則罪脫。鄭曾供稱反對黨否決預算案，惟法官指，他在公民黨記者會上無提反對、而是舉牌，可強烈推論他決定遵循黨魁楊岳橋表達的黨立場；而他不同場合的公開發言亦顯示他忠於黨立場，為獲黨支持參選，打算跟隨更激進的路線，當選後無差別否決預算案。法官不同意鄭僅盲目背誦黨路線，認為他不會拿自己政治前途冒險，採取與黨魁相違的立場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同被裁定罪成的彭卓棋，法官指其政網表明必須運用否決權，否決所有不公義議案。法官不接納彭在論壇表示不惜癱瘓政府等，只是發表「選舉語言」，認為他是「投機取巧」及不可信的證人，作出對自己有利的說法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官鄭達鴻必知公民黨同意戴謀劃很多候選人同意用否決權&quot;&gt;官：鄭達鴻必知公民黨同意戴謀劃、很多候選人同意用否決權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;公民黨鄭達鴻是港島參選人，審訊時有作供。法官接納控方證人區諾軒稱，2020年2月戴耀廷與包括梁家傑的公民黨成員見面，鄭曾參與公民黨記者會前的籌備會議，譚文豪提議該黨帶頭以否決權為籌碼爭取五大訴求。而在3月25日記者會上，梁家傑表示支持民主派協調，達致議會過半，楊岳橋及譚文豪亦承諾公民黨會否決財政預算案，要求落實五大訴求，相關說法與戴耀廷文章吻合，無疑他們所指的是戴提出的「35+計劃」。法官又指，鄭電腦內有戴文章〈齊上齊落 目標35+〉截圖，提倡取得足夠議席否決預算案，認為不可抗拒的推論是鄭在3月底必定留意到，至少上述的公民黨成員，同意公民黨應該參與戴的計劃，更重要的是，他們同意推行該謀劃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又指，鄭參與了港島協調會議，並留意到有人提出使用否決權的議題，接納區諾軒指只有司馬文表達反對。至於6月的「墨落無悔」聲明，鄭表示有與黨員商討是否簽署，而鄭電腦內亦有相關文件，顯示聲明獲公民黨及其他人贊同，鄭在6月初必然留意到很多候選人已表達同意使用否決權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官若公民黨無共同訊息召記招是違背常識&quot;&gt;官：若公民黨無共同訊息召記招是違背常識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄭達鴻供稱，曾在籌備會議和公民黨討論是否簽署「墨落無悔」聲明時，表達不同意，不過其意見不獲接納；又指記者會上楊岳橋等3人表達的意見，並非所有出席記者會人士的統一立場，至少郭家麒和郭榮鏗有不同意見，他同意後兩者說法。惟法官指，如公民黨沒有共同訊息傳達而召記者會，是違背常識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又引郭榮鏗會上提及，提倡運用包括否決預算案的權力；郭家麒則指市民要求五大訴求很清楚，無論任何人當選都要要求政府回應，又指如撥款胡亂增加警察開支，有責任反映，直至政府交出合理的預算案。法官認為，郭家麒判斷預算案是否合理的標準，是政府會否正面回應五大訴求，而發言者說法的差異，只是重點不同，但實質內容一樣，不接納鄭達鴻稱會上各人表達的訊息不一致，亦不接納鄭如此相信。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官不同意鄭僅盲目背誦公民黨路線&quot;&gt;官不同意鄭僅盲目背誦公民黨路線&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄭又供稱，若然當選會申請公民黨豁免機制，不跟從黨就預算案的立場投票，並會審視預算案的優劣，不會無差別投反對票。惟法官認為，鄭記者會上沒有對楊岳橋等人的意見表達不同意，反而站在他們身後，高舉「35+議會過半實現五大訴求」標語牌。法官認為，無論鄭在籌備會議說過什麼，強烈推論他在3月25日已決定遵循梁家傑和楊岳橋表達的黨立場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，鄭之後的言行進一步強化了上述推論，包括電台節目表示「共同目標就係撼動個政權去用35 plus」，而戴耀廷要求不簽聲明是想有「走棧位」，但有人想繼續有共同願望，因此有聯署，而公民黨已簽署。法官不接納鄭的言論只是盲目背誦公民黨的路線，指明顯他承認候選人有共同目標撼動政權，亦同意公民黨簽署「墨落無悔」。法官亦拒絕接納鄭指公民黨以黨名義簽署能提供彈性，認為說法不合邏輯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又指，鄭曾在公民黨街站稱民主派要團結力爭35+，可以在立法會否決預算案，為香港人爭取落實五大訴求，認為其說法不僅是「選舉修辭」；而鄭提交初選提名表格時，政綱提及「以關鍵否決權促使政府落實『五大訴求』」，雖然是基於公民黨統一範本，但認為鄭作出的承諾令他日後難以獲黨豁免。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官公開發言顯示忠於公民黨否決立場&quot;&gt;官：公開發言顯示忠於公民黨否決立場&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，鄭FB帖文曾稱會否決預算案逼特首下台，從而爭取五大訴求，法官認為不論帖文是否由鄭本人撰寫，他不可能對帖文不知情；而鄭選舉論壇上也提及要否決預算案。就鄭有份參與拍攝的公民黨初選宣傳短片中，楊岳橋曾稱會否決預算案，法官亦不接納鄭稱別無選擇拍攝，指他明顯可以選擇，而他選擇遵從黨的路線，以得到支持參選，實現成為立法會議員的夢想，不接納他會採取與黨魁「莊嚴承諾」相違的立場，拿自己的政治前途冒險。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，鄭公開發言顯示他忠於（committed to）公民黨否決預算案的立場，裁定鄭於3月已同意謀劃，並為獲黨支持參選，打算跟隨更激進的路線，即當選後無差別否決預算案。而就區諾軒還柙時曾寫信予鄭指他被公民黨「連累」，法官不給予任何比重，認為區諾軒不能代表鄭的想法說話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官拒納公民黨國安法後改變立場&quot;&gt;官：拒納公民黨《國安法》後改變立場&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就鄭供稱，《國安法》後公民黨曾修改政綱，法官認為當中仍提及「否決財政預算案，迫使政府落實五大訴求」，與《國安法》前單張無分別。而公民黨用「以言入罪 無字政綱」代替初選政綱，惟法官認為，一個合理的人會解讀口號為對《國安法》的抗議，無從顯示公民黨改變否決預算案，迫政府回應五大訴求的立場，又認為公民黨的修改只為減少候選人被DQ的風險。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官不接納鄭達鴻認為35+不可能，認為他被DQ後退黨，只因對黨的不滿及夢想破碎；他清楚知道「35+計劃」目標，並意圖跟隨黨的否決路線。法官又指，以鄭作為區議員及其政治經驗，必然知道政府不會接受「五大訴求，缺一不可」；加上其法律背景，他肯定知道推行謀劃意味解散立法會兩次，最終特首下台。考慮到他在《國安法》後持續參與初選，唯一合理推論是他意圖顛覆國家政權，因此裁定他罪成。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官彭卓棋選舉單張印戴攬炒十步-清楚知道計劃目標&quot;&gt;官：彭卓棋選舉單張印戴「攬炒十步」 清楚知道計劃目標&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭卓棋是港島參選人，他不屬任何政黨，於審訊時選擇作供。法官接納區諾軒提及，他和戴耀廷曾於2020年2至3月與彭會面，但彭不關心立會過半或否決權，只關心選票方式，因會影響其勝算。而彭有出席首次港島區協調會議，會上有人提出使用否決權的議題，不過各方尚未就「運用」或「積極運用」字眼達成協議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭的電腦內有選舉單張草稿，標題為「共同協調人民奪權 齊上齊落對抗極權」，首頁提到民主派35+願景是提倡否決財案，迫當權者回應五大訴求，單張背面印有戴耀廷的「攬炒十步」時間表。法官因此確信，彭清楚知道戴耀廷提倡利用「35+計劃」取得立會過半，否決預算案，迫政府答應五大訴求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官彭政綱表明會否決所有不公義議案&quot;&gt;官：彭政綱表明會否決所有「不公義」議案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官續指，彭在政綱表明必須運用否決權，「否決所有不公義議案（包括財政預算案）……迫使當權回應『五大訴求』……阻撓不公議會進行」；又提到「『35+』是選舉主軸，以『議會抗爭攬炒』迫使政府回應『五大訴求』，這是沒有妥協的空間」、「不論是純政治表態的議案還是具約束力的議案，我們也不應該放過任何一個機會去展示抗爭意志」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官認為，彭是表達對抗政府的堅定決心，他將「35+計劃」、「立法會抗爭」、「攬炒」及「五大訴求」連結一起，又指立法會「腐爛」現象持續已久，與他指預算案及立法會程序「不公」的說法相呼應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;彭稱有意大灣區創業-官指與反政府無矛盾&quot;&gt;彭稱有意大灣區創業 官指與反政府無矛盾&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，雖然彭稱有興趣探索大灣區商機，並協助年輕企業家利用政府資助作相關事情，但不接納辯方所指，基於上述利益，彭不大可能有意圖與他人否決財案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官舉例反駁，彭在政綱中就經濟改革表明要「推倒既有經濟結構」，主張「先拆除，後重建」，因此彭一方面推動創業，一方面持反對政府的政治理念，兩者並無必然衝突。法官認為，考慮到選舉單張及彭的教育程度，他必然意識到常人會理解其政綱的意思，是當選後會否決財案迫使政府回應五大訴求，這亦是他想傳達的訊息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;再者，彭曾經簽署「墨落無悔」聲明，並且在選舉論壇上表明：「我哋嘅敵人就係共產黨，我哋入到議會不惜以肢體抗爭、癱瘓政府、否決財政預算案，亦會用議員身位支援街頭抗爭」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官彭作供投機取巧不可信&quot;&gt;官：彭作供「投機取巧」、不可信&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官認為，觀察彭在庭上作供，認為他是個「投機取巧」及不可信的證人，作出對自己有利的說法。法官亦不接納他聲稱自己僅發表「選舉語言」，實際上無意執行。法官又指，彭明顯將政府及共產黨刻劃成「敵人」，表明不公義的預算案必須被否決，亦無意與他一再形容為「暴政」的政府談判，唯一合理推論是他完全贊同「35+計劃」的目標，意圖嚴重破壞政府和政權的合法性。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就彭卓棋稱《國安法》後曾撕爛單張，以示放棄政綱，法官也不接納，指彭從未公開宣布放棄政綱，單張仍可見反抗政府的訊息，認為彭稱沒有政綱下參選不是講真話。相反，法官認為彭派發撕爛單張的行為，是含蓄地向公眾傳達反抗政府的決心。考慮上述因素後，法官裁定他罪成。&lt;/p&gt;

But even with the best intentions, fast-paced adoption and implementation of AI in the public sector will involve significant challenges.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The widespread adoption of AI technologies comes with much promise. In the public sector in particular, AI integration has the potential to bring greater efficiency, for example by speeding up administrative services, thereby saving taxpayer money and offering better services to citizens. On a more macro level, AI integration in the public sector – civilian and military alike – is also supposed to secure an economic and military advantage to the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government already envisages widespread adoption of AI, and is encouraging civil servants to familiarise themselves with generative AI at work, for instance. The Cabinet Office is currently running a trial for an AI-powered chatbot, intended to make an interactive document analysis tool accessible to all civil servants. However, while the aim is for all government departments to use AI and support the wider goal of becoming a “global AI superpower”, in practice, many hurdles arise for the adoption of AI by the public sector. These range from the lack of skills and training in day-to-day engagement with AI technologies to a lack of flexible procurement and technical leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;knowledge-and-skills-in-the-private-sector&quot;&gt;Knowledge and Skills in the Private Sector&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key challenge the public sector faces is that much of the knowledge and experience around AI development, research and application currently lies in the private sector, whose deep pockets drive R&amp;amp;D and attract much sought-after talent. No public spending commitments come close to the budgets of the private sector – compare the UK’s £900 million commitment to build a supercomputer to the $35 billion committed by AWS to data centres in Virginia. Of course, many consultancies offer well paid advice to public sector entities on how to navigate this challenge. But it takes more and especially different kinds of partnerships with the private sector to enable greater information and knowledge exchange between public and private organisations. Such partnerships are needed not only to enable the public sector to reap the benefits of AI but also to design effective regulation and governance to mitigate any risks that arise. The National Cyber Security Centre’s Industry 100 scheme, through which public institutions host cyber security experts from the private sector for one day a week or month, is a laudable model that could be replicated in an AI context. This would allow the public sector to benefit from private-sector expertise while the private sector can access a greater network and gain insights into the government’s work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;learning-from-defence-procurement&quot;&gt;Learning from Defence Procurement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Challenges also arise given the public sector’s slow procurement of AI technologies. The Ministry of Defence (MoD), for example, spent £25 billion with UK industry in 2022/23. Yet industry has long complained about the MoD as a customer, and these complaints extend to its procurement of AI. The MoD published its strategy for exploiting AI (the “Defence Artificial Intelligence Strategy”) in 2022, but has since faced criticism for failing to sufficiently detail how it will become “the world’s most effective, efficient, trusted and influential Defence organisation for our size [in terms of AI]”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A greater range of partnerships are needed not only to enable the public sector to reap the benefits of AI but also to design effective regulation and governance to mitigate any risks that arise&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies, both large and small, have not received clear demand signals on the MoD’s operational objectives, hindering the deployment of successful AI in defence. Besides a lack of clarity on priorities and requirements (which, granted, the Defence AI Centre hopes to rectify), uncertainty persists over how to integrate AI with existing systems. The MoD contains a myriad of “architectural standards, patterns and interfaces”, thereby limiting data accessibility (the lifeblood of AI functionality) and AI integration into decision-making, analysis and training processes. Similarly, the rather disparate efforts at AI procurement across a host of defence entities – from front-line commands to the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory – inhibit AI’s efficiency benefits. The Integration Design Authority (IDA) will alleviate some of these frictions by incorporating a level of AI oversight into its efforts; however, it cannot bear sole responsibility for this task, as the IDA was created to facilitate integration across the whole of Defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, most of the AI innovation occurs in smaller firms and start-ups, especially small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), while many of the MoD’s procurement processes are overwhelmingly oriented towards the largest defence contractors – the so-called “defence primes”. The regulatory framework requires experience of navigating the complex MoD bureaucracy as well as sufficient capital to sustain one’s firm through the long process. SMEs often have neither the £25,000 monthly revenue stream to stay afloat, nor the decades of organisational knowledge about the MoD’s security and classification protocols: their choice is either to fail or to pivot away from the MoD to easier customers. Ongoing efforts to shorten innovation cycles include the new “Integrated Procurement Model” with a focus on software-oriented procurement, which requires maintaining a stronger relationship with companies in order to ensure constant, iterative updates. To secure the best technological advantage, MoD and wider public procurement need to become more agile to include smaller companies that provide cutting-edge technology, even if not at scale yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;changing-the-public-sector-career-mindset&quot;&gt;Changing the Public Sector Career Mindset&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MoD at least has an AI strategy; 76% of government departments don’t, even though over a third of surveyed government departments questioned on the use of AI by the public sector are already deploying AI. Declaring the aim to become a global AI superpower is perhaps an ambitious target, but it is by no means sufficient in terms of setting useful guidance and vision for government departments. The UK’s public sector needs more tangible goals to work towards. This means identifying in more concrete terms what being an “AI superpower” looks like in the next 3, 5, 10 and 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Only when its people support the government’s aim of being an AI superpower will the UK be able to turn ambition into reality&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting out and implementing such a vision needs credible leadership at all levels and in all government departments. Yet the career civil servants and generalists who often fill these positions can easily lack the technological understanding and vision that a technician from the private sector, or even a specialist within the public sector, might offer. Thus, external hiring needs to become more agile to offer private-sector tech visionaries and specialists the opportunity to come into the public sector on a senior level and for a shorter timeframe than is currently the case, while still benefitting from full integration and trust from public sector colleagues. Similarly, technology experts already working within the public sector must be able to be promoted to leadership positions, not only to offer their expertise on new levels but also to show that a long-lasting technology career within the public service is possible. Only by hiring and retaining adequate technology leadership will the public sector be able to successfully roll out AI technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;navigating-the-talent-terrain&quot;&gt;Navigating the Talent Terrain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technically focused leaders are crucial for planning and envisioning strategies, but are entirely reliant upon the skills held within government departments to enact their policies. Unfortunately, the National Audit Office’s autumn 2023 survey of government bodies found that 70% of respondents described a lack of skills as a barrier to AI adoption. Difficulties in hiring and retaining individuals with the necessary skills to develop and deploy AI have intensified in recent years, exacerbated by uncompetitive salaries relative to the private sector (which faces its own skills shortage). Every entity of the UK government needs greater expertise in machine learning, data management and cloud computing, along with a broader spectrum of software skills and lawyers trained in AI ethics and the corresponding legal compliance. Yet the demand for skills must extend beyond experts. Non-technical employees must familiarise themselves with simple data processes while understanding the function of their organisation’s models in order to trust the outputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government is demonstrating its commitment to equipping younger generations with the skills for a data-driven world. But this investment is geared towards the long-term upskilling of the UK economy and does not mitigate the current shortcomings of an under-skilled civil service. Currently, the government is filling this gap with “contractors, agency workers, and temporary staff”, who comprise a third of “digital and data professionals”. Despite the government commitment to reduce reliance upon temporary workers in order to cut costs, the lead time on large-scale upskilling indicates that the government will need to continue to buy in skills before developed skills have matured. This transition must be accelerated by including data skills as part of on-the-job learning for all civil service roles, providing a boost in digital literacy without more major expenditure in formal training. Similarly, personnel management must become more porous to permit expertise to flow out of and back into government with ease. Flexible career paths between the public and private sectors are needed to ensure that private-sector knowledge, ideas and skills can be brought into government at no additional cost to the taxpayer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-people-challenge-as-much-as-a-technology-one&quot;&gt;A People Challenge as Much as a Technology One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much can be debated about what the right aim is for a grand AI strategy, how the public sector can procure AI technologies and who has the vision and leadership to work towards AI implementation in the public sector. Most importantly, however, the UK cannot become an AI superpower unless the ambition is reflected in wider society. This includes early access to learning opportunities and safe engagement to try out human-machine teaming, as well as a clear signal of job opportunities rather than threats to the labour market. Critically, it also requires strong engagement with ethical concerns and other risks that need to be addressed to meaningfully assure the responsible use of AI. Only when its people support the government’s aim of being an AI superpower will the UK be able to turn ambition into reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While international media attention is currently diverted to the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, the question of whether to engage with the Taliban’s de facto government remains a contentious topic actively deliberated in Western diplomatic circles. Rather than examining the merits of engaging (or not) with the Taliban, this Emerging Insights paper highlights the Taliban’s perceptions, agendas and modes of operation in order to gain a better understanding of how to move forward with the question of future engagement with the Taliban. The paper is specifically aimed at informing Western policymakers and is not intended to cover the wider spectrum of the Taliban’s perceptions of the external world, nor does it aim to analyse the group’s foreign policymaking. Thus, notwithstanding their undoubted importance, the paper does not cover the Taliban’s relations with Afghanistan’s neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper is informed by recent research on the Taliban’s more than two years in government, supported by tens of meetings and interviews with Taliban officials and leaders, dating from well before August 2021 and up to the present day. Identities and all data emerging from these exchanges are either anonymised or unattributed, as specific sources cannot be identified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper has two main sections. The first section discusses the Taliban’s perception of Western countries and the second outlines the Taliban agenda towards Western countries. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of the implications for Western powers of engaging with the Taliban.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;understanding-the-taliban-perception-of-the-west&quot;&gt;UNDERSTANDING THE TALIBAN PERCEPTION OF THE WEST&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;resentment-and-suspicion&quot;&gt;RESENTMENT AND SUSPICION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After more than two years of diplomatic negotiations and exchanges, the Taliban are sceptical about the value of engaging with the West. “We have had open discussion with many political figures over the past two years, diplomats and UN officials, but we see little progress as a result”, says one senior Taliban member. Still, this does not mean that the Taliban have given up on building bridges with the West – not yet. The Taliban recognises the Doha agreement of February 2020 as the main document regulating their relations with the US and by extension all Western countries, as the agreement refers to “the United States, its allies, and the Coalition”. Disagreements over the implementation of that agreement fuel Taliban distrust of the US and its allies – as well as US distrust of the Taliban. The US has repeatedly accused the Taliban of not having fully implemented the terms of the agreement, in particular with regard to their handling of groups linked to Al-Qaeda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Doha agreement was rather imprecisely worded, asking the Taliban not to allow “any of its members, other individuals or groups, including al-Qa’ida, to use the soil of Afghanistan to threaten the security of the United States and its allies”, to “prevent them from recruiting, training, and fundraising” and not to “host them” (note that the term “ally” lends itself to conflicting interpretations). It also asked the Taliban to “send a clear message that those who pose a threat to the security of the United States and its allies have no place in Afghanistan” and to “instruct members of the … Taliban not to cooperate with groups or individuals threatening the security of the United States and its allies”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more importantly, the US State Department is silent on whether the agreement still stands. The State Department has been vocal about the Taliban’s treatment of women and other rights issues, while gradually becoming more positive about the Taliban’s handling of foreign jihadists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taliban responded that, according to the Doha agreement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The US was supposed to “initiate an administrative review of current U.S. sanctions and the rewards list against members of the … Taliban with the goal of removing these sanctions by August 27, 2020”, and that this did not happen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The US was further supposed to “start diplomatic engagement with other members of the United Nations Security Council and Afghanistan to remove members of the … Taliban from the sanctions list with the aim of achieving this objective by May 29, 2020”, and that this did not happen either.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The US also committed to “refrain from the threat or the use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Afghanistan or intervening in its domestic affairs”. The Taliban claim is that the US is continually putting pressure on them on these matters.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taliban also argue that the freezing of National Bank funds violates the spirit of the Doha agreement, as does the fact that the US continues to fly drones over Afghanistan. Sources were keen to stress this point, and claimed that leaders in the Taliban felt intimidated by the continuous drone surveillance, which some of them took as a sign of US bad faith. Some leaders argue that this unfriendly behaviour plays into the hands of hardliners opposed to engaging with the West, pushing pragmatists to prioritise internal Taliban unity over efforts to marginalise the hardliners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is a degree of defensiveness in evidence here, and there are other, perhaps more important, reasons why the hardliners gradually gained influence from September 2021, it is at least plausible that the more threatened the Taliban feel, and the more distrust towards Western countries there is within their ranks, the easier it will be for Taliban hostile to engaging with Western countries to impose their line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After more than 20 years of war, the Taliban’s distrust of Western countries (and vice versa) comes as no surprise. But it is, nonetheless, one factor contributing to why Afghanistan’s de facto government has so far shown little to no interest in responding to calls by foreign governments and institutions for policy change – with the assumption being that such governments and institutions cannot be trusted to reward Taliban concessions in any substantial way. The Taliban maintain that the centrality of Sharia Law to their system of governance is non-negotiable, and they also have their own ways of determining which interpretation of Sharia Law applies in a given case, with the prime authority in the field resting with the Taliban’s Amir, Haibatullah Akhundzada (who is the leader of the Taliban movement but does not have a formal role in the Taliban government).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One noteworthy example of how Taliban distrust can have the effect of harming the Taliban themselves is the recent failure of the so-called “Doha II” meeting of 18 February 2024, when special envoys for Afghanistan gathered to discuss the report prepared by UN Special Coordinator Feridun Sinirlioğlu. Although the intention was to map a path towards the normalisation of relations, the Taliban interpreted the recommendation to appoint a UN special envoy for Afghanistan as an attempt to humiliate them. They also took exception to civil society representatives seemingly being accorded the same status as the Taliban at the meeting. Then, when it emerged that the UN Secretary-General would not chair the meeting with the Taliban, they took it as a snub (notwithstanding that Antonio Guterres could not meet the unrecognised de facto government in any case). Attempts to find an approach acceptable to the Taliban failed after the UN’s final proposal arrived too late for the Taliban’s slow policymaking arrangements, which required it to make the rounds between Kabul and Kandahar, gaining the acceptance of all the Taliban’s heavyweights. The end result was that the Taliban did not attend the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sensitivities-about-criticism&quot;&gt;SENSITIVITIES ABOUT CRITICISM&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taliban are especially proud of what they view as having achieved stability in Afghanistan and ending the very long war that began in 1978. State collapse, feared by many, has been averted and the Taliban have undoubtedly proven able to provide basic security. They consider this the main source of legitimacy of the new regime. Ordinary Afghans, they say, now enjoy the freedom to move around the country without risking their lives. “Many people have been able to visit their home villages for the first time in decades”, said one member. The Taliban also express irritation that among foreign diplomats there has either been no acknowledgement of their achievement of what they describe as the “neutralisation of the IS-K [Islamic State in Khorasan] threat” without external help, or, if the achievement is acknowledged, it is immediately undermined by what they see as a litany of complaints about the Taliban’s lack of respect for the rights of minorities and women. It seems clear that in the expectations of many Taliban, the group’s role in containing IS-K and averting state collapse should offset the other concerns of Western countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taliban leaders and officials say that they appreciate receiving advice, but remark that “there is a big difference between advice given by your enemy and advice given by a friend”, implying that Western countries are not “friends”. These words from another senior member of the Taliban show how the distrust for Western countries is apparent:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What we don’t appreciate is when the West and in particular the US occupies the moral higher ground and start[s] issuing advice to the IEA [Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan] on issues of human rights and freedoms – as if we don’t see and hear about their practices in Afghanistan and elsewhere in the world – look what is going on in Gaza as we speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taliban also harbour resentment about public criticism in the diplomatic arena:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When you advise someone with good faith, the advice and the way it is delivered must be peaceful and preferably confidential. One does it to receive reward from Allah and not to score goals or humiliate the other side. However, if the advice is public and confrontational, then the Taliban movement considers it offensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taliban’s extreme sensitivity to public criticism is hardly unique – most governments would be sensitive – but theirs is likely reinforced by the sense of insecurity derived from their lack of diplomatic training and relative lack of experience in navigating the diplomatic arena. An additional factor, perhaps even more important, is that in the constant intra-Taliban tussle over competing foreign policy lines, Taliban interlocutors with Western countries feel humiliated by external criticism, which they believe undermines them in the eyes of their more sceptical colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, the Taliban are often thirsty for Western appreciation. The July to October 2023 World Bank reports, for example, were greatly appreciated by some Taliban for their positive assessment of the financial and economic trends in Afghanistan. This illustrates how the Taliban – particularly the pragmatists among them – value acknowledgement and commendations. They interpreted the reports as a sign of political appreciation and as a rare piece of evidence of external appreciation that they can show to their more isolationist colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diverging foreign policy views among the Taliban could explain why, at a surface level, the Taliban have appeared resistant to taking advice from any source, Western or otherwise, public or private. Individual Taliban leaders and groups within the Taliban are reported by their colleagues to be willing to listen to advice from different sources – Qatar, the UAE, China or even in some cases the CIA – but contradictory pieces of advice tend to offset each another, resulting in little movement in policy terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;why-the-taliban-think-they-need-to-engage-with-the-west&quot;&gt;WHY THE TALIBAN THINK THEY NEED TO ENGAGE WITH THE WEST&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taliban tend to deny courting external support, while at the same time seeking it in certain circumstances. For example, senior Taliban contacted for this paper say that the main reason for the April 2022 ban on the cultivation, production and trade of drugs was awareness of the devastation that hard drugs were bringing to Afghanistan itself, as well as the fact that Sharia Law bans the consumption of narcotics. However, the desire for external support is evident when they suggest, to one of the authors but also to foreign diplomats, that help in dealing with the large quantity of drug addicts in the country and providing alternative livelihoods to opium farmers would be welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taliban also argue that consolidating an improved security situation depends on “improving people’s livelihoods and in particular new employment opportunities for young men from rural areas”, as a senior figure put it to one of the authors. The need for economic progress in Afghanistan is one of the main rationales for external engagement in the eyes of the Taliban. However, there is little readiness to accept trade-offs that might include what many Taliban consider external interference in their internal decision-making. The Taliban are, nevertheless, beginning to implement plans to open Afghanistan’s mining sector to investment, not least to encourage Western investment to counterbalance the expected heavy Chinese investment in the Afghan economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-talibans-agenda&quot;&gt;THE TALIBAN’S AGENDA&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;taliban-rigidities-and-some-evolution&quot;&gt;TALIBAN RIGIDITIES AND SOME EVOLUTION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no question that the Taliban suffer from multiple rigidities in their policymaking. Some of these may be “ideological rigidities”, either genuine ones embedded in the Taliban’s origins, or ones rooted in the fear of being overtaken by more extreme groups. Others may have more to do with power struggles and internal competition among groups and leaders. Others still may be understood simply as a demonstration of sovereignty, a result of the Taliban’s desire to show that they are in charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Taliban pragmatists and modernists claim that the suspension of women’s and girls’ education, in high schools in September 2021 and in universities in December 2022, is the result of pressures from a minority group of ultra-conservative leaders, mostly concentrated in Kandahar, who genuinely believe that previous arrangements were not compliant with Sharia Law, and who have the support of the Amir. This is despite the fact that the policy is rather unpopular, even among Taliban themselves. Many Taliban officials say they do not take very seriously the view of figures such as Justice Minister Abdul Hakim Haqqani, who believe that jihad (intended as “mobilisation for struggle”) should continue until the establishment of a fully Islamic order – that is, a system of government very rigidly based on an institutionalised version of the Taliban’s understanding of Islam. For them, the jihad ended the moment Kabul fell in August 2021. However, even these Taliban justify the implementation of such policies with another ideological statement: that revolt against the “legitimate Amir” without “legitimate justification” (which can only be the Amir’s disbelief in Allah) is not permissible under Sharia Law. The Amir must, therefore, be obeyed even when he is “unjust”. Importantly, obedience to the Amir is also seen as key to the Taliban’s unity and, as one member explains, “our success rests on staying united”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other areas, Taliban have claimed that some policy decisions were dictated less by their own convictions than by the desire to counter propaganda claims from IS-K that the Taliban have sold out to the West. This could of course be an excuse to justify policy shifts that many Taliban officials might find it difficult to justify otherwise, such as the suspension of women’s rights to education. There are, nonetheless, cases where this perceived vulnerability might have genuinely contributed to reshaping policy. In interviews with low-level officials of the Taliban Emirate in 2021–23, the Taliban clearly appeared to be concerned about some of their disgruntled members being attracted to IS-K. One example of this potentially having influenced policy is the decision to fully apply Sharia Law in criminal matters and the growing rigidity shown towards the Shia community from summer 2023 onwards, as Taliban failure to implement Sharia Law and the group’s courteous relations with the Shia community had been two key points of IS-K propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assessing the role of ideology in Taliban policymaking also requires consideration of the issue of intra-Taliban competition. While there are certainly many ultra-conservative ulema (senior clerics) within the Taliban, it is far from clear that the Amir is ideologically aligned with them. His record in 2016–21 was eminently pragmatic – see, for example, his willingness to accept Russian support for the Taliban in 2016, at the peak of the Russian intervention in Syria, despite widespread opposition within the leadership. This raises the issue of to what extent the Amir may be using the fatwas of his ulema to undermine those Taliban leaders who try to bypass his authority, including by reaching out to Western diplomats without his consent (as happened repeatedly in 2021–22). It is worth noting that, typically, suspensions of girls’ education rights came within days of meetings between Taliban officials and Western diplomats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever is driving these rigidities, they are primarily endogenous factors that have had a major impact on how the Taliban interact with the rest of the world, even though they primarily concern the Emirate’s internal affairs. Evolution, or softening, is not impossible, however. The Taliban’s cautious approach towards foreign jihadists based in Afghanistan is an example. In the face of obvious IS-K attempts to attract foreign jihadists away from the Taliban, the Emirate was unwilling to put more than moderate pressure on the Pakistanis of the Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), despite very strong demands from Islamabad. The reason appears clear: the TTP’s thousands of fighters could destabilise eastern Afghanistan if they allied with IS-K. However, the Emirate placed the much smaller Uighur and Uzbek jihadist contingents under strict surveillance and then forced them to relocate, estimating that the damage caused by defections to IS-K would be limited, and aiming to win praise from Beijing and Tashkent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other examples. In September 2023, the Taliban responded to an incident in Sweden in which the Qur’an was burned by freezing all Swedish aid activities. One Taliban member commented:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It may not have been sanctioned by the government, [but] the only option for us is to sanction all Swedish activities. Having done that, we have done our very best to protect the property and personnel of Swedish aid organisations in the country, but we cannot go against the will of the Afghan people who feel badly hurt as a result of [this incident].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, however, the Taliban have taken care not to be seen as promoting mobilisation in favour of Hamas in Gaza, for example, despite the issue being strongly felt by many within their ranks. This can probably be read as a signal to the West. Overall, the impression is of a Taliban leadership that is juggling its political capital, combining a rigid approach on some ideological issues related to internal affairs with considerable pragmatism on other issues, especially those related to the prospects of economic growth. They appear to have judged that dropping any kind of support for jihadist movements abroad will not hurt or impact them much, except in the case of the TTP in Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note, moreover, that despite their rigidities the Taliban do have a track record of sometimes responding positively to lobbying from NGOs, tribal and local elders, and even neighbouring countries – although at the centre, the rigidities appear harder to negotiate. Low-profile, discreet messaging appears to be more effective in influencing Taliban policymaking, while public statements, threats and ultimatums are generally rejected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;taliban-understandings-of-inclusion&quot;&gt;TALIBAN UNDERSTANDINGS OF INCLUSION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greater inclusion of a variety of ethnic, religious and political groups in the Taliban government is a key demand not only of Western countries, but also of most neighbouring countries. When the Taliban are asked about inclusion today, they defend themselves by noting that their critics did not seem concerned with inclusion when the Taliban were entirely purged from the state apparatus in 2001. In comparison, they argue, the Taliban’s de facto government has at least retained most officials from the previous regime, such that the ministerial machinery mostly continues to function in the same way as before. In fact, junior officials were largely retained, while senior-level managers have been replaced, which leaves the issue of inclusiveness to a large extent unaddressed. The Taliban say that they are even retaining officials once linked to parties opposed to the Taliban, and that they make every effort to pay the salaries of officials on time (albeit at a considerably reduced rate), while many members of the Taliban themselves experience major delays. There is evidence that civilian officials do get paid, while, according to interviews, salaries to Taliban in the armed forces are often paid irregularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With regard to specific communities, Taliban perceptions often represent an obstacle to a more inclusive government. The Taliban are dismissive about the possibility of ethnic tensions, both within Afghanistan and among the Taliban themselves. Sources quoted Interior Minister Serajuddin Haqqani’s assessment that “there are no racial and linguistic prejudices in the nation and the Islamic Emirate will not allow anyone to do this. People should be assured that there is full unity between the ethnic groups of Afghanistan”. Taliban with whom the authors met claimed to have recently defused conflict between Kuchi nomads and Hazara settlers in Behsud in Wardak province, and noted that they had recently invited Shia leaders, such as two of the most prominent leaders of Shia parties, Karim Khalili and Haji Mohaqeq, to return to Afghanistan. They seemed oblivious to the worsening of relations with the Shia community following clashes during Ashura observances in summer 2023, and to deteriorating relations between Pashtuns on one side and Uzbeks and Tajiks on the other, including among the Taliban themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the Taliban consider any debate about the system of government to be settled. In their view, the Islamic Emirate – an authoritarian system with the Taliban movement at its centre – is the solution, and the so-called “hybrid system”, bringing together elements of the 1990s Emirate and the Islamic Republic or even the monarchy (which was abolished in 1973) – which was still being discussed in the weeks following the Taliban takeover – is no longer under consideration. In reality, however, the Emirate system remains poorly defined, especially with regard to the distribution of powers and governance. Nevertheless, the firmly held belief is that the Islamic Emirate system “served the Taliban well during two decades of war” and, in the words of one contact, the pragmatists find it “difficult to convince leaders that something else might be more suitable for peacetime”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;External demands to revisit this issue are considered interference in the internal affairs of the de facto government and are rejected. The Taliban acknowledge that lack of inclusiveness is still a problem, both in private and – more obliquely – in public. But they deny that there is any wish or intent on the part of the Taliban to discriminate against any particular ethnic group. Further, they intend to resolve this lack of inclusiveness in their own way: by incorporating individuals from different communities and rejecting the inclusion of organised groups. Actors such as former president Hamid Karzai and former CEO Dr Abdullah, who have been lobbying for greater political inclusiveness in Kabul, appear marginalised today. Political parties that were promised government positions immediately following the Taliban takeover, such as Gulbuddin Hekmatyar’s Hizb-i Islami, had all but lost hope by October 2022. As of January 2024, there was only a handful of non-Taliban individuals at the top levels of government. An exact head count is difficult, as some avowedly non-Taliban individuals may have entertained discreet relations with the Taliban in the past, as is alleged in relation to Minister of Commerce Nooruddin Azizi and the minister of health, Qalandar Ibad. There are also five deputy ministers with no confirmed links to the Taliban: Sheikh Madar Ali Karimi Bamyani (urban development and land), Abdul Latif Nazari (economy), Hassan Ghiasi (health), Mohammad Azim Sultanzada and Mohammad Bashir (commerce).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;seeking-acceptance-as-an-authoritarian-problem-solver&quot;&gt;SEEKING ACCEPTANCE AS AN AUTHORITARIAN “PROBLEM SOLVER”&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taliban are aware that much of the wider region is ruled by authoritarian governments. Hence it is likely that they feel there is no particular reason for their own authoritarian regime not to be accepted too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Taliban sources argue that their success in stabilising the Afghan economy derives from their “power to assert sovereignty” against local, factional, sectarian and tribal/ethnic interests. One example of this assertion of sovereignty, a senior figure explained, is the ban on the use of other currencies for trade within Afghanistan. The Taliban also point to their success in banning the production of drugs, including methamphetamine, as a sign of their ability to act as a result of their “assertion of sovereignty”. In other words, the Taliban believe they have demonstrated that their strong-handed approach works in their operating environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference between the conservatives and the pragmatists is that in the latter’s view, the Taliban will in practice need to tackle particular issues, such as gender discrimination and inclusiveness – at least to some degree – before achieving full international acceptance, gaining diplomatic recognition and obtaining external aid. The conservatives, on the other hand, believe that to gain international acceptance, the Taliban simply need to demonstrate staying power and the ability to keep Afghanistan together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-and-implications-for-engagement&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS FOR ENGAGEMENT&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attitudes of Western countries towards engaging with the Taliban’s de facto government of Afghanistan vary, although a majority of governments now appear to favour some level of engagement, while staying away from formal recognition. Those governments favouring engagement must contend with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Taliban’s notions about the West, and the context of mutual distrust and mutual flawed perceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Taliban’s determination to retain the Emirate model of government.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Diverging strategic views among Taliban leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Distrust and misperceptions are inevitable after 20 years of war. One such misperception is about the degree to which the Taliban are being “ideological”. Some of what is usually viewed as ideological rigidity are in fact political tactics, which derive from the Taliban’s insecurity or from their internal power struggles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more substantial and probably more long-term issue is the fact that the Taliban have seemingly given up altogether on political inclusion, which remains a key demand of most Western and neighbouring countries. Similarly, the Taliban do not even try to portray themselves as anything other than authoritarian, and they make it clear that this is not going to change. Therefore, even if in future engagement is unlocked by progress on female education, this engagement will remain limited – especially compared to the billions of dollars of development aid Afghanistan received before 2021 – and so any impact will only be seen in the medium and long term, and will be diluted over time. Another hard reality, however, is that any collapse of the state in Afghanistan, or a deepening economic crisis, would drive hundreds of thousands more Afghans to migrate or seek asylum westwards. This raises the question of how wise it is for European countries to delay engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some positive signalling could be useful to keep doors open and to strengthen the position of those Taliban pragmatists who believe that good relations with Western countries are important for the de facto government. Without such positive signalling, the pragmatists would be left empty handed and condemned to gradual marginalisation. Even small steps could begin a virtuous cycle. For example, helping to address issues such as the refusal of international banks to process payments to and from Afghanistan would involve very little engagement and have disproportionate positive impact, enabling investment into the country. Projects aimed at encouraging or facilitating private investment could similarly improve the diplomatic environment, without necessarily undermining Western demands concerning rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting test is the recent decision of the World Bank to unlock development funds for Afghanistan. The Taliban see this as a potential confidence-building measure. The question is whether Taliban policymakers in Kabul would then be able and willing to reciprocate, at least with some small, symbolic gesture, once funds began gradually translating into projects on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth adding that at the Doha II meeting in February 2024, China, Russia and Iran all supported the Taliban’s rejection of the proposal for a special envoy to Afghanistan, clearly expecting to gain from the failed take-off of Taliban–West relations. It is not clear to what extent Western countries are concerned about the possibility of Afghanistan falling into the orbit of these neighbours, but if they are, this would be one more reason not to delay engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;控方播國安法生效前片段 黎智英明言會悼念六四&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ud0qopy.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（29日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第86日審訊。控方播放黎智英在《國安法》生效之前的受訪片段。在2020年6月的《蘋果日報》宣傳片中，黎智英提及現時年輕人對於中國事務有很大抽離感，更遑論悼念六四，但是黎明言會出來悼念六四，因為如果不滿《國安法》的時候，參與六四集會便是一種表達方式。此外，黎接受外媒訪問時形容特朗普是守信用的人，希望特朗普能對中國實施嚴厲的制裁。他認為美國最有效的制裁措施是凍結中國高級官員的外地銀行戶口，因為他們有很多不光彩的錢（corrupted money）儲存在美國和歐洲的銀行戶口裡。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英美國的道德權威是很大籌碼-應以強硬態度對付中共&quot;&gt;黎智英：美國的道德權威是很大籌碼 應以強硬態度對付中共&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方播放黎智英於2019年7月10日出席美國「保衛民主基金」論壇的片段，黎指很多人會說要與中國進行貿易，不要得罪中國，但是黎認為這種想法完全錯誤和愚蠢。如果中國想有貿易的話，美國的道德權威是很大的籌碼，可以用來與中國談判，對付中共態度應該強硬而非軟弱。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎談及與時任美國國務卿蓬佩奧會面，黎憶述他向蓬佩奧說香港人正在為與美國相同的價值抗爭，並且正在敵陣抗爭，需要美國的支持，所以黎籲蓬佩奧和時任美國副總統彭斯：「看！說些鼓勵香港人的說話吧！尤其是年輕人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英籲外國就香港示威發聲表達同情&quot;&gt;黎智英籲外國就香港示威發聲、表達同情&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;庭上播放2019年7月15日的《霍士新聞》片段，黎智英受訪時指，如果《逃犯條例》修訂通過，政府便可以把任何人送往中國內地坐監，這亦會削弱香港的法治，如果沒有了法治，香港便會失去國際金融中心地位。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎指香港有很多年輕人正在前線抗爭，呼籲外國就香港的示威發聲，以及表達同情，亦可以派議員到港，使年輕人知道外國人在支持他們。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在8月再次接受《霍士新聞》訪問，他形容習近平是「人類歷史上最強的獨裁者」，因他利用科技和人臉識別技術來監控人民，被當局針對的人可以被禁止開銀行戶口或前往公眾地方，這是不好的事情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎指美國可以做很多事向中國施壓，要求中國改變，例如停止向中國輸出技術。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英指國安法將催毀香港自由希望特朗普能對中國實施嚴厲的制裁&quot;&gt;黎智英指國安法將催毀香港自由、希望特朗普能對中國實施嚴厲的制裁&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在《國安法》生效之前，黎智英接受《彭博》訪問時指，特朗普說過如果香港實施《國安法》，「他會認真地做一些事」；黎表示他不知道特朗普對中國實施制裁會有多嚴厲，但是他促請美國實施制裁。黎形容特朗普是守信用的人，希望特朗普能對中國實施嚴厲的制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎表示，他認為美國最有效的制裁措施是凍結中國高級官員的外地銀行戶口，因為他們有很多不光彩的錢（corrupted money）儲存在美國和歐洲的銀行戶口裡。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主持人問《國安法》來臨，黎智英最擔心什麼。黎則指擔心「我們要失去這裡的傳媒」，無論寫什麼東西都會被指控煽動、顛覆國家。黎又擔心所有香港人失去自由，他們只能選擇移民離開，又或者留下及反抗，香港人沒有其他選擇。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎指，《國安法》將會催毀所有英國殖民地時期留下來的遺產，包括各項自由，他認為全世界應該採取任何行動去制止中國，不能坐以待斃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英明言會悼念六四是一種反抗&quot;&gt;黎智英明言會悼念六四：是一種反抗&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另播放2020年6月2日的《蘋果日報》宣傳片，當中黎智英指現時年輕人對於中國的事有很大抽離感，更遑論悼念六四，但是黎明言會出來悼念六四，因為如果不滿《國安法》的時候，參與六四集會便是一種表達方式。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在另一段《蘋果日報》宣傳片中，黎以英語說訂閱對於一間自由和獨立的傳媒而言是很重要，籲美國人支持，愈多美國人訂閱的話，便能夠減低中國打壓《蘋果》的機會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英不認為美國會出賣香港特朗普會以一連串制裁作為選舉策略&quot;&gt;黎智英不認為美國會出賣香港、特朗普會以一連串制裁作為選舉策略&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年6月10日的《自由亞洲電台》片段中，黎智英受訪時指《國安法》即將來臨，移民、將資金轉移至外國等成為了香港人之間的熱門話題。他指如果美國能對中國實施實際和完整制裁的話，有可能就算人大通過《國安法》，香港也不會執行，又或者《國安法》條文可能減弱、「唔會做到咁辣」，因此得到美國和特朗普的支持是很重要。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎認為，特朗普會以一連串的制裁作為連任美國總統的選舉策略，從而爭取人民的共鳴和支持，所以黎稱暫時是樂觀的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;節目主持人問黎，很多人指美國只是利用香港，美國會否出賣香港。黎則表示，不覺得自由民主的社會會出賣與她價值觀相同的香港，而且中美冷戰不會是一年、兩年的事，而是十年、二十年的事，亦是意識形態之戰。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎又表示他不會離開香港，因他的一切包括家人、同事、生意等都是這個地方給予他的，所以他打算留下來至最後一刻。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下周一續審。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;16人不認罪 明日裁決&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Xi5nOjI.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名組織及參與初選的民主派，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，經歷118日審訊，將於明日（30日）在西九龍裁判法院（暫代高院）裁決。距離61萬人投票的民主派初選近4年，法庭明將就控方指控被告串謀取得立會過半後，無差別否決預算案，迫使特首解散立法會及辭職，意圖顛覆國家政權，作出裁定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據《國安法》第22條，一旦顛覆國家政權罪成，「首要分子或罪行重大」可判監10年以上至終身監禁；「積極參加者」可判監3至10年；「其他參加者」則判監3年以下，故法官就被告參與程度及角色的裁定，將會影響判刑。值得留意的是，政府去年修例，就沒有陪審團的高院國安案，若有被告罪脫，律政司可緊接提出擬上訴，法庭可應申請，命令無罪被告還柙或准予保釋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案目前共34人還柙，其中32人已還柙至今逾3年2個月，料裁決後罪成被告將與認罪被告另外擇日一併求情及判刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;正庭延伸庭共設410公眾席&quot;&gt;正庭、延伸庭共設410公眾席&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明天早上10時於西九龍法院3號法庭進行聆訊，司法機構表示，將於明天早上9時15分派發合共410張公眾席入庭籌，其中正庭有43席，另外4個設有聆訊直播的法庭及延伸區域，則有367席，另設約100張後備籌。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;6人不准保釋-4人還柙逾1180日&quot;&gt;6人不准保釋 4人還柙逾1,180日&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案16名不認罪被告為：鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、何桂藍、陳志全、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄、柯耀林、李予信、余慧明及吳政亨。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其中6人正在還柙，當中何桂藍、林卓廷、梁國雄和吳政亨4人，至裁決日已還柙逾3年2個月、逾1,180日；至於鄒家成和余慧明一度獲准保釋，但因違反保釋條件而遭撤銷擔保，已分別還柙逾2年9個月及2年7個月，逾970日及950日。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;爭議無差別否決是否非法手段被告有否達協議&quot;&gt;爭議無差別否決是否「非法手段」、被告有否達協議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案由指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理，是《國安法》後最大規模的案件，亦是「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪首案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案指控被告串謀取得立會過半後，無差別否決預算案，迫使特首解散立法會及辭職，意圖顛覆國家政權。控辯雙方爭議無差別否決預算案是否構成控罪中的「非法手段」，及被告有否達成協議無差別否決、是否串謀一分子、及是否有意圖顛覆國家政權等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;刑期三級制-最高可囚終身&quot;&gt;刑期三級制 最高可囚終身&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;16名不認罪被告中，僅發起「三投三不投」的吳政亨被視為組織者，其餘則為參與者。根據《國安法》第22條，一旦罪成，「首要分子或罪行重大」可判處10年以上至終身監禁；「積極參加者」可判監3至10年；「其他參加者」則判監3年以下、拘役或者管制。因此法官就被告參與程度及角色的裁決，將會影響判刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;律政司可緊接提擬上訴申罪脫被告還柙&quot;&gt;律政司可緊接提擬上訴、申罪脫被告還柙&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;值得留意的是，被告即使獲裁定無罪，律政司亦可緊接提出擬上訴，法庭可應申請將無罪被告羈押。政府去年修訂《刑事訴訟程序條例》，針對高等法院原訟庭沒有陪審團、由3名指定法官審理的國安案件，法例列明如法官就被告作出無罪裁決，律政司司長可「緊接」通知法庭擬提出上訴，法庭則可應律政司司長的申請，命令將該被告羈留扣押，以待上訴庭作出裁定，或准予該被告保釋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法例亦列明，法庭處理保釋申請時，受限於《國安法》第42條的保釋門檻，意味除非法官有充足理由相信，被告不會繼續實施危害國安的行為，否則不得准予保釋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;首提堂至開審歷時近兩年-審訊118天&quot;&gt;首提堂至開審歷時近兩年 審訊118天&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;民主派初選於2020年7月舉行，其後立法會選舉延期一年，47人於2021年1月6日被以「顛覆國家政權」罪拘捕，同年2月28日被要求提早報到，被落案起訴「串謀顛覆國家政權」。47人於3月1日首度提堂，經歷6次提訊日及多次提堂後於2022年7月正式交付高院，當中共31人認罪，包括組織者戴耀廷和區諾軒，另16人不認罪受審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件今年2月6日於西九龍法院開審，原定審期90天，最終歷時近10個月、審訊118天，於同年12月4日完成結案陳詞。當中控方案情花了共58日，被指為組織者的區諾軒、趙家賢、鍾錦麟以控方證人身分作供44天，認罪的林景楠亦應辯方要求被傳召作盤問。此外，控方傳召在新西協調會議拍片的匿名證人X先生作供，及應辯方要求傳召6名警員及1名選舉主任作盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後以6日處理「共謀者原則」爭議及被告申請毋須答辯的中段陳詞，法官裁定該原則不適用於《國安法》前的言行，及所有被告表證成立。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方案情則用了51日，不認罪的16人，除吳政亨、楊雪盈、黃碧雲、林卓廷、梁國雄和柯耀林6人外，其餘10人：鄭達鴻、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、施德來、何桂藍、陳志全、鄒家成、李予信、余慧明均有出庭作供，至於吳政亨及柯耀林則傳召辯方證人。案件最後以3天完成結案陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;31人認罪&quot;&gt;31人認罪&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於認罪的31人，包括：戴耀廷、區諾軒、趙家賢、鍾錦麟、袁嘉蔚、梁晃維、徐子見、岑子杰、毛孟靜、馮達浚、劉澤鋒、黃之鋒、譚文豪、李嘉達、譚得志、胡志偉、朱凱廸、張可森、黃子悅、尹兆堅、郭家麒、吳敏兒、譚凱邦、劉頴匡、楊岳橋、范國威、呂智恆、岑敖暉、王百羽、伍健偉及林景楠。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;認罪被告中，僅呂智恆、林景楠和黃子悅獲保釋，惟黃另涉理大衝突案，承認暴動判囚37個月。其餘被告均還柙至今逾3年2個月。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;黎智英指自由經濟本來無分「黃藍」 但黃色經濟圈會隨政府鎮壓而繼續存在&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/xfMIeqs.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（28日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第85日審訊。在辯方要求下，庭上播放多段黎智英直播節目「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」片段。有觀眾問黎以生意人的角度來看，黃色經濟圈是否可行。黎認為當香港愈來愈被鎮壓，黃色經濟圈便會一直存在，而且愈來愈重要；又指自由經濟本來並無分「黃藍」，但是黃色經濟圈這個「畸型的經濟」會因為政府的鎮壓而繼續存在。黎另指「警隊已經坐大到無法無天」，認為中共的鎮壓政策如果不改變，警隊的形象也不會改變，愈來愈猖狂、愈坐大，這是無法改變的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英指外界對香港的關注是救星&quot;&gt;黎智英指外界對香港的關注是「救星」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在2020年11月29日的「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」節目中，黎智英表示，他自己愈身陷險境，便愈能有效地引起外界對香港的關注，並形容「這是我們的救星（saving grace）」，因為香港實在太細小，不足以對抗中國這個巨人。黎又表示，他不能夠退縮，他必需繼續，使其他人也跟著繼續。「如果我退縮，他們也會退縮，那我們便會完蛋。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;有觀眾問黎，香港未來會否變成「一國一制」，如果會的話怎麼辦、香港還有什麼價值。黎指香港的公務員和傳媒自由度轉差，他認為「一國一制就要嚟㗎喇，但唔代表我哋要跪喺度接受佢，我哋一定要企喺度」，並且保衛香港的法治和自由。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一名觀眾談及警隊，黎則回應指「警隊已經坐大到無法無天」，最近不時出現警察犯罪的新聞，又指警隊的權力愈大，內部文化便會愈腐敗、愈猖狂。他認為中共的鎮壓政策要改變，否則警隊的形象不會改變，愈來愈猖狂、愈坐大，這是無法改變的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英指自由經濟本來無分黃藍-但黃色經濟圈會因為政府的鎮壓而繼續存在&quot;&gt;黎智英指自由經濟本來無分「黃藍」 但黃色經濟圈會因為政府的鎮壓而繼續存在&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另有觀眾問黎以生意人的角度，黃色經濟圈是否可行。黎指，只要打壓存在，黃色經濟圈便會繼續存在；但是如果打壓停止，黃藍之間的衝突便會解決。黎認為黃色經濟圈會持續存在，因為當香港愈來愈被鎮壓，黃色經濟圈便會一直存在，而且愈來愈重要，除非香港有一國兩制和法治。黎又指，自由經濟本來並無分「黃藍」，但是黃色經濟圈這個「畸型的經濟」會因為政府的鎮壓而繼續存在。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英指美國與中國貿易時應考慮中國人權法治狀況&quot;&gt;黎智英指美國與中國貿易時應考慮中國人權法治狀況&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在2020年12月1日的「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」節目中，美國學者 Dan Blumenthal 指中共獨裁統治不只影響中國，更會波及全世界。黎智英回應指，獨裁政權的特質之一，是它們內部愈弱、愈多內部問題，便需要在外面樹立更多敵人，來維持自己的統治地位。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎指，拜登政府應該察覺到，美國需要以強硬而非柔弱的手腕去處理中國問題。他認為當美國與中國有貿易往來的時候，美國應該以中國改善人權、法治等作為先決條件，以及在貿易中連繫香港和新疆維吾爾族的問題。如果外國容許中國的經濟不斷發展，但同時容許中國堅持其價值觀，「我們便會完蛋。」他希望外國能持續改變中國，使中國民主化。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英指若習近平繼續執政-香港或變成中國城市比新疆更大鑊&quot;&gt;黎智英指若習近平繼續執政 香港或變成中國城市、比新疆更「大鑊」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在觀眾提問環節中，有觀眾問香港會否被同化，成為與中國差不多的城市。黎表示，如果沒有一個奇蹟出現，而習近平繼續做一個「永遠的主席」，「我哋就仆街㗎喇，我哋就冇機會保持到特殊嘅地位。」黎指屆時香港不但變成中國一個城市，「可能我哋變成咗新疆都唔定。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎續指，香港人的價值觀對中國而言很危險，如果這些價值觀瀰漫到中國，使中國人知道這些價值觀，對中共政權來說是非常危險。黎又指新疆穆斯林的價值觀只是宗教層面，然而香港人的價值觀對中共來說更加危險，香港未來有可能成為與中國差不多的城市，甚或乎「比新疆更大鑊」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;有年輕觀眾表示正在考慮赴澳洲發展，問黎智英意見。黎表示，如果對方能夠適應澳洲的生活的話，他應該留在澳洲定居。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另有觀眾問黎智英作為一名天主教徒，有什麼說話想跟時任特首林鄭說。黎說，希望林鄭可以多些祈禱和多些聆聽上帝的話語，這對她自己和香港而言都是好事，因為林鄭顯然地沒有聆聽到上帝的聲音。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英在國安法下行事必須非常小心-當局可能會利用任何材料來控告&quot;&gt;黎智英：在《國安法》下行事必須非常小心 當局可能會利用任何材料來控告&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方播放2020年12月1日的《霍士新聞》片段，黎智英受訪指他們正在控告《大公報》，又指《大公報》是中共的喉舌。他提到自己身負3宗案件，在《國安法》下行事必須非常小心，因為當局可能會利用任何材料來控告他。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在訪問中亦批評《國安法》凌駕《基本法》和普通法。香港要保持國際金融中心地位，需要得到商人的信任，背後需要有法治，但是在「人治」下金融中心地位不能存在。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另播放2020年12月1日《霍士新聞》訪問美軍前副參謀長 Jack Keane 的片段。惟法官李素蘭指，在這影片中看不到黎智英。控方指影片純粹想顯示 Jack Keane 的立場。法官李運騰質疑，看不到這影片與本案的關係，黎與 Jack Keane 的對談影片過去在庭上已經播放過，從中亦可知道 Jack Keane 的立場。法官杜麗冰則指控方可在結案陳詞中處理相關議題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 29 May, South Africans will go to the polls in what is likely to be the country’s most important election since the advent of a non-racial democracy in 1994. It could be the moment when the country shifts from one-party dominance to coalition rule of one or another stripe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This election occurs amid a backdrop of low economic growth, rising unemployment (which in its broad definition affects 42% of South Africa’s 61 million people, nearly half of whom survive meagre state welfare) and rampant criminality. For some it is a chance to remind the African National Congress (ANC) – Africa’s oldest liberation movement – why it is in power, and how the majority of South Africans now believe it is the ANC, and not apartheid, that is to blame for the country’s woes. Much was expected from Cyril Ramaphosa when he took over from Jacob Zuma as president in 2017, supposedly bringing down the curtain on the era of “state capture” and rampant corruption which had cost the country by Ramaphosa’s own admission over R500 billion, or $28 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve this result, several things will have to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For one thing, participation in South Africa’s democracy is weakening, and even this “watershed” election might not fix that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A yawning chasm of apathy has opened up in South Africa over the last three democratic decades. Fewer and fewer adults of voting age are participating in formal politics; youth registration is abysmally low, just as unemployment among this cohort is shockingly high at over 60%. This pattern of non-participation has grown as the government’s capacity to deliver has diminished and corruption has risen. It is fuelled by a deep cynicism, a view that “voting won’t change anything”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing illustrates this better than the fact that more South Africans voted in the national election of 1994 – some 19,533,498 – than 25 years later in 2019, when only 17,672,851 cast their ballots, despite the population growing by 18 million in the same period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last 30 years, only one of the arms of democratic government, the judiciary, has done its job reasonably well, holding the line against Zuma’s blatant attempts to run roughshod over independent institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, the judicial role has not been the perfect story. The weakness – and politicization – of the judicial system must bear its share of the blame for the establishment of a culture of impunity. The failure to prosecute those identified as corrupt by the Zondo Commission’s investigation into the era of state capture has happened on its watch. Perhaps this is unsurprising given that Ramaphosa served as Zuma’s deputy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the judiciary has comparatively held firm, the legislature and especially the Executive manifestly has failed to deliver on the democratic promise. Dominated by the government, parliament was admonished for closing ranks on Zuma and it would later cover up for his successor, Ramaphosa, putting aside recommendations by its own commission that there be an investigation into the mysterious appearance of tens of thousands of US dollars in Ramaphosa’s couch. Just as there have been dark spots in the judiciary’s record, however, there have been bright spots for parliament given its role in continuing to highlight – amid some theatre – Zuma’s malfeasance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is more. The Executive has presided over infrastructural decay and a vast network of crooked contracts, the latter laid bare in excruciating detail by the Zondo Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;For some the election is a chance to remind the ANC why it is in power, and how the majority of South Africans now believe it is the ANC, and not apartheid, that is to blame for the country’s woes&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of moving to strengthen and grow South Africa’s democracy and democratic participation, the Executive has apparently been happy to see the last of disgruntled voters and instead opted for apathy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, in another alarming development, it has begun to turn its back on the democratic world in favour of a potpourri of dictatorships, autocracies and theocracies with abysmal human rights records and a penchant for imprisoning and murdering critics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When South Africa joined BRICS, it become one of three democratic countries – Brazil and India being the other two – in an organisation dominated by Russia and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet when the opportunity came for South Africa to lead the expansion of BRICS at the 2023 summit held in Sandton, Johannesburg, what did it do? It overlooked Africa’s two largest democracies – Nigeria and Kenya – and instead chose to extend BRICS to Iran, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Ethiopia and Egypt, none of which can remotely be described as democratic – thus turning the body from a forum for enhanced trade and cheaper debt into one antagonistic towards democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was an alarming sign that democracy is no longer the loadstar of South Africa, which nowadays prefers the company of autocrats. New friends have included Iran’s hardline former president, Ebrahim Raisi – the first leader Pretoria consulted after the 7 October terror assault on Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Raisi died in a helicopter crash earlier this month, Ramaphosa said of a man labelled the “Butcher of Tehran”: “This is an extraordinary, unthinkable tragedy that has claimed a remarkable leader of a nation with whom South Africa enjoys strong bilateral relations”. There was not even a fig leaf such as “although we may have disagreed about democracy”, nor any mention of the thousands imprisoned and executed under Iran’s violent theocratic regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now there is a threat not only in terms of the deterioration of South Africa’s already ineffective governance, but worsening policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are those on the ballot paper such as the MK Party, led by former president Zuma and ranked third in most polls, which are openly in favour of the repeal of the constitution. Others want it to be amended and limited in scope. Some of these parties might end up as minor partners in a new coalition government should the ANC choose to continue its populist trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lends itself to four scenarios around the twin-tracks of policy and governance, which we have mapped out in “The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly – Scenarios for South Africa’s Uncertain Future”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first – the “Good” scenario – is the only one which provides light at the end of the tunnel, and centres on the formation of a centrist pact built on the opposition’s Multi-Party Charter and the pragmatic parts of the ANC, which together could command as much as 75% of the vote according to the latest surveys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It is worth asking whether 2024 could be South Africa’s last democratic election, given all the signs: authoritarian friendships, shady funding, leadership impunity, rising violent crime and scant regard for parliamentary niceties&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The realisation of this scenario would require South Africa’s establishment to swallow some humble pie, as well as the emergence of the much-talked about but hitherto invisible “good ANC” which would place the majority of South Africans – and not just an increasingly out-of-touch elite fascinated with power and its tantalising economic proceeds – at the centre of policy and implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that this scenario is part of the way to being achieved thanks to key provinces. It seems certain – or as certain as one can be ahead of elections – that coalitions will run Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal, which together with the Western Cape comprise nearly two-thirds of South Africa’s GDP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This provincial dimension may be just the segue needed to broker a wider national deal that puts the country first. And it is just such a deal that could save the Ramaphosa presidency from a legacy of disappointing indecision and governance failure that may otherwise end in a catastrophic tilt to the populist promise of redistribution. Of course, this “Good” arrangement comes with dangers – not least the danger of the ANC swallowing up the opposition once it has got its breath back, just as Robert Mugabe’s ZANU-PF weakened the opposition MDC in Zimbabwe after their 2009 unity government leading to a major slide in its popularity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But overall, this is the only coalition alternative offering an improvement in governance and policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second – the “Bad” scenario – comes in the form of an “Animal Farm” nightmare, where the ANC hooks up with populists who want the constitution and/or private ownership of anything to be scrapped. The ANC, in combination with either the EFF or the MK Party – or either of the latter’s mutant offshoots – would see a rapid descent into populism. Ramaphosa’s trademark dithering would pave the way for these populist forces to seize the public agenda and push him around. In this scenario, for tourists coming for a cheap holiday or businesspeople seeking a quick flip, South Africa “won’t seem such a bad place” – save for those actually living and working there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scenario is more likely than most think. The ANC has already flirted with abandoning private property rights; it has launched a R1 trillion National Health Insurance scheme without any funding plan, and there are several powerful members of its leadership who openly desire this outcome. In this scenario it is worth asking whether 2024 could be South Africa’s last democratic election, given all the signs: authoritarian friendships, shady funding, leadership impunity, rising violent crime and scant regard for parliamentary niceties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’ll never happen to us” and “we’re too big to fail” are among the famous last words of many other regimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third, “Ugly” scenario can be summed up as more of the same, with the ANC squeaking over the line at just over 50% of the vote and then continuing with the status quo ante. This would mean the prospect of little reform in the human and institutional software required for a modern economy, given the inherent loss of rent, while managing a weak fiscus as the effects of its unsubtle pivot to populism in the form of the signing into law of the National Health Insurance scheme take hold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final scenario – the “Fistful of Cents” – would see the ANC fall below 50% but with sufficient votes to form a coalition with one or two smaller parties, possibly including the PA or the IFP. While policy can be expected to remain much the same, this scenario could only lead to even worse governance given the inevitably highly transactional relationships that are likely to be reached with smaller parties, resulting in only limited reform at best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When South Africans go to the polls, they will be celebrating three decades of democracy. But they will also be carrying a responsibility to protect that democracy, before voting itself becomes a charade.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;黎智英指中國視香港人為異族 有如對待新疆穆斯林方式&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/CwrqiZR.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（27日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第84日審訊。在辯方要求下，庭上播放多段黎智英直播節目「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」片段。黎智英與前港督彭定康對談之中，黎指：「我們要對抗中國，如果我們不改變她的話，以中國的經濟實力，我們便會被改變。」如果不對抗中國的話，世界將永無寧日。黎又指國家主席習近平將香港視為異族地區（alien area），視香港人為異族（alien），正如中國對待新疆穆斯林的方式，因為香港人所擁抱的價值，包括民主、自由和人權等，對中共而言是非常危險的，香港將變成與新疆一樣的城市。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英指如果不對抗中國-世界將永無寧日&quot;&gt;黎智英指如果不對抗中國 世界將永無寧日&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年11月13日的「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」節目中，嘉賓前港督彭定康指中共是香港自由民主的威脅，如果想中國改變的話，要持續為香港勇敢走出來。彭定康指中國的思考方式與西方國家不同，他憶述在任時與時任國務院港澳辦主任魯平溝通的過程中，發覺魯平不明白為何需要「法治」（rule of law），中國認為只需要「以法治國」（rule by law），然而法治是民主社會的基石。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英提到中國對人民施予洗腦，顯示中國治國方式過時，並且想為所欲為。黎指：「我們要對抗中國，如果我們不改變她的話，以中國的經濟實力，我們便會被改變。」他又指，如果不對抗中國的話，世界將永無寧日。黎指中國並不是一個孤島，她需要面向世界，而外國需要堅持他們的價值，並逐漸地改變中國。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英指習近平視香港人為異族-香港將變成新疆一樣的城市&quot;&gt;黎智英指習近平視香港人為異族 香港將變成新疆一樣的城市&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;有觀眾問黎認為聯合國可以怎樣幫助香港。黎表示對於聯合國不感到樂觀，因為很多國家都站在中國那一邊。他反而認為日本和印度等民主國家將會與香港走在一起及支持香港，惟對於聯合國則不樂觀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎批評習近平只想將自己個人形象凌駕在中國之上，另將香港視為異族地區（alien area），視香港人為異族（alien），一如中國對待新疆穆斯林的方式，因為香港人所擁抱的價值，包括民主、自由和人權等，對中共而言是非常危險的。黎指香港將變成與新疆一樣的城市，因為中共對待香港人就像對待新疆穆斯林般。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英稱面臨風險越大-越能吸引外界對香港關注&quot;&gt;黎智英稱面臨風險越大 越能吸引外界對香港關注&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在2020年11月19日的節目中，主持人問黎為何仍身處香港，「這個人是否瘋了？」黎則表示，他現時離開不到，因護照被扣留；但即使有機會離開，他也選擇不離開，因為當他面臨的風險越大，便越能有效地吸引外界對香港的關注，形容這是他一生中最好的時候。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎提到新上任的美國總統拜登對於中國採取「多邊主義」手法，多個國家一同應對中國，但是整體立場便會削弱，所以黎不相信「多邊主義」。就拜登而言，他認為單一國家未必能夠能付中國這個巨人，所以黎相信拜登未來會繼續採用「多邊主義」，但是他相信特朗普時代訂下的對華政策方針不會輕易改變。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;有觀眾問國際社會可以做什麼。黎智英表示，國際的支援是很重要，現時市民不能上街遊行，立法會失去多元聲音，「香港可以講係喺窒息之中」，所以新聞減少，如果沒有新聞的話，「如果呢個世界忘記咗我哋呢，我哋就會好大鑊㗎喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英指習近平比毛澤東更危險-因現今中國是強大競爭對手&quot;&gt;黎智英指習近平比毛澤東更危險 因現今中國是強大競爭對手&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另播放2020年11月20日的節目片段，當日嘉賓為以色列前副總理 Nathan Sharansky。黎表示，他被安排有如此的身位去做「如此美妙的事情」，他的人生並不是關乎自己，而是關乎更加多的人，當其他人見到他不退縮的時候，其他人便不會退縮。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在2020年11月26日的節目，嘉賓為美國退休軍官 Jack Keane。黎指習近平比毛澤東更加危險，因毛澤東時代的中國十分貧窮，但是現在中國經濟起飛，是一個強大的競爭對手。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎問 Jack Keane 對於拜登的「多邊主義」手法有什麼觀點，各國都有自己的主張，便會沖淡或削弱了整體的立場，美國對於中國便會不夠強硬。Jack Keane 則指就算採取「多邊主義」手法，美國也應該擔任世界秩序的領袖，在各國間作主導角色。他又指在疫情期間外國想與中國合作，避免造成不必要的緊張，他理解這種做法，但是個人不認同。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎問 Jack Keane，香港可以如何引起拜登政府的關注。Jack Keane 則指：「你的聲音和其他人的聲音都很重要。」他指美國需要了解世界正在發生什麼事，並需要力量和道德勇氣持續下去。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審，控方將繼續播放影片。除了辯方要求播放的片段之外，控方擬播放多17段片段，部份涵蓋《國安法》未生效的時段，由於5月30及31日因初選案而不會開庭，預料需播放影片至下星期。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;黎智英批拜登以理想化眼光看待中國、過於謹慎 不像特朗普大膽&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/WWSdUoX.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（24日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第83日審訊。在辯方要求下，庭上播放多段黎智英直播節目「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」片段。黎不認為特朗普是「反中」，反指特朗普只是想解決中國與自由世界之間的價值差異；又指經過疫情爆發和看到中共如何處理香港問題，他相信美國人整體上都是反對中國。黎直言拜登很弱，相信他會趨向與中國維持和諧關係，卻不會想辦法對付中國，而且拜登以理想化的眼光看待中國，使黎十分擔心。黎指美國對台售武最高峰的時期是在特朗普任內，顯示他明顯地有意提升台灣的國際地位；可是拜登政府則過於謹慎，不想冒著與中國開戰的風險，不像特朗普那麼大膽及敢於冒險。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英籲國際社會幫助12港人&quot;&gt;黎智英籲國際社會幫助「12港人」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在2020年10月15日的節目中，美國前副國防部長 Paul Wolfowitz 擔任嘉賓，被問到中國和台灣之間是否有機會打仗，Paul 指不是沒有可能，但是雙方都想盡量避免打仗。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;觀眾問黎認為中國未來會否有宗教自由，黎指只要中共一日執政的話，中國一日都不會有宗教自由，直指除非中共下台或改變政策，否則不會有宗教自由。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎提到「12港人」在前往台灣途中被中國當局扣留，他表示可以做的事不多，只能呼籲國際社會幫助，包括外國政府、政客和市民，呼籲中國當局盡快釋放，「該12名年輕人真的需要你們的援助。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英認為如果特朗普當選-政權會更加謹慎&quot;&gt;黎智英認為如果特朗普當選 政權會更加謹慎&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在2020年10月22日的節目中，黎智英指對華態度較強硬的特朗普「做了對的事」，他又表示不相信拜登及其陣營，他們作出很多承諾，但是過於理想化。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;有觀眾問到美國總統選舉之前，政權有沒有機會打壓香港的民主派或《蘋果日報》。黎指香港現時已沒有示威活動，因為市民被威嚇而不再出來，如果拜登當選的話，政權便會繼續打壓；如果特朗普當選的話，政權便會變得更加謹慎，但總括而言黎不認為美國大選之前會出現打壓。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英愈被針對便愈需要發聲&quot;&gt;黎智英：愈被針對便愈需要發聲&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年10月29日的節目中，黎智英與美國神父 Robert Sirico 談論宗教自由。黎指梵蒂崗已經失去道德權威，以往人們需要梵蒂崗作為道德權威，引領他們走在正確的道路，但是梵蒂崗已經放棄了這個位置，現時唯一能帶領信徒的就只有上帝，這是非常痛苦的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎又表示，自己愈被當局針對，他的價值便會愈大，便愈需要發聲，而他對於能夠肩負這個角色而感到感恩。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在觀眾提問的環節中，有人問黎作為傳媒人，對於特朗普將反對他的記者形容為「散播假新聞」有何看法。黎則指不能否認美國有假新聞的情況，但是記者隱瞞拜登醜聞、不予報導的情況，比假新聞更加嚴重。他指特朗普有時發言很快、用字不準確和「講錯嘢」，但是不等如傳媒沒有假新聞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另有觀眾問到，如果特朗普不再反共的時候，黎會支持誰人出任美國總統。黎則不認為特朗普是「反中」，反指特朗普只是想解決中國與自由世界之間的價值差異。他認為這並非特朗普一人可以決定的事，而是政客和市民之間的共識，因為新冠疫情爆發帶來恐懼，威脅世界和平，而特朗普過往任內已經做得很有效，沒有比他做得更好方法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英經過疫情爆發-相信美國人整體上都是反對中國&quot;&gt;黎智英：經過疫情爆發 相信美國人整體上都是反對中國&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方播放2020年11月5日的節目片段，黎智英指港人對於拜登當選美國總統感到遺憾，但是認為必需接受現實。他指中國的根本問題是中共的價值觀與世界不同，惟他不認為拜登會長久作戰。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎指，美國人現時察覺到他們正面對一個在價值和行為上均與他們截然不同的政權，這嚇怕了不少商人，加上經過疫情爆發和看到中共如何處置香港問題，他相信美國人整體上都是反對中國。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在台灣問題上，黎指特朗普做了很多工作去提升台灣的地位，而中共非常關注台灣的地位提升，成為國際社會的一員。然而拜登團隊以一種理想化的眼光看待中國，卻不肯面對現實。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英指蔡玉玲被起訴顯示政府不只針對蘋果而是所有記者&quot;&gt;黎智英指蔡玉玲被起訴顯示政府不只針對《蘋果》而是所有記者&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英提到7.21事件和港台節目《鏗鏘集》前編導蔡玉玲被起訴「提供虛假陳述」，他形容這是一個信號，當局不只針對《蘋果日報》和黎智英，還會針對所有記者「如果不為政府服務，便會惹來麻煩」，就算是關於車主查冊的條例也可被用來起訴記者，情況令人感到可怕。黎續指，一個自由身記者做了一件很微小的事，卻招來嚴厲的拘捕，對其他市民造成阻嚇。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎希望拜登政府明白，中國看待世界的方式和價值觀與他們不相同，中國是以一種「非贏即輸」的眼光看待世界。如果中國是一個細小國家，則問題不大；可是中國將會發展成為世界上最強大的國家，「如果我們不留意中國，便會太遲。」不過黎表示，對於美國人有信心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英指香港已完蛋-繼續抗爭因維持尊嚴吸引世界關注&quot;&gt;黎智英指香港已「完蛋」 繼續抗爭因維持尊嚴、吸引世界關注&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;有觀眾提問，特朗普作為一個經歷多次生意失敗的商人，如今要與中國打貿易戰，問黎智英認為貿易戰未來發展如何、特朗普會否與中國和好如初。黎則指貿易戰並不關乎做生意，而是兩個擁有不同價值觀的陣營的對壘。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另有觀眾問黎對拜登有何看法。黎直言拜登很弱，比上屆總統更弱，他的世界觀與現實非常不同。黎相信拜登會趨向與中國維持和諧關係，卻不會想辦法對付中國，而且拜登以理想化的眼光看待中國，使黎十分擔心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎又形容香港已經「完蛋」，沒有其他解決方法，香港人之所以繼續抗爭，原因是要維持自己的尊嚴，使世界繼續關注中共對香港做了什麼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英指美國應協助台灣克服弱者形象&quot;&gt;黎智英指美國應協助台灣克服弱者形象&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在2020年11月12日的節目中，黎智英指美國對台售武最高峰的時期是在特朗普任內，他認為特朗普明顯地有意提升台灣的國際地位，可是拜登政府則過於謹慎，不想冒著與中國開戰的風險，不像特朗普那麼大膽及敢於冒險。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎表示擔心台灣情況，又指台灣在中美博奕中有重要角色。他指美國應協助台灣克服弱者形象，拜登政府應該坐言起行，而非只說不做。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;有觀眾提問，若果黎智英被拘捕的話，黎估計還有沒有其他人可以承接他的工作和精神。黎則相信，香港有好多好像他的人，因為香港是他的家園，相信很多人會為這個家園犧牲。他又指，如果外面的世界見到香港人的操守和堅決，必定會幫助他們，這是最大的支持和最大的保護。如果香港人繼續爭取民主自由，「呢個世界會有個迴響、會有個共鳴」，從而提供支持和鼓勵，「呢個係我哋需要嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下周一續審，控方將繼續播放片段。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On May 2, 2024, Japanese prime minister Kishida Fumio announced the launch of the Hiroshima AI Process Friends Group at the Meeting of the Council at Ministerial Level (MCM) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). This initiative, supported by 49 countries and regions, primarily consisting of OECD members, aims to advance cooperation for global access to safe, secure, and trustworthy generative artificial intelligence (AI). The group supported the implementation of international guidelines and codes of conduct as stipulated in the Hiroshima AI Process Comprehensive Policy Framework (Comprehensive Framework). Endorsed by the G7 Digital and Tech Ministers on December 1, 2023, the Comprehensive Framework was the first policy package the democratic leaders of the G7 have agreed upon to effectively steward the principles of human-centered AI design, safeguard individual rights, and enhance systems of trust. The framework sends a promising signal of international alignment on responsible development of AI — a momentum that only increases with the Hiroshima AI Process Friends Group support and involvement. Notably, the Hiroshima Process International Code of Conduct for Organizations Developing Advanced AI Systems (HCOC), established within the Comprehensive Framework, builds upon and aligns closely with existing policies in all G7 nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as the G7 has stated that the principles are living documents, there is vast potential yet to be realized, as well as remarkable questions lying ahead: How does the Hiroshima AI Process (HAIP) contribute to achieving interoperability of international rules on advanced AI models? How can it add value beyond other international collaborations on AI governance, such as the Bletchley Declaration by Countries Attending the AI Safety Summit? How can the G7, as a democratic referent, leverage its position as a leading advocate for responsible AI to encourage broader adoption of its governance principles, even in regions with differing political or cultural contexts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer these questions, this report (1) provides a brief overview of the history of AI governance and relevant instances of international cooperation; (2) analyzes the structure and content of the HAIP, with specific focus on the HCOC; (3) examines how the HCOC fits into the international tapestry of AI governance, particularly within the context of G7 nations, and how it can foster regulatory interoperability on advanced AI systems; and (4) identifies and discusses prospective areas of focus for the future development of the HCOC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-short-history-of-ai-governance&quot;&gt;A Short History of AI Governance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the deep-learning breakthroughs of the early 2010s, AI adoption surged across a myriad of industries and sectors. This rapid integration process brought to light a multitude of potential risks. From fatal accidents involving autonomous vehicles to discriminatory hiring practices by AI algorithms, the real-world consequences of AI development have become increasingly evident. Furthermore, manipulation of financial markets by algorithmic trading and the spread of misinformation on social media platforms highlight the broader societal concerns surrounding AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fueled by growing awareness of AI risks in the mid-2010s, national governments (including G7 members), international organizations, tech companies, and nonprofits launched a wave of policy and principle publications. Prominent examples include the European Union’s 2019 Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI, the Recommendation of the Council on Artificial Intelligence by the OECD in 2019 (updated in 2024), and the Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 2021. These publications emphasized pairing AI development with core values such as human rights, democracy, and sustainability as well as key principles including fairness, privacy, safety, security, transparency, and accountability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While fundamental values and AI principles provide a crucial foundation, translating them into implementable standards for AI systems remains a challenge. Addressing this challenge requires concrete and material guidance. Various initiatives have been undertaken at different levels to bridge this gap. At the national level, examples include the AI Risk Management Framework (RMF) published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the United States in January 2023 and Japan’s AI Guidelines for Business. On a supra-national scale, leading examples include the 2023 AI Safety Summit’s Emerging Processes for Frontier AI Safety and the G7’s HCOC — the focus of this report. Additionally, nongovernmental organizations such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) have contributed by issuing international standards on AI governance. The AI management system standard ISO/IEC 42001 was published in December 2023. The Human Rights, Democracy, and the Rule of Law Assurance Framework for AI Systems (HUDERAF), proposed by the Alan Turing Institute to the Council of Europe’s Ad Hoc Committee on Artificial Intelligence, is another significant example of AI risk management and stakeholder engagement. Collectively, these diverse approaches underscore the ongoing efforts to transform abstract AI principles into a practical and implementable reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Many published guidelines and principles for responsible AI development lack legally binding force, making them examples of “soft law.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this common direction, many published guidelines and principles for responsible AI development lack legally binding force, making them examples of “soft law.” While compliance with these documents helps companies with risk prevention strategies and forward-looking accountability measures, there are no guarantees or enforceability measures to ensure adherence to these standards. Thus, to advance stronger commitment to AI governance — in particular, addressing AI systems that pose high risks — there has been an active movement to introduce regulations with legally binding force. For instance, the European Commission introduced the draft AI Act in 2021 (subsequently approved by the European Parliament in March 2024), focusing most of its compliance requirements on high-risk systems and even banning certain systems when the risks they present are deemed unacceptable. Similarly, in 2022, Canada presented a legislative proposal, the Artificial Intelligence and Data Act (AIDA), which focuses on establishing compliance requirements for high-impact AI applications. The United States has also seen a surge in legislative activity targeted at AI, with nearly 80 draft bills introduced, over 30 of which specifically address risk mitigation in AI applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2023 boom in foundation models presents a new layer of complexity to the already challenging landscape of AI governance. While conventional AI has faced issues such as limited explainability, diverse stakeholders, and rapid evolution, foundation models expand the scope and reach of these challenges. The application of these systems in countless contexts and their ease of operation create an even more intricate risk environment. As a result, there has been a surge in global efforts to establish rules and foster international cooperation around advanced AI systems models. The EU AI Act, for example, recently incorporated provisions specifically related to “general purpose AI” systems. Japan’s Liberal Democratic Party proposed the concept note for the Basic Law for the Promotion of Responsible AI in February 2024, which targets advanced foundation AI models with significant societal impact. Similarly, the Chinese government implemented the Interim Measures for the Administration of Generative Artificial Intelligence Services in August 2023. Figure 1 shows the overall structure of AI governance and key documents related to each layer of governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Mw9r2i4.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Overall Structure of AI Governance and Key Documents Related to Each Layer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brief history of AI governance is characterized by a complex and multidimensional balancing act between innovation and regulation, rapidly advancing technology, and the integration of multivector interests — encompassing the technology industry, the general public, and regulators. While these groups may have differing priorities, there is also growing recognition of the need for collaboration. Responses to AI risks have evolved: nations and international bodies initially relied on soft-law principles and public-private collaborative efforts, whereas the current momentum is toward binding legislative action addressing AI. While the European Union’s AI Act and Canada’s proposed AIDA encompass regulations that span various industries, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States have indicated a policy direction that focuses on industry-specific AI regulations or focuses on powerful foundation models. Nonetheless, the regulatory emphasis in all of these instances is primarily on high-risk AI, aiming to strike an appropriate stability between fostering technological development and ensuring safety. G7 countries, in particular, find common ground in core principles such as human rights and democratic values, grounding their AI governance strategies in transparency, explainability, and bias prevention and forming a common unified for responsible AI development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;advancing-international-collaboration&quot;&gt;Advancing International Collaboration&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As countries make progress with AI rulemaking within their borders, international cooperation is also advancing. The G7 is one of the most impactful forums for such international coordination. During the May 2023 summit, G7 leaders committed to establishing the HAIP by the end of the year to foster collaborative policy development on generative AI. Within six months, the G7 digital and tech ministers had delivered the Comprehensive Framework. This framework prioritizes proactive risk management and governance, transparency, and accountability across the AI life cycle. Additionally, it emphasizes anchoring AI development in human rights and democratic values while fostering the use of advanced AI for tackling global challenges such as climate change, healthcare, and education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bletchley Declaration, emerging from the AI Safety Summit held in the United Kingdom in November 2023, stands as another significant milestone in international AI collaboration. The declaration addresses crucial aspects of AI governance, such as the protection of human rights, transparency, explainability, fairness, accountability, human oversight, bias mitigation, and privacy and data protection. Additionally, it highlights the risks associated with manipulating or generating deceptive content. Endorsed by 29 countries and regions, the signatories encompass not only G7 and OECD nations but also partners from the Middle East, Africa, South America, Asia, and, notably, China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United Nations is also active in forming an international AI governance body. In December 2023, the UN AI Advisory Body issued the interim report Governing AI for Humanity. The document addresses a comprehensive set of considerations and actions necessary for governing AI in a manner that benefits humanity as a whole. The report proposes a series of guiding principles and institutional functions aimed at establishing an international governance framework for AI. These include principles such as inclusivity, public interest, and the importance of aligning AI governance with data governance and promoting a data commons. Institutional functions highlighted in the report include assessing the future directions and implications of AI; developing and harmonizing standards, safety, and risk management frameworks; and facilitating the development, deployment, and use of AI for economic and societal benefit through international multistakeholder cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2024, the Council of Europe’s Ad Hoc Committee on Artificial Intelligence introduced the Draft Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence, Human Rights, Democracy and the Rule of Law (AI Treaty), a groundbreaking treaty on AI governance that sets a high bar on responsible AI development. The AI Treaty emphasizes the obligation of signatory nations (parties to the convention) to proactively ensure AI activities are aligned with human rights, democratic integrity, and the rule of law. The treaty advocates for protective measures governing the AI life cycle — including accountability and transparency — and introduces comprehensive risk management frameworks. Furthermore, it calls for robust remedies and procedural safeguards against rights violations, promotes rigorous risk and impact assessments, and delineates duties for international cooperation and implementation, focusing on nondiscrimination and rights protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nations participating in these initiatives vary. Figure 2 maps the structural involvement of various jurisdictions in the above-mentioned international processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/T2qtr7o.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: The Global AI Governance Landscape&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 2 shows why and how the G7 HAIP has significance in global rulemaking on advanced AI systems. First, the G7 nations participate in all significant initiatives mentioned previously — namely the AI Safety Summit, the UN AI Advisory Body, and the AI Treaty. Second, the G7 represents a group of nations with significant economic, regulatory, and technological impact and leadership. In 2023, the GDP of the G7 countries (excluding the European Union, which is a nonenumerated member) accounts for approximately 26.4 percent of the global total. Moreover, most global companies developing advanced AI systems are based in one of the G7 member countries. Establishing interoperable rules for advanced AI systems in these countries is crucial to avoid duplicate compliance costs and to facilitate innovation on a global scale. Third, the G7 is a group of democratic nations, unlike more inclusive bodies such as those in the United Nations or the AI Safety Summit. This shared commitment to democratic principles facilitates a focus on common values, equipping the HAIP to serve as a key foundation not just for safety, but also for realizing fundamental values such as human rights, democracy, and the rule of law in the development and implementation of advanced AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;structure-of-the-comprehensive-framework&quot;&gt;Structure of the Comprehensive Framework&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to the rapid development and global spread of advanced AI, the G7 nations launched the HAIP in May 2023 under Japan’s presidency. This international forum aims to establish common ground for responsible AI development and use. It focuses on fostering safe, secure, and trustworthy AI by addressing key ethical issues, promoting collaboration on research and development, and encouraging international standards for a future where humanity benefits from AI advancements. Although the HAIP focuses on governance of advanced AI systems, the Comprehensive Framework avoids a rigid definition of this technology by providing open terminology in the form of “the most advanced AI systems, including the most advanced foundation models and generative AI systems.” This flexibility likely reflects a desire to adapt to future advancements in AI performance, functionalities, and deployment landscapes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Comprehensive Framework consists of four elements (see Figure 3). First, the OECD’s report G7 Hiroshima Process on Generative Artificial Intelligence serves as a background analysis of the opportunities and risks of advanced AI systems. Second, the Hiroshima Process International Guiding Principles for All AI Actors (HIGP) are 12 general principles for designing, developing, deploying, providing, and using advanced AI systems without providing detailed guidance. Third, the HCOC provides a set of detailed instructions for the developers of advanced AI systems including 11 of the 12 general principles the HIGP provides. Finally, the project-based cooperation on AI includes international collaborations in areas such as content authentication and the labeling of AI-generated content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following section summarizes the contents of the HIGP and HCOC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;contents-of-the-hiroshima-process-international-guiding-principles&quot;&gt;Contents of the Hiroshima Process International Guiding Principles&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HIGP is a comprehensive set of values and best practices promoting responsible development and use of advanced AI on a global scale. It consists of 12 core principles that serve as a foundation for responsible AI governance. These principles closely mirror the values and approaches that G7 nations are already exploring or have drafted and implemented within their individual AI governance frameworks. The analysis here suggests that the 12 principles may be divided into the following three groups (see Table 1):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk management and governance:&lt;/strong&gt; recommended actions to assess and mitigate risks associated with AI systems, ensuring they are reduced to a level that relevant stakeholders deem acceptable&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stakeholder engagement:&lt;/strong&gt; recommended actions to ensure clear communication with and accountability to all relevant stakeholders&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ethical and societal considerations:&lt;/strong&gt; recommended actions to ensure the development, deployment, and usage of AI are in alignment with ethical standards and societal values&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overview-of-the-code-of-conduct&quot;&gt;Overview of the Code of Conduct&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on 11 of the HIGP’s 12 core principles (excluding the trustworthy and responsible use of advanced AI), the HCOC translates these principles and materializes them into a more specific code of practice for organizations developing and deploying advanced AI systems. The HCOC provides a comprehensive road map for AI processes and risk mitigation, outlining general actionable items on the matters of risk management and governance, stakeholder engagement, and ethical considerations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Risk Management and Governance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HCOC emphasizes in items 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 11 the importance of comprehensive risk management for organizations developing advanced AI across the life cycle of development and implementation. These practices include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk identification and mitigation:&lt;/strong&gt; implementing rigorous testing throughout the AI life cycle, such as red-teaming, to identify and address potential safety, security, and trustworthiness issues&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vulnerability and misuse management after deployment:&lt;/strong&gt; postdeployment monitoring for vulnerabilities and misuse, with an emphasis on enabling third-party and user vulnerability reporting, possibly via bounty systems&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Governance and risk management:&lt;/strong&gt; creating transparency about organizations’ governance and risk management policies and regularly updating users on privacy and mitigation measures&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security investments:&lt;/strong&gt; implementing robust security measures throughout the AI life cycle to protect critical system components against threats&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content authentication:&lt;/strong&gt; developing content authentication methods (e.g., watermarking) to help users identify AI-generated content&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data quality, personal data, and intellectual property protection:&lt;/strong&gt; prioritizing data integrity, addressing bias in AI, upholding privacy and respecting intellectual property, and encouraging alignment with relevant legal standards&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stakeholder Engagement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HCOC highlights in items 3 and 4 the critical role of transparency and multistakeholder engagement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transparency and accountability:&lt;/strong&gt; emphasizing public transparency for organizations developing advanced AI, including reporting on both the capabilities of AI systems and their limitations&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsible information sharing:&lt;/strong&gt; encouraging organizations to share information on potential risks, incidents, and best practices with each other, including industry, governments, academia, and the public&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ethical and Societal Considerations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HCOC establishes in items 8, 9, and 10 a series of parameters to ensure AI is developed and deployed within the boundaries of human rights and democracy to address global challenges:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research prioritization for societal safety:&lt;/strong&gt; emphasizing collaborative research to advance AI safety, security, and trustworthiness, focusing on key risks such as upholding democratic values, respecting human rights, and protecting vulnerable groups&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI for global challenges:&lt;/strong&gt; prioritizing development of advanced AI systems to address global challenges such as climate change, health, and education, aligning with the UN Sustainable Development Goals&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;International technical standards:&lt;/strong&gt; encouraging contribution to the development and use of international technical standards, including practices to promote transparency by allowing users to identify AI-generated content (e.g., watermarking), testing methodologies, and cybersecurity policies&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A detailed summary of the HCOC is presented in Table 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ZttR20x.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-potential-of-the-hiroshima-code-of-conduct-toward-interoperable-frameworks-for-advanced-ai-systems&quot;&gt;The Potential of the Hiroshima Code of Conduct: Toward Interoperable Frameworks for Advanced AI Systems&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HCOC, as articulated in the Comprehensive Framework, serves as a pivotal instrument to enhance interoperability between various AI governance frameworks. But how compatible is the HCOC with the regulatory frameworks of G7 members? What are the mechanisms or functionalities that make this interoperability possible? Firstly, the HCOC (and similar voluntary codes of conduct) operate as a potent, nonbinding “common guidance.” Although not legally enforceable, the gravitas and direction of the document wield significant practical influence. The document can shape compliance behaviors, either as good corporate governance standards or as forward-looking risk mitigation strategies in anticipation of further regulation; serve as a reference in private contracts; and even factor into civil or tort liability decisions. Secondly, the HCOC can be integrated into a jurisdiction’s regulatory framework. G7 nations are poised to either introduce new regulations or revise existing structures on AI governance. This opens a window to integrate the HCOC principles in new regulatory waves — an opportunity which is only enhanced by the international alignment represented by the Hiroshima AI Process Friends Group. If these regulations draw upon the HCOC — whether by reference, content consistency, or formal incorporation — this will facilitate and increase regulatory interoperability as well as international cohesion, integrating an AI governance framework that safeguards human rights, democracy, and the rule of law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section explores the space the HCOC holds within the G7 regulatory context and how it can foster interoperability between the regulations of different G7 jurisdictions on advanced AI systems. First, the section examines the current state of AI regulation within each G7 member state. This analysis assesses the compatibility between the HCOC principles and existing frameworks. Notably, a significant overlap already exists between the core elements of the G7 nations’ regulatory documents and the HCOC. Second, building on this compatibility, the section explores various avenues for integrating the HCOC into the regulatory frameworks of G7 member states. By exploring these options, the section identifies the most effective means of leveraging the HCOC to achieve interoperability in G7 AI governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;status-of-ai-governance-in-the-g7-and-hcoc-as-common-guidance&quot;&gt;Status of AI Governance in the G7 and HCOC as Common Guidance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HCOC serves as a central reference point in the evolving global landscape of AI governance. This section provides insight into how the HCOC aligns with the existing frameworks in G7 jurisdictions, including Canada, the European Union, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Next, the section contains a brief overview of each jurisdiction’s regulatory status, identifies the documents that closely align with the HCOC’s structure and functionality, and evaluates their compatibility with the HCOC’s content. A summary of this analysis is shown in the annex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The HCOC serves as a central reference point in the evolving global landscape of AI governance.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Canada:&lt;/strong&gt; Canada is in the process of formulating a comprehensive regulatory framework for AI under Bill C-27, known as AIDA. This legislation prioritizes risk mitigation for “high-impact” AI systems. Additionally, Canada has published a Voluntary Code of Conduct for Responsible Development and Management of Advanced Generative AI Systems, offering nonbinding guidelines for AI industry stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;European Union:&lt;/strong&gt; The European Union has been at the forefront of AI regulation with the AI Act, passed in March 2024. This legislation sets a robust and comprehensive framework for trustworthy AI development and implementation, emphasizing a risk-based regulatory approach. The AI Act mandates the development of codes of practice to guide its implementation, ensuring alignment with international standards as well as evolving technology and market trends.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Japan:&lt;/strong&gt; Japan’s approach to AI governance emphasizes maximizing the positive societal impacts of AI and capitalizing on a risk-based and agile governance model. Taking a sector-specific approach, Japan seeks to promote AI implementation through regulatory reforms tailored to specific industries and markets, such as transportation, finance, and medical devices. This strategy includes updating more than 10,000 regulations or ordinances that require “analog” compliance methods, including requirements for paper documents, on-site periodic inspections, and dedicated in-person staffing. In addition, Japan launched the AI Guidelines for Business as a voluntary AI risk management tool. The principles for advanced AI systems established in the HIGP are directly integrated into these guidelines, following Japan’s presidency of the G7 during the HAIP Comprehensive Framework drafting process.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;United Kingdom:&lt;/strong&gt; The United Kingdom is developing a decentralized regulatory approach focusing on sector-specific guidelines, a pro-innovation stance, and public-private collaboration through specialized AI institutions. While the United Kingdom is not currently enforcing a comprehensive AI law or drafting a central code of conduct, it emphasizes traditional AI governance principles such as safety, security, transparency, and fairness to inform its sector-driven regulations. The UK Department for Science, Innovation and Technology also published a practical guidance code in the form of the Emerging Processes for Frontier AI Safety, ahead of the UK AI Safety Summit, where 28 nations and the European Union were signatories of the Bletchley Declaration.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;United States:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States has adopted a decentralized, multitiered regulatory strategy for AI governance, with specialized agencies overseeing sector-specific regulations. Key initiatives include the Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence, which directs agencies to formulate regulations addressing specific industries; the RMF, developed by NIST to provide guidelines for risk assessment and management; the White House’s Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights, outlining foundational principles for AI development; and the White House’s nonbinding voluntary commitments for ensuring safe, secure, and trustworthy AI endorsed by companies such as Amazon, Anthropic, Google, Inflection, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and OpenAI, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;achieving-and-enhancing-regulatory-interoperability-the-hcoc-as-a-reference-point-for-ai-governance-development&quot;&gt;Achieving and Enhancing Regulatory Interoperability: The HCOC as a Reference Point for AI Governance Development&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite sharing common principles and core values, the AI governance landscape across the G7 is complex and multifaceted. The European Union has instituted robust and comprehensive regulations through its AI Act, and Canada is in the process of developing similar hard-law frameworks. Conversely, the United States, Japan, and the United Kingdom lean toward sector-specific and lighter-touch regulatory approaches. As such, the G7 nations exhibit a patchwork of regulations regarding AI use. This regulatory inconsistency creates challenges for global businesses, forcing them to navigate complex legal landscapes and varying rights and obligations across these key markets. The HCOC holds promise as a unifying mechanism, bridging these regulatory disparities and promoting interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The HCOC holds promise as a unifying mechanism, bridging these regulatory disparities and promoting interoperability.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HCOC may be integrated into national regulations across G7 countries through various means, such as direct legal referencing or recognition, content integration, and leveraging or materially harmonizing specific aspects of regulatory developments. Pathways for integration into the regulatory frameworks of the G7 jurisdictions include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Canada:&lt;/strong&gt; Overall, Canada’s voluntary code of conduct specifically, and its regulatory trajectory generally, demonstrates alignment with the international conversation on ethical AI development and the HCOC’s principles. As AIDA evolves, it presents the potential to translate these principles into enforceable regulations, further solidifying Canada’s commitment to responsible AI advancement. As AIDA may include advanced AI systems within its regulatory scope, this upcoming law opens a clear possibility to find common ground with the HCOC’s principles and functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;European Union:&lt;/strong&gt; The EU AI Act mandates the development of codes of practice to formalize its implementation. These codes of practice are poised to address practical aspects of responsible AI development, aligning with the HCOC’s focus. Furthermore, the European Union acknowledges the influence of international standards in shaping these codes of practice, presenting an opportunity to materially integrate or formally reference the HCOC in the EU AI governance framework.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Japan:&lt;/strong&gt; In February 2024, the Liberal Democratic Party proposed the concept note for the Basic Law for the Promotion of Responsible AI. The proposed legislation specifically targets advanced foundational AI models with significant societal impact. It requires model developers to adhere to seven key measures, including third-party vulnerability checks and the disclosure of model specifications. The requirements align with the voluntary commitmentsS. companies have made to the White House. The HCOC could serve as a valuable reference point for implementation of these key measures, especially considering that the HCOC principles are already integrated into Japan’s AI Guidelines for Business.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;United Kingdom:&lt;/strong&gt; Besides leading international discussions on AI governance through initiatives such as the Bletchley Declaration, the United Kingdom is proactively formulating its own AI governance framework. According to A Pro-innovation Approach to AI Regulation, the UK government is undergoing technical policy analysis on regulation and life-cycle accountability of capable general purpose systems. The nation has also committed to updating the Emerging Processes for Frontier AI Safety, which is highly compatible with the HCOC, by the end of 2024. To build its AI regulatory and deployment capacity, the United Kingdom is opting for collaborative private-public development through institutions such as the Digital Regulation Cooperation Forum and the AI Safety Institute. Considering the current institutional inertia and the stalled progress regarding its AI in intellectual property code, the United Kingdom might leverage the HCOC and its international scope to inform potential regulatory initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;United States:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States is in a period of active development of its AI governance frameworks. The AI executive order has directed multiple agencies to deliver sector-specific guidance publications, and there are more than 80 draft bills addressing AI, with over 30 focused on risk mitigation. Notably, after releasing RMF 1.0 in January 2023, NIST established the Generative AI Public Work Group to spearhead development of a cross-sectoral AI RMF profile for managing the risks of generative AI models or systems. The HCOC’s emphasis on responsible risk management and governance aligns seamlessly with the United States’ principles-based trajectory and could fit into proposed risk mitigation legislation, positioning the HCOC as a crucial reference in shaping AI regulatory policy in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hiroshima-code-of-conduct-20-next-steps-toward-a-more-harmonized-ai-governance-framework&quot;&gt;Hiroshima Code of Conduct 2.0: Next Steps toward a More Harmonized AI Governance Framework&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current landscape of AI governance is jurisdictionally fragmented, with national regulations creating a patchwork of requirements for developers of advanced AI systems and providing differing rights to its users. However, as this report has analyzed, the HCOC holds significant potential to enhance interoperability among the governance frameworks of G7 members. Further, it also serves as a model for the wider international community, namely the Hiroshima AI Process Friends Group. Nonetheless, the current HCOC lacks specificity to serve as useful material guidance. Future discussions among G7 leaders should focus on how the HCOC may be updated to ensure interoperability of rules for advanced AI systems across not only G7 countries but also the global community, serving as a benchmark for leveraging values such as human rights, democracy, and the rule of law. This section highlights key considerations to be addressed in future updates of the HCOC in alignment with its structure, including within (1) terminology and definitional interoperability, (2) risk management and governance, (3) stakeholder engagement, (4) ethical and societal considerations, and (5) further areas for exploration not contained within the current HCOC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Future discussions among G7 leaders should focus on how the HCOC may be updated to ensure interoperability of rules for advanced AI systems across not only G7 countries but also the global community.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;terminology-and-definitions-indexing-a-common-vocabulary&quot;&gt;Terminology and Definitions: Indexing a Common Vocabulary&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HCOC can serve as a foundation for a consistent definition or methodology for identification of terms for advanced AI systems governance, facilitating smoother regulatory implementation across jurisdictions. Future terminology consensus includes the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bridge the terminology gap:&lt;/strong&gt; The HCOC can endorse consistent definitions for streamlined regulatory implementation across jurisdictions, fostering a common understanding of critical concepts. This could be achieved by including a glossary of key terms with clear, agreed-upon definitions or by establishing methodologies for identifying and classifying AI systems based on factors relevant to risk assessment. By establishing a common language, the HCOC can ease communication, regulatory certainty, and business-sector collaboration across borders. Underscoring the importance of a shared language around AI, the European Union and the United States are currently in the development of 65 key terms “essential to understanding risk-based approaches to AI.” Notably, even when common terminology has been developed (e.g., through the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council, OECD, or the ISO), the definition of advanced AI systems is unclear, leaving the question of which criteria (e.g., floating point operations, quality and size of data set, or input and output modalities) should be used to determine advanced AI systems — a gap across jurisdictions that can be bridged by the HCOC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;risk-management-and-governance-building-a-common-and-robust-framework&quot;&gt;Risk Management and Governance: Building a Common and Robust Framework&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effective risk management stands as a cornerstone of responsible development of advanced AI systems. The HCOC can significantly contribute to this endeavor by advocating for shared principles and best practices. Risk management cohesion across jurisdictions includes the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identify and share security risks, particularly systemic risks:&lt;/strong&gt; The HCOC can enhance its interoperability contribution by explicitly listing and addressing security risks, particularly those with systemic consequences. This can be achieved through a two-pronged approach. First, the HCOC can integrate a comprehensive list of typical AI risks common to advanced AI systems, such as AI hallucinations (generating inaccurate outputs), fake content generation (deepfakes), intellectual property infringement (copyrighted content integration in data sets), job market transformations due to automation, the environmental impact of AI systems, bias amplification based on training data, and privacy concerns, among others. Case studies can be implemented through “project-based cooperation,” which constitutes the fourth element of the Comprehensive Framework. Second, the HCOC can establish a risk assessment framework to categorize AI systems based on their potential for harm. This framework could leverage existing models such as the EU AI Act’s categorization of “general purpose AI models with systemic risk.” By prioritizing systems with the greatest potential for systemic issues, the HCOC can provide a clearer road map for identifying, understanding, and mitigating various risks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhance clarity in the risk management process:&lt;/strong&gt; The HCOC can encourage the development of standardized risk management policies tailored to specific AI applications. Future drafting can reference or draw insights from established risk management frameworks, such as ISO/IEC 42001:2023 or NIST’s RMF — especially the RMF to be developed by the Generative AI Public Working Group, slated for public review in April 2024. Additionally, policies can incorporate learnings from other reputable sources to enhance clarity and comprehensiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop standard data governance, risk management, and information security policies:&lt;/strong&gt; Risk management, information security, and data governance standardization addressing the utilization, obtainment, and storage of data should receive clear and unified focus by the HCOC. The development of standardized policies can leverage established frameworks such as ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27002 or NIST’s Cybersecurity Framework, which provide a structured foundation adaptable to the unique risk landscape of the development of advanced AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implement content authentication mechanisms:&lt;/strong&gt; The HCOC can list reliable content authentication and provenance mechanisms to enable users to identify the originators of content or establish common labeling mechanisms to help users understand that AI has generated any specified content. These contributions could be based on input from the HAIP’s project-based cooperation. Authentication mechanisms can safeguard against misinformation and uphold democratic values and human rights by verifying data sources and outputs. However, it is imperative to balance these efforts with the protection of individual privacy, ensuring authentication processes do not compromise personal data. This balance is key to maintaining public trust and promoting the responsible use of AI technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;stakeholder-engagement-fostering-transparency-and-accountability&quot;&gt;Stakeholder Engagement: Fostering Transparency and Accountability&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building trust in AI necessitates robust stakeholder engagement. A transparent and accountable AI development process fosters public confidence and encourages information sharing. Future pathways for stakeholder engagement include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish standardized formats for transparency reports:&lt;/strong&gt; The HCOC can promote adoption of standardized formats for transparency reports. By consolidating best practices and identifying common risks, the HCOC can offer a template for companies to self-assess and disclose relevant information consistently across jurisdictions. A potential model for standardized formatting pursuant to transparency reports is the UK Algorithmic Transparency Recording Standard. Standardization would enable companies to have uniform international disclosure criteria, enhancing cross-border cohesive reporting and auditing consistency as well as allowing the public to better understand the development and operation of AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Define clear formats for incident sharing:&lt;/strong&gt; Encouraging adoption of clear incident-sharing formats can facilitate the exchange of information about security breaches, biases, or unintended consequences observed in deployed AI systems. This collaborative approach to sharing and learning from incidents enables stakeholders to develop effective mitigation strategies, ultimately enhancing the safety and reliability of AI technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ethical-and-societal-considerations-upholding-the-rule-of-law-human-rights-and-core-democratic-values&quot;&gt;Ethical and Societal Considerations: Upholding the Rule of Law, Human Rights, and Core Democratic Values&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The G7, a group of leading democracies, has a unique opportunity to shape the global conversation around responsible AI development. The HCOC, as an initiative stemming from this group, can play a crucial role in ensuring AI development aligns with the ethical and societal considerations that underpin democratic values and secure human rights in AI development and implementation. Potential pathways to prioritizing these principles include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reinforce the primacy of the rule of law, human rights, and democratic principles:&lt;/strong&gt; The HCOC already champions these values and emphasizes human-centric design. However, there is room for further enhancement and substantiation for practical application. For instance, the HCOC could enhance its guidance on how organizations should foster research and AI development that prioritizes the protection of fairness, privacy, and intellectual property rights while also tackling global challenges such as climate change, health, and education. Rather than providing detailed descriptions itself, the HCOC could make reference to other international agreements or widely recognized standards. Furthermore, the HCOC could strengthen democratic principles and the rule of law by highlighting due safeguards for freedom of expression, ensuring AI does not minimize dissent or impose undue restrictions on information access, guaranteeing a right to remedy for individuals adversely affected by AI and promoting transparency and accountability in AI decisionmaking processes. Enhancing human-centricity could involve advocating for effective oversight in high-risk applications, providing individuals with explanations about AI-driven decisions affecting them, and promoting inclusive design that caters to the diverse needs and perspectives of various populations to ensure equitable AI benefits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;further-areas-for-exploration&quot;&gt;Further Areas for Exploration&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HCOC can play a key role in exploring several critical areas for further development in responsible AI:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acknowledge special considerations for government use of AI:&lt;/strong&gt; The HCOC can play a pivotal role in delineating special considerations for government use of AI, ensuring governmental powers in AI deployment are appropriately circumscribed and limited. Drawing inspiration from the AI Treaty and leveraging principles from the OECD Declaration on Government Access to Personal Data Held by Private Sector Entities, the HCOC can establish clear guidelines that emphasize due process in developing and deploying advanced AI systems by the public sector, such as legal basis, legitimate aims, oversight, and redress, in addition to building upon and reinforcing shared foundational AI governance principles such as privacy, transparency, and accountability. By aligning with these values, the HCOC can become a democratic referent, and governments can leverage the power of AI responsibly while mitigating potential risks and fostering public trust.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Borrow best practices and harmonize regulatory approaches:&lt;/strong&gt; The HCOC can explore the potential for incorporating best practices from various jurisdictions’ regulations. This could involve elements such as certification mechanisms, robust oversight mechanisms, and iterative audit controls.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Certification mechanisms:&lt;/strong&gt; The HCOC can establish a framework for certification and registration mechanisms for high-risk advanced AI systems. This system could ensure rigorous evaluation throughout the life cycle of high-risk and advanced AI systems, from pre-market integrative assessments to ongoing post-market analyses and compliance reviews. The HCOC could define risk categories and establish criteria for the need for certification.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oversight methodologies:&lt;/strong&gt; The HCOC can emphasize the importance of effective oversight in AI systems to mitigate potential harm and address incidents effectively. In some cases, human involvement in critical AI processes is necessary, while in other cases machines can detect risks much faster and more precisely than humans. The HCOC could propose guidelines addressing whether to prioritize human judgment and intervention, especially in high-risk AI applications, ensuring a balance between the enhanced efficiency of automation, and the fairness and legitimacy of human oversight.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audit mechanisms:&lt;/strong&gt; The HCOC can extend procedural cohesion beyond AI implementation by establishing common processes for iterative audits, ensuring continuous monitoring and evaluation of AI systems’ compliance with established principles and guidelines. By considering and potentially adapting existing frameworks, such as the UK Guidance on the AI Auditing Framework, the HCOC can equip organizations with practical tools for ongoing evaluations. These iterative audits would allow for continuous improvement and ensure AI systems remain aligned with responsible development principles throughout their life cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish means for redress:&lt;/strong&gt; The HCOC could expand discussions about redress for harms caused by advanced AI systems. This could involve exploring access to remedies and explanations for individuals affected by AI decisions in areas as diverse as copyright and intellectual property to judicial processing. As AI plays a growing role in judicial decisionmaking, for example, developing specific appeal mechanisms for harms caused by AI content may become crucial. The HCOC could encourage developers and deployers of advanced AI systems to provide appropriate dispute resolution mechanisms to users and harmed parties. Furthermore, to make victim relief more effective, G7 members could discuss shifting the burden of proof of damages or causal links and establishing accessible, fast, and low-cost dispute resolution mechanisms for damages caused by advanced AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foster shared responsibility in the AI ecosystem:&lt;/strong&gt; The HCOC addresses developers of advanced AI systems only. However, its scope could expand in the future to other actors within the AI value chain, such as deployers and users of advanced AI systems. In addition, it is important to examine how to distribute responsibility and liability among stakeholders, ensuring all parties are accountable for their respective roles in potential harms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By focusing on these key areas, the HCOC can evolve into a powerful tool for facilitating a more cohesive and effective approach to AI governance on a global scale. The HCOC’s dynamic nature positions it to bridge the gap between diverse national frameworks, fostering a future of responsible AI development for the G7 nations and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The G7 nations’ endorsement of the HIGP and the HCOC, supported by more than 40 countries through the Hiroshima AI Process Friends Group, marks a significant milestone in international AI governance. This agreement by leading democratic economies signifies a strong international commitment to fostering human-centered AI development that safeguards individual rights and bolsters trust in AI systems. The weight and influence of this international collaboration on the global stage imbues this agreement with particular impact and significance, holding the potential to shape the future of AI governance worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, for the promise of the Comprehensive Framework to be fully realized, its key practical instrument, the HCOC, requires further development. While the HCOC, as this report reveals, significantly aligns with the trajectory of existing G7 policies, it currently lacks the material specificity to provide truly effective guidance for practical implementation. Moving forward, it is crucial to engage in substantive discussions on enhancing the HCOC in several key areas. These areas include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coordinating a common vocabulary:&lt;/strong&gt; A unified understanding of key terms and definitions is essential for ensuring consistent interpretation of AI terms across borders.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developing robust risk management frameworks and risk-based categorization:&lt;/strong&gt; The HCOC should provide clear guidance on assessing and mitigating risks associated with advanced AI systems throughout the entire AI life cycle, from pre-market duties to post-market updates.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promoting harmonized stakeholder engagement:&lt;/strong&gt; The HCOC can play a valuable role in encouraging cohesive approaches to stakeholder engagement and developing consistent transparency standards.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthening democratic and human rights principles:&lt;/strong&gt; The HCOC should provide more concrete and actionable steps for upholding democratic values and safeguarding human rights in the context of AI development and deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pursuing further areas for discussion:&lt;/strong&gt; The HCOC’s potential extends beyond its current scope. The G7 can leverage this collaborative document to explore critical areas such as developing special considerations for government AI use, harmonizing regulatory practices (e.g., certification mechanisms, oversight methodologies, and audit mechanisms), fostering shared responsibility within the AI ecosystem, and establishing redress mechanisms for AI harms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A strengthened HCOC can serve as a valuable reference point not only for G7 nations but also for a broader international audience seeking to navigate the complexities of responsible AI development and deployment.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By addressing these crucial areas, the HCOC has the potential to evolve into a truly robust and impactful instrument for global AI governance. A strengthened HCOC can serve as a valuable reference point not only for G7 nations but also for a broader international audience seeking to navigate the complexities of responsible AI development and deployment. This international alignment can help ensure the power of AI is harnessed for the benefit of all while mitigating potential risks and upholding core human values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Russia’s war against Ukraine well into its third year, fears of a potential “spillover” into the Arctic remain high. With Sweden and Finland having recently joined NATO, three things become clear. First, there is now de facto “more NATO” in the Arctic. Second, Russia’s fears of strategic encirclement are not going away any time soon. Third, the dividing line between Russia and the West in the Arctic has never been starker – there is now what can be argued to be a “NATO 7 vs Russia” in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implications for Arctic cooperation are significant. “Arctic exceptionalism” – the idea that the challenges facing the region encouraged cooperation and not geostrategic competition – which for so long was regarded as the guiding light for relations between the eight Arctic states (Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the US), has all but dissipated. The principle of “circumpolarity” (the idea that the Arctic 8 should collectively determine the region’s future) has also been eroded. The impact on the Permanent Participants (representing Arctic indigenous peoples) has been largely overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenges faced by the Arctic Council (the premier forum for regional cooperation) over the past two years are emblematic of the current state of circumpolar affairs. Within weeks of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, seven of the eight member states (Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Finland, Norway, Sweden and the US) jointly “paused” their involvement in the Council and its affiliated bodies. Around a third of the Council’s 130 projects were reportedly put on hold, with new projects blocked and existing projects unable to be renewed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gradually, the “Arctic 7” have found ways to resume activities with minimal participation from Russia. The handover of the chairship from Russia to Norway in 2023 proceeded smoothly. In February 2024, Norway announced that the Council’s Working Groups, where the organisation’s main work takes place, would be resumed with the participation of all states, including Russia – but only in a virtual format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet despite these steps to restore critical functions, there is still good reason to be concerned by the Arctic Council’s future prospects. Even as plans for the Working Groups to meet virtually were being drawn up, Moscow announced that it would suspend its annual payments to the Arctic Council until the organisation resumes its work in full. Since 2022, Russia has restricted access to scientific data that is crucial to monitoring climate change, and especially to assessing the potential impact of carbon dioxide and methane “bombs” being released by Russia’s melting permafrost as part of a feedback loop. Such a situation will negatively impact climate change prediction models at large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Signs of increasing collaboration in the Arctic between Russia and other members of the so-called BRICS+ (Brazil, India, China, South Africa, Iran, Saudia Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Ethiopia) have prompted further concern that Moscow may be preparing to pursue the commercial exploitation of the Arctic Zone of the Russian Federation (AZRF) independently of the Arctic 7. With Chinese interests in mind, such a situation could be to Moscow’s long-term detriment, as Beijing might be tempted to impose its own views on Arctic governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The fragmentation of circumpolar cooperation is closing doors on diplomatic activity that could help to diffuse tensions and promote confidence-building measure&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Russia has shown little appetite for addressing circumpolar challenges relating to climate change, the rights of indigenous communities, the management of biodiversity and living resources, environmental pollution, and the threat of radioactive contamination from Soviet-era and current nuclear activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid all this uncertainty over the future of Arctic cooperation and whether the Arctic Council can survive (without betraying the West’s commitment to Ukraine), military activity in the region has continued to increase. The accession of Finland and Sweden to NATO necessarily requires a re-evaluation of the Alliance’s defence planning across the Wider North (comprising the North Atlantic, Arctic and Baltic). This is likely to become a significant point of contention with Moscow, particularly as it begins to drive the restructuring of commands in the European and Northern theatres, the reconfiguration of forces and deployments, and new patterns of training and exercising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viewed from Moscow, the “enlargement” of NATO closer to Russian borders is feeding a sense of not only vindication but also increased conventional vulnerability. Furthermore, melting ice in the AZRF is no longer a reliable source of protection along Russia’s northern border, which is further strengthening the Kremlin’s Arctic insecurities. Russia’s own Arctic ground forces in the European High North have been largely decimated by war operations in Ukraine, which will continue to divert attention and resources away from the Arctic theatre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Moscow’s military posture in the Arctic has not changed in the context of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and it remains bent on obsessive control over the AZRF and countering NATO activity. Russia’s vast multi-layered network of Arctic-capable air and coastal defence systems has stayed in place along the AZRF and has not been tremendously impacted by the war against Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context – and judging by the sense of conventional vulnerability fuelling Russia’s Arctic insecurities – there is a risk that Moscow could engage in more overt nuclear sabre-rattling and escalatory behaviour. There remains an outside chance that Russia could resume nuclear weapons testing on the islands of Novaya Zemlya. This situation is compounded by the inherent risk of miscalculation provoked by accidents, incidents and tactical errors, left unchecked by the current absence of lines of communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the fragmentation of circumpolar cooperation is closing doors on diplomatic activity that could help to diffuse tensions and promote confidence-building measures. Prior to 2022, there was some discussion of re-establishing joint military forums or some form of “code of conduct”, but this dissipated quickly as Moscow’s designs on Ukraine became clear. The chances of a predictable Arctic in military security terms are growing slimmer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The risk of an armed conflict in the Arctic is clearly higher than it was. However, this does not mean that either NATO or Moscow is any more likely to seek a conflict in the Arctic than they were prior to Russia’s assault on Ukraine. Considering the complexity of the operating environment, there is little incentive for Moscow – or NATO – to escalate in the Arctic per se, let alone conduct high-intensity warfare operations there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;For now, the most likely scenario is that we will continue to see a balancing and counterbalancing of NATO and Russian forces in the High North as both sides adjust to the realities of Swedish and Finnish membership of NATO&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no sign yet (publicly at least) that either side is seeking to change the “facts on the ground” regarding critical international agreements, or even press claims in areas of disagreement – for instance, over how to interpret the Svalbard Treaty on the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) as it applies to the Northeast Passage (including the Northern Sea Route, or NSR) and the delimitation of extended continental shelves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Russia remains determined to control “its” Arctic and the NSR. Over the past few years, successive waves of regulations have increasingly restricted passage through the NSR, placing it under Moscow’s tight control. If, even as the effects of climate change are felt, Russia maintains its dubious interpretation of the status of the NSR, or if the Kremlin seeks to further restrict passage along the route (especially for foreign military vessels), there could be more serious consideration of a US- or NATO-led Freedom of Navigation operation, even if it increases the risk of an armed clash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These issues are all the more critical in the context of the renewed US interest in Arctic affairs as part of the 2022 National Strategy for the Arctic Region (NSAR) and its 2023 Implementation Plan. Indeed, the NSAR is quite clear regarding protecting freedom of navigation across the Arctic region in accordance with UNCLOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, the most likely scenario is that we will continue to see a balancing and counterbalancing of NATO and Russian forces in the High North as both sides adjust to the realities of Swedish and Finnish membership of NATO. The danger is that this could increase the risk of a miscalculation provoked by an accident escalating into something worse. More presence and platforms in a changing Arctic will undoubtedly bring about more incidents, including environmental catastrophes and human-made disasters, with indigenous peoples and other local communities bearing the brunt of the impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, we anticipate that the Arctic will remain in limbo until one side or the other makes a move to either restore or abandon the Arctic Council, or attempts to press a claim that undermines the commitment that all the Arctic states made in Ilulissat in 2008 (and again in 2018) to resolve their disputes in accordance with international law. The wider risk is that in the absence of a circumpolar approach, creeping alternatives will harden the dividing lines between Russia and the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither side currently looks ready to blink first. China, meanwhile, may seek to exploit the fragmentation of Arctic governance to push for its own “free for all” approach. All the while, human insecurity and climate breakdown in the Arctic look set to worsen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（23日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第82日審訊。在辯方要求下，庭上播放多段黎智英直播節目「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」片段。在2020年8月的節目中，黎智英邀請天主教香港教區榮休主教陳日君樞機擔任嘉賓，談及中梵「秘密協議」、內地的地下教會和宗教自由。黎一度問陳日君，假設香港的教會受壓而要變成「愛國教會」，他會否領頭成立地下教會。陳日君則指地下教會不應該有領袖，而他只是教區的主教，但是教會的領袖應該是上帝，又指教會應該由信徒共同建立。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英若中國被實施制裁或禁運-台灣將成亞洲晶片技術樞紐&quot;&gt;黎智英：若中國被實施制裁或禁運 台灣將成亞洲晶片技術樞紐&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在2020年9月24日的節目中，黎指中國依賴外國的技術，若果中國被制裁的話，將難以研發製造晶片的技術，對科技和經濟造成打擊，屆時台灣在製造半導體的角色便會變得更重要。黎又指中美打仗的可能性不大，因美國這個時候仍需要在亞洲國家進行工作，以應對中國的崛起。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在2020年10月1日的節目中，黎相信不論特朗普或拜登均會與中國對抗，但是二人的分別在於，特朗普作風較務實，惟拜登則傾向理想化中國。黎認為，面對如此強大的中國，不能只停留在理想層面，要考慮現實層面，而特朗普比拜登更加務實。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎又指，若外國對中國實施制裁和禁運的話，台灣將會變成亞洲的晶片技術樞紐，並作為一個「獨特的國家」。以往台灣害怕得罪中國而避免與美國走得太近，但是當美國向台灣提供支援，台灣便會有更大信心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎指中國不想要打仗，但是現在已經有一個在科技、外交和貿易上的「冷戰」。黎又指世界已經一體化，中國不能與世界割裂，新冠疫情爆發使世界看到中國的價值和道德正在威脅人們的性命，現在是時候解決中共的威脅。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;節目邀陳日君談宗教自由-黎智英指中梵秘密協議導致災難性後果&quot;&gt;節目邀陳日君談宗教自由 黎智英指中梵秘密協議導致災難性後果&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年10月8日的節目邀請到天主教香港教區榮休主教陳日君樞機擔任嘉賓。樞機先談及他先前赴羅馬要求會見教宗方濟各，就香港教區主教人選表達想法，惟日夜等候消息卻不獲接見，最終只能回港。黎智英則對樞機以88歲之齡赴羅馬表示欣賞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;節目談到中梵之間就主教任命簽訂「秘密協議」，然而協議內容至今從未公開。黎智英形容情況是災難性，有些內地教會主教是真誠的信徒，但是因為不獲中國官方認可而需要辭職。陳日君樞機則分析指，因為中梵協議，內地的地下教會將會越來越弱勢，因為它們失去梵蒂崗的支持。黎智英則指，雖然地下教會變得越來越弱勢，但是信徒在靈性上會越來越強大，他仍然抱有希望。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主持人 Mark Clifford 提到，夏寶龍過往採取強硬手腕打壓內地的地下教會，而他現時擔任國務院港澳辦主任，問這安排是否一個巧合，又問香港未來還會否有宗教自由。陳日君則指有時需要與官方溝通，有時也需要和平地抗議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英問陳日君，假設香港的教會受壓而要變成「愛國教會」，他會否帶頭成立地下教會；黎又表示會參與陳日君的地下教會，成為「第一個信徒」。陳日君則指地下教會不應該有領袖，而他只是教區的主教，但是教會的領袖應該是上帝。黎追問，但是地下教會總得有神父、領袖或始創人來帶領信徒。陳日君則重申，教會應該由信徒共同建立。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審，控方將繼續播放直播節目片段。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（22日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第81日審訊。在辯方要求下，庭上播放多段黎智英直播節目「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」片段。在一段《蘋果》宣傳訂閱的影片中，黎表示：「我覺得我哋對市民有責任，無論點艱難、點危險都好，我哋都要用一個探水、嘗試嘅方法，去做到保留市民嘅一把聲喺度囉。」黎又稱不會後悔，會一直做下去，「無論幾辛苦都好，因為一個人去到最後，係為咗活著嘅一個意義，做啱咗嘢，你覺得有意義嘅時候，你就唔會後悔。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英指人生不關乎自己而是比自己更加重要的東西&quot;&gt;黎智英指人生不關乎自己而是比自己更加重要的東西&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方播放2020年8月27日的「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」節目片段，嘉賓包括美國聖母大學政治學系副教授許田波。黎批評中國不願跟從國際秩序，沒有法治、人權和憲法所保障的自由，當中國在經濟發展上逐漸追上西方國家，然而在文明程度方面卻與西方國家出現很大分別。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在觀眾提問環節，正被警方國安處通緝的許穎婷提問，她稱發表文章《我是香港人，不是中國人》以及在美國當地舉辦遊行之後，她開始被視為一名行動者，但是作為一個新聞系學生，她猶豫應否表露自己的政治立場，問黎有否面對類似掙扎。黎智英則表示不打算離開香港，「你的人生並不關乎你自己，而是關乎比你自己更加重要的東西」，只要是正確的事，便會推動自己去做下去，又指他們將成為人類歷史的一部份，並為後代留下足印。其後許穎婷追問作為記者應否表露自己的立場，黎則回應，記者不應該迴避表露自己的立場，應真誠地表達自己想法，並講出真相。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英稱無論如何艱難都會用探水方式-冀保留市民一把聲音&quot;&gt;黎智英稱無論如何艱難都會用「探水」方式 冀保留市民一把聲音&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方播放一段由《蘋果》製作的宣傳片段，開首黎智英被問到訂閱蘋果會否違法，他笑言應該不會，又說：「第一唔係毒品，第二唔係槍械。」片段顯示警方搜查壹傳媒大樓和拘捕黎智英的片段，黎智英說：「基本上如果跟住《國安法》去做，傳媒就冇得做。」他續指：「啫係要睇住你哋自己嘅安全，你哋自己嘅良知，同埋對社會嘅責任去做呢個工作囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英稱：「我坐監嘅影響唔係好大，唔係我直接管㗎喇。希望張劍虹唔好坐監啦，就算係 Royston（周達權）都好，黃偉強都好，我都需要佢哋。」黎又笑言：「自己都覺得過意唔去，如果累到佢哋坐監，希望唔好啦。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎稱：「第一就係，我好多謝啦，啲香港朋友真係大力支持，甚至乎用我哋隻股票去做抗議啦。」他指需要依靠訂閱來維持營運，因為一年間訂閱人數下跌了四分之一，由80多萬人減少至60多萬人，反映《蘋果》的內容不足以吸引讀者或留住他們。所以他們增設主題網站（minisite），有健康、親子、旅遊、飲食和投資的內容，希望將新聞或資訊變成服務，令讀者的生活更加方便，從而提升《蘋果》的價值。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎表示：「我覺得我哋對市民有責任，無論點艱難、點危險都好，我哋都要用一個探水、嘗試嘅方法，去做到保留市民嘅一把聲喺度囉。」影片顯示黎保釋出來翌日回到壹傳媒大樓，他擁抱張劍虹，並表示：「累埋你，累埋你喇！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎最後表示：「我諗唔會後悔嘅，唔會後悔嘅，一路繼續去做，無論幾辛苦都好，因為一個人去到最後，係為咗活著嘅一個意義，做啱嘅嘢，你覺得有意義嘅時候，你就唔會後悔。」黎說：「我哋都撐得幾辛苦吓，但係無論點樣我哋都會撐落去。大家一齊努力囉，各自爬山囉，齊上齊落囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英直播節目籲羅傑斯繼續堅持他的工作-因國際社會是香港人的救贖&quot;&gt;黎智英直播節目籲羅傑斯繼續堅持他的工作 因國際社會是香港人的救贖&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另播放2020年9月10日的「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」片段，當天嘉賓為「香港監察」創辦人羅傑斯（Benedict Rogers）。黎智英指他自己有機會被控告「勾結外國勢力」，所以海外人士的聲音變得更重要，他希望羅傑斯繼續堅持他的工作，又形容國際社會是香港人的救贖（savior），關注香港的聲音愈多，香港便會愈安全。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在2020年9月17日的「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」節目中，黎智英指中國不跟從國際秩序和普世價值，以往歐洲國家不願改變中國，因為只想與中國做生意，但是當中國逐漸強大，歐洲國家便會開始覺得有需要與美國結盟，從而改變中國。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審，控方將繼續播放直播節目片段。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Putin’s decision to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine has embroiled Russia in a long war of attrition, requiring its defense industry to manufacture and send an uninterrupted flow of materiél to the battlefield. Sanctioned by the West and unable to achieve self-sufficiency, Russia has turned to U.S. adversaries — primarily China, Iran, and North Korea — as alternative military suppliers. All three countries have aided the Kremlin’s war effort, albeit to varying degrees and with different geopolitical objectives. This piece, building on the analysis contained in the recent CSIS report, “Back in Stock? The State of Russia’s Defense Industry after Two Years of the War,” assesses the significance of Russia’s military-technical collaboration with these countries and speculates on the impacts these partnerships may have on regional security in the Global South, where U.S. standing has been more equivocal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;military-technical-benefits-for-russia&quot;&gt;Military-Technical Benefits for Russia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the start of the full-scale invasion, the Kremlin has directly benefited from increased military-technical partnerships with China, Iran, and North Korea, with these countries mitigating sanctions- and war-induced pressures on Russia’s defense industry. Combined, the three have supplied Russia with much needed dual-use items, arms, and weapon parts. While these goods have generally been of lower quality than their Western alternatives, they have nonetheless kept the Russian Armed Forces relatively well supplied. This has allowed Russia to maintain consistent intensity of attacks on Ukraine and has contributed to Russia’s battlefield successes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China:&lt;/strong&gt; Beijing has arguably been the most important enabler of the Kremlin’s war effort. China has thus far refrained from openly supplying weapons, although the UK defence minister has recently accused its leadership of “providing or preparing to provide” lethal aid to Russia for its war effort. What has been commonly acknowledged, however, is that Beijing has provided Russia with much-needed dual-use components such as semiconductors, ball bearings, and machine tools through a complicated network of China- and Hong Kong–based shell companies. Leveraging its vast stockpiles of old Soviet equipment, these Chinese shipments have helped the Russian defense industrial complex speed up the refurbishment and modernization of many Soviet-era combat vehicles and technologies, including artillery, tanks, and missiles. The Russian military has also relied on commercial drones and drone parts manufactured by Chinese companies, including DJI. While DJI, China’s biggest drone manufacturer, has said it would discontinue its businesses in Russia and Ukraine due to the war, existing evidence suggests that DJI products and relevant components are continuously imported to Russia through different intermediaries. For instance, within the first six months of 2023, Russia received at least $14.5 million in direct drone shipments from Chinese trading companies. While commercial, such drones, especially the first-person view (FPV) variants, can carry a variety of munitions, causing significant distraction and harm on the battlefield. Russia has also increased imports of Chinese-made goods that are not usually restricted by the international sanctions regime — such as trucks and digging and dirt-moving equipment — but that nonetheless have wide battlefield applications. Overall, Beijing has dramatically eased the pressure caused by sanctions on the Russian defense industrial base through shipments of dual-use components and commercial technologies. This aid will reach new levels if the most recent claims about Chinese plans to send weapons to Russia turn out to be true. Going forward, this partnership might also extend into the military high-tech sector, with President Putin suggesting joint Sino-Russian production of higher-end microchips and even high-orbit assets for space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iran:&lt;/strong&gt; Similar to China, Tehran has also supplied Russia with uncrewed systems, especially combat drones. According to Kyiv, since the start of the full-scale invasion, Moscow has launched at least 4,600 Iranian Shahed attack drones against Ukraine’s major cities and military and energy infrastructure. While Ukraine has reportedly shot down the majority of those Shaheds, such continuous attacks have drained Ukraine’s air defenses. Iran has also collaborated with Russia on the construction of a new factory in Russia’s Tatarstan region that could reportedly manufacture at least 6,000 Iranian-designed Shahed drones by 2025. Besides uncrewed systems, since January 2024 Tehran has reportedly sent Moscow around 400 Fateh-110 ballistic missiles, capable of striking targets at a distance of 186–435 miles, with additional missile shipments from Iran potentially underway. According to pro-Kremlin media, Moscow and Tehran allegedly moved away from the SWIFT payment system for cross-border transactions by the end of 2023. They aim to set up a direct interbank transfer mechanism that would allow companies in both countries to trade in rubles and rials instead of dollars or euros. Such a move could potentially encourage even larger-scale Russo-Iranian arms sales, further aiding Russia’s war effort in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;North Korea:&lt;/strong&gt; The war has resulted in a strengthened military-technical cooperation between Russia and North Korea. Following a September 2023 meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and President Putin in Russia, Pyongyang has been accused of selling weapons to Moscow. According to South Korean defense experts, North Korea might have sent as many as 5,000 containers of weapons to Russia by the end of December 2023, potentially carrying up to 2.3 million rounds of 152-millimeter (mm) shells, or 400,000 rounds of 122 mm artillery shells. These deliveries may have kept the Russian military supplied with munitions for months, while firing around 10,000 shells a day and bringing further damage to the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which are themselves running low on ammunition. Besides artillery systems, Russia has reportedly deployed around 50 North Korean ballistic missiles in Ukraine, which the White House has called a “significant and concerning escalation” to be met with additional sanctions against individuals in those arms deals. Moscow will likely continue relying on ammunition and weaponry sent by Pyongyang as long as the current attritional phase of the war continues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;military-technical-benefits-for-the-partner-countries&quot;&gt;Military-Technical Benefits for the Partner Countries&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the war in Ukraine drags into its third year, all three countries have leveraged Russia’s changing political, economic, and military-security dynamics to secure benefits and concessions from Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China:&lt;/strong&gt; In the case of China, Russia’s growing military-security and economic dependency has been glaringly obvious. Beijing has become Moscow’s key trade partner, replacing EU imports lost to sanctions. Beijing’s two-way trade with Moscow hit a record high of $240 billion in 2023, growing by more than 26 percent from a year earlier. Chinese shipments to Russia — which included shipments of dual-use goods and technologies, among other items — jumped by around 47 percent in 2023 compared with 2022 and 64 percent compared with 2021. However, while by some preliminary estimates China’s share in Russia’s trade turnover exceeds 32 percent (41 percent in imports and 26 percent in exports), Russia’s share in China’s trade turnover is significantly smaller (around 5 percent in imports and 3 percent in exports). These numbers point to a growing asymmetry in the Sino-Russian economic relationship, with significant potential for implications in defense-military cooperation. For instance, China still relies on Russian imports of advanced defense equipment and technologies that are difficult to reverse-engineer, especially with regard to aerospace. Up to 40 percent of China’s air force fleet depends on Russian-made fighter engines. While, historically, Moscow has been more protective of its engine technology, it may have already made, or eventually will be forced to make, more concessions to Beijing, considering the latter’s role in providing economic and defense lifelines to Russia. Going forward, the increased Sino-Russian defense partnership will likely result in more asymmetry, with China gaining access to advanced Russian defense and technological know-how Moscow had been reluctant to share in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iran:&lt;/strong&gt; Similar to China, Iran is leveraging Russia’s war- and sanctions-induced defense industrial complications. In return for Iranian-made combat drones and missiles, Tehran has allegedly secured unprecedented defense cooperation with Moscow, including obtaining Russian-made attack helicopters, radar systems, and combat aircraft — potentially significantly strengthening Iran’s stunted air force. Furthermore, as Iranian-made Shahed drones are being constantly tested on the battlefield in Ukraine, Iran has continued opportunities to observe, improve, and promote technology to other potential buyers around the world. According to CSIS’s Hanna Notte, “It’s no longer the patron-client dynamic, where Russia holds all the leverage,” as Iran is also setting forth specific requirements and benefiting from military transfers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;North Korea:&lt;/strong&gt; Just like Tehran, Pyongyang also views its arms transfers to Moscow as an opportunity to test its equipment in battle. It also expects Russia to provide advanced weapons systems and technological know-how to significantly strengthen its defense, nuclear, and space programs. For instance, some analysts suggest North Korea gets insights from Russia’s alleged use of North Korean missiles to further develop its missile technology. Going forward, these combat-qualified weapons may open new markets to Pyongyang. Importantly, even if North Korean missiles represent a marginal share of Russia’s missile stockpiles, their alleged use goes against the consensus achieved between the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council — Russia included — on preventing Pyongyang from expanding its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Furthermore, Putin has also promised to help North Korea develop its space satellite program. In November 2023, two months after the two leaders met in Russia, North Korea successfully launched its own military reconnaissance satellite, which many Western analysts attributed to Russian expertise and assistance. If Pyongyang were to develop fully fledged military satellite capabilities with help from Moscow, it would be able to access critical data regarding U.S. and South Korean military activities on the Korean Peninsula, with the potential to further exacerbate tensions in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-impact-on-the-global-south&quot;&gt;The Impact on the Global South&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this piece demonstrates, the military-technical partnerships Russia has built and developed with China, Iran, and North Korea are mutually beneficial, and they have the potential to challenge U.S. interests in their respective neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Middle East is the most obvious region where Russia could play a more important role in challenging U.S. standing. Rising Russo-Iranian arms transfers could benefit militant groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah, which are commonly considered Iranian proxies in Tehran’s confrontation with Israel; they could also harden Iranian defenses against any future Israeli airstrike. Some experts believe that if the war in Ukraine becomes frozen, the chances of Russia ramping up its involvement in the Middle East will rise. Russia could send weapons, and large numbers of Russian troops with battlefield experience could also potentially appear in the Middle East, welcomed by Iran-backed groups eager for partners in their fight against “U.S. neocolonialism.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, expanding Russian–North Korean defense ties threaten to destabilize the Korean Peninsula, with Pyongyang growing more hostile toward Seoul. For instance, in January 2024, North Korea fired hundreds of artillery rounds into the sea near its contested border with South Korea and conducted its first intermediate-range ballistic missile test of the year, announcing that it no longer considered South Korea a “partner of reconciliation and reunification.” If Moscow continues to help Pyongyang advance its defense and military capabilities, Seoul’s security as well as U.S. activities and interests on the peninsula will be further endangered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of strengthened Sino-Russian defense-military relations, Moscow’s technological know-how, its lessons learned on working around sanctions, and its well-tested battlefield tactics might prove beneficial to China and could impact the latter’s military calculus with regard to Taiwan. Elsewhere in the world, including with middle powers like India and countries across Africa and Latin America, growing defense cooperation between Moscow and Beijing might lead to the proliferation of relatively cheap Russian weapons systems and technologies made from Chinese components and spare parts. Such arms sales could increase Russia and China’s clout in conflict-driven regions, straining U.S. relationships with existing partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, Russia’s burgeoning relationships with its fellow authoritarian states have mitigated its diplomatic isolation and pushed Moscow into a long path of dependence. Going forward, this new status quo could make it more acceptable for other countries, particularly in the Global South, to do business with Russia. Thus, should the war in Ukraine fade from global headlines following the 2024 U.S. presidential elections, Russia’s war-tested defense industry and increasing willingness to share military technology will make it an attractive partner to many in the Global South. Russia will work hard to further break out of its diplomatic isolation in this part of the world and will likely succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（21日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第80日審訊。在辯方要求之下，庭上播放多段黎智英接受外媒訪問和「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」節目片段。在2020年8月的Live Chat 節目中，黎表示：「心裡面知道自己做緊啱嘅嘢，我係覺得好平靜、甚至係好開心嘅」，又表示：「冇一刻我隻手，喺個手鐐下面，而係覺得自己好慘，或者覺得自己被屈辱，我完全呢個感覺都冇。」黎稱自己所做的事，「只係因為呢個地方對我實在太好，呢個係我需要對呢個地方交代嘅，呢個係我應該做嘅，因為呢個係我嘅家園，呢個係培養到我今日能夠有所有一切嘅一個家園。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;社交媒體專家確認撰寫報告期間-警方沒有提供任何資料電子器材或文件&quot;&gt;社交媒體專家確認撰寫報告期間 警方沒有提供任何資料、電子器材或文件&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方應辯方的要求傳召社交媒體專家鄒錦沛出庭作供。辯方向鄒展示他的證人供詞，顯示警方在2023年3月13日要求鄒就本案提供專家證供，之後於同年4月18日發出信件（letter of appointment），指示鄒就即時通訊軟件包括 WhatsApp、Telegram、Signal，和社交媒體 Facebook 和 Twitter，以及影片平台 YouTube，提供專家證供。鄒遂應警方要求撰寫相關報告，惟期間警方沒有提供任何資料、電子器材或文件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;他指，為了撰寫專家報告，他使用3個已重新設定的手機，就 WhatsApp、Telegram 和 Signal 進行實驗。辯方則質疑，社交平台軟件的版本不時更新，不同版本可以有不同的功能，然而鄒撰寫專家報告的時候，未有察覺到本案涉及的手機器材中，相關通訊軟件屬於哪一個版本。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英指美國和國際社會的支持是香港的唯一救贖&quot;&gt;黎智英指美國和國際社會的支持是香港的唯一救贖&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方播放《金融時報》（Financial Times）片段，當中包含黎智英於2020年4月24日的受訪片段，他指法治是香港的基石，市民爭取自由，是因為這是他們一直以來享有的自由，然而當權者卻認為自由是他們賦予給市民的東西，而不是市民與生俱來應有的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎指，當權者害怕溫和的市民，因為他們佔大多數，所以當局要拘捕民主派人士，以阻嚇溫和的市民，並孤立激進的市民。黎又形容習近平的做事方式一往直前，不會在中途停下來，如果國際社會不阻止中國，唯一能夠阻止或減慢中國控制香港的方法，是來自美國和國際社會的支持，「這是我們現在的唯一救贖（saving grace）。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英沒一刻感到好慘或受屈-因香港是我嘅家園&quot;&gt;黎智英：沒一刻感到好慘或受屈 因香港是「我嘅家園」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方播放2020年8月13日的「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」節目片段，當天嘉賓包括美國智庫「美國傳統基金會」資深政策研究員Mike Gonzalez。黎表示，不應該使用激進手段，不應該與政權硬碰，因為「我們是雞蛋，而他們就像高牆」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎又表示，在生命的最後階段，覺得每一刻都很寶貴，「心裡面知道自己做緊啱嘅嘢，我係覺得好平靜、甚至係好開心嘅」，又指：「冇一刻我隻手，喺個手鐐下面，而係覺得自己好慘，或者覺得自己被屈辱，我完全呢個感覺都冇。尤其是我出嚟嘅時候見到咁多人 support 自己，咁多人對我哋做緊嘅嘢支持，我係非常感激。」黎稱自己做的事並非因為特別原因，「只係因為呢個地方對我實在太好，呢個係我需要對呢個地方交代嘅，呢個係我應該做嘅，因為呢個係我嘅家園，呢個係培養到我今日能夠有所有一切嘅一個家園。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英若果我們不能改變中國中國便會改變我們&quot;&gt;黎智英：若果我們不能改變中國，中國便會改變我們&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續播放2020年8月18日的「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」節目片段，當天嘉賓為美國教授、漢學家林培瑞（Perry Link）。黎指，世界正在面對的問題是，中國變得越來越強大，與外國價值觀產生碰撞，中國價值觀亦可能侵蝕普世價值，「若果我們不能改變中國，中國作為如此強大的國家便會改變我們。」林培瑞同意黎的觀點，又形容中國由「小龍」變成「巨龍」，是非常可怕。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎指習近平施政就如倒退回毛澤東時代，將會面臨很多問題，例如中美之間未必會打仗，但是會在貿易和外交上「開戰」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎被問到會否擔心自己和《蘋果日報》的未來，黎表示「我們當然擔心」，但是他們仍然需要站出來及堅持，以顯示無論發生什麼事都好，他們依然會做應該要做的事，《蘋果日報》仍然會繼續營運、堅持抗爭，使香港人不再擔心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審，控方將繼續播放「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」節目片段。&lt;/p&gt;

This paper examines this evolution, the results of those development efforts, and potential future policies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-brief-history-of-japans-official-development-assistance&quot;&gt;A Brief History of Japan’s Official Development Assistance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the end of the Cold War, dramatic changes in the security environment in the Indo-Pacific region have transformed Japan’s official development assistance (ODA) strategy, as evidenced by revisions to the ODA Development Cooperation Charter. This paper examines the evolution of Japan’s development cooperation in recent years in response to international factors, the results of those development efforts, and potential policies to be considered in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan entered the field of development cooperation when it joined the Colombo Plan in 1954. It then experienced an extended period of rapid economic growth. The scale of its ODA continued to expand, and by 1989 it had surpassed the United States to become the world’s top donor in terms of volume. After World War II, Japan branded itself as a peaceful nation and imposed strict restrictions on the use of military force, including prohibitions on military aid to other countries. The Japanese government also avoided providing assistance that could be perceived as interfering in the internal affairs of recipient countries or making political conditionalities for development assistance, such as maintaining a liberal democracy or respect for human rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Cold War, however, issues emerged for Japan’s ODA, such as support for the democratization of former socialist countries or for state building in fragile states. In April 1991, Japan introduced four guidelines that officials should consider when making decisions about ODA: (1) trends in military expenditures; (2) trends in the development and manufacture of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction and missiles; (3) trends in arms imports and exports; and (4) efforts to promote democratization, introduce a market-oriented economy, and guarantee basic human rights and freedoms. The four ODA guidelines reflect Japan’s first use of the political conditionality principle and were incorporated into the first ODA charter, approved by the government on June 30, 1992.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly thereafter, Japan’s economy collapsed and entered a prolonged slump, placing a severe strain on government finances. In 1997, the government shifted its emphasis from quantity to quality in ODA and reduced the budget; in 2001, Japan lost its status as the world’s top donor. This financial situation led to a decline in public support for ODA, and in an attempt to demonstrate accountability to taxpayers, the government released a revised ODA charter in August 2003 emphasizing that ODA would be clearly connected to the national interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;japans-oda-in-the-indo-pacific&quot;&gt;Japan’s ODA in the Indo-Pacific&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An increasingly complex security environment in Asia over the last decade has affected Japan’s approach to ODA strategy. China’s maritime aggression in the East and South China Seas has prompted a renewed focus on the rule of law as a core principle in the securitization of ODA, meaning more openness to supporting capacity building in the security realm. Japan became wary of China’s coercive tactics in the mid-2000s, ahead of the West. Since Chinese president Xi Jinping took office in 2013, China has not only attempted to unilaterally change the status quo by force in the East China Sea (Senkaku Islands) and the South China Sea (Paracel Islands and Spratly Islands) but has also sought to enhance its influence in Pacific Island nations, exemplified by a security agreement with the Solomon Islands announced in 2022. China has also increased development aid to expand its footprint across the region. In 2010, for example, China surpassed Japan to become the top aid donor to Cambodia. China has also adopted a multilateral approach to aid via the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) — originally called the One Belt, One Road Initiative — announced in 2013; the establishment of the New Development Bank (NDB) with the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) in 2014; and the creation of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) in 2016. These new multilateral aid institutions are expected to challenge the existing development cooperation architecture dominated by developed countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China’s maritime aggression in the East and South China Seas has prompted a renewed focus on the rule of law as a core principle in the securitization of ODA, meaning more openness to supporting capacity building in the security realm.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faced with an increasingly assertive China committed to challenging norms across the security and diplomatic realms, Japan, under the leadership of Prime Minister Abe Shinzo, unveiled its first National Security Strategy (NSS) in December 2013, which detailed how Japan would manage in an increasingly complex security environment. The NSS was significant in that it was not limited to foreign and defense policy but clearly stated that ODA should be part of Japan’s security policy. The NSS built on the revised ODA charter of 2003 by: (1) emphasizing the national interest; (2) adding the rule of law to a list of universal values including freedom, democracy, and fundamental human rights; (3) addressing development issues not only through ODA but also by mobilizing various government resources; and (4) flexibly applying the principle of non-military assistance in order to facilitate military capacity building for like-minded developing states. The government then released a Development Cooperation Charter in 2015 to reflect these new realities. Moreover, in response to China’s massive infrastructure development initiative, the Abe administration launched the Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP) vision in 2016, with the main goal of countering China’s rise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific has since intensified, as has Japan’s commitment to preserving the international order after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, which has threatened the rule of law, upended global supply chains, and exacerbated economic strife and poverty in developing countries. In December 2022, Japanese prime minister Kishida Fumio accelerated the securitization of ODA in a new NSS, which noted, “Japan will strategically utilize ODA to maintain and develop a free and open international order and to realize coexistence and coprosperity in the international community.” Following the revision of the NSS, the Development Cooperation Charter was also revised in June 2023 to declare “Japan’s national interests” as the core objective of ODA, with particular emphasis on security and multilateralism. The new charter declared that the purpose of development cooperation is “to contribute even more actively to the formation of a peaceful, stable, and prosperous international society” and at the same time “contribute to the realization of Japan’s national interests, such as securing peace and security for Japan and its people and achieving further prosperity through economic growth.” This was the first time that the “realization of Japan’s national interests” was explicitly stated as one of the direct objectives of development cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New priorities for development cooperation emerged in parallel with a new version of the FOIP vision Kishida released in March 2023, dubbed the New Plan for a “Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP).” According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, this plan is based on the following four pillars of cooperation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principles of Peace and Rules for Prosperity:&lt;/strong&gt; (1) Reaffirm and promote the minimum basic principles the international community should observe (sovereignty, respect for territorial integrity, and opposition to unilateral changes in the status quo by force) to build international peace, and (2) create rules to prevent opaque and unfair development finance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High-Quality Infrastructure:&lt;/strong&gt; Encourage Japanese companies to expand overseas and revitalize both the local and Japanese economies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multilayered Connectivity:&lt;/strong&gt; Enhance connectivity in various realms to enable growth, as reliance on any single country can increase risk or lead to political fragility.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Efforts to Expand Security from Sea to Air:&lt;/strong&gt; Cooperate, emphasize, and communicate with other countries and regional organizations that share the principles of FOIP, and promote the sharing of principles and knowledge to ensure the rule of law at sea.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kishida government also worked closely with the United States and other like-minded nations to introduce a range of initiatives reaffirming shared commitment to the global order, including support for the developing world. In May 2023, Kishida hosted the Hiroshima G7 summit, which produced a Leaders’ Communiqué including international principles and common values such as the rule of law, an initiative on global food security, and a commitment of up to $600 billion in financing for quality infrastructure development through the G7 Partnership for Global Infrastructure Investment (PGII). Prime Minister Kishida also explained his New Plan for a “Free and Open Indo-Pacific,” emphasizing support for the Global South, and G7 leaders agreed to help realize the FOIP vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-issues-results-of-japanese-strategies-and-policies&quot;&gt;Key Issues: Results of Japanese Strategies and Policies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section examines the effectiveness and impact of Japan’s development aid policies in the context of strategic competition with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;components-of-foip&quot;&gt;Components of FOIP&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FOIP may be described as an umbrella concept that incorporates numerous components such as norms, rule setting, infrastructure development, and capacity building. The first component is an emphasis on universal values, such as the rule of law. The first Abe administration (2006–07) introduced a concept known as the Arc of Freedom and Prosperity to defend liberal democracy in the region spanning from Asia to Europe and prevent the rise of authoritarianism, with China in mind. However, some Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member countries, concerned about interference in their internal affairs, negatively evaluated this initiative, which failed to generate regional support for global norms as a result. Therefore, Japan’s focus on promoting universal values shifted from liberal democracy to broader principles such as the rule of law and freedom of navigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Compliance with universal values is neither a condition for aid nor an excuse for interference in internal affairs. Even in the FOIP era, Japanese assistance has not changed significantly from previous policies in terms of its approach to political conditionality.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be sure, the original FOIP and Kishida’s New Plan refer to democratization and human rights. However, the 2023 revision of the Development Cooperation Charter, while paying sufficient attention to democratization, rule of law, and human rights conditions, states that development cooperation will be implemented based on comprehensive assessment of a partner country’s development needs, economic and social conditions, bilateral relations, and efforts to improve governance and democratization by partner governments’ initiatives. In other words, compliance with universal values is neither a condition for aid nor an excuse for interference in internal affairs. Even in the FOIP era, Japanese assistance has not changed significantly from previous policies in terms of its approach to political conditionality. This universalization with a rather narrowly focused emphasis on rule of law is an essential agenda-setting mechanism for expanding support for FOIP among like-minded countries. Thus, both the West and emerging and developing countries have widely supported and endorsed the normative aspects of FOIP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second component of FOIP focuses on international rulemaking and reaffirmation of global norms. This theme featured in former prime minister Abe’s foreign policy prior to FOIP. For example, Abe delivered the keynote speech at the 2014 Shangri-La Dialogue, attended by defense and security ministers from Asia-Pacific countries, and stressed principles related to the rule of law in the context of Chinese assertiveness over its maritime sovereignty claims in the region. Japan also accentuated rules and norms related to infrastructure development in response to worsening debt sustainability associated with massive Chinese infrastructure investment. The G7 summit in 2016 and the G20 summit in 2019 — both of which Abe hosted — introduced principles for quality infrastructure development such as openness, transparency, economic efficiency in terms of life-cycle costs, and debt sustainability, as well as the importance of providing support that avoids the “debt trap” for recipient countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emphasis on norms was directly connected to Japan’s interests in promoting infrastructure development, which is the third component of FOIP. It seeks to address the most pressing needs of developing countries in the Indo-Pacific region, but it is also a countermeasure to China’s BRI. Both initiatives focus on infrastructure and connectivity to provide public goods, but there are differences. The revised Development Cooperation Charter noted that some developing countries are experiencing debt problems due to loans that do not sufficiently consider debt sustainability and that other forms of assistance do not lead to independent and sustainable growth in developing countries. Thus, the issue of debt sustainability was included for the first time in the “implementation principles for ensuring appropriateness in development cooperation” in the revised charter in 2023. The G7 Hiroshima Summit in 2023 reiterated that international standards such as transparency, good governance, anticorruption, labor, environment, climate, finance, and debt sustainability were included under the PGII framework. In addition, the G7 countries are to use an online database of infrastructure-related information called SOURCE, the G20 Compendium of Quality Infrastructure Investment Indicators, the Debt Management and Financial Analysis System, and other multilateral tools that improve the quality, standards, and governance of infrastructure projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In support of FOIP’s objective to uphold the international rule of law and freedom of navigation in the air and at sea, the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has been providing capacity-building assistance to maritime law enforcement agencies in the Indo-Pacific region.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fourth component is the securitization of ODA. In support of FOIP’s objective to uphold the international rule of law and freedom of navigation in the air and at sea, the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has been providing capacity-building assistance to maritime law enforcement agencies in the Indo-Pacific region. This is intended to contribute to the overarching goal of enhancing the deterrence of countries in the Indo-Pacific region against China and, ultimately, strengthening Japan’s security. Relatedly, on April 5, 2023, the Japanese government announced an official security assistance (OSA) policy and targeted four countries for the first phase of OSA: Bangladesh, Fiji, Malaysia, and the Philippines. However, the OSA budget for FY 2023 was only ¥2 billion (approximately $12.8 million), which is a small amount compared to the $19.6 billion ODA budget that year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economic security and connectivity constitute the fifth component of FOIP. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has promoted development cooperation that contributes to Japan’s economic security and supports the overseas expansion of Japanese companies, with particular emphasis on strengthening and diversifying supply chains, sustainable development of critical mineral resources, and the stable supply and securing of food. FOIP is designed to provide support for private sector business activities, international rulemaking in the area of trade, and assistance for individual projects that will help improve connectivity in the Indo-Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sixth component is a shift in the core principle of Japanese ODA from request-based cooperation, whereby Japan provides assistance upon receiving a request from the recipient country, to offer-type cooperation, referenced in the revised Development Cooperation Charter, in which the Japanese government proposes initiatives. OSA, in particular, has the direct objective of contributing to Japan’s security, and there is a limit to what can be achieved under the request-based approach alone. In other words, if Japanese aid focuses on direct national interests, active encouragement and guidance from the donor side will be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The seventh and last major component is the strengthening of recipients’ capacity to counter China. For example, to address debt sustainability, it is essential to have guidelines for lender behavior and capacity building in fiscal policy and public debt management on the part of recipients. For example, Japan has dispatched fiscal experts to Laos, the Maldives, Zambia, and other countries to improve their capacity to formulate and implement fiscal policy, with the aim of developing capacity for sustainable macroeconomic management and debt management. Furthermore, senior officials of the finance ministries of each country have conducted seminars and lectures on public debt management to strengthen their capacity in public debt and risk management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FOIP is not a vision Japan can complete alone but one that necessarily requires a multilateral approach with allies and partners. Japan’s ODA budget has been halved from a peak of ¥1.2 trillion in FY 1997 to just above ¥500 billion, and the budget for FY 2022 was only ¥510.5 billion — about 0.5 percent of general account expenditures, or about 10 percent of defense expenditures (¥5.4 trillion for the same period). Therefore, to effectively achieve the objectives of FOIP, coordination with other countries and cooperation between the public and private sectors will be essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FOIP vision is supported not only by Western countries, such as members of the European Union and G7, but also by India and ASEAN countries. Moreover, Australia, India, South Korea, the United States, and some ASEAN countries have introduced their own Indo-Pacific strategies based on the FOIP concept. While major powers such as China are challenging the status quo through force and economic coercion, countries across the Indo-Pacific are increasingly embracing normative principles such as the rule of law. This is the basis of support and expectations for FOIP in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;has-japanese-aid-been-successful&quot;&gt;Has Japanese Aid Been Successful?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the time being, Japan’s development assistance strategy appears to have transformed dramatically under the FOIP framework, which succeeded in elevating Japan’s leadership role. FOIP’s impact, thus far, has been largely normative in encouraging standards for infrastructure development, but the effects of Japan’s development aid under FOIP is not fully known. Moreover, in the context of strategic competition with China, the value of the FOIP framework can only truly be evaluated over a long time horizon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;For the time being, Japan’s development assistance strategy appears to have transformed dramatically under the FOIP framework, which succeeded in elevating Japan’s leadership role.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The juxtaposition of Japan’s FOIP and China’s BRI suggests, arguably, a convergence in their economic and infrastructure development strategies. While Sino-Japanese aid competition has increased infrastructure funding, there is also concern that it has reduced discipline and quality control over development funds. In 2013, immediately after the launch of the AIIB, the Asia Development Bank (ADB), over which Japan has maintained influence, passed a reform proposal that expanded its lending facility by 50 percent, including a “high-quality infrastructure” component cofinanced by Japan, and accelerated the loan approval process, reducing the project approval period from 21 months to 15 months. This menu of reforms appears to have been a response to competition from Chinese aid and an attempt to distinguish Japan’s approach through its emphasis on quality infrastructure development. But in 2015, the Japanese government amended the law governing its main economic cooperation bank, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), to increase the bank’s risk tolerance, which could invite “a race to the bottom” as competition between Japan and China intensifies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Sino-Japanese aid competition in recent years has centered increasingly on “quality infrastructure.” The AIIB has developed more mature aid practices due to cofinancing with the World Bank and ADB, and it has become more careful in judging the environmental and social impacts of development projects. The BRI seems to have moved to “BRI 2.0,” with increased emphasis on debt sustainability. Overinvestment in unprofitable transportation infrastructure and real estate is rampant in China, and China is realizing that sloppy loan evaluations are worsening its debt sustainability. As a result, China is beginning to understand that it is imperative to adopt a more rigorous evaluation of loan projects that reflects international standards and takes debt sustainability into account. This process may be synonymous with the loss of the comparative advantage (via quick and massive loans) enjoyed by China-led development finance institutions. At the same time, Japan’s insistence on high-quality infrastructure may not appeal to developing countries in the future. Therefore, Japan must take the lead in rule setting under FOIP while remaining open to further refinement in anticipation of continued competition with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Japan’s insistence on high-quality infrastructure may not appeal to developing countries in the future. Therefore, Japan must take the lead in rule setting under FOIP while remaining open to further refinement in anticipation of continued competition with China.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s emphasis on its “national interests” may also need to be examined in terms of development effectiveness. It is possible for Japan’s national interest and the international public interest to coincide. However, there is also a risk of Japan’s national interest superseding the international public interest. In order to incentivize Japanese firms to support Japan’s strategy to increase infrastructure exports, government aid projects imposed strict conditions regarding technical capabilities and deadlines that are expected to exclude bidding competitors. A former JICA official recalls that this approach has had the significant side effect of undermining the trust Japan has built with developing countries. This concern could also materialize under the revised 2023 Development Cooperation Charter. The charter calls for Japan to achieve greater prosperity through economic growth. To realize this, a significant portion of the yen loans mobilized for quality infrastructure development are tied to aid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, no matter how much the Japanese government has tied aid to Japanese companies involved in FOIP projects, the deals have tended to be high cost. Essentially, ODA is intended to assist local economic and social development and improve the welfare of the people. As put in the Asahi Shimbun, “If this guiding principle for development aid is undermined by a policy change driven by a myopic and ill-advised pursuit of short-term national interests, Japan could lose the trust of numerous countries it has spent years helping to develop through aid.” At a time when aid has become an important instrument of international politics and security, there is a risk that international development will be neglected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-recommendations-how-japans-assistance-to-the-indo-pacific-region-should-evolve-in-the-future&quot;&gt;Policy Recommendations: How Japan’s Assistance to the Indo-Pacific Region Should Evolve in the Future&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;continually-refine-foip-principles&quot;&gt;Continually refine FOIP principles.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FOIP development cooperation is too often discussed in the context of international politics and security discourse, making it necessary to redefine development cooperation in the context of international development. In addition to debt sustainability, which has been the focus of FOIP, it is necessary to address the food security crisis and energy price hikes associated with the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as Russia’s war of aggression in Ukraine — all of which undermine progress on the UN Sustainable Development Goals. In addition, the simultaneous pursuit of national and international interests has been taken for granted, though it is similar to the win-win principle in Chinese aid. But just as China’s interests still outweigh those of developing countries in a win-win situation, which can build frustration in developing countries, Japan’s overt focus on national interests may undermine the trust of recipients if it becomes too prevalent. The relative weight of international development in FOIP must be strengthened, and the core principles of international development should redefine FOIP in a broader context. Thus, FOIP’s approach must reflect the development goals of developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;maintain-japans-leadership-role-in-the-indo-pacific&quot;&gt;Maintain Japan’s leadership role in the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be necessary to create an environment in which more developing countries can support and participate in FOIP. Japan should therefore continue to downplay democracy and human rights as a political conditionality for development aid and instead advocate for freedom, openness, diversity, inclusiveness, and rule of law as the basis of international order. This should help gain support from emerging and developing countries averse to interference in their internal affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan should also pursue cooperation with more developing nations and emerging powers under FOIP, including members of ASEAN, countries in Southwest Asia, and Pacific island countries. Under FOIP, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is considering cooperation in a wide range of areas, including climate change, maritime issues, connectivity, digital technology, and economic security. These activities can serve to boost regional resilience while enhancing the autonomy of each Pacific island country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Indo-Pacific region is also home to countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand — countries which were once classified as developing but that are now emerging as donors. These emerging donors understand the needs of developing countries and share interests with Japan, such as maintaining the rule of law. Working with emerging donors would help strengthen FOIP in the context of international development. Fortunately, Japan has more experience working with emerging donors than other Development Assistance Committee donors in development cooperation, particularly in Southeast Asia. Graduates of Japanese aid have been assigned to government agencies in Southeast Asian countries, and as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs mentions, “These human resources are important human assets who understand the culture and values of our country and are therefore newly positioned as partners to strengthen solidarity in order to strengthen networks after their return to their home countries.” Thus, they are important assets to the expansion of FOIP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;engage-china&quot;&gt;Engage China.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introducing tied projects to Japanese firms under the banner of “quality infrastructure” will not necessarily improve the performance of Japanese firms, which are inferior in terms of cost competitiveness. Instead of providing immediate, material national interests, the medium- to long-term benefits may be greater in designing, disseminating, and establishing international rules for infrastructure development assistance and debt issues. For example, if FOIP could successfully lead to a harmonized institutional framework for infrastructure development and finance, it would be easier to avoid the debt trap caused by China’s infrastructure support, which will also benefit Japan. Efforts to incorporate China into such international rules are to be expected, though China, of course, may not easily join. However, the large scale of and lack of transparency in China’s infrastructure financing have resulted in international criticism and declining interest in Chinese loans. Restructuring China’s development aid practices under the guiding principles of openness, transparency, sustainability, and multilateralism will help transform the BRI initiative into an international public good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;promote-cooperation-with-the-united-states-and-other-partners&quot;&gt;Promote cooperation with the United States and other partners.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the United States is the cornerstone of Japanese diplomacy, U.S. involvement in development cooperation is indispensable to multilateral cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region under FOIP. For example, to address the vulnerabilities of the Pacific island countries, the United States could partner with Taiwan on aid within the framework of FOIP. Taiwan has a record of assistance to Pacific island countries, shares a commitment to universal values, and is an original member of the ADB. Although the United States does not have official diplomatic relations with Taiwan, the two parties signed a memorandum of understanding in November 2022 regarding U.S.-Taiwan development and humanitarian assistance cooperation, under which the United States and Taiwan would mutually invest $600,000 in the South Pacific in the areas of health, climate change, and cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper overviews the development and future of FOIP as a strategic interest for Japan in the Indo-Pacific region. As a result, Japanese aid, once focused narrowly on economic benefits, has become more focused on security, and the logic of international politics has become more important than aid and development effectiveness under FOIP. Japan has taken a leadership role in setting norms and rules for connectivity, infrastructure investment, and maritime security under FOIP, and these norms and rules have become international public goods that benefit all countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Development Cooperation Charter formulated in 2023 emphasizes (1) proactive contributions to the formation of a peaceful, stable, and prosperous international community, and (2) contributions to the realization of Japan’s national interests. The two are not mutually exclusive but directly linked. Japan’s resolve to strengthen security places FOIP in the context of diplomacy and international politics, but too much emphasis on broader strategic dynamics could reduce the impact of development aid. New versions of FOIP that focus more intently on the needs of developing countries will be necessary to sustain Japan’s leadership role into the future.&lt;/p&gt;

This paper reviews Japanese development policy toward Africa and Japan’s efforts to encourage support for the rules-based global order.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the Group of Seven (G7) Hiroshima Summit held in May 2023, 15 months after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, G7 leaders confirmed the strengthening of partnerships with African countries. Japanese prime minister Kishida Fumio, as summit chairman, led the effort to strengthen partnerships with Africa and pledged continued support for peace, stability, and prosperity on the continent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Japanese government places particular importance on relations with Africa because it is extremely important to work with all 54 African countries, which collectively account for more than a quarter of UN members, to maintain and strengthen a free and open international order based on the rule of law. This is all the more critical at a time when China and Russia are seeking to unilaterally change the status quo through force and coercion. It is therefore in Japan’s strategic interest to gain support from the Global South, including as many African countries as possible, to serve as a diplomatic deterrent to dissuade China from furthering its unlawful maritime expansion in the Indo-Pacific or invading Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Japanese government has built good relations with African countries and is positioned to engage them on the need to maintain a free and open international order based on the rule of law.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To gain the support of African countries, Japan needs to contribute to their peace and prosperity through means such as aid, investment, and military support. Since hosting the first Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD) in 1993, the Japanese government has focused on encouraging the economic development of African countries, particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa. As a result of these efforts over the past 30 years, the Japanese government has built good relations with African countries and is positioned to engage them on the need to maintain a free and open international order based on the rule of law. However, the level of Japanese official development assistance (ODA) for Africa is declining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s ODA contributions were the largest in the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) during the 1990s, but as of 2022, Japan had fallen to third place behind the United States and Germany. It will be virtually impossible for Japan to increase its ODA to African countries given its declining birth rate and aging population, as well as its difficult fiscal situation: gross public debt as a percentage of GDP was 261 percent in 2022. In addition, Japan’s total GDP is only about one-fourth that of China, making it impossible for Japan to compete in terms of ODA with China’s growing presence in Africa. Furthermore, in the current international context, in which UN peacekeeping operations are generally in decline, Japan has few opportunities to contribute to security in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than pursue an increase in ODA to Africa, the Japanese government is faced with redesigning its African diplomacy amid the relative decline of Japan’s national strength. This paper reviews the history of Japan’s policy toward Africa, summarizes the challenges facing Japan’s Africa policy, and proposes ways to make Japan’s constructive engagement with Africa sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;history-of-japanese-diplomacy-in-africa&quot;&gt;History of Japanese Diplomacy in Africa&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a long time after a series of African countries gained independence in the 1960s, the Japanese government did not have a systematic strategy for Africa. In 1970, ODA to sub-Saharan Africa accounted for only 1.8 percent of Japan’s total ODA; by contrast, 94.4 percent went to Asia. The first slight change in Japan’s diplomacy toward Africa occurred in the early 1970s, when the 1973 oil shock led the Japanese government to position Africa as one of its oil supply sources. In 1974, Kimura Toshio became the first Japanese foreign minister to visit five African countries, including Nigeria. However, diplomacy with Africa remained a low priority throughout the 1970s and 1980s, and the director in charge of Africa within the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) was regarded as a “lower ranking” division chief post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first major turning point came at the end of the Cold War, in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Amid Japan’s bubble economy, its total ODA contributions surpassed those of the United States in 1991 to become the highest in the world. In 1990, Japan’s share of total ODA to Asia fell to 63.1 percent, while its share to sub-Saharan Africa increased to 10.9 percent. During the 1970s and 1980s, African countries received large amounts of aid from Western donor countries, but these funds delivered only limited development gains across Africa. As a result, there was a widespread sense of aid fatigue among Western donors in the early 1990s. Under these circumstances, the Permanent Mission of Japan to the United Nations in New York, believing the best way to ensure Japan’s election as a nonpermanent member of the UN Security Council was to collect votes from African countries, proposed internally in July 1990 that MOFA organize a new conference to discuss development issues in Africa. In 1993, the Japanese government hosted the first TICAD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the recollections of Owada Hisashi, who was then the senior deputy minister for foreign affairs (promoted to vice minister for foreign affairs in 1991), MOFA made the decision to launch TICAD in June 1991, hosting the first conference in October 1993, for two reasons. First, because aid provided by the East and West during the Cold War did not contribute to the development of African countries, Japan wished to lead the formation of a new concept for African development and contribute to solving problems such as poverty, conflict, and underdevelopment in Africa. Second, the Japanese government wanted to break with its “passive diplomacy” as a defeated nation in World War II and shift to “proactive diplomacy” to shape the international order by showing the international community how Japan could take the lead in promoting African development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Japanese government wanted to break with its “passive diplomacy” as a defeated nation in World War II and shift to “proactive diplomacy” to shape the international order by showing the international community how Japan could take the lead in promoting African development.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, MOFA, seeking to strengthen relations with Africa, hosted the second TICAD in 1998. However, African diplomacy remained a low priority for Japan throughout the 1990s. By contrast, China dispatched two different presidents to Africa a total of four times during the 1990s. The first visit to the continent by a Japanese prime minister was not until Mori Yoshiro’s visit in 2001. Despite the impetus to establish TICAD, the importance of Africa was not well understood within the Japanese government or even within MOFA. The ministry did not have a senior official dedicated to African diplomacy until 2001, when a reorganization created the position of deputy director general for Africa within the Middle East and Africa bureau.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Japanese government gradually began to recognize the importance of diplomacy with Africa around 2008, when the fourth TICAD was held. Rapid growth of African economies began in earnest around 2003. In the 2009 edition of Japan’s Diplomatic Bluebook, an article referred to the importance of diplomacy with Africa for the first time: “Relations with Africa, with its abundant natural resources and an enormous, ever-increasing population, also carry great significance for the future of the Japanese economy.” The following year, the 2010 edition of the Diplomatic Bluebook for the first time clearly referred to TICAD as the “cornerstone” of Japan’s diplomacy with Africa. The idea of using TICAD as a diplomatic asset for Japan gradually gained strength within the government. In 2012, the Department of African Affairs was established within MOFA. Total ODA (net disbursement) to sub-Saharan Africa increased 180 percent over 10 years, from $0.97 billion in 2000 to $1.73 billion in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s diplomacy with Africa became more strategic and systematic under the second Abe Shinzo administration, which began in December 2012. The first change was evident at the fifth TICAD, in 2013, which promoted investment in Africa by Japan’s private sector. The Japanese government focused on sustained economic growth in Africa and chose to strengthen Japan’s presence in the region with private sector funding. A particular focus of the Abe administration was the export of “quality infrastructure” from Japan to African countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second change was that Japan and Africa began to jointly issue messages on the importance of a liberal international order. In his keynote speech at the sixth TICAD in Nairobi in August 2016, Prime Minister Abe announced the Free and Open Indo-Pacific Initiative (FOIP), a diplomatic vision to connect Indo-Pacific and East African nations under shared principles, including freedom, the rule of law, and a market economy free from coercion. The TICAD Ⅵ Nairobi Declaration included a new phrase: “maintaining a rules-based maritime order in accordance with the principles of international law.” Although the declaration did not mention a specific country, its content is mindful of China, which then and now seeks to exert maritime dominance in the South China Sea without regard for international law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The statement on “maintaining a rules-based maritime order in accordance with the principles of international law” has since become, without fail, an explicit part of the triennial TICAD outcome document. In other words, since the sixth TICAD, Japan and its African partner countries have jointly communicated the importance of values such as freedom and the rule of law. This indicates that the position of African countries within Japanese diplomacy has changed from “aid destination” to a “partner in shaping the international order.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Japan and its African partner countries have jointly communicated the importance of values such as freedom and the rule of law. This indicates that the position of African countries within Japanese diplomacy has changed from “aid destination” to a “partner in shaping the international order.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, the Kishida administration has followed the strategic nature of Japan’s diplomacy with Africa, formed under the Abe administration, which lasted approximately eight years and nine months, until September 2020. However, Japan’s ODA contributions (net disbursements) to sub-Saharan Africa, which increased in the 2000s, have generally remained at around $1.5–$1.7 billion per year since 2010 and totaled $1.68 billion in 2022. The share of ODA to sub-Saharan Africa in Japan’s total ODA has also generally been fixed at around 10 percent. In addition, the Japanese government’s goal of promoting investment in Africa by Japanese companies has, to date, failed to produce the expected results. The issue of investment by Japanese companies is discussed in more detail below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-issues&quot;&gt;Key Issues&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;china-and-japan-in-africa&quot;&gt;China and Japan in Africa&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s diplomacy with Africa took on a strategic character under the second Abe administration for two main reasons: (1) economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa, which truly took off in the twenty-first century, and (2) the expansion of China’s influence in Africa. After a long period of stagnation beginning in the early 1980s, economies in sub-Saharan Africa began to experience high growth around 2003. According to statistics from the International Monetary Fund, the average growth rate in GDP in sub-Saharan Africa during the decade from 2003 to 2012, when growth was strongest, was 5.7 percent. Sub-Saharan Africa’s total GDP, increased from $424 billion in 2000 to $1.4 trillion in 2010, more than tripling in just 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Japan’s diplomacy with Africa took on a strategic character under the second Abe administration for two main reasons: (1) economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa, which truly took off in the twenty-first century, and (2) the expansion of China’s influence in Africa.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corporate investment from all over the world drove Africa’s economic growth. For many years, the main players were French, UK, and U.S. companies. But since the beginning of the twenty-first century, Chinese investment in Africa has increased rapidly, as has China’s presence on the continent. China, under Chinese president Xi Jinping, has incorporated involvement in Africa into its Belt and Road Initiative. Further, Vision 2035 was adopted at the eighth Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), held in 2021, setting forth the basic policy for future relations with Africa through 2035. Vision 2035 calls for enhanced cooperation with Africa in all areas, including agriculture, poverty reduction, industrialization, finance, trade, investment, infrastructure development, digital innovation, science and technology, human exchange, human resources development, environment, peace and security, and global governance. The Xi administration intends to use Africa’s economic and population growth for China’s development, and China seeks to wield superior influence on the development of African countries, surpassing the influence of France, the United Kingdom, or the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impetus for China’s deepening relations with Africa may be traced back to the Tiananmen Square protests in June 1989. Although major Western countries imposed severe economic sanctions on China, some African countries, such as Angola, supported the Chinese government’s hard-line response. As part of its strategy to avoid isolation under the U.S.-centered international order, the Chinese government began to strengthen relations with African countries. Throughout the 1990s, Chinese officials made a series of annual visits to Africa, and since 2000, FOCAC has been held every three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a study by the Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO), Chinese investment flows to Africa, which totaled only $75 million in 2003, steadily increased, rising to $5.4 billion annually in 2018. After a drop to $2.7 billion in 2019, they recovered to $4.2 billion in 2020, when the global economy was severely damaged by the Covid-19 pandemic. Global new investment in Africa in 2020 totaled $38.0 billion, meaning China accounted for about 11 percent of global investment in Africa that year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the United Kingdom had the highest balance of investment in Africa as of 2020, at approximately $65 billion, followed by France, the Netherlands, and the United States; China was in fifth place, at approximately $43 billion. In addition, according to a report published in August 2021 by the China-Africa Business Council, China’s outstanding investment in Africa as of 2020 was estimated at $47 billion. By country, the largest target for Chinese investment in Africa was South Africa (12.5 percent), followed by the Democratic Republic of Congo (8.5 percent) and Zambia (7.0 percent). Construction (29.6 percent), mining (23.5 percent), and manufacturing (12.5 percent) were the sectors in which China was most active. In addition, after peaking at $11.0 billion in 2017, Chinese financing for energy- and infrastructure-related projects in Africa totaled $4.5 billion in 2018, $2.8 billion in 2019, and $3.3 billion in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the Chinese companies operating in Africa, Huawei, which is engaged in digital infrastructure construction, deserves attention. The U.S. government has restricted Huawei’s U.S. sales of telecommunications equipment for security and other reasons. However, Huawei is providing both equipment and solutions for digital infrastructure in African countries, especially in the construction of smart cities. According to a database published in June 2021 by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, Huawei has been involved in 39 smart city projects in at least 25 African countries. Once an African country has installed Huawei smart city technology, it is forced to rely on Huawei for maintenance and software updates for an extended period. In addition, reliance on the company’s network can result in a vast amount of personal information being stored by the company. Huawei’s method of expanding into Africa is characterized by an “iron triangle” in which companies in African host countries receive loans from the China Development Bank and use the funds to purchase Huawei’s equipment and services. This presents an extremely high risk of the Chinese government collecting and using national secrets and personal information from African countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the start of the second Abe administration, China had surpassed Japan in total GDP and had expanded its presence in Africa rapidly as the continent entered a period of economic growth. During this period, African countries voiced their desire for investment rather than ODA, and Japan could not increase its ODA due to fiscal challenges. The Abe administration therefore promoted Japanese corporate investment in Africa as a lever for diplomacy with the continent instead of relying on ODA. As a result, Nippon Export and Investment Insurance, a government-affiliated agency, established the Special Insurance for Promotion of Investment and Loan to Africa to mitigate investment risk. MOFA concluded investment agreements with Mozambique, Kenya, and Côte d’Ivoire and began negotiations with eight other African countries. The Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) expanded its loan facility for investment promotion, known as the Facility for African Investment and Trade Promotion. The Japan International Cooperation Agency and the African Development Bank focused on improving the investment environment in African countries through the Enhanced Private Sector Assistance for Africa initiative. Through these measures, the Japanese government sought to encourage Japanese companies to invest in Africa and strengthen relations with African countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to UNCTAD, Japan was not among the top 10 countries in terms of investment in Africa in 2020, with outstanding Japanese foreign direct investment in Africa totaling only $6.1 billion, far behind that of smaller countries such as Singapore ($21.0 billion) and Switzerland ($17.0 billion). The Japanese government attempted to reduce its reliance on traditional ODA and position private funding as leverage in its diplomacy toward Africa but failed to produce the desired results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-impact-of-russias-invasion-of-ukraine&quot;&gt;The Impact of Russia’s Invasion of Ukraine&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another challenge facing Japan’s diplomacy with Africa is anti-Western sentiment that has become evident in some African countries. The voting behavior of African nations at the UN Emergency Special Session held on March 2, 2022, in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine shocked Western nations, including Japan, and revealed the reality that African countries do not widely support the current international order led by the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The voting behavior of African nations at the UN Emergency Special Session held on March 2, 2022, in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine shocked Western nations, including Japan, and revealed the reality that African countries do not widely support the current international order led by the West.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the special session, 141 of the 193 UN member states voted in favor of a draft resolution calling for the immediate withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine (Figure 1). However, 35 countries abstained, 12 countries did not vote, and 5 voted against the resolution. A close examination of the voting behavior of African countries revealed that 17 of the 35 abstentions, 8 of the 12 no votes, and 1 of the 5 opposing votes were from Africa. In other words, 26 of the 54 African countries did not vote in favor of condemning Russia. Three weeks later, on March 24, 2022, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution calling for the cessation of attacks against civilians and the strengthening of humanitarian assistance. There were 140 countries in favor, 5 against, 38 abstentions, and 10 no votes. One African country voted against, 27 were in favor, 20 abstained, and 6 did not vote. In other words, exactly half of the 54 African countries did not condemn Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/LbYOaXg.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Voting Results on Russia-Related Resolutions at the UN Emergency Special Session, March-April 2022&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even African states that supported the aforementioned resolutions appear to have signaled dissatisfaction with the Western-led order. On April 7, 2022, the UN General Assembly voted on a resolution calling for suspension of Russia’s membership in the UN Human Rights Council. Nine African countries voted against, 24 abstained, and 11 did not vote, meaning 44 of the 54 African countries did not vote in favor of suspending Russia’s status. This means many of the countries that voted in favor of the two earlier General Assembly resolutions in March chose to oppose, abstain, or not vote on Russia’s status in the Human Rights Council. Kenya, for example, changed its voting behavior, having voted yes on the two General Assembly resolutions in March but then abstaining on the third (Table 1). Even Kenya, which normally follows a pro-Western diplomatic line, changed its attitude as soon as Western countries made human rights an issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/4S3zhxI.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: Voting Results on Russia-Related Resolutions at the UN Emergency Special Session by Country, March-April 2022&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;African nations are not monolithic and do not actively associate themselves with the term “Global South,” which is increasingly used in reference to the developing world. However, in the modern interpretation, the Global South generally refers to emerging and developing countries that are not aligned with the West, China, or Russia, and that seek to remain neutral. The approach many African countries took at the United Nations regarding the Russian invasion of Ukraine — neither agreeing with nor opposing the resolutions proposed by the West — may epitomize the Global South.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If leading Western countries, including Japan, are to effectively engage the Global South in the future, it is necessary to understand why many African countries were reluctant to criticize Russia at the UN General Assembly. The regimes in Angola, Mozambique, South Africa, and other countries drew support from the former Soviet Union throughout the colonial liberation struggle and still have close ties to Russia. In the case of South Africa, Nelson Mandela, who became president after the abolition of Apartheid, visited Russia in 1999, and the two countries signed a treaty of friendship and cooperation in 2006. In 2013, the two countries signed a comprehensive strategic partnership agreement during Russian president Vladimir Putin’s visit to South Africa. Moreover, South African president Cyril Ramaphosa has made statements that could be perceived as pro-Russian. On March 17, 2022, about three weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine, Ramaphosa declared in parliament that the war was caused by eastward expansion of NATO, which had pushed Russia into a corner. Only a few African countries have such deep historical ties to Russia, though Russia has influence across the continent. For example, several countries that do not have more established connections to Russia, such as Kenya, opposed its expulsion from the UN Human Rights Council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia does not exert its influence economically and is not a major player in the economies of African countries. UNCTAD estimates that Russian companies account for less than 1 percent of total direct investment flowing into Africa as a whole. In addition, trade (exports plus imports) between Russia and Africa constitutes only about 2 percent of total African trade. The Putin administration held two Russia-Africa summits, in 2019 and 2023, and promised to provide economic support for Africa, but Russian companies are not competitive, excluding in the energy sector. As a result, African countries are unlikely to expect any substantial economic support from Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s military presence in Africa has been somewhat more influential. Prior to 2015, only four African countries had confirmed military agreements with Russia: Algeria, Angola, Libya, and Tunisia. However, starting with Cameroon in April 2015, Russia began signing a series of military agreements with African countries, and by the end of 2018, Russia had signed military agreements with 21 countries. The agreements generally included the provision of Russian-made weapons, training of African countries’ militaries, and support in conflicts against various terrorist groups. It is believed that Russia rushed to strengthen relations with these African countries after it unilaterally annexed the Crimean Peninsula, a Ukrainian territory, by force in 2014 and its confrontation with Western countries intensified. For Russia, military support is one of the few areas where it can exert influence in the international community. However, close examination of the voting behavior of African countries on the March 2 UN resolution condemning Russia after the invasion of Ukraine reveals that 10 of the 21 African countries that had concluded military agreements with Russia since 2015 voted for the resolution. In other words, the strength of Russia’s military ties with African countries alone cannot explain the voting behavior of African countries at the United Nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important factor in Russia-Africa relations is the issue of Russia’s use of hybrid warfare tactics in Africa. Hybrid warfare is a method of warfare that incorporates military intimidation; political, economic, and diplomatic influence and cyberattacks; information warfare, including the dissemination of propaganda and fake news; terrorism; and criminal acts to achieve political objectives. Such activity came to prominence following Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and has been the focus of reports from groups such as the European Institute for Security Studies, among others. Russian information warfare using social networks and mass media has been identified in the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Mali, Sudan, and Zimbabwe. These countries have three things in common: political instability, the presence of natural resources, and a perception from Russia that formerly colonized states where British or French influence has weakened are unlikely to resist Russian intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A prime example of Russia’s use of hybrid warfare techniques is the establishment of pro-Russian regimes in the Central African Republic and Mali. Both countries have hosted the Russian private military company the Wagner Group, and both abstained from the March 2 UN General Assembly vote. However, both are in a special political situation, with civil wars and frequent coups d’état, and Russia has succeeded in taking advantage of the breakdown of governance to bring both countries under its influence. Therefore, these cases are hardly universally useful for explaining the voting behavior of African countries in the UN General Assembly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sharing-values-with-africa&quot;&gt;Sharing Values with Africa&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MOFA was alarmed by the large number of abstentions among African countries at the UN General Assembly because a failure to clearly condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could send the wrong message to China, which has engaged in coercive behavior in the East and South China Seas and could take action to defend its territorial sovereignty claims if it concludes the international community will not condemn attempts to change the status quo by force. Therefore, the Japanese government began behind-the-scenes negotiations with the African Union Commission (AUC), the cohost of TICAD, on the contents of the Tunis Declaration to be issued at the eighth TICAD, scheduled for August 2022, six months after the invasion of Ukraine. Japan’s objective was to include clear language criticizing Russia in the declaration and to jointly issue a message with Africa that reiterates that attempts to change the status quo by force are unacceptable. However, the AUC told Japan that it did not want to mention matters concerning Ukraine in the declaration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, the Japanese side proposed avoiding the use of words that might provoke Russia, such as “war” or “aggression,” and settled on expressing “serious concern” about the situation in Ukraine and the African and global economies. The Japanese side also proposed, and the AUC agreed to, specifying “respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries” and emphasizing “the importance of the preservation of peace, security and stability, through dialogue and respect for the principles of international law.” During the negotiations, language regarding “maintenance of maritime order” was also adjusted with China in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, the statements from the fourth and seventh TICADs included references to the “maintenance of maritime order” to send a signal to China. For this reason, the Japanese side thought it would be relatively easy to obtain the AUC’s approval to include similar language in the Tunis Declaration. However, the AUC initially expressed reluctance, saying, “We acknowledge the existence of the problem of maritime order, but we cannot accept only Japan’s demands.” Eventually, a compromise was reached by including the phrase, “We take good note of the initiative of a Free and Open Indo-Pacific as announced by Japan at TICAD VI in Nairobi.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The idea that the West can use development aid to influence the foreign policies of African countries is no longer valid. In the twenty-first century, African countries have acquired the status of “choosers” and engage various economic partners.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The episode regarding the content of the declaration shows that the relationship between African countries and Western countries, which are traditional aid donors, has changed dramatically. The idea that the West can use development aid to influence the foreign policies of African countries is no longer valid. In the twenty-first century, African countries have acquired the status of “choosers” and engage various economic partners, including Brazil, China, India, Singapore, South Korea, and Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The large number of abstentions and no votes in the UN General Assembly is the result of African nations taking full advantage of their position as choosers. For African nations, which have experienced colonization and domination by different ethnic groups, self-determination is a nonnegotiable principle. Therefore, many countries chose not to endorse Russia’s aggression, which is a clear violation of international law, but are also unwilling to unconditionally recognize the Western-led international order. There is a general perception among African countries that the current international order was established based on the legacy of colonial rule by Western powers and does not benefit African countries. For example, Africa has experienced a series of droughts and floods attributed to climate change in recent years in various regions. However, Western industrialized countries have emitted the majority of greenhouse gases in modern history, and African countries are asking why they must suffer as a result of a problem they did not create. Japan and other leaders of the Western-led order therefore should develop new engagement strategies with African countries and convince them that the existing order supports the interests of the continent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-recommendations&quot;&gt;Policy Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Japan should work with the United States and other Western countries to deepen policy dialogue with African countries on a shared vision for the continent and the Global South. Japan’s FOIP vision is effective in the diplomatic and military spheres but lacks a clear strategy for economic development that can attract African countries. Policy dialogue should be held preferably at both the track 1 (official) and track 2 (nongovernmental) levels to generate a range of initiatives and reach agreement on the most effective way to engage the continent. Notably, Prime Minister Kishida delivered an address at the UN General Assembly on September 19, 2023, in which he stressed the importance of “human dignity.” This term appeals to the Global South and can be widely endorsed because it does not overemphasize human rights, which is a sensitive issue for many countries in the Global South and could invite a backlash against renewed initiatives from developed nations such as Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Japanese government must face the reality of economic decline due to an aging population and declining birthrate and should redesign its diplomacy toward Africa accordingly, building on the premise that future increases in ODA or Japanese corporate investment are unrealistic. A redesigned strategy for Africa should focus on the principles of selection and concentration, or a narrower emphasis on select fields, industries, and target countries, to increase the effectiveness and impact of development assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To narrow down the target countries and areas of concentration, several general criteria should be considered:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;the quality of the partner country’s leadership and bureaucracy, in particular the willingness and ability to persevere in development&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;a shared commitment to maintain a free and fair international order&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;alignment of needs with Japan’s strengths (for example, Japan’s deep experience in the manufacturing industry but limited capacity to provide support in the military field)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To deepen mutual understanding, comprehensive bilateral policy dialogues should be held between Japan and countries identified as targets for collaboration and cooperation. A problem for both Japan and African countries is that government officials, business leaders, and others on both sides do not know enough about each other’s histories and social conditions. Therefore, policy dialogue should not be limited to officials focused on development aid.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Developing a cohort of African individuals who know Japan well is critical. Efforts to invite African youth to Japan should be expanded. Japan announced the African Business Education Initiative for Youth (ABE Initiative) at the fifth TICAD, held in 2013. The ABE Initiative has accepted a total of approximately 1,600 young people from 54 countries. Supporting the trainees’ activities after they return to their home countries and continuing the relationship with them will be a mid- to long-term diplomatic asset for Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Japan should cooperate with the United States and other Western countries to develop information dissemination strategies in Africa focused on social networking services (SNSs). In sub-Saharan Africa, where more than 60 percent of the population is under age 25, the influence of SNSs is enormous. Russia has been exploiting this situation to spread disinformation. Understanding new information and communications technologies is vital if concepts such as freedom and human dignity are to be shared with African youth.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that African countries have obtained the status of “choosers,” a meticulous approach is required to build upon shared universal values with African countries, such as freedom and human dignity. Although various forms of human rights repression are apparent in African countries today, the West’s approach of imposing human rights from above and harshly criticizing the politics and customs of African countries may have the opposite effect, reminding African people of memories of colonialism by the West. China and Russia, which are despotic regimes, will see the situation in which African countries oppose the West as an opportunity to expand their influence. Under these circumstances, Japan, the only Asian country in the G7, has an important role to play in engaging Africa on its own terms while developing partnerships to maintain a world order based on liberalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（20日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第79日審訊。現駐守國安處、曾到監獄派送判詞給張劍虹的警署警長繼續作供。辯方早前質疑他的職責僅限於派送判詞，並沒有理由與張談論「獄中生活」，並且質疑他游說張轉做控方證人。警長今解釋，與張傾談「係一個工作嘅延續嚟嘅，同埋一個好人性化嘅處理」；此外「我亦都需要評估，睇吓佢喺獄中入面有冇啲唔好嘅情況發生⋯⋯所以一路延續咁同佢傾喇」。辯方又表示在控方案情完畢之後，會準備中段陳詞，希望法庭裁定黎智英面對的3項控罪表證不成立。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;警長稱與張劍虹傾談是工作延續好人性化嘅處理&quot;&gt;警長稱與張劍虹傾談是「工作延續」、「好人性化嘅處理」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;曾於2021年11月11日到監獄探訪張劍虹的偵緝警署警長黎國勇（音譯；英文：Lai Kwok Yung）繼續作供。辯方表示沒有進一步問題盤問黎。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在控方覆問下，黎指警員記事冊上的「SD」（Special Duty）是一個很籠統的用字，任何警隊部門都可以使用，亦沒有涉及機密行動。至於為何使用「SD」來形容派送判詞給張劍虹的工作，黎指沒有特別原因，他舉例離開辦事處做其他工作，都可以稱為「Special Duty」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;上周辯方盤問時指，黎除了按上司指示到監獄派送判詞給張劍虹之外，便沒有其他理由留下來與張談論「獄中生活」，當時黎同意；但當辯方接著問他是否正在執行警察職務時，黎卻回答是。控方今要求黎澄清。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎稱：「其實我入去派發判詞已經係警務工作嚟㗎」，雖然張收到判詞之後有沉默和思考，「但係我同佢講一連串嘅嘢，係一個工作嘅延續嚟嘅，同埋一個好人性化嘅處理」，他又補充：「同埋我亦都需要評估，睇吓佢喺獄中入面有冇啲唔好嘅情況發生⋯⋯所以一路延續咁同佢傾喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方表示會準備中段陳詞-冀法庭裁定表證不成立&quot;&gt;辯方表示會準備中段陳詞 冀法庭裁定表證不成立&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎警長作供完畢後，辯方表示由於取得懲教署的文件，故毋須傳召另外數名警察出庭作供。控方指，辯方要求傳召社交媒體專家鄒錦沛出庭，供辯方律師盤問，而控方正在作出安排，希望盡量安排他明天出庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又表示會準備中段陳詞，希望法庭裁定控罪表證不成立。法庭暫定於6月27及28日聽取雙方口頭補充陳詞。辯方稱需視乎情況而決定是否開啟辯方案情；若然法庭裁定控罪表證成立的話，即使有辯方案情，需時也不會長。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英指當局大舉拘捕泛民-目的是威嚇市民不敢出來&quot;&gt;黎智英指當局大舉拘捕泛民 目的是威嚇市民不敢出來&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;應辯方的要求，庭上播放2020年5月台灣 YouTube 頻道《Yahoo TV 一起看》的節目「鄉民來衝康」片段，黎受訪時表示，「我覺得《蘋果日報》肯定是他們的眼中釘，這麼多年來我們是反共的，我們是反對派的報紙，對他們來說是搞到香港亂七八糟，是我們有關係的，我們有責任的，他們就這樣說。」黎指，警方拘捕知名的民主派人士，目的是威嚇溫和的市民，使他們不敢出來示威遊行，也想孤立勇武派和打擊《蘋果日報》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主持人問到警方動用重案組、「大陣仗」地拘捕黎，卻在短時間內釋放，當中用意何在。黎則指目的是「威嚇那些以後的市民不敢出來，就給你看，就是整個就是威嚇的行動」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英稱對被捕不感害怕不介意坐牢&quot;&gt;黎智英稱對被捕不感害怕、不介意坐牢&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到被捕時會否感到害怕，黎表示：「不害怕，我從來不害怕」，他的妻子亦不害怕。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎表示，「對我自己來說，假如要坐牢，我也不介意去坐牢，反正你出來抗爭，你出來說所謂 civil disobedience，公民不服從，你就要對法律負責任，這個一早就預了，一早就準備，我要坐牢就坐牢了。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於美國和英國非常關注他被捕，黎表示：「我們很想CIA，我很想美國影響我們，我很想英國影響我們，我很想外國影響我們，他們的支持是我們唯一能夠撐下去的，外國的勢力是現在我們非常需要，讓我們撐下去的。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英指港獨是陰謀-提倡港獨者屬少數&quot;&gt;黎智英指港獨是「陰謀」 提倡港獨者屬少數&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主持人問黎，親北京的香港媒體形容黎是「漢奸黎」，大陸媒體也說黎是「叛國惑港四人幫之首」，「你認為你是嗎？然後你支持港獨嗎？」黎回答：「第一，我從來反對港獨」，引述自己曾在網上節目說過「我們不能夠中計」，「這個港獨的事情，一定是個陰謀，沒有人蠢到要港獨的，我有什麼本事要港獨。我們要的不是港獨，我們要的是，我們的《基本法》的權利，這是我們香港人應該有的，就是法律上給我們，賦予我們的權利。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎指：「到現在他說，我們爭取民主，我們爭取普選，就是港獨。這個他要說什麼就說什麼。」他又說：「反正今天他說我什麼，我還要出來的；他今天說我什麼，我還要撐下去的。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎續指，提倡港獨的人僅是小部份，「最初的時候，我們對本土也有抗拒的，現在經過這整個運動以後，我們也對本土的人越來越同情，而且也覺得，我們也是香港人多過大陸人。」他指作為香港人要團結，維持香港的法治跟自由。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英稱自己非運動領導人-沒有需要想運動下一步&quot;&gt;黎智英稱自己非運動領導人 沒有需要想運動下一步&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主持人問，假如2020年9月的立法會選舉，民主派得到比較好的成績，黎的下一步是否要換特首，然後要求由市民直選特首。黎則表示：「我沒有，我不是這個運動的領導人，這個運動到現在，你也知道的，沒有領導人的。」他指泛民屆時會開會商討下一步，一定有好的方法去做，而這並不是黎份內要想的事情，他既沒有也不需要去想。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英接受外媒訪問時稱會留港直至最後一日&quot;&gt;黎智英接受外媒訪問時稱會留港直至最後一日&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;接著庭上播放2020年7月1日《霍士新聞》（Fox News）片段，主持人問黎智英，《國安法》生效之後會否擔心被捕，黎則以英語表示：「我不擔心，因為我不能擔心，如果我擔心就不能做或講任何事情。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎又表示不會離港：「我將會留在這裡直至最後一日⋯⋯直至我不能再留或我們陣營的人全部被捕或離去。不，我不能離開。如果我離開，我令自己蒙羞，我令《蘋果日報》名譽受損，我也損害民主運動的團結。」主持人指他曾被捕數次，所涉及的罪名可判終身監禁，黎表示他不知道將會發生什麼事，「但當政府不尊重法律，你不會知道紅線在哪。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎亦在訪問中指《國安法》導致港人之間溝通要變得非常小心，又批評《國安法》凌駕立法會、取代法治和《基本法》，令做生意的人無法受到保障，難以維持香港的金融中心地位。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另播放2020年7月17日及8月6日的「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」節目片段。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last September, the EU announced an anti-subsidy probe into imports of Chinese-made electric vehicles (EVs), and the UK is reportedly considering a similar investigation. Policymakers’ main concern is that a flood of cheap Chinese EVs might eat into the market share of European manufacturers, replicating the decimating effect that cheap Chinese solar panels have had on Europe’s solar industry. This time, however, the economic security stakes are much higher, with the automotive sector representing 6.1% of total EU employment and over 7% of the Union’s GDP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Western automakers have been dragging their feet on transitioning to pure battery electric vehicles (BEVs), Chinese policymakers began prioritising BEVs as early as 2009, hoping to help Chinese firms technologically leapfrog Western companies. Companies like BYD – now the world’s largest EV producer – have benefited hugely from government support, including various discounts and tax breaks, availability of credit, the provision of supporting infrastructure, as well as finance for research and manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ambitions were initially limited to the domestic market, but by 2017, Chinese policymakers had explicitly outlined goals for Chinese automakers to conquer the world. On the domestic market, Chinese brands have climbed up the leaderboard of best-sellers, with BYD surpassing Volkswagen last year. In Europe, too, Chinese brands are making headway, their market share rising from just 0.4% in 2019 to 7.9% in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is also a battle beginning between Chinese and Western auto companies for emerging EV markets in the Global South. Rich countries currently account for the vast majority of global EV sales, but uptake in middle-income countries like Brazil is starting to pick up. Chinese automakers have invested heavily in these markets, where US, European and Japanese companies currently dominate with traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Brazil, EV sales were up 145% in the first three months of 2024, with BYD accounting for over 40% of the cars sold. Second place, with just 15% of the total, went to another Chinese brand, Great Wall Motors. In March, BYD’s Dolphin Mini became the best-selling electric vehicle (EV) in the country, breaking the record previously held by another BYD model. EV penetration in Brazil is still low compared to Europe, but it is a rapidly expanding market, and this expansion is largely being driven by Chinese companies, particularly BYD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;As of yet, Western companies do not have a product that can compete on price, meaning that BYD is likely to dominate the rollout of EVs in middle-income countries&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western carmakers have neglected EVs in emerging markets, choosing to follow the conventional wisdom that rich countries will transition to EVs first, with poorer countries lagging behind. For example, in 2021, BMW decided to double-down on combustion engines, citing a lack of infrastructure, while BYD’s main Western competitor in BEVs, Tesla, is only now preparing to bring its cars to South America. Following BYD’s recent success, Western companies like Volkswagen and GM have this year announced a change of course, but BYD has a good head-start as well as a significant technological and cost advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BYD has been able to win ground in Brazil due to the low price point of models like the Dolphin Mini. This compact electric hatchback retails for £15,800 – below the average price of a new car in Brazil and a bargain for an EV, which also costs the consumer less to run than an ICE car. State support has certainly helped BYD bring down costs, but by manufacturing most of its own components, BYD has also achieved a massive cost advantage through vertical integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By introducing affordable EVs, BYD has effectively created a new segment in the market. As of yet, Western companies do not have a product that can compete on price, meaning that BYD is likely to dominate the rollout of EVs in middle-income countries. BYD’s explicit ambition in Brazil is not just to become the top EV manufacturer, but to displace Volkswagen as the top auto brand, and if EV penetration in Brazil continues at pace, that is a real possibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BYD is also investing heavily in local manufacturing. The left-wing government of Lula da Silva is not opposed to EVs, but nor is it incentivising Brazilians to buy electric. The government is concerned about deindustrialisation and jobs, so it has been reluctant to encourage EV imports that would undermine the national auto industry. BYD has managed to get around this resistance by building an £860 million manufacturing facility in the north of Brazil. Poignantly, this site formerly belonged to US automaker Ford, which abandoned its Brazilian operations in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil does not have any car brands of its own, so unlike the EU, it has nothing to fear from Chinese EV brands, as long as they manufacture locally. In fact, the prospect of cleaner transport and the movement of high-tech industry to Brazil makes such developments incredibly attractive. During his first two terms, from 2003 to 2011, Lula oversaw a period of deepening relations with China. A decade later, the power asymmetry between Brazil and China has shifted, and Brasilia is looking to Beijing for technology and investment. Lula’s April 2023 visit to China, which was pivotal in bringing forward the BYD investment, was explicitly linked to the hope that China could help reverse Brazil’s deindustrialisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Leveraging anti-Western and anti-colonial sentiments among developing countries, Beijing is seeking to position Chinese leadership as a credible alternative to the Western-led international order&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Losing huge emerging EV markets to China is not only an economic concern; there is also a political dimension at work. BYD’s emerging market strategy coincides with a diplomatic push from Beijing to win over countries in the Global South. Leveraging anti-Western and anti-colonial sentiments among developing countries, Beijing is seeking to position Chinese leadership as a credible alternative to the Western-led international order. The hope is that amid worsening trade tensions with the West, more neutral or even pro-China markets in the Global South could become alternative destinations for Chinese exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bearing in mind this wider systemic competition with China, BYD’s success in Brazil is also a victory for Beijing’s global leadership ambitions. Not only is BYD helping Brazil towards its climate goals by providing affordable EVs, but it is also bringing high-tech supply chains by investing in local manufacturing. Washington’s quiet diplomacy has had some luck in rolling back Chinese projects in Latin America, but unless the West comes up with more compelling alternatives to attractive offers like BYD’s, it will find it difficult to push back against Beijing’s narrative in the Global South.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And BYD’s is not just investing in Brazil. Besides a planned factory in Hungary and a failed bid to invest in India, BYD has also established a joint manufacturing venture in Uzbekistan worth £130 million, built a £520 million factory in Thailand and announced a £1 billion facility in Indonesia, and it is scouting locations for another factory in Central Mexico. The speed and scale of this push to internationalise is unprecedented – while Toyota’s global expansion took decades, all of the developments above have occurred in the last 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accompanying German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on his recent trip to China, BMW boss Oliver Zipse claimed, “we don’t feel threatened by Chinese manufacturers”. Given the colossal dependence of German automakers on China, it is easy to see why they might seek to play down tensions, but it is difficult to buy Zipse’s confidence while surveying BYD’s progress in China, Europe and now across the Global South.&lt;/p&gt;

How could AI transform the art form?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)’s “visit piece” is one of the intelligence community’s secret weapons.&lt;/strong&gt; By revealing what foreign leaders want and analyzing their personality, the CIA delivers decision advantage when the U.S. president is meeting with an African counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The CIA expertly assessed how African leaders sought to navigate geopolitical competition during the Cold War,&lt;/strong&gt; and it succeeded in deciphering what underpinned specific attitudes toward engagement with U.S. presidents, judging from a review of declassified intelligence assessments, policy memos, public statements, and press reports from 1961–1987.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The art of leadership analysis is ripe for innovation, driven by artificial intelligence (AI),&lt;/strong&gt; following six decades of impressive support to U.S. presidents. The current AI models are underwhelming, however; they will require significant training and iteration, as well as a proficiency with the art form, to strengthen and enrich analysis on leaders in Africa and other global regions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When President Joe Biden welcomes foreign leaders to Washington, he is inundated with paper. From talking points and draft statements to seating arrangements and dinner menus, the White House staff will prepare all of it, except for one essential document: the CIA leadership visit piece. It is this analysis — presented as a standalone assessment or integrated into the President’s Daily Brief (PDB) — that delivers decision advantage for the president of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A CIA visit piece is more than a written recitation of a foreign leader’s career highlights or a preview of potential agenda items. When it is done well, it is a revealing and yet remarkably succinct study on a leader’s hopes and dreams, attitudes and demeanor, and friends and enemies at home and abroad. In other words, it is a roadmap to understand who is sitting across the table and how to advance U.S. national security interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effective leadership analysis is exceedingly difficult to do in the best of circumstances, and arguably even more challenging when it comes to sub-Saharan Africa. Relative to other regions, there has been less reporting, comparatively fewer intelligence analysts, and a limited number of senior policy interactions. It requires deep subject-matter expertise and superior intelligence tradecraft to transcend these shortcomings and contribute to a successful presidential engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The declassified record, while incomplete and riddled with redactions, showcases how and why CIA leadership analysis has become pivotal to presidential meetings. By examining 34 PDBs and other intelligence reports from 1961 to 1987 and then cross-referencing these analytic assessments with 63 policy memos, public statements, and press reports, as well as personal reflections, it is possible to chart how the CIA perfected the visit piece; measure its policy successes and failures; and point to new innovations to elevate the art form, including through the transformative power of AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;creating-the-visit-piece&quot;&gt;Creating the Visit Piece&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the spring of 1961, President John F. Kennedy, still reeling from the Bay of Pigs crisis, expressed his dissatisfaction with his intelligence support. His staff piled on, complaining about the daily stream of reports from multiple government agencies and the dense, often inscrutable bureaucratic jargon. The CIA, in response, rushed to create the President’s Intelligence Checklist (the predecessor of the PDB) to address Kennedy’s concerns. With crisp prose and a global perspective, it became an immediate hit. The president not only relied on the product to inform policy decisions, but it also served him well in his meetings with foreign leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kennedy believed in the power of personal diplomacy, especially with regards to Africa. He told his staff that he wanted to engage with his African counterparts, decreeing that “if African leaders want to meet me, good. Invite them down here.” Kennedy’s interest and appetite for information about the continent was considerable; Arthur Schlesinger, one of Kennedy’s closest advisers, recalled that some African leaders told him that the “American president knew more about their countries than they did themselves.” Three months after the creation of the President’s Intelligence Checklist, Kennedy received a CIA assessment regarding Sudanese general Ibrahim Abboud’s state visit. Abboud, who the analysts judged to be a “sincere patriot, disgusted by the corruption among the civilians,” was seeking to secure from Kennedy “some sort of dramatic impact project” to increase his prestige.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “visit piece,” however, was hardly a developed art form, and it struggled to distinguish itself from traditional political analysis. In this early period, most assessments included a cursory reference to a leader’s planned travel to Washington before segueing into more standard assessments on the country’s political, economic, and security developments. While some exceptions exist (including an astute study on a “more self-assured” Zairian president Mobutu Sese Seko in 1973), the visit piece, as it related to African heads of state, was fairly mundane and not consistently crafted to advance a presidential meeting. Judging from the declassified record, the art form only started to find its stride during the Carter administration and reached its apogee under President Ronald Reagan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Jimmy Carter regarded the CIA’s leadership analysis as vital to his diplomacy, especially his landmark summit with Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian president Anwar Sadat in 1978. He told CIA analysts that he wanted to be “steeped in the personalities of Begin and Sadat.” These psychological profiles enabled Carter to navigate negotiations between the two leaders; in 2013, he admitted that the CIA assessments had “steeled his resolve to seek a full-fledged treaty between Egypt and Israel.” It stands to reason that this diplomatic triumph at Camp David reaffirmed the importance of leadership profiles and visit pieces. Carter, who boasted that he was more interested in Africa than his predecessors and spent “more effort and worry on Rhodesia than the Middle East,” presumably demanded similarly rigorous analysis to inform his interactions with African leaders. While still uneven as an art form, the CIA’s 1978 assessment on Senegalese president Leopold Senghor, who possessed “an impressive blend of intellectual and political skills” and “moves as gracefully and comfortably in French culture as he does in African,” was a significant improvement in analytic quality and insights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The visit piece reached new heights during the Reagan administration. Indeed, the CIA started to regularly label these assessments as such; 13 out of the 19 declassified analytic reports published to coincide with Reagan’s meetings with African counterparts included the word “visit” in the title. The art form’s growing prominence reflected Reagan’s interest in people. His national security adviser, Bud McFarlane, said Reagan “always focused on the human dimension of foreign policy, waiting to know more about everybody.” The increase in the quality of visit pieces also probably stemmed from Reagan’s engagement on Africa. He met with more African leaders than any of his predecessors, and his policies to eject the Cubans from Angola and secure Namibian independence, as well as his antipathy toward Libyan leader Muammar Qadhafi’s adventurism in the region, framed many of his interactions with African counterparts. The CIA rose to the challenge, leveraging its expertise and tradecraft to ensure the president had the most critical analysis to charm, coax, and cajole his White House visitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;serving-the-president&quot;&gt;Serving the President&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CIA’s visit piece, when at its best, consists of five elements. It delves into a leader’s personality, their goals, and the context for the meeting — specifically the country’s political, economic, and security situation. It also includes a warning component, informing the president that his counterpart may criticize U.S. policy or press for a change to the U.S. approach. Finally, it often features an outlook section, forecasting whether a leader or his country will succumb to or overcome emerging challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personality:&lt;/strong&gt; A visit piece’s most critical task is revealing a leader’s personality: not what they have done, but who they are. The study of an African leader’s disposition, temperament, and personal history helps to explain what makes them tick. It is fundamental to a visit piece, and it is certainly the hardest for intelligence analysts to master. The declassified assessments, for example, stressed Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie’s “unusual personal vigor and determination” and Zambian president Kenneth Kaunda’s tendency to become “highly emotional.” They characterized Sudanese leader Jafaar Nimeiri as “low-key, unpretentious” and explained that Mozambican president Samora Machel was “given to dominating conversation.” The most exceptional pieces tapped into a leader’s mindset; in 1973, for example, CIA analysts asserted that “as Mobutu’s confidence has grown, so have his pretensions to leadership in Africa.” At the same time, they judged that he “remains troubled . . . by the picture many have of him as being overly pro-US.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goals:&lt;/strong&gt; A visit piece uncovers what an African leader wants from his interactions with the U.S. president. While a predictable feature of the art form, it takes talent and experience to go beyond the obvious. The declassified record is full of intelligence assessments that highlighted potential requests for more financial or military assistance, or a desire “to improve his stature at home,” as was the case for President Quett Masire of Botswana in 1984. More impactful have been visit pieces that unearthed broader foreign policy priorities, such as Senghor’s likely requests for U.S. funding in support of Angolan rebel Jonas Savimbi or Ivorian president Felix Houphouet-Boigny’s hope for “assurances that the US remains committed to protecting its friends in the Third World.” The most sophisticated pieces raised potential quid pro quos; in 1985, the CIA suggested that in return for more U.S. assistance, Machel may accept a symbolic U.S. naval visit to Maputo, the addition of a defense attaché to the U.S. embassy, and more balanced voting by Maputo’s representative at the United Nations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Context:&lt;/strong&gt; A CIA visit piece also analyzes the political, security, and economic context underpinning a presidential meeting. It explains what is driving a leader’s actions and any potential asks of the U.S. government. Houphouet, for example, was concerned about “the crumbling institutions of the states around him,” and Senghor was animated by a “fear of Soviet intervention in Africa and elsewhere.” Visit pieces often underline a leader’s expectations, such as Kenyan president Daniel Arap Moi’s belief that his acceptance of a military access agreement obliged the United States to help Kenya. The assessments also touch on an African leader’s opinion of U.S. allies and adversaries, such as Senegalese president Abdou Diouf’s criticisms of French president Francois Mitterrand’s Africa policies or Zimbabwean prime minister Robert Mugabe’s close relations with Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria, North Korea, and China. Several assessments in the declassified record explained why the Soviet Union valued its partnerships with African leaders, such as Somalia’s Mohamed Siad Barre in 1970s. The rare visit piece even called out when a leader was being disingenuous. In 1983, the CIA pointed out that Kaunda’s insistence that he pursued a balanced foreign policy was “only partly valid.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning:&lt;/strong&gt; An effective visit piece also prepares the U.S. president for difficult conversations, identifying areas of disagreement and steering them away from counterproductive topics. The CIA profile generally incorporates several red flags and “watch out fors” into its analysis, such as highlighting that Sudan’s Abboud “has been critical of the level of American aid” and that Senghor’s policies on Arab-Israeli issues “conflict with US interests.” In 1982, the CIA warned that Liberian leader Samuel Doe’s frustrations with the economy posed “the most serious potential irritant to Liberian-US relations.” The visit piece on Mugabe’s 1983 meeting with Reagan was forthright about potential landmines, noting that Mugabe “resents Western criticism of his efforts to quell dissident violence” and that he is “extremely sensitive to any actions by Washington that he believes infringe on Zimbabwe’s sovereignty.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outlook:&lt;/strong&gt; A visit piece usually includes an outlook section, forecasting what the future may hold for a leader or country and what that could portend for U.S. interests. It may be as routine as predicting another election win for Kenya’s Moi or asserting that Nigerian leader Ibrahim Babangida’s “prospects for remaining in office over at least the next year or so appear favorable.” Some assessments addressed a pending leadership transition, concluding that a successor to Senghor “probably will continue to follow moderate, democratic principles.” The analysis, however, has historically tended to skew negative, such as the CIA’s judgment in 1962 that Ugandan prime minister Milton Obote may gradually adopt some anti-Western sentiment or the risk of growing regional and ethnic tensions in Cameroon and Togo. In 1969, the CIA painted a grim picture of Haile Selassie’s grip on power, arguing that his reforms paradoxically undercut his control and “unhappiness with his autocratic rule will likely continue to grow and nurture serious and perhaps successful plotting.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;grading-the-analysis&quot;&gt;Grading the Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A visit piece, regardless of how well written and considered, is only as valuable as it is convincing to the reader and adept at shaping the president’s conversations as well as contributing to favorable outcomes. While the CIA’s initial forays into visit pieces were occasionally outmatched by Department of State and National Security Council memos, the declassified record reveals some impressive results. President Richard Nixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger took onboard the CIA’s message that Mobutu wanted to strike a balance between being viewed as independent while remaining “on good terms with the US.” In their meeting, Kissinger praised the Zairian leader’s UN speech as a masterpiece because it sounded “critical of the United States, but when one read it, it was not so bad.” Nixon added that the speech showed that Mobutu was a “skillful politician.” The analysis on Senghor was prescient that the Senegalese leader fancied himself a mediator. He informed President Carter that “he is part Jewish and can speak frankly to both sides” of the Arab-Israeli question. The CIA also accurately pinpointed Liberian leader Doe’s need for continued U.S. support to shore up his shaky regime. In press remarks following his White House visit, Doe exclaimed that “President Reagan assured me we can continue to count on America’s understanding and support.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CIA particularly excelled at framing why African leaders viewed themselves as non-aligned and how navigating global geopolitical competition was central to their foreign policies. Following his engagement with Abboud, Kennedy publicly confirmed that the United States “fully endorsed the determination of the newly-independent countries of Africa to maintain their independence.” In press interviews during his visit to Washington in 1985, Mozambique’s Machel was adamant that his country was “African, independent, and nonaligned,” adding that “there is no question of blocs.” Reagan seemingly reached a similar conclusion, writing in his diary that Machel “turned out to be quite a guy and I believe he really intends to be ‘non-alligned’ [sic] instead of a Soviet patsy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The visit pieces had mixed results when anticipating an African leader’s key priorities or potential issues to discuss. The CIA published a long paper on Liberia’s economy ahead of President William Tubman’s meeting with President Lyndon Johnson, accurately previewing the Liberian leader’s deep concern with his country’s pressing foreign debt service and rising commodity prices. Tubman and Johnson subsequently dedicated several paragraphs to Liberia’s economic challenges in their joint statement. Similarly, several of the CIA visit pieces accurately captured how many West African leaders had become apprehensive about Libyan meddling in the region, especially in Chad. After his meeting with Reagan in 1983, Senegal’s Diouf told the Washington Post that “we must stop the Chadian adventure.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the CIA repeatedly failed to identify global issues that the African leaders discussed in their engagements with U.S. presidents, including the situation in Berlin in the 1960s or Lebanon in the 1980s. The agency’s obsession with Upper Volta (now Burkina Faso) leader Thomas Sankara — they saw Libya’s hand behind his coup in 1983 — prompted analysts to repeatedly flag the country as a likely topic in visit pieces on Senegal’s Diouf and Togo’s Gnassingbe Eyadema; Upper Volta, however, was absent in any of the public statements, press reports, diary entries, or the memorandum of conversation from Eyadema’s meeting with Reagan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The visit pieces had some other big misses. Ahead of Nimeiri’s meetings with Reagan in late 1983, the CIA raised concerns about the Sudanese leader’s “erratic personal behavior,” warning that his decision to introduce sharia law had alarmed the country’s leftists, secular elite, and predominately non-Muslim southerners. Despite the agency’s growing worry that Nimeiri was vulnerable to a coup, Reagan seemed unconvinced and sidestepped any questions about the Sudanese regime’s increasing fragility; Nimeiri was eventually removed from power by a popular uprising some 16 months later. Moreover, the visit piece in the 1980s failed in one fundamental aspect: they did not fully understand their customer. In his diaries, Reagan repeatedly opined on whether an African leader was a believer in “free enterprise,” whereas only the profile on Houphouet examined the Ivorian president’s economic philosophy. A central precept of leadership analysis is knowing your principal’s interests, which the CIA seemed to have flubbed during the Reagan administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;profiling-for-the-future&quot;&gt;Profiling for the Future&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When future African leaders visit the White House, President Biden almost certainly will benefit from the CIA’s insights on the leaders’ political acumen, as well as their top concerns for their country’s economy or security, or their views on global crises. The visit piece, after more than six decades of evolution and refinement, has become a vital resource for U.S. presidents, and it will undoubtedly serve President Biden well in his next engagements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the art form seems ripe for another innovation — this one powered by the generative power of AI. The drafting of leadership profiles and assessments are innately human endeavors, but AI has the potential to augment and enhance this critical intelligence product. In last year’s National Intelligence Strategy, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines committed to strengthening the intelligence’s community’s capabilities in language, technical, and cultural expertise harnessing open-source “big data,” AI, and advanced analytics. Below are three recommendations on how to leverage AI in the analysis of African leaders, as well as other prominent global figures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scale:&lt;/strong&gt; The drafting of a leadership assessment is a time-intensive effort, requiring deep substantive expertise and a mastery of analytic tradecraft. While analysts focus on the visiting African leader, AI can generate additional profiles on the entire delegation, adding further value to the engagement. This is more than a just force multiplier; it is crucial for policy success. In the CIA’s piece on Zambian president Kaunda’s visit, the analysts highlighted the participation of Reuben Kamanga, the ruling party’s top foreign affairs specialist, who was instrumental in repairing relations between the United States and Zambia. In contrast, the CIA failed to mention Cape Verde’s foreign minister — who Reagan disliked, according to his subsequent diary entry — in its visit piece on President Aristides Pereira in 1983.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Customization:&lt;/strong&gt; A visit piece is typically directed toward the U.S. president and later distributed to other senior policymakers. While the analysis for the president addresses strategic topics, it often excludes details useful for subsequent meetings and engagements with U.S. officials. By leveraging AI, it is possible to generate tailored analyses to plug into existing assessments for additional readers. For example, the CIA only briefly discussed the cocoa market in its visit piece on Houphouet in 1983, whereas the Department of State dedicated several sections to the topic in its own memorandum. With AI’s assistance, a leadership profile could have multiple bespoke versions to better align with diverse U.S. policy needs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Analytics:&lt;/strong&gt; Leadership profiles, as is the case for other intelligence assessments, use all-source information to back up analytic judgments. This art form, however, rarely avails itself of big data to strengthen its argumentation. AI’s capacity to identify common themes and patterns in the underlying data and quickly summarize large amounts of text could help analysts to quantify some of their work. For instance, the CIA explained in 1973 that Ethiopia’s “budget suggests that they may be less worried than they say” about the threat from Somalia. By tapping into AI, the visit piece could have included a deeper analysis of the budget to contrast the emperor’s stated priorities with his government’s current actions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;ais-lackluster-take-on-president-rutos-visit&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AI’s Lackluster Take on President Ruto’s Visit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The existing AI models remain underwhelming when generating leadership profiles and integrating the best standards of analytic tradecraft. It will require significant AI model training and iteration, as well as a proficiency with the art form, to raise the current AI level to something that will strengthen and enrich intelligence products. For example, when the leading chatbots were asked what Kenyan president William Ruto might raise with President Biden during their meeting on May 23, the answers ranged from unexceptional to unacceptable:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ChatGPT 4 offered the most fulsome take, indicating that “Ruto views this as an opportunity to usher in a new era of dynamic partnerships, particularly in transforming trade and investment, green energy, digital technology, and multilateralism, aiming for shared prosperity not only for Kenya and the United States but globally.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Anthropic’s Claude generated a passable answer, identifying five potential topics, including “strengthening economic and trade ties between the two countries, possibly discussing the proposed U.S.-Kenya free trade agreement that was being negotiated,” and “security cooperation, given Kenya’s role in fighting terrorist groups like al-Shabab in East Africa.” The only problem, however, is that there is no free trade agreement currently under discussion.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Meta AI spun out a very basic response, generating a list of 11 topics Ruto could possibly raise, such as expanding economic ties, strengthening people-to-people ties, furthering technological innovation, and addressing climate and clean energy.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Google’s Gemini failed the exercise entirely, acknowledging that it was “still learning how to answer this question” and recommended trying Google Search.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;國安警黎國勇繼續作供，辯方續圍繞黎探訪陳梓華的情況提問，辯方早前指，2022年8月至11月9日期間，黎探訪陳14次；黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方針對11月9日的探訪提問，指根據黎的記事冊，提及翌日早上10時，警長1237離開基地前往羈押中心進行調查。辯方又展示由警長1237撰寫的調查報告，黎引述指，於當天11時至下午3時45分，黎與警長1237於羈押中心會見室與陳梓華會面，並由警長1237向其錄取口供，共6頁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在庭上補充，當天他與警長1237前往會見室，因被指派要向陳錄取口供，由警長1237負責。黎再向懲教署職員協調，安排如何列印口供予陳梓華簽署。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方提及，正向懲教署申請張劍虹的探訪紀錄，希望稍後就此向黎提問。法官杜麗冰質疑，辯方提問無助於辯方案情，指除非辯方指控在證人錄取口供的過程中，遭受威逼而捏造證供，否則即使證人曾與警方談及證供，亦無助於辯方案情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方提出，警方曾指導證人如何錄取口供。法官李運騰指，但早前盤問時，辯方並無向證人提出指導（coaching）、捏造（fabrication）及排練（rehearsing）證供等字眼。辯方指，曾提出「遊說（persuade)」等字眼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在黎國勇避席下，辯方另提及，正向懲教署申請張劍虹的探訪紀錄，希望稍後就此向黎提問。法官杜麗冰質疑，辯方提問無助於辯方案情，指除非辯方指控在證人錄取口供的過程中，遭受威逼而捏造證供，否則即使證人曾與警方談及證供，亦無助於辯方案情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法庭頒令禁報保護證人計劃資料&quot;&gt;法庭頒令禁報保護證人計劃資料&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方提出，警方曾指導證人如何錄取口供。法官李運騰指，但早前盤問時，辯方並無向證人提出指導（coaching）、捏造（fabrication）及排練（rehearsing）證供等字眼。辯方指，曾提出「遊說（persuade）」等字眼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;經控辯雙方休庭商議後，法庭頒下命令，禁止任何人，包括報章及傳播媒體，以任何方式透露、發佈或報道在本案聆訊中任何可能導致關於參與者，或曾是參與者或曾被考慮納入任何保護證人計劃內的人的身分，或所在地點的資料、或危害此人安全的資料。任何違令者，可能會被視作藐視法庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件押後至下周一（20日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

President Tinubu’s economic policies, including ending fuel subsidies and currency devaluation, have sparked further economic decline, leading to inflation and discouraging investors, further hampering Nigeria’s economic potential and political stability.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nigerians like to say that when their country sneezes, the rest of Africa catches a cold. Whether by dint of the size of its economy or its population, Nigerians are rightfully proud of their country and its influence within the West African region and the wider world. And yet, many would also say that in recent years that influence has waned as Nigeria has struggled to rise above its internal challenges. Beset by poor governance, weak institutions, deteriorating security conditions, spiraling economic decline, and uninspired leadership, Nigeria’s current conditions present it as more of a sick man of Africa. For these reasons, many saw the country’s 2023 presidential elections as a chance to reset the narrative, begin the necessary process of reforming what ails the country, and chart a new course for the future of Africa’s largest country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper, researched and drafted in the opening months of the new Bola Tinubu government, considers some of the early policy choices the president has taken and his governing style thus far to develop expectations regarding the pace and quality of economic and governance reforms in the years to come. In particular, this paper focuses on the hydrocarbon sector, which has traditionally been Nigeria’s engine of economic growth and largest provider of hard currency. As the face of extractive industries in Nigeria evolves, along with global attitudes toward fossil fuels and green energy, this paper assesses how Nigeria is positioned locally to both benefit and be buffeted by this rapidly evolving landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tinubu-administration&quot;&gt;Tinubu Administration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;More of the Same?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bola Tinubu assumed the presidency of Nigeria in May 2023 with his back already firmly against the wall. Court challenges to his electoral victory hung over his first five months in office, creating distractions and defusing the kind of meaningful momentum that electoral victories often bring and which are important for new administrations to build the necessary energy for change and reform. Beyond the allegations of a fraudulent election, Tinubu was further saddled with the reputational harm that comes with being the first Nigerian president elected with without receiving a majority of the popular vote. Winning only 36 percent of cast ballots, Tinubu’s mandate coming into office could not have been weaker. Compounding this trust deficit, he took over Aso Rock, the presidential villa, with no grand vision for how he would administer the government and address the nation’s many challenges, nor a defined policy ag                                enda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Described by many as a consensus builder and dealmaker, he ran on his reputation as a results-oriented administrator capable of assembling teams of competent lieutenants able to achieve results — a reputation he made for himself as the governor of Lagos State from 1999 to 2007. But given the nearly two decades since he has held elected office, his detractors note that there is a substantial difference between making Nigeria’s complex patronage network function and being able to or interested in reforming it. In terms of reform, perhaps Nigeria’s most pressing and challenging priority, his early record suggests that he is likely to continue the tradition of prioritizing politics over governance, or as one local analyst remarked, “making things work despite government involvement, not because of it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the many structural challenges facing Nigeria’s economy and governance structures, Tinubu has shown in his first 10 months in office that his focus is likely to be much more on outcomes than on process, with many suggesting an “ends justifies the means” attitude toward governing. Several early policy pronouncements illustrate this style of governing and imply an impetuous and even ad hoc style of leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Tinubu’s cabinet choices have disappointed many who had hoped to see the kind of young, dynamic, and technocratic government officials he reportedly assembled during his time as Lagos State governor. Instead, his record number of ministerial appointments has created a bloated and unwieldy cabinet that again suggests that politics will trump public policy, as more party stalwarts and political allies have been rewarded with prized ministerial posts in lieu of more qualified reformers or technical experts, with only a few exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Tinubu’s decision to keep the position of petroleum minister for himself, as all previous Nigerian presidents have done, was clearly a missed opportunity to break from tradition and signal that a reform of Nigeria’s sclerotic revenue generator might be coming. Perhaps more importantly, it signals a business-as-usual approach to the sector, where the presidency maintains a firm grip over all contracts and investments in the country’s oil industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, hasty announcements of reforms to remove a national fuel subsidy and float the foreign exchange rate appear to have been done with little consultation with economic advisers and without any kind of short- or long-term strategy to mitigate the unintended consequences of his decisions. While many in Nigeria acknowledge that these moves were entirely necessary to begin to right the country’s economy, the dramatic devaluing of the naira and the soaring cost of everyday staples has set back the economy even further and disproportionately hurt average Nigerians, who the actions were intended to help. That these weighty decisions were enacted with no social safety net in place and without sufficient warning to Nigerian businesses has squandered an opportunity to demonstrate true political courage and instead made the policy change appear foolhardy and chaotic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, Tinubu’s robust defense of regional democracy in the face of Niger’s military coup and threats to employ Nigeria’s thinly stretched military to mount an invasion of Niger to restore to power its erstwhile president, Mohammed Bazoum, presented Tinubu as impetuous, uncalculating, and underprepared to manage the country’s complex foreign relations and internal security challenges. Nigeria’s military leaders were particularly angered at reportedly not having been consulted before Tinubu made his threats of military force against a nation that had largely been trained by Nigeria and with whom many of Nigeria’s Hausa officer corps share deep cultural and familial bonds. In the words of one retired general, “It was tantamount to declaring civil war.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Many analysts, politicians, and business leaders argue that Nigeria possesses the requisite laws and institutions for the effective functioning of an efficient state, but also that it has mostly lacked the kind of steadfast leadership required to challenge entrenched patronage networks.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many analysts, politicians, and business leaders argue that Nigeria possesses the requisite laws and institutions for the effective functioning of an efficient state, but also that it has mostly lacked the kind of steadfast leadership required to challenge entrenched patronage networks that continue to undermine the best intentions of even the most committed reformers. It is still too early to predict what direction Tinubu will choose. There is still a large amount of triage to undertake on the economy before larger structural reforms can be imagined, especially given the deleterious effects of his early economic choices. In short, if he can get there, a second term would be a more likely opportunity for President Tinubu to pursue true reforms, should he choose to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-future-of-nigerian-oil&quot;&gt;The Future of Nigerian Oil&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is perhaps no greater example of Nigeria’s unrealized potential than its oil industry. The well-documented failures and shortcomings of Nigeria’s hydrocarbon sector are a direct reflection of the inability and unwillingness of successive Nigerian governments to address debilitating governance challenges, rampant insecurity, and endemic corruption — all of which today form a vicious cycle that inhibits simple solutions. International oil companies (IOCs) are increasingly exploring options for leaving Nigeria’s onshore oil areas and concentrating in the deep offshore — or even departing Nigeria altogether. Along with mounting pressures from the global “net-zero” movement to shift away from fossil fuels and lower carbon emissions, Nigeria faces the critical question of whether oil can or should maintain its relative importance to the country’s economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The election of Tinubu has carried with it some hope, and even more promises, that renewed efforts will be taken to address the sector’s deficiencies and reinvigorate the hydrocarbon sector to once again be a driver of growth and much-needed foreign exchange. The president has proclaimed a desire to see the country boost its production to 4 million barrels per day, nearly tripling its present-day production level, which is itself well short of the country’s quota established under the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. Many see Tinubu’s personal experience working for an IOC and his family’s deep ties to the industry as giving him special insight into the sector and motivation to fix it. Today, the industry is viewed as much maligned, which one industry insider described as “broken at every level.” But such herculean ambitions require a genuine commitment to upending Nigeria’s vast oil-related patronage network, starting at the highest levels of the federal government and extending all the way down to the creeks of the Niger Delta’s expansive inland waterways. But a number of impediments stand in the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;governance&quot;&gt;Governance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, many argue that the oil industry itself is simply too big to disrupt and has too many entrenched interests embedded throughout for one person to address, even if that person is the president. Underscoring this point, many refer to Tinubu’s decision to reserve the position of petroleum minister for himself as a signal that he has no real interest in reforming the system he oversees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others point to passage of the landmark Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) as further proof that even legislative and regulatory tools are too little, too late in seeking to reform the sector. The PIA, at its inception, was intended to provide a comprehensive set of legal, governance, regulatory, and transparency measures to address many of the sector’s endemic challenges and to open Nigeria up to a new generation of investment. But few believe that the legislation, conceived of 20 years ago and passed in 2021, has arrived in time to either reverse the slow and steady decline of the oil sector or signal to outside investors that Nigerian leaders are in fact interested in transforming the industry into a model of growth and efficiency. Indeed, while Nigerian lawmakers were busy spending two decades debating how to transform and govern the industry to ensure its health well into the twenty-first century, the sector and the world changed around it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When debate started on the PIA, Nigeria was Africa’s oil behemoth, producing roughly 2.5 million barrels per day. Despite low-level insecurity and operational challenges associated with managing complex community relations, as the majority of Nigeria’s oil infrastructure crisscrosses literally thousands of local communities, oil majors had few other alternatives to Nigerian oil. That is no longer the case. As oil discoveries have been made all along the West African coast, not to mention major new discoveries in places further afield such as Uganda and Mozambique, IOCs now have a wealth of investment opportunities from which to choose. And importantly, those locations appear to be more secure and easier in which to operate — and seem to offer greater returns on investment. In particular, deeper offshore oil investments in Nigeria have emerged as more attractive to international investors for their higher revenue margins, absence of local community groups to manage, and lower vulnerability to unrest and insecurity, resulting in fewer production delays and higher profits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other element of the PIA’s development that has clearly backfired is the notion that the legislation would open the door to new investment to reinvigorate the sector. Instead, oil majors, preferring to see what direction this landmark legislative effort would take, have delayed for decades the kinds of necessary investments in upkeep, maintenance, and expansion of oil infrastructure that would allow Nigeria to even meet its existing production quotas. The result has been increasingly unreliable and faulty infrastructure, some of which is 50 to 60 years old, that is easily tampered with and prone to leakages and other failures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fundamental weakness in current onshore oil infrastructure has been exacerbated by fraught community relations as more and more responsibility for local development and service delivery has been foisted onto IOCs in the absence of tangible and sustained efforts at the local or federal levels. A vicious cycle currently exists whereby oil infrastructure is either vandalized or breaks down, creating environmental damage and exacerbating grievances with local communities. This in turn prompts lawsuits and clean-up efforts, which IOCs are left to negotiate with communities and largely occur absent any government oversight or intervention. It is perhaps no wonder that in this operationally challenging and litigious environment that oil majors in recent years have been choosing to defer promised onshore investments for which they hold exclusive licenses; in some cases, they have even chosen to return those licenses back to the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In the words of one Nigerian oil analyst, “Nigeria expected the rest of the world to wait for them to get their house in order, and instead [the world] got tired of waiting and moved on.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the words of one Nigerian oil analyst, “Nigeria expected the rest of the world to wait for them to get their house in order, and instead [the world] got tired of waiting and moved on.” However, it is not only the governance of the sector that has left so many actors, from the IOCs all the way down to the community level, so disillusioned and disheartened about the sector’s future. Even if President Tinubu committed to implementing the PIA and its many provisions governing community-IOC relations, the sector would still exist in the context of Nigeria’s wider governance failings, all of which require a top-down, comprehensive set of measures to address. Short of wholesale elite buy-in, this is difficult to envisage happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;security&quot;&gt;Security&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowhere is this governance failure on sharper display than in Nigeria’s overall lack of security, not only in the Niger Delta but across the country’s 36 states. Currently, Nigeria’s military, which is responsible for the country’s internal security, is deployed on security operations in 34 states, each of which has sustained a minimum of at least 20 conflict-related fatalities, though most cases involve far more. This is despite having fewer than 200,000 active-duty troops and only two functioning C-130 transport aircraft to move those forces. Chronically understaffed and undermotivated, they are also underfunded. The administration of former president Muhammadu Buhari reportedly needed to borrow funds externally to pay army salaries, with as many as one-third of army salaries being paid to ghost workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Security in the Niger Delta largely has been predicated on the notion that some combination of money and the military would fix the ailments of both the hydrocarbon sector and the local communities in which those operations take place. In reality, the opposite appears to be true.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, security in the Niger Delta largely has been predicated on the notion that some combination of money and the military would fix the ailments of both the hydrocarbon sector and the local communities in which those operations take place. In reality, the opposite appears to be true. The more money and forces deployed to the delta, the worse the security situation has become in recent years. Though assessments vary, at least one-quarter and as much as one-half of Nigeria’s daily oil output is being stolen by militant groups across the six states of the Niger Delta, to the point that the government has lost track of the number of pipeline attacks because there are so many.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sustained militancy in the delta is a function of both the absence of development dollars, which typically fail to make it to the community level, and the lack of jobs and economic opportunity for the increasingly young population. Despite the chronic insecurity this militancy engenders, oil theft creates higher-paying jobs than can be found on the local job market, fills the region’s energy gaps through small-scale refining, and has become the grease that literally helps the region to function — prompting one local community leader to assess, “Oil theft is state sanctioned instability.” With most of the Nigerian army and navy’s deployed forces in the region coming from northern and western states, delta militants remain at a distinct advantage in knowing the spiderweb of creeks and roads across the region. This local knowledge enables militants to evade even serious attempts at capture and has left the military looking feckless in its inability to effectively respond to this threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These trends are all epitomized in the announcement last year that former Niger Delta militant and kingpin of the illegal oil market Government Ekpemupolo, or “Tompolo,” had been granted a ₦48 billion (approx. $60 million when signed) annual contract by the federal government to provide pipeline security across the Niger Delta. Many saw this deal as a quiet, yet public acknowledgement by the state that it had been bested and is unable to provide effective pipeline security. Billed by the government as an amnesty and a works project for delta youth, it is hard to view this “fox guarding the henhouse” scenario as anything other than another government abdication of its responsibilities in the region — the first being the foisting of development responsibilities onto IOCs. This sad admission — that the best the government can do is award lucrative contracts to those responsible for inflicting pain on the nation — is not just a recognition that Nigeria is plundered, but that it is also rewarding criminals, bandits, and groups that take up arms against it. Unsurprisingly, despite the high levels of violence and militancy, the Niger Delta is not even Nigeria’s most unstable and violent region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One local community leader lamented that, “Everything about oil production is violent: from the discovery, to the extraction, to the refining and the flaring. You cannot escape it.” And with local security being turned over to militants — essentially paying bad actors to refrain from further attacks — the government seems to be both rewarding bad behavior and acknowledging their inability to stop it. With such a bleak security picture of and disheartening commentary on government capacity, few local leaders are surprised that commitment from IOCs to onshore production is in doubt and that the outlook for the sector appears bleak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;environmentalism-and-a-green-future&quot;&gt;Environmentalism and a Green Future&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 20 years that the oil industry has waited for the government to address the challenges facing oil production, trends were also emerging outside of the oil industry which are today similarly having a profound effect on the sector’s future in Nigeria. The race to net-zero carbon emissions and campaigns against fossil fuels are beginning to have profound effects on the industry in ways that will affect future investments and seemingly depress enthusiasm for new oil projects. But for communities in the delta, environmentalism has less to do with protecting the environment and reducing emissions and is much more focused on getting paid for past or ongoing environmental damage caused by vandalism or failing infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;For communities in the delta, environmentalism has less to do with protecting the environment and reducing emissions and is much more focused on getting paid for past or ongoing environmental damage caused by vandalism or failing infrastructure.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the net-zero movement exists within some community and advocacy circles, local politicians have appeared largely unmoved by the global climate change debate. In fact, many point to the fact that Western countries are continuing to make substantial new investments in fossil fuels as a sign that international calls by those countries to begin a shift toward more expensive green energy is little more than a new tool of colonialism. Instead, the priority in Nigeria has remained developing a greater abundance of affordable energy for the local market, though not necessarily from green sources. But many acknowledge that Nigeria may be approaching the stage where pursuing a greener future may in fact create opportunities for “leapfrogging,” especially as the cost of renewables inches closer to the price of oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many officials and business leaders acknowledge that “Nigeria is really a gas country,” in recognition of the fact that the country’s natural gas supply far surpasses its future oil reserves. They argue that a transition to gas for internal energy uses, as much as for export, is precisely the kind of initiative the government needs to jumpstart the economy and bring in a new source of foreign exchange. Similarly, others argue that Nigeria’s famous innovators and entrepreneurs would be well placed to help develop the sector if the government did more to incentivize innovation and create a market for its monetization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this kind of energy transition discussion has been slow to take hold among leaders and the population at large because of the stranglehold that big oil has on the economy and governance of the country. Nigeria, it is argued, is a rentier state that revolves around oil. Shifting away from that, or creating a new reality around gas or renewables, would mean undoing an entrenched, and in many ways perverse, incentive structure from the top down that politicians have neither the courage nor willingness to take on. Beyond that, it would also mean changing the popular conception that the country is an oil economy. In the delta in particular, local activists argue that, given the harm and destruction the oil industry has wrought on the region, communities are unwilling to abandon it without first seeing some of the benefits that they have long been promised from the resource. Indeed, many locals express concern about a de-emphasis on oil or the rumored departure of IOCs, arguing that it is not fair to suffer the negative impacts of the industry for so long without reaping sufficient benefit. With President Tinubu’s removal of fuel subsidies, this argument is even more resonant today as communities throughout Nigeria are now forced to pay the equivalent of a month’s salary for a tank of gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from a handful of civil society organizations and delta-based NGOs, there has been no strong indigenous advocacy movement from key actors in Nigeria pressing for a transition to clean energy or a move away from oil production. This lack of political leadership or organized public demands has made progress slow. But President Tinubu’s recent appointment of a minster of gas is seen by some as a potentially hopeful sign. To operationalize those efforts, others have argued for a gas master plan that puts in place a gas policy and strategic development plan for the sector’s future. Beyond that, many argue that if gas is to be developed, the government must do a better job from the start of maximizing the benefits for local communities during the development of the asset. Unless equity is established between local communities and gas production, Nigeria risks recreating the toxic and unstable environment that is already entrenched in the oil sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-growth-of-indigenous-firms&quot;&gt;The Growth of Indigenous Firms&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the many challenges of governance, security, and community relations faced by IOCs in operating in the onshore Niger Delta, coupled with the increasing global pressures to disinvest from fossil fuels, it is no wonder that many of Nigeria’s oil majors are discussing or actively seeking to pull out of Nigeria’s onshore environment. And yet, most of the major oil industry stakeholders, whether business executives, local communities, politicians, or civil society groups, all appear sharply divided over what the net effect would be of having indigenous Nigerian oil companies assume the assets and production capacity of international operators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some argue that the departure of large international oil operators presents a historic opportunity to develop local talent, keep Nigeria’s vast oil wealth in Nigeria where it can better benefit the Nigerian people and economy, and become more responsive to the needs and demands of the communities where the oil is extracted. But arguing, as many do, that traditional IOCs have always overpromised and underdelivered on their local commitments excuses many of the structural impediments to efficient operations that companies of any national origin will face in Nigeria’s rough and tumble delta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-mixed-picture&quot;&gt;A Mixed Picture&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a number of points, the argument often made by the sector’s stakeholders — that indigenous operations would have the inherent tools to succeed — can in fact cut both ways. Many argue that Nigeria possesses the requisite pool of local skilled talent after decades of oil production to run the industry from the wellheads to the boardroom. But others point to the endemic corruption and inside information that comes from many of those same locally employed staff. How, it is argued, can upwards of half of Nigeria’s daily production output be stolen without the leakage of inside information to militants regarding where and when to strike? Will these relationships recede when Nigerian ownership is installed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the argument goes that there is enough security in the delta, with large-scale deployments of federal army and naval forces. But again, many assume that those forces will be more dedicated to protecting locally owned and operated assets than foreign-owned ones. This assumption similarly ignores the basic reality that delta militants remain substantially better armed, better informed, and better motivated than federal security forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the development front, operators contend that there are sufficient development resources already in the delta to counter the threats to operators and vandalism of infrastructure. They argue that violence will be minimized against local operators, pointing to the provision of the PIA requiring oil operators to pay 3 percent of profits into a local community development fund. However, previously unpublished audits of those trust funds suggest that development dollars are being siphoned off before making it to local communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOME LOCAL ADVANTAGES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most obvious and significant advantage observers point to that locally owned Nigerian firms would have over their international counterparts is simply that they are local. Western multinationals are seen as deep pocketed and as susceptible to the kinds of pressures that local communities, militant groups, and politicians can bring to bear. These leverage points against IOCs have grown even more pronounced against the backdrop of global climate change discussions and environmental justice debates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local operators, it is argued, will be seen as having fewer resources to pay militants or corrupt politicians; as unwilling to buy off local communities with gifts or development projects to create goodwill or compensate for environmental damage; and as less of a security target for militant groups. Being Nigerian, these operators are also seen as likely to be less susceptible to the kinds of shareholder pressure and bad press that impacts IOCs located in Houston, London, or the Hague. Such IOCs are constantly spending to ward off bad press associated with local lawsuits related to everything from environmental damage to unfair labor practices to unmet promises to local communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communities seeking to gain leverage over locally owned and operated Nigerian operators would have to sue them in Nigerian courts, seek compensation in naira, and work through Nigerian politicians and the Nigerian press to plead their cases. This is decidedly a far less appealing, less effective, and less lucrative avenue for seeking redress, which many believe will dissuade such formal legal proceedings from becoming as widespread as they are today with IOCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, because local firms are understood to be more resource constrained than major multinationals, many believe that violence, vandalism, and environmental damage will go down markedly as soon as it is understood that the prospect of a substantial payday is not waiting for malign actors in the way it may have been before. However, not all Nigerian operators are monolithic, and some may feel that having fewer activist shareholders and being free from the constraints of Western anti-corruption legislation, such as the United States’ Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, will give them many of the benefits of being both a smaller target and more able to respond in ways that continue to challenge IOCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SIGNIFICANT DOWNSIDES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as local firms present some obvious advantages to their international oil counterparts, it may become quickly apparent that having a smaller size and capitalization comes with a number of distinct disadvantages as well that are unlikely to benefit the local communities or wider economy. This is especially true when it comes to the kinds of leverage local groups might have over oil companies to press demands, which will have to be channeled through local, state, and federal politicians and institutions, including the courts. These indigenous firms are unlikely to be as responsive as IOCs, which have activist shareholders and boards seeking to minimize bad press and operational risks. Similarly, without foreign courts adjudicating disputes, many fear that more pressure will be put on Nigeria’s weak judicial and law enforcement agencies to govern the sector more actively. Given the overall governance challenges already endemic in Nigeria, this suggests an environment where local voices have less ability to hold decisionmakers accountable for the matters that affect them directly. Some local activists are worried that local operators would take shortcuts on issues such as health, safety, security, and workers’ rights because they do not fear the same repercussions that an IOC might feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, some local oil operators suggest that the biggest challenges they face, which are felt locally, are the cost and availability of the capital necessary to maintain and even grow their operations. One operator calculated that the cost of capital for hydrocarbon projects in the United States is 6 percent, compared to 13 percent in Nigeria, thus putting a 7 percent risk premium on any project for which they seek to raise funds. In addition, they noted that the overall race to net zero is hindering the global capital flow to hydrocarbon projects. If a local project is not self-financed, it would have to pursue large decarbonization offsets and substantial environmental, social, and governance (ESG) components in order to raise money from Western sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this resource-constrained environment, where environmental concerns often trump demand, indigenous firms are likely to have fewer resources on hand to operate and maintain the existing, and failing, infrastructure networks they have bought into, let alone the substantial new resources needed to bring online Nigeria’s remaining reserves. Instead, what many expect to see is indigenous firms looking to squeeze what is left of a dying industry in a bid to maximize profits but not production. As a result, many suspect to see a proliferation of small and resource-constrained local operators entering the onshore market, surrendering the production efficiencies of large firms and accelerating production declines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-economic-study-in-contradictions&quot;&gt;An Economic Study in Contradictions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Tinubu came into office with sky-high expectations for reviving the economy and delivering an economic miracle to the country, as people recall him doing for Lagos State during his time as governor. Eight years of statist policies and interventions in the economy under the previous Buhari government — defined by capital controls, heavy government borrowing, and costly subsidies on everything from foreign exchange to fuel and electricity — have left the economy in a historically bad position. And while Tinubu is looking for quick wins to stem the hemorrhaging of the economy, he is not seen as a reformer. People are expecting to see more liberalization and less intervention from the government in the economy. At the same time, he has given little indication that he is likely to do much to break the current patronage system so central to the Nigerian economic model and rebuild it more efficiently under the rule of law. Absent such reform, Nigeria’s economic outlook will remain highly unpredictable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Nigeria’s economy is rife with contradictions that President Tinubu appears, so far, ill-equipped to reverse.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Nigeria’s economy is rife with contradictions that President Tinubu appears, so far, ill-equipped to reverse. First, although the president came into office on the tail of multiyear rises in the global price of oil, Nigeria finds itself in the unenviable position of watching its own internal fiscal situation deteriorate precipitously. Similarly, the quick wins promised by Tinubu in the campaign have translated quite simply into quick losses. His inaugural announcements to end costly fuel subsidies and float Nigeria’s currency, the naira, had the near-immediate effect of accelerating the country’s economic decline, to the point that the naira has lost nearly 100 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar since the float was announced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On paper, Nigeria has the potential to be Africa’s economic powerhouse. It already has the continent’s largest economy and population and is expected to have the third-largest population globally by 2050. Fed by a large middle class, the president’s business-friendly rhetoric and promises to usher in a new era of deregulation, private sector–led growth and development, and job creation have struck many as the right message at the moment. But once again, his early economic choices have hurt those he claims to be trying to help the most. With real inflation running somewhere between 50 and 75 percent each month, overall consumption is starting to fall, further contributing to the downward economic pressures and beginning to shrink the much ballyhooed middle-class segment. That shrinkage is only further exacerbated by a rising, record-level brain drain, as many Nigerians with better options are voting with their feet and leaving the country for easier and more prosperous lives in the diaspora.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop of economic decline, oil majors and the middle class are not the only ones seeking an exit from Nigeria’s economy. Large providers of consumer goods, such as the South African retailer Shoprite and Western giants such as Proctor &amp;amp; Gamble and Unilever, have also decided to end efforts to manufacture in the country and have instead shifted to a distributor model for selling goods in Nigeria. This move away from value-added production — owing to severe capital controls that mean it can take as long as six months to repatriate hard currency earnings — and the precipitous decline of the naira are sure to push Nigeria further down the economic ladder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This unmet potential and Nigeria’s declining economic fortunes have been compounded by Tinubu’s rash economic decisionmaking and seeming lack of a comprehensive economic plan. But one trait the country’s detractors can rarely explain and are challenged to quantify is its resiliency. This resiliency has enabled the country to survive and succeed sometimes despite itself. But for too long, as one local business analyst noted, “Nigeria walks and talks like a country that is wealthy, but it’s not. The image that Nigeria has of itself is not the truth.” The question remains whether the departure of decades-long pillars of Nigeria’s business community will be enough to speak the kind of truth to power in Abuja that can initiate much-needed governance reform and institutional strengthening. Thus far, too few have been willing to undertake the changes needed to help Nigeria develop into the economic powerhouse it can be and thinks it already is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regrettably, President Tinubu’s early economic missteps suggest that he might draw the wrong lessons from his bold economic choices. Instead, Nigerians are hoping he learns from that hasty start and sets upon a trajectory of thoughtful and deliberate economic reforms that tap into the country’s natural advantages. Short of that, Nigeria’s economic and political fortunes are likely to remain unpredictable and contradictory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Islamic State in Khorasan (IS-K), the branch of IS in Central and South Asia, has been actively recruiting for years, in particular in Afghanistan and Pakistan. In recent years, much of this effort has been online, but early in its existence (2015–18) the organisation exclusively recruited face to face. Some themes have been dominant in IS-K recruitment throughout, however, and are therefore worth investigating, so as to assess vulnerabilities that might make disrupting its recruitment efforts or undermining the commitment of its members easier. This Emerging Insights paper aims to explore how the same ideas and themes that are used by IS-K for recruitment and for “gluing” members to the organisation might be recrafted for those members who are disengaging. The paper does not attempt to exhaustively discuss IS-K recruitment in all its shapes and phases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper is primarily based on data collected during the STRIVE Afghanistan project, which RUSI implemented in 2019–24. In particular, it draws extensively on interviews with current and former IS-K members. The paper does not aim to be a conclusive piece of research, but rather aims to raise questions and issues based on exploratory work carried out so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An Afghan researcher interviewed a total of nine former members of IS-K in Afghanistan in spring 2023 and winter 2024. The paper also draws material from other publications resulting from STRIVE Afghanistan. There are clear limitations to the research methodology adopted. Research was by necessity primarily limited to oral sources and, more importantly, it was not possible, in the organisational and risk context of the time, to adopt an ethnographic approach. Former IS-K members were often reluctant to expand on their life histories, and the researcher was not in a position to spend long periods of time with them. While obtaining access was not a problem, there was a risk that interviewees might be affected by a social desirability bias, resulting in overstatement of some aspects of their involvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper is composed of three sections. The first section briefly outlines where IS-K propaganda sits relative to preceding jihadist movements, while the second section discusses the main recruitment pitches specific to IS-K propaganda. The third looks at the role of financial offerings in underpinning the ambitions of IS-K recruits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;narratives-in-common-with-previous-jihads&quot;&gt;NARRATIVES IN COMMON WITH PREVIOUS “JIHADS”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked about their motives for joining IS-K, former IS-K members who had surrendered to the Taliban in 2021–22 typically focused on one or both of two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A religious/ideological duty to defend the entire Islamic community (umma) against American “colonisation”, as it was framed by some of the interviewees – implying an effort not just to dominate but to change the minds and way of life of Afghans.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The duty of defending the local community – that is, the village – from the direct threat of bombing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most interviewees blended the two concerns, the umma and the village. IS-K propaganda also emphasises the theme of the responsibilities and roles the group believes that men specifically have, which include engaging in armed jihad to protect the umma, a theme also found in the propaganda of IS Central. As Elizabeth Pearson has noted, men fighting for the cause are held up as “real men” and contrasted with the “emasculated” men in Western countries. It is important to note that Afghanistan remains a fully patriarchal society, and individuals drawn to jihadism only ever saw a modest shift towards a less patriarchal society in 2001–21. The challenges that activate the patriarchal masculinity of prospective IS-K recruits in Afghanistan are of a specific nature. There is evidence that anger, shame and humiliation are important motivators in driving masculinity towards intersecting with violent extremism. House searches by US troops and CIA Afghan militias, which violated both the privacy of homes and the widely practised gender segregation, were very powerful in activating patriarchal masculinity in rural Afghanistan. The theme of protecting the safety and honour of Muslim women has been a standard feature of jihadist propaganda. Women typically feature as victims of IS-K’s enemies and as prisoners in need of rescue, whether they are detained in Syrian camps or in Afghan prisons. IS Central propaganda does sometimes refer to women fighting on the frontlines, but likely with the intent of shaming men, rather than as an attempt to recruit women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On such issues, there is considerable overlap with groups engaged in jihad in Afghanistan before IS-K. In the deeply patriarchal context of Afghanistan, key norms of masculinity discussed by interviewees included: bravery; protection of the family and its honour and community values; and being the breadwinner. For Taliban village recruits in 2003–21, protecting their families was a key motivating factor, to the extent that they objected to being rotated to different areas, as this would take them away from their families. A typical account of recruitment into the Taliban features the violation of the family home and of the honour of womenfolk. The link made between manhood and a duty to defend the community was strong. When interviewed, even former members of the Taliban tended to understate the importance of pressure from family (fathers, mothers and wives) in getting them to leave the Taliban, probably because of the sense of shame involved. Although several interviewees did not list family pressure as a key factor in getting them out, when pressed they did admit that it played a role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both IS-K and its predecessor jihadist groups have drawn on the glorification of violence that derived from decades of war: participation in the jihad has become a rite of passage for many men. Thus, an idea of masculinity in which honourable men are dominant and aggressive is even encouraged by mothers and other female relatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;is-ks-specificity&quot;&gt;IS-K’S SPECIFICITY&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since August 2021, the most obvious distinguishing feature of IS-K has been its focus on fighting the Taliban. The Taliban takeover deprived IS-K of even the relatively modest opportunities to tap into antagonised masculinities that were offered by the (modest) efforts to promote female emancipation in Afghanistan in 2001–21. The Taliban itself had exploited that campaign to mobilise support among those who resented these policies. However, post-regime change, IS-K has still been able to rely on masculinities activated by humiliation, for example in the Salafi villages of eastern Afghanistan, where the Taliban often harassed and behaved aggressively with the local youth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A case of particular interest, from a countering violent extremism standpoint, is that of university students who joined IS-K. Recruits and recruiters interviewed agreed that it was those humiliated by pro-Taliban students and professors who were most likely to join. In order to emerge and function as a large insurgent organisation, IS had to attract recruits from varied constituencies, usually adapting to local contexts. However, one feature common to the IS recruitment drive across regions was the concern with setting up a cohesive hardcore of what could be described as “professional revolutionaries”, which would carry forward the organisational, military and ideological know-how of IS in the face of all difficulties and failures. The recruitment pitch aimed at prospective members of this hardcore was targeted at urban, educated youth, the type of youth that cultural anthropologist Scott Atran describes as “not attracted to the lure of a consumerist society, but instead seduced by the offer of a life of fight, risk, adventure. IS aims to channel the youth’s inclination towards rebellion, their energy and idealism and aspiration to sacrifice”. Atran’s description evokes frustrated masculinity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This pitch resonated in a context like Afghanistan’s cities, where “the traditional sources that defined (and also imposed) a monolithic lifestyle and system of customs and values, lost their power and authority”, as a result of the new order brought about by US intervention. In the words of Borhan Osman, the youth was left “adrift in an urban space in which values looked confusing and fluid”, facing a “new market of identities … thanks to the ease of communication with the broader Muslim world and the interchange of elements of culture, religion, and politics”, and seeking to understand “what it means to be Afghan and Muslim in the twenty-first century”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially among young urban, university-educated “middle-class” prospective recruits, IS-K marketed itself as a full package, which even included getting them married: “The sense of jihadi solidarity among ISKP’s urban members was further reinforced by tales of female members offering to marry male recruits and elder male members marrying away their daughters to young men joining the group”. Such things happened without consultation with the girls’ households, thus breaching “standard Afghan marriage customs”, and showing that recruits were prepared to “reject tradition in order to live the kind of life they want”. These marriage opportunities seem to have worked best for Salafi militants who were struggling to find a partner before joining IS-K. They worked not so well for the girls offered in marriage by their fathers, not least because of the heavy casualty rate among fighters and the unpopular practice of remarrying widows to other IS-K members. At least some of the widows fled IS-K before they could be remarried. One former member was at ease discussing this aspect:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Within the land of the Caliphate [IS-K-controlled territory], there was Jihad-ul-Nika [jihadi marriage], and every member of Daesh [IS] Khurasan who was single was permitted to do Jihad-ul-Nika. The leadership of the Daesh and the Islamic Commission of Daesh asked the villagers to give their daughters for Jihad-ul-Nika.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The treatment of these women as transferable goods should be viewed within the context of a strongly patriarchal society, where forced marriages are common and arranged marriages the rule. What is new is IS-K taking on a role that previously belonged to the household. This was part of a wider aspect of IS-K’s message: that it was bringing the old Islamic order back to life, here and now. One former member recalled how in parts of Nangarhar province&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;there was total implementation of the Islamic law like it was implemented 1,400 years back. Members observed the same Sharia and caliphate system which we had in the time of the Caliphs of Rashidun. We cut off the hands of the thieves, we beheaded enemies and spies, we implemented fully the Islamic punishments against criminals … There was praying five times a day and nobody could avoid it. If any member couldn’t wake up in the morning for praying or somehow would fall asleep, the next day our commander would inflict 50 lashes on him as punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IS-K social media propaganda, such as the “Star of the Night” audio recordings, regularly mentions how individuals could support themselves, find a wife, and start a family after becoming fully embedded with IS-K. Despite often breaching local traditions, IS-K propaganda offers an environment in which traditional gender roles are celebrated, and joining the organisation becomes a means of achieving the milestones of manhood within traditional Afghan society. In parallel, the organisation’s pitch to female recruits included the promise of marriage to “men who are adventurous, loyal, true believers”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the first two sections of this paper offer only a brief overview of the range of IS-K propaganda pitches, and no attempt is made to quantify the relative importance of each of them, it seems clear that much of IS-K’s propaganda revolves around masculinity. In the particular case of middle-class recruits, it effectively conjures a dream path to social advancement within an alternative social setup. However, to make its claims even minimally plausible, IS-K has had to invest substantial financial resources, which has ended up representing a key vulnerability for the group, as discussed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-impact-of-financial-incentives&quot;&gt;THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL INCENTIVES&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;is-ks-years-of-financial-plenty&quot;&gt;IS-K’S YEARS OF FINANCIAL PLENTY&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it is difficult to find a link between socioeconomic status and the likelihood of supporting violence against civilians, there is a widespread belief in Afghanistan that the offer of salaries and financial rewards motivates many to join violent extremist organisations. When it first emerged in 2014–15, one of the drivers of IS-K recruitment in Afghanistan was undoubtedly its wealth. At that time, the “Caliphate” was at the peak of its wealth in Iraq and was able to provide generously. Then and for some years after, the organisation was able to pay its members good salaries (up to $800 per month for a simple fighter in IS-K’s golden era, at a time when the Afghan army and the Taliban were paying around $200 per month), as well as considerable opportunities for social advancement – after all, it had to build a new structure from scratch. Individuals who had been sidelined or marginalised within the Taliban and the Pakistani Taliban (primarily the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP) could now become commanders and leaders. Although promoted individuals were often known for their hardline views within both organisations, it is likely that quite a few opportunists were attracted by high salaries and benefits during this first wave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, over time, IS-K recruitment shifted towards cohorts deemed to be more ideologically/religiously aligned with the core IS message. By 2018, few new defections from the Taliban or TTP were taking place, and new recruits came from one of three groups:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Salafi villagers in eastern Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Salafi madrasa students.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Middle-class urbanites, mostly Tajiks and often university students.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here the third group – middle-class urbanites and university students – is of particular interest. Their record over the years shows that these people were not opportunist or mercenaries attracted by what were at one time comparatively high salaries. To the extent that there is evidence of their motivation, it points not towards greed, but to a career as an IS-K cadre being made more appealing because of the absence of other ways of obtaining gendered status (such as sources of wealth providing access to marriage, community status and stability). Control over weapons, power over others and maybe a motorbike – as well as cash – contributed to the rise in status offered by IS-K membership. This “career path” propelled individuals towards the growing hardcore of highly motivated IS-K members, who were establishing a structure much more similar to the original IS model than IS-K had been in its early years. For them, the high salaries were enabling factors that smoothed their path into the utopian, pure Islamic society that IS-K advertised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussed above, the prospect of either a marriage arranged by the organisation or meeting a like-minded Salafi student and marrying her under the sponsorship of IS-K was also a major aspect of the IS-K recruitment pitch. For such a scenario to really work, however, the new IS-K family needed to have a decent middle-class salary and associated benefits – to enable a path to success that was independent of any family of origin and in opposition to a society such youths viewed as morally corrupt. At its peak in 2016–18, IS-K offered that (see Box 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-1-life-story&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 1: Life Story&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The life story of H*, a Kabul University law graduate, is illustrative of how an attractive financial package contributed to IS-K recruitment and – even more – to retaining those recruited. H* graduated before IS-K had even appeared, and until 2014 he did not display any signs of inclination towards Islamic radicalism; he was known to be very secular in his attitudes. He came from a rather wealthy family, with an older brother working as a senior government official.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In 2014, he was working for foreign analysts translating religious and Taliban texts, but told his colleagues that he did not actually need a job; he just wanted to do something useful. Within a few months, his views began to change. Perhaps working for Westerners translating Taliban texts prompted some soul searching, or perhaps he was exposed to external influences. He started practising Islam quite strictly, even visiting the mosque five times a day to pray, which is quite unusual in Kabul. He began objecting to the tasks assigned to him at work and in 2015 he quit, alleging unease about working for people linked to the “US colonisers”.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;During early 2015, he was known to be in contact with a variety of mullahs and ulema from northern Afghanistan who were opposed to US occupation, even organising meetings attended by tens of them in his family home. He also started inviting old friends from his previous life as a secularised Muslim to these events, in an evident attempt to attract them towards radical views. It was not long before he joined IS-K and became an IS-K indoctrinator, paid to run motivational courses for new recruits based on religious texts and IS literature.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;H* was already married with two children at the time he joined IS-K, and did not face financial difficulties as he was supported by his wealthy family. This illustrates the point made above that financial need per se is not necessarily a driver for recruits into IS-K’s core structure. H* appears to have resented both his lack of autonomy and independence, along with the pressure to conform to a widespread understanding that social advancement could be attained by accommodating the “colonisers”. Indeed, he joined IS-K without informing his older brother (his father had passed away) or other family members. He even left his wife and two children behind when he moved to Achin district in Nangarhar.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In late 2015, H* was injured in a US air strike and returned to Kabul to heal. His family and old friends tried to encourage him to reintegrate into society, which would have been easy to do, as the fact that he had joined IS-K was not known to the authorities. However, he was unable to reintegrate, and after about six weeks he decided to go back to IS-K’s “land of the Calipate” in Achin, a society within a society that was purported by the group to embody pure Islam. This time, he took his wife and children with him. He also managed to convince his younger brother to join IS-K a few weeks later, who also took his wife with him. H*’s salary as an indoctrinator of recruits (a role that IS-K values highly) would have been significantly higher than the already generous one of a common member, and it allowed him to move to Achin. In 2017, however, H*, his wife and his children were all killed in another US strike.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;This account suggests that the combination of a job with some responsibility, a good salary and the narrative of establishing a pure Islamic society were very effective in retaining H* within IS-K: a package similar to what in the West would be considered an attractive and motivating career path. Taken separately, none of these three elements would have worked.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This short biography was put together with the help of an Afghan researcher who wished to remain anonymous.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-dream-evaporates-is-ks-financial-crisis&quot;&gt;THE DREAM EVAPORATES: IS-K’S FINANCIAL CRISIS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 2018, IS-K began to struggle financially, largely because the mother organisation, IS Central, was in decline and its ability to generate revenue was collapsing. The defeats IS-K suffered in 2019–20, which resulted in the loss of territorial control in the comparatively wealthy Nangarhar province, compounded the financial situation. Between 2020 and 2022, the salaries paid by IS-K were down to $300–500 per month, from $400–600 in 2016. Those joining at this time were, however, still seeing this as a package that would appeal to their patriarchal masculinity. One former member, for example, interviewed in 2024, stressed that “families were also treated well by the organisation, and the organisation was responsible for logistically and financially supporting the families of its members”. He “joined Daesh ANTONIO GIUSTOZZI10 [not for money], but only to defeat the American and implement the Islamic Caliphate in Afghanistan”. He presented the salary he was receiving as a pay-out “[to support] my family and children”. However, as the same former member recalls, the Islamist utopia that IS-K had been trying to create had disappeared by 2020:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The [Caliphate] system collapsed after the military operation of Taliban in Nangarhar and in Kunar [in 2019–20]. When I returned back from Pakistan and rejoined Daesh, I didn’t find the same Caliphate rule and system which was there before … that’s why I decided to surrender to the Taliban in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another former member believes he was actually duped into joining by the dishonest reporting of some friends:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Two of my villagers and friends who had joined Daesh several months earlier told me about the power of Daesh, about how Daesh members and the leadership loved each other, spoke about the real Islam and real Caliphate in the territories of Daesh Khorasan … But whatever my friends told me about the Daesh, that was not true. Daesh didn’t have much territory under their control, we were kept in the hideouts and mountains most of the time, Daesh was not in [as] much power as my friends told me, and Daesh was recovering from the military defeat which happened in 2019 and 2020 in Nangarhar and Kunar province[s] … Some members of Daesh were not happy with the situation and conditions of Daesh and with the treatment they received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worst was to come, however. By 2023, the situation had deteriorated further, due to IS’s broader decline having progressed, and to Turkish crackdowns on IS’s and IS-K’s financial hubs in Türkiye. Sources in eastern Afghanistan indicated that salaries to IS-K fighters were not being paid. For a few months in spring, IS-K was not even able to feed its members or provide logistical support. Only later in the year were food and expenses allowances of around $100 per fighter per month restored. At this time, moreover, IS-K members were either hiding in the cities, planning terror attacks and under constant threat of being caught by the Taliban, or hiding in mountain caves with little comfort for themselves and their families. Members had to endure the humiliation of having to ask for food in the villages (which IS-K had never done before), or extort money from the local population. Towards the end of 2023, fresh recruits, who had joined online, appeared in IS-K’s private chats complaining about having been left alone for months after having joined, with no effort to take them to the pocket of Islamist utopia that IS-K claims to have somewhere in the mountains of Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the recruitment effort by IS-K has centred around masculinities. This effort has allowed IS-K to, among other things, build a substantial core of members responsible for its organisational and military know-how and ensuring the continuity of the organisation among the highs and lows of jihad. The effort did not, however, come about in a vacuum. To attract suitable educated members, IS-K had to offer credible opportunities for ambitious, educated, angry young men to gain status. An environment had to be created that could claim to resemble the alternative Islamic utopia that IS-K claimed to be building. This was possible as long as IS-K was generously funded by IS Central, which was the case in 2015–17. After that, funding started becoming scarce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IS-K’s real financial crisis began in 2023, however, during which it was not able to pay salaries or even at times feed its members. Years earlier, the loss of even the few remaining pockets of territorial control had made it impossible to maintain IS-K’s small utopian villages. As of early 2024, the IS-K’s core was still showing remarkable resilience in the face of the evaporating utopia, not least because its financial and morale issues were not being exploited by its enemies, such as the Taliban, in any serious way – the Taliban even put on the backburner their plans to reintegrate disaffected IS-K members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can these narratives, centred around masculinity, now be exploited to craft messaging aimed at disengaging hardcore IS-K members from the organisation? The IS-K narrative now seems vulnerable to disruption, because the package that the organisation was able to offer at its peak is no longer affordable. Although counter-narratives have been subjected to much criticism in recent years, and indeed have a track record of poor effectiveness, one could imagine replacing them with campaigns that highlighted how an IS-K (or more generally an IS) career leads, not to a fulfilled masculine role of saviour of the community and protector of women, but instead down a path of self-destruction; how instead of establishing an Islamic utopia, this organisation took its middle-class members and their families off to live in isolated mountain caves, or in cities under constant threat of detection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same set of arguments could be used to substantiate media resilience campaigns, showing that these narratives cannot be trusted, as the scenarios they project often turn into their opposites. Longer-term solutions are inevitably harder to formulate and require in-depth research. A framework for preventing violent extremism that specifically addresses masculinities could well have potential for establishing programmes aimed at offering individuals at risk of being recruited into IS-K alternative (non-violent) paths to asserting their masculinity. They could identify non-destructive causes to fight for, such as business or community or NGO work. More specificity would require surveying the attitudes and desires present among the at-risk population. Any such approach would of course be more likely to be effective in periods when organisations such as IS-K are running low on funds (as is the case now) and business and community alternatives are flourishing (not yet the case in Afghanistan). Hence the urgency of continuing work in this field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（16日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第77日審訊。辯方早前申請重召前《蘋果》社長張劍虹出庭作供，冀就通訊群組Slack內的「飯盒會」紀錄提問，惟3名法官宣布拒絕申請，指不符司法公義。駐守國安處的偵緝警署警長接著作供，他曾於2021年11月到監獄向張劍虹派送判詞，形容張閱讀判詞後將它「冚埋」並思考了10分鐘，警長遂提出：「不如我哋傾吓偈吖。」然後張談及獄中生活，翌日便主動提出轉做控方證人。辯方則質疑，該次會面歷時逾3小時，真正原因是警方游說張劍虹出任控方證人，惟警長不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方申重召張劍虹被拒-官指明顯不符司法公義&quot;&gt;辯方申重召張劍虹被拒 官指明顯不符司法公義&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方早前申請重召前《蘋果》社長張劍虹出庭作供，冀就蘋果員工通訊群組 Slack 內的「飯盒會」紀錄提問。法官今拒絕申請，認為辯方在審前已獲得充分通知，控方會依賴被告在「飯盒會」上說過的話，而控方開案陳詞、張劍虹、陳沛敏等供詞也有提及「飯盒會」，並於2022年6月前送達辯方。此外，張劍虹作供首天已供稱他被黎智英要求記錄「飯盒會」重點，而黎亦是該 Slack 群組的成員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官亦認為，辯方在盤問張劍虹前，有充足機會準備案情和索取 Slack 紀錄。法官指，本案原定於2022年12月開審，最終延至2023年12月，而控方於開案陳詞曾提到 Slack 紀錄的截圖，辯方在盤問張劍虹時亦曾展示相關截圖，而 Slack 作為《蘋果》員工內部溝通方式，難以說黎智英對該紀錄並不知情。法官信納 Slack 紀錄能夠亦應該在審前索取，尤其辯方有多於兩年時間準備本案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官續指，黎智英的公平審訊權利，不會因法庭拒絕重召張劍虹而受影響，因辯方能在辯方案情提出相關紀錄，又指如那真的發生，便輪到控方考慮應否重召張劍虹。法官同意控方指，司法公義同樣適用於控方及辯方，不論辯方申請動機為何，但單從事實來看，批准重召張劍虹明顯不符司法公義，故拒絕批准申請。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;警署警長稱獲指示派判詞予張劍虹-主動提議不如傾吓偈&quot;&gt;警署警長稱獲指示派判詞予張劍虹 主動提議「不如傾吓偈」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後應辯方要求，傳召曾探訪張劍虹的警員供辯方盤問。張早前接受盤問時，曾透露2021年11月一名警署警長到荔枝角收押所要求會見他，會面長達約6小時，翌日該警長連同另一名偵緝警員再訪，張在會面突然提出想成為控方證人。辯方質疑警長游說張做控方證人，惟張否認，堅稱會面純粹談論荔枝角的生活和運動，又指「因為我睇完個判詞之後，自己開始去諗，想講返個事實出嚟囉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;當日探訪張劍虹的偵緝警署警長黎國勇（音譯）作供，他自1994年10月加入警隊，2020年7月26日獲委派處理本案，現時駐守警方國安處。他供稱，2021年11月11日，被總督察李書權指派到荔枝角懲教所，向張劍虹派發一份判詞。黎指會見室內，二人隔着透明板對望坐着，張花了約20至30分鐘自行閱讀判詞，「睇完又睇」，讀完後把判詞「冚埋」，「跟住佢就冇出聲，個樣係諗緊嘢嘅」，歷時約10分鐘。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎指，張當時無打破沉默，「係由我開聲先嘅」，他問張：「你有冇特別嘢啊？」張答：「冇」，他再問：「你真係冇嘢？」張再答：「冇嘢」，黎遂說：「不如我哋傾吓偈吖。」被問為何提議二人聊天，他解釋「大家打破沉默啫，冇特別原因」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;警指談及還柙生活-無談及本案及邀張任證人&quot;&gt;警指談及還柙生活 無談及本案及邀張任證人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎續指，二人大致談及張扣留期間的日常，張提到自己被獨立囚禁，故「平時冇人同佢接觸同埋傾偈」，又指自己起床吃早餐後，會去天台做運動。黎問張做什麼運動，張稱自己多年來都有習慣，玩類似太極的運動「站樁」，運動完「成身都濕晒」便會去洗澡。張續稱，之後他就等人探訪，又指自己是基督徒，通常是由女朋友和牧師探訪，其後就等吃飯，並提及獄中的膳食、他定期訂購的外賣、他喜歡吃什麼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎指，會面期間張劍虹無向他作出任何要求，亦無談及本案證據，他也沒有邀請張任控方證人。其後「因為我見傾得太耐」，黎曾建議張「不如食飯先」，但張指「唔需要」，因他可以稍後返監倉吃飯，可繼續傾，但黎仍覺得「耐」，遂於下午約2時45分稱：「不如我哋傾到呢度啦」，張回應：「不如你聽日再嚟探我啦」，因除了朋友和宗教探訪「冇乜人探佢」。黎指，當天約4時返回辦事處向總督察匯報，上司無再作指示，他並於翌日再探訪張。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;記事冊列派判詞為特別任務-與國安相關&quot;&gt;記事冊列派判詞為「特別任務」 與國安相關&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎國勇其後接受辯方大律師關文渭盤問，他確認沒有出席張劍虹2021年11月5日的保釋申請聆訊，但從新聞得知張被拒保釋。而11月11日早上他在區域法院工作，但受上司指派返辦公室拿判詞交張劍虹。辯方展示記事冊，顯示黎寫有「0915 attend to Crt」後刪去，下一項則為「1630 From Ct by SP instruct by sp, SD Duty」，同被刪去。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/97onnx2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
▲ 大律師 關文渭&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎確認「SD duty（Special duty）」是與國安相關，並解釋是「我自己寫錯」，當時警司要求他做有關國安的工作，但隨即說不需要，他遂即時刪去並簽名，同意是「好⋯⋯唔小心嘅錯誤嚟」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;記事冊續顯示，「0930 instruct by CIP C1 SD duty and proceed to LCK correctional center 派發判詞 HCCP 418/2021」。被問派判詞是否「特別任務」，黎形容特別任務（SD）是籠統的工作，「SD」是他們用的簡寫，而「我哋通常都唔會寫其他嘢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;警長稱無調查過張劍虹不認識他-無考究為何非下級警員派判詞&quot;&gt;警長稱無調查過張劍虹、不認識他 無考究為何非下級警員派判詞&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在盤問下指，上司僅着他派判詞予張劍虹，無告知他張當時有法律代表、判詞前一日已公開。辯方問他對判詞內容是否有興趣，黎答：「冇，因為我一路都冇調查過佢，我唔識佢嘅。」黎又形容，當時上司是將判詞放在公文袋，着他待會去荔枝角交給張劍虹，「其實冇詳細解釋㗎，我淨係好單純咁接咗就攞去㗎喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎又指，公文袋有膠紙封住，他沒有打開過，是到了荔枝角後由張自己打開，黎向張稱「呢份係判詞，我今日嚟攞畀你嘅」。黎當時無問張的律師是否已給他判詞，亦「冇諗過」張是否已知悉自己保釋被拒。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，黎是偵緝警署警長，有下級警員，為何不是由下級警員而是他派判詞？黎指「呢個係我上級嘅 judgement，我冇去考究」。關文渭續問黎是否C1隊的第二負責人，黎不同意，指有其他警署警長，總督察下亦有督察。關文渭一度追問誰是另一名警署警長，黎質疑涉及編制不可透露，法官杜麗冰亦質疑與案無關，辯方遂無再追問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;警長認無準備收據予張劍虹簽收覺得冇需要&quot;&gt;警長認無準備收據予張劍虹簽收：覺得冇需要&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎續同意，一般警方將文件送達被告時，會要求簽收，但當天沒有要求張劍虹簽收，他出發往荔枝角時亦沒有準備收據。辯方追問原因，黎解釋「我當時覺得冇需要」，指「我自己記事冊有記錄啦，我真誠真係派咗畀佢，我兩手空空離開，我相信呢個係真誠嘅動作記錄嚟嘅，我亦都深信張劍虹唔會話我冇派過判詞畀佢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關文渭一度指，看來派判詞予張劍虹的工作很重要，因是「特別任務」的一部分，黎稱：「我只係執行我嘅指示，我冇去判斷係咪一個咁嘅工作」；法官李運騰亦說，特別任務不代表是重要，而辯方是在問及證人意見，關遂無再追問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在辯方盤問下，黎警長確認沒有任何文件證明他有把判詞交給張劍虹。辯方指，黎警長理應知道，如果沒有得到懲教署署長的許可，而將文件交給在囚人士，可構成刑事罪行。黎確認：「係呀。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;警長否認錄口供時知道張劍虹庭上證供&quot;&gt;警長否認錄口供時知道張劍虹庭上證供&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎續確認，今年2月曾就該次會面錄取證人供詞，但不同意當時已知道張庭上作供的內容，稱自己「有睇新聞，冇向同事了解」。黎續在法官李運騰詢問下，指張劍虹作供時他不在庭內，「我淨係知道佢作供，法官閣下，我冇去真係了解件事啊」，他不知道張庭上說什麼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方質疑警長職責只限派送判詞-沒有任何理由留下來與張劍虹談獄中日常&quot;&gt;辯方質疑警長職責只限派送判詞 沒有任何理由留下來與張劍虹談「獄中日常」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方質疑，若然上級的指示只是叫黎派送判詞給張劍虹，為何黎把判詞交給張之後，不立即離開懲教所。黎則指當時讓張閱讀判詞，而張亦低頭閱讀。辯方遂質疑，根據黎警長的證供，他坐著20至30分鐘，等待張劍虹閱讀判詞，接著又坐多10分鐘等待張思考，惟毫無目的和原因。黎僅回答：「係呀。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又質疑，黎的供詞紀錄、記事冊和調查報告中，從沒有提及過張劍虹閱讀判詞之後把判詞「冚埋」、思考10分鐘，接著黎問張：「你有冇特別嘢啊？」，張回答：「冇。」黎亦同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又質疑，黎在11月11日會見了張劍虹超過2小時，並在庭上供稱張談及獄中生活，包括膳食、運動、探訪者等，然而在黎的記事冊中，這些對話內容僅以「獄中生活」四個字來概括，直至庭上作供才首次提及詳情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，會面結束的時候，二人已經會面超過3小時。黎同意，並稱：「張劍虹講嘢呢，我冇阻止佢，係由佢講嘅」，又形容這是「一個正常嘅交談」。辯方則指，這似乎像朋友之間的對話。惟黎不同意：「唔講得上係朋友嘅交談。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，除了向張劍虹派送判詞之外，黎警長並沒有任何理由（justification）留下來與張劍虹談論「獄中日常」。黎同意。不過當辯方問，當黎與張談論「獄中日常」的時候，是否正在執行警務人員的職務，黎稱：「係。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎與張劍虹會面3小時，真正原因是游說張劍虹出任控方證人。黎不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方質疑偵緝警長游說張劍虹轉做控方證人&quot;&gt;辯方質疑偵緝警長游說張劍虹轉做控方證人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，翌日即11月12日，黎與另一名偵緝警員8215再度探訪張劍虹。黎確認，並指當時會見不久後，有親友要探訪張，所以張被懲教人員帶走，而兩名警員需等候張。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，當張劍虹與親友會見完，他回來之後，第一句向警員說的說話是他表明想做控方證人。黎亦確認。辯方質疑，張的說話會否使警員感到意外？黎表示：「會呀。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方向黎提議，黎在11月11日的會面中游說張劍虹轉做控方證人，並叫他用一晚時間考慮。黎否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另質疑，黎在今年2月就探訪張劍虹的過程錄取供詞之前，曾經閱讀過有關張劍虹的新聞。黎否認，稱：「冇刻意睇新聞」，即使有也不會影響他的記憶和紀錄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指，在今年2月的供詞中，黎才首度指稱會面於下午2時45分結束，質疑他不可能相隔如此長時間後記得相關時間。黎則回應：「係呀，當時我都覺得時間好長，張劍虹未食飯，而我亦都未食飯。我好記得我睇睇個錶，係3點前。」辯方質疑為何黎不一早在記事冊中寫下「11:30至2:45，與張劍虹交流獄中生活」，惟黎稱：「我覺得未必需要」，因為他離開懲教院所時，懲教署會有時間紀錄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;紀錄顯示偵緝警長曾赴小欖探訪陳梓華14次&quot;&gt;紀錄顯示偵緝警長曾赴小欖探訪陳梓華14次&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又向黎展示另一名「從犯證人」陳梓華的探訪紀錄，顯示在2022年8月至11月9日期間，黎曾到小欖精神病治療中心探訪陳梓華合共14次。黎確認。辯方又問黎，在14次會面期間，陳梓華有否提及他的3份證人供詞有不準確之處。黎稱沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎作供未完，案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The treaty is the latest in the planned steps for developing the tri-country sixth-generation fighter, known in the UK as Tempest, and it cements the partnership as well as establishing its governance structures. Signing the treaty is, arguably, the easy part, and the UK and its partners must now continue to do the hard work to get the aircraft into service on time. This work includes reaching consensus on the multinational prerequisites for the initial capability, adopting a design philosophy that facilitates capability expansion over the system’s lifespan, and establishing agreements on support arrangements and a continuous upgrade trajectory. It will be challenging to address all of these factors effectively, yet they are just as vital to the programme’s success as overcoming the numerous technological challenges in developing a next-generation multi-role combat aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This analysis does not address the full GCAP agenda but focuses on the initial and evolving capabilities of the aircraft. It looks at aircraft-specific capability elements before addressing the capabilities of the platform as whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-sixth-gen&quot;&gt;Why Sixth Gen?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are multiple reasons for the UK’s pursuit of GCAP, including preservation and development of a notable defence industrial and technological capability and the benefits it could bring to the UK economy. More strictly in the defence domain, the governmental commitment to operational independence requires a system that can be deeply understood in order to be sustainable and modifiable in the UK. Importantly, the threat environment beyond 2040, around which the programme is directed, implies a need for a system that delivers a step change in capability from current fifth-generation aircraft (such as the F-35 and F-22). Indeed, the development of technologies driving the evolution of the threat environment is happening rapidly and is seeing massive investment from state actors. This is transforming the threat landscape significantly, thereby requiring a new capability not only to act as a deterrent but also to defeat these threats and ensure continued ability to deliver the necessary military effect. This is reflected in the US’s commitment to the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) programme, aimed at replacing the F-22 fighter jets and developing a portfolio of technologies to ensure continued air superiority. Similarly, France, Germany and Spain are pursuing the Système de Combat Aérien du Futur (SCAF) programme to replace French Rafale jets and Eurofighter Typhoons from Germany and Spain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to UK next-generation capability development, it is important to distinguish between GCAP, Future Combat Air System (FCAS) and Tempest. The UK’s next-generation combat air capability development is housed within its FCAS programme, which includes a future core platform (crewed aircraft); uncrewed aircraft of various possible various types, also known as Adjuncts or Autonomous Collaborative Platforms (ACPs); next-generation effectors (weapons), command, control and information systems; and through-life services (sustainment, upgrade and training). The GCAP collaboration is the trilateral partnership and programme that will deliver the crewed fighter (known as Tempest in the UK) component of the FCAS, which is also aligned to the Japanese and Italian requirements for a next-generation crewed combat aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to understand that UK combat air platforms already operate within a wider system and have done at least since the beginning of the Second World War. The RAF prevailed in the Battle of Britain through exploitation of ground-based radars (the Chain Home system), information analysts, a ground-based command system and fighter aircraft. However, what is envisaged in FCAS is much more complex and capable than anything previously established, and its sophistication is likely to incrementally increase. Most notably, and unlike previous combat air systems, it is envisaged that the FCAS will operate in conjunction with ACPs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fundamental-defence-capabilities&quot;&gt;Fundamental Defence Capabilities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attributes of GCAP’s next-generation crewed combat aircraft can be analysed using the framework of the seven Fundamental Defence Capabilities (Deploy, Inform, Command, Operate, Sustain, Prepare, Protect) specified in the second edition of British Defence Doctrine in 2001. This framework offers a structure within which specific requirements can be located and assessed. As will be shown in the sections below, it is also useful for clearly relating GCAP to FCAS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;deploy&quot;&gt;Deploy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any defence system needs to be locatable or movable to the area where it can be useful. Combat aircraft are usually flown to where they are needed from an equipped base either at home or overseas. Beyond the characteristics of an intended airfield, deployability away from a prepared base must take account of the support equipment that an aircraft needs, especially for maintenance. The US Government Accountability Office has reported that 13 C-17 flights are needed to transport the support equipment for a short-notice deployment of 12 F-35s. The less support equipment is needed, the easier deployability should be. In terms of deployment range, from a UK point of view, the RAF is likely to want more from the aircraft than the 450 miles associated with the F-35B for unrefuelled combat radius.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the international partnership level, the three GCAP partners might also address whether they should commit to establishing and maintaining a common infrastructure for the programme, so that any partner could deploy its aircraft to another partner with the minimum testing, diagnostic and maintenance equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;inform&quot;&gt;Inform&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important question concerns what level of performance will be required of the core platform to collect a hefty amount of data and to analyse its significance onboard the aircraft. These are matters for sensors and computers with computerised integration of information, creating both an opportunity and a significant challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data could be collected from onboard radar, infrared, electromagnetic and even noise sensors that receive material from different ends of the aircraft. The Inform agenda raises the questions of cost, weight and electricity: the more sensors, the heavier and costlier the aircraft and the greater the need for electric power. To enable spiral development and its electrical needs, the power and propulsion plant should be designed with significant spare capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The increased amount of data available will need to be quickly processed and integrated into a meaningful picture. It will be necessary to determine whether data synthesis will be primarily driven by human input or to what extent onboard computer facilities can be trusted to provide a clearer understanding of ongoing events and potential actions. There will be a demand and an opening for enhanced integration of AI-powered sensors onboard. However, it is crucial to be cautious about “conspiracies of optimism” regarding the Inform requirements, as evidenced by the persistent delays and cost escalations seen with the F-35 programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;With technological developments driving a rapid evolution in the threat environment, a new capability will need to be able not only to act as a deterrent but also to defeat threats as they emerge&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GCAP platform is likely to be specified to be able to be informed from the beginning by extant UK platforms including Wedgetail, Reaper, the F-35 and Typhoon. However, the RAF envisages having ACPs in service by 2030 – that is before the Tempest aircraft is ready. The extent to which the GCAP will be able to benefit from and contribute to other systems from the outset should be covered in what the Ministry of Defence’s (MoD) 2024 New Procurement Model referred to as minimum deployable capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also the issue of the compatibility of the wider system, including design philosophy and interoperability, with partners. Japan, for instance, may be influenced by any US encouragement to participate in its Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) for ACP requirements, and to focus on potential US aircraft for training. The question arises whether these matters pose challenges for GCAP or if they remain distinct enough from it to operate separately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;command&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon receiving analysed information, the allocation of control over GCAP capabilities between machinery and the crew, as well as the extent to which the pilot will be guided by external sources, still needs to be determined. The fact that the US, France and the UK are all pursuing a new piloted aircraft suggests that no major state is yet ready to rely entirely on autonomous or even remotely controlled systems. However, the volume of information that could be available to the pilot may means that, to avoid information overload, physical control over the aircraft may largely have to be the responsibility of a machine. The human–machine division of labour is still unclear at this stage, but developments in AI and machine learning are expected to play a significant role in supporting the pilot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The optimum scope of a pilot’s capacity to control other airborne objects needs further work, and there will likely be learning and evolution in this area. Conceptually, the GCAP pilot may have a much wider role than that of pilots to date, directing other airborne systems as part of the FCAS or beyond, while being a key node in multi-domain operations on sea and land as well as in the air. Namely, the GCAP core platform will envisage the pilots as an integrated part of the system, with human-machine interface technologies allowing them to focus on making the right decisions at the right time and making them “battlespace operators”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;operate&quot;&gt;Operate&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The operational capabilities and arrangements of the aircraft are crucial considerations. It is safe to expect it to possess the capability to engage targets across air, ground and sea domains. Additionally, determining the balance between equipping the aircraft with informational collection and distribution systems versus kinetic weapons and other effectors is essential. As emphasised in John Boyd’s Observe, Orient, Decide and Act loop framework, the ability to act effectively is closely intertwined with the capacity to receive and analyse data, underscoring the importance of information and its timely analysis in decision-making and operational effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its range needs will be defined in terms of the breadth of missions set out in the operational requirements, the location of potential targets and the need for secure basing. Given that the sixth-generation fighter jet is for the UK and Italy the successor to Typhoon, these countries are likely to insist that it should have the capability to at least perform the equivalent air-to-air and air-to-surface roles in the future operating environment that are currently performed by Typhoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aeronautical characteristics of the platform will shape its capacity to deliver needed operational capability. These include a wide range of factors such as maximum and minimum height, maximum and minimum speed, range, payload, turn capability and climb rate. To date, GCAP looks set to deliver a comparatively large platform because weapons must be stored internally to preserve low observability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sustain&quot;&gt;Sustain&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukraine war has underscored the importance of a country’s ability to sustain a war effort. The Sustain element of capability is important both operationally and financially: major platforms require much more expenditure over even a decade than they did to produce. It is therefore vital to give sustainment capabilities an important place in requirement specification during the earlier stages of requirement setting and project planning. Past experience suggests that insufficient investment in these areas at the design stage can impose substantial extra cost during operational service. When Ben Wallace was defence secretary, he complained in public about the operating costs of the F-35, so the Tempest should target being less expensive to use than that aircraft, which is a significant challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sustainment encompasses a multitude of critical considerations that must be addressed. These include, among others, the deployment of necessary test and analysis equipment to operational locations, determining the requisite number and qualifications of personnel for platform maintenance, establishing reliability benchmarks for subsystems and the overall platform, ensuring ease of maintenance and repair procedures, managing inventory levels and associated costs to maintain specified aircraft availability rates, and proactively addressing obsolescence challenges. While accurately forecasting these factors before development reaches an advanced stage is inherently challenging, prioritising design for reliability and availability is a must.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;prepare&quot;&gt;Prepare&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effective use of any armed force and its equipment relies heavily on comprehensive and effective training. Like the F-35, the Tempest aircraft does not include a two-seat version in its plans. Therefore, training for the GCAP countries will necessitate a combination of experience on other aircraft and simulation sessions to sufficiently prepare a solo pilot for their inaugural flight on the sixth-generation aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Integrating combat-related elements of GCAP, such as interoperability with other platforms, into simulators can potentially reduce the amount of time needed for both initial training and ongoing pilot proficiency. Live flying training is not only costly but also exposes aircraft features and performance to potential adversaries. Flying simulators, however, can potentially pose retention challenges as pilots may seek more active flying roles or opportunities in the commercial sector if confined to simulator-based training for extended periods. A delicate balance will have to be struck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prepare dimension prompts consideration of the attributes required for the successor to the Hawk trainer aircraft, which also serves to train future Typhoon and F-35 pilots. Finally, within the Prepare agenda, it is essential to tackle the issue of surrogate trainers. These are more economical platforms aimed at maintaining pilot proficiency, safeguarding platform security, and enhancing pilot retention. It is worth considering how this requirement aligns with both pilot training and aggressor training needs, as there may be overlapping areas where resources and strategies can be shared for greater efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;protect&quot;&gt;Protect&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the above elements of capability will need to be protected against hostile action which will evolve over time. Physical safeguarding of a platform encompasses its core features such as low observability, along with defensive measures like warning systems, decoys, flares and countermeasures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;For the GCAP partners, it is vital to develop a platform capable of dealing with the envisaged capabilities of anticipated adversaries post-2035&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GCAP partners must deliberate on the significance of stealth and overall low observability, considering advancements in radar technology and the trade-offs associated with carrying numerous external weapons. While it may be premature to entirely abandon aspirations for low observability, even a stealthy aircraft requires effective defensive aids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond low observability and aerodynamic performance, various options exist for aircraft self-protection. These include established defensive aids such as missile and radar warning systems, as well as weaponised countermeasures like air-to-air missiles. Additionally, the emergence of directed energy weapons, such as lasers, could become a reality by 2035.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aircraft must strike the right balance between offensive and defensive systems, with the flexibility to adjust this balance for specific missions. Last but not least, the cyber security and cyber resilience dimensions are pivotal to protecting the core system and the overall “system of systems” approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2035-and-beyond&quot;&gt;2035 and Beyond&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Balancing requirements across the seven areas of capability for GCAP’s core platform is not simple. Yet, a crucial feature will be the ability to counter potential adversaries, with China being the primary concern due to its growing industrial prowess. Russia’s capabilities in ground-based air defence should not be under-estimated, but overall, given that defence is looking to science and civil-origin technology for major advances, it seems clear that China will overtake Russia across the board in defence by 2035, if not well before. China’s trading record suggests an increasingly assertive stance towards the West, with a readiness to sell its military products to those hostile to the West, including Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the GCAP partners, it is vital to develop a platform capable of dealing with the envisaged capabilities of anticipated adversaries post-2035, particularly those of China. Such a product would satisfy the MoD’s current concept of a “minimum deployable capability”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second core requirement to counter future evolving threats is for the system to be an “open system” susceptible to spiral and even continuous development. For GCAP specifically, the MoD has embraced this iterative development with its adoption of the PYRAMID Open Mission System, an open systems approach that will make upgrades more rapid and reduce software maintenance costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the terms “open system” or “modular system” are always easy to say but often difficult to deliver, and they do not come without challenges. Engineers must ensure sufficient power, propulsion and internal space for upgrades beyond the minimum deployable capability. While a minimum deployable capability is clear, the route to achieving it requires careful consideration, ideally with flexibility to adapt as knowledge advances. However, while this approach is welcomed, it will be important to assess the extent to which spiral development and open system architecture allow for national customisation, and how much divergence can be permitted without endangering programme coherence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the “open system” to develop and thrive, a healthy government–industry collaboration in each of the partner countries is crucial. This would allow for dynamic adjustments to project requirements based on evolving technology and threat assessments. The Government Accountability Office in the US has long advocated a knowledge-based approach to defence acquisition, where harder commitments are specified only as knowledge is advanced. This was not the case with the F-35 which subsequently suffered multiple delays and cost overruns. Furthermore, the issue extends to government–private sector relations, where the UK and US aim to possess the intellectual property for system modifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of spring 2024, significant progress can be observed, as evidenced by two key developments. Firstly, the signing of the treaty establishing the GCAP International Government Organisation signifies a notable milestone, cementing the commitment among the three partner countries and laying down governing structures for the programme’s progression. Secondly, and relevant to the capability aspects addressed in this article, consensus has been reached by the three countries on an initial system requirement document. This not only indicates a robust collaborative approach, but also shows considerable advancement in delineating the characteristics of the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid these achievements, several complexities and challenges remain. The establishment of an industry delivery structure stands as a crucial yet pending task. It would be reassuring if this structure is announced by the end of the year, and delays beyond this point could pose concerns. Additionally, there are important issues that will have to be addressed such as in-service support arrangements, security and vetting considerations for personnel (especially in light of recent Chinese espionage cases), exports arrangements and potential collaboration with third countries on sub-systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The success of GCAP hinges not only on the development of the aircraft itself, but also on avoiding “conspiracies of optimism” and addressing problems collaboratively as they emerge. The challenges and opportunities outlined in this article can inform the GCAP partners in their next steps towards 2035. Effective programme management, including timely decision-making, will be pivotal to realising the vision of the GCAP team.&lt;/p&gt;

This piece outlines five key issues this strategy should address.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most recent U.S. national security supplemental package to Ukraine, passed in April 2024, mandates the administration under President Joe Biden produce a strategy for continued U.S. support of Ukraine against Russian aggression. The strategy must “help Ukraine end the conflict as a democratic, independent, and sovereign country capable of deterring and defending its territory.” This white paper is intended to support the development of such a strategy by defining five key strategic problems: (1) integrating Ukraine into the European economic and transatlantic security order, (2) degrading Russia’s continued ability to bypass sanctions and access capital, (3) combating the resilience of Russian disinformation campaigns, (4) rethinking the arsenal of democracy, and (5) sustaining and strengthening Ukraine’s economy and democracy (Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ice5BPu.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Five Strategic Problems Relevant to U.S. Support for Ukraine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To succeed, the strategy must have bipartisan buy-in and be effectively messaged, both to the congressional committees of jurisdiction as required by statute and to the American people. Absent public support, Russia will win. The Russian regime possesses the key advantage of autocracies: the ability to play the long game, beholden not to the Russian people but rather to its political and military elites. Russian president Vladimir Putin is emboldened by the prospect of waning public support for Ukraine’s fight in the West. Rather than treat this as yet another time-consuming reporting requirement foisted upon overworked officials by Congress, the administration should seize the opportunity to craft a strategy that will lay the foundation for continued support for Ukraine for three to five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;long-wars-require-strategic-vision&quot;&gt;Long Wars Require Strategic Vision&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The optimism that took hold after Ukraine held advancing Russian columns at bay in spring 2023 has given way to the reality of a longer war. The Russo-Ukrainian war is now longer and bloodier than 90 percent of all interstate wars in the last 200 years. Once attritional struggles cross this threshold, they last on average 962 days, or almost three years.[1] And the end is uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long wars have unique dynamics that require more focused planning and resourcing. Strategies for gaining an advantage in attritional campaigns need to follow the allure of battle and beware the myth of quick, decisive victories, which continues to plague most military and political thinking. An informed approach that incorporates lessons from past conflicts is more prudent than assumptions of swift success. Optimistic predictions can create information asymmetries, leading to miscalculations reminiscent of Ponzi schemes that promise rapid and substantial returns on investment but ultimately lose precious capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, stopping Russia in Ukraine requires a shift from the reactive approaches of the past two years to a more proactive strategy. This strategy should anticipate a conflict that may extend for another two to three years and prepare for the most substantial reconstruction effort in Europe since World War II. The plan must include a well-defined theory of victory and a vision for the postwar European security landscape that extends beyond Ukraine’s borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effective strategy begins with a comprehensive assessment of war and the desired outcomes. This analysis identifies key challenges that, if left untreated, will increase the disparity between the current state of conflict and the potential for peace and stability, not only in Europe but globally. It is only by starting with these problems that strategists can visualize and describe opportunities, key trade-offs, and how best to align ways (foreign policy options) and means (resources). As a result, this paper defines the most pressing problems the victory plan must address to ensure victory in Ukraine and a position of advantage in the anticipated post-conflict competition with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategy-starts-with-a-clear-end-state&quot;&gt;Strategy Starts with a Clear End State&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Ukraine, the ideal end state appears clear: (1) restore its sovereign territory (i.e., the 1991 borders), (2) rebuild the country in a manner that promotes deeper Western integration, and (3) hold Russia accountable for war crimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether or not U.S. policymakers agree with this end state, it should serve as the foundation for any U.S. strategy. While the United States has now allocated over $175 billion in support of the war in Ukraine, it is not an American war. Most of the soldiers fighting and dying on the front lines are Ukrainian, not American or European. As such, U.S. policymakers should approach strategy formation with a sense of humility. There is almost certainly an ongoing debate within the Biden administration splitting those who would prefer Ukraine make concessions to avoid further escalation and more hawkish parties who see the fate of the international order at stake on the steppe battlefields in eastern and southern Ukraine. Regardless, a consensus likely exists around the need to support Ukraine in its defense against Russia, but with limits placed on attacks inside Russian territory with U.S. weapons to avoid further escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is unclear whether a coherent and well-coordinated strategy has guided U.S. support for Ukraine thus far. Although commendable for their swift response early in the conflict, Western efforts to maintain support for Ukraine appear ad hoc and less coordinated than optimal. It appears that transatlantic leaders face budget, time, and space constraints to forge a clear, deliberate theory of victory and a long-term plan to achieve it. These constraints have been evident since the start of the war. Reactive crisis management in Washington superseded strategy deliberation and focused on short-term (multi-month) solutions designed to manage escalation risks in lieu of the long-term (multi-year) planning required to ensure Ukraine wins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;For Ukraine, the ideal end state appears clear: (1) restore its sovereign territory (i.e., the 1991 borders), (2) rebuild the country in a manner that promotes deeper Western integration, and (3) hold Russia accountable for war crimes.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A comparison of the efforts to support Ukraine and the Allied planning conferences that predated World War II is revealing. Even before the United States formally entered the war, its top military leaders and strategists were already developing plans to defend Europe and create a new postwar order. There were five major planning conferences over two years before the United States formally entered World War II following the attack on Pearl Harbor. These conferences included core strategic framing documents like the 1940 Plan Dog memorandum prioritizing the European theater and the 1941 Atlantic Charter laying out a vision of postwar Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where are the equivalent documents guiding the current war in Ukraine? The formation of a Ukrainian Contact Group (UCG) and meetings at Ramstein Air Base designed to “help Ukraine win today and build strength for tomorrow” are only the start. The UCG currently lacks a multilaterally connected political framework focused on a long-term competitive strategy extending beyond the immediate necessity of keeping Ukraine on the battlefield. Furthermore, there appears to be a lack of unity of effort, both within individual governments and across the broader transatlantic network of states supporting Ukraine. There are reconstruction envoys and meetings du jour, but none appear backed by an overarching strategy with clear end states, objectives, or resourcing plans that extend beyond the short term. There are discussions about seizing frozen Russian assets, but they appear stuck in a dangerously long deliberation phase. In the end, the West appears to be muddling through and reacting to the latest crisis rather than setting conditions for Ukraine’s victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;crisis-response-is-not-a-strategy&quot;&gt;Crisis Response Is Not a Strategy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At best, crisis response is consequence management. It is firefighting and rushing to contain a burning building as opposed to taking the time to be the fire marshal and think about how to prevent fires and control future burns. Seen in this light, congressional leaders did the right thing by asking the Biden administration for a strategic vision for victory in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, it appears too much energy and political capital have been spent on debating escalation risks and securing immediate weapon stockpiles to keep Ukraine in the fight at the expense of developing a long-term strategy. The war in Gaza further set back long-term strategic thinking as the Biden administration found itself responding to two major theater wars involving multiple rivals while still maintaining sufficient forces to focus on deterrence in the Asia-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This logic of crisis response means weapons have been delivered piecemeal to Ukraine without a clear idea of the flow of resources over time, which directly limits the ability of the Ukrainian military to conduct long-term campaign planning. In June 2023, this tendency was on display when all energy and resources were focused on an unrealistic breakthrough of a triple defensive belt without air superiority. This campaign also did not plan for resources to help reconstitute the Ukrainian military for the next three years. Uncertain flows of aid are at the forefront in an almost endless series of reconstruction conferences that fail to produce binding documents or funding vehicles for an estimated 10-year, $486 billion effort to rebuild a country scarred by large-scale combat operations. These mistakes cannot continue, or they risk letting Russia win. Worse still, they set the stage for future wars in Europe and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;five-strategic-problems&quot;&gt;Five Strategic Problems&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transatlantic alliance has a unique opportunity to develop a long-term strategy for supporting Ukraine and containing Russia. As analysts who have spent time in Ukraine supporting efforts linked to ongoing hostilities, the authors see five core strategic problems that must be addressed as part of the new theory of victory the Biden administration produces in response to the directive in the national security supplemental.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-integrating-ukraine-into-the-european-economic-and-transatlantic-security-order&quot;&gt;1. Integrating Ukraine into the European Economic and Transatlantic Security Order&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way to secure lasting peace in Ukraine is to explore Ukraine’s path to a deeper relationship with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union. By taking steps to join both of these institutions over time, Ukraine will also strengthen its internal democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine applied for EU membership less than a week after Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. In December 2023, the European Council gave Ukraine candidate status and approved the commencement of accession negotiations. This is significant, as current EU members waited an average of 3.5 years from the time of their application to official approval of candidate status. There are 35 areas in which reforms are required to meet the conditions of membership, which range from food safety and justice to freedom and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While not an EU member, the United States should support Ukrainian aspirations to join the European Union by aligning its assistance to expedite the design and implementation of required reforms. The administration’s strategy should propose the key areas of reform, which the United States can play a leading role in supporting, and coordinate with the European Union and other donor countries to ensure complementary efforts. Combating corruption and tackling judicial reform seem to be sensible areas in which U.S. assistance can focus, given substantial support in these sectors to date. Through the supplemental packages, the United States has programmed critical dollars to assist in Ukraine’s efforts to combat corruption by supporting transparency and organizations such as the National Anticorruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) and the Specialized Anticorruption Prosecutor’s Office (SAPO) and by funding financial accountability platforms such as Prozorro and the Digital Restoration Ecosystem for Accountable Management (DREAM). The United States should also double down on investments to support judicial reform, a key requirement for EU membership and a continued challenge for combating corruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The only way to secure lasting peace in Ukraine is to explore Ukraine’s path to a deeper relationship with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the United States should use its diplomatic leverage to ensure the European Union adopts the negotiation framework for Ukraine prior to EU elections in June. Following the elections, Hungary will assume the presidency of the European Council. Given the Hungarian government’s ties with Russia, it is unlikely to make progress on Ukraine’s accession a priority. Even if EU membership for Ukraine is fast-tracked, many experts argue EU expansion will require treaty reform — a complicated and cumbersome process that many nations in the bloc will not be eager to undertake. However, this should not stop the push to ensure Ukraine meets the ambitious reform agenda to secure membership when the time is right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While EU membership would secure Ukraine’s economic future, the protection and durability of Ukraine’s postwar borders will require a multilateral security guarantee. NATO is the most obvious mechanism to provide such a guarantee. Ukrainian aspirations to join NATO predated Russia’s full-scale invasion. Members of the alliance first agreed Ukraine would become a member of NATO at the Bucharest summit in 2008. Those plans were put on pause from 2010 to 2014 when Ukraine adopted a policy of nonalignment under the leadership of pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych. Yanukovych was forced into exile amid pro-democracy protests in February 2014. Putin, sensing a threat to his influence in Ukraine, illegally annexed the Crimean peninsula, setting into motion a reinvigoration of Ukraine’s efforts to join the alliance. In 2017, the Ukrainian parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, adopted legislation confirming NATO membership as a strategic foreign policy and national security objective, which was followed by a corresponding amendment to the constitution. At the last NATO summit in Vilnius, the secretary general reaffirmed the commitment to expedite Ukrainian membership in NATO “when allies agree, and conditions are met.” The secretary general also stated that “unless Ukraine prevails there is no membership to be discussed at all.” These statements have left Ukraine without a clear set of criteria or timeline for NATO membership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next NATO summit is fast approaching. Heads of state, along with high-ranking foreign and defense officials, will convene in Washington, D.C., in early July. This summit will be particularly symbolic as it marks the 75th anniversary of the alliance and will be the first time in over a decade the United States will serve as host. While summits are often performative, the alliance should seize the opportunity to clearly lay out a detailed plan to support Ukraine’s victory and subsequent ascension to NATO even if it takes years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure broader regional security, the administration’s strategy for victory in Ukraine must consider its neighbors — notably, the former Soviet republic of Moldova. While other Ukrainian neighbors including Poland, Slovakia, Romania, and Hungary are in both the European Union and NATO, Moldova is more isolated. It shares a lengthy border with Ukraine and is within striking distance of Russian-occupied Crimea. It is also home to the breakaway province of Transnistria, which houses an unknown number of Russian troops. Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, NATO has continued to strengthen its relationship with Moldova. Building on the country’s 2022 membership application, Moldovans will go to the polls in fall 2024 to vote on a referendum to amend their constitution to state citizens’ desire to join the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To support Ukraine, the U.S. strategy should also support Moldova’s demonstrated desire to align more closely with the European Union and NATO. Russia is actively and openly interfering in Moldova’s presidential elections, slated to occur concurrently with the EU referendum. Should Russia succeed, this could open up yet another vector to destabilize Ukraine and the region. The Biden administration clearly recognizes the importance of Moldova, having channeled nearly $260 million to the nation of just 2.5 million in 2023 alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s neighbor to the north, Belarus, will continue to pose a challenge so long as pro-Russian president Aleksandr Lukashenko remains in power. The administration’s strategy must also contend with how to deal with this reclusive nation, which many view as a proxy state of Putin. However, Belarus experienced mass protests in 2020 signaling popular discontent with the despotic leader. While the charismatic opposition leader in exile, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, captured the attention of the West immediately following her surprise presidential candidacy in August 2020, attention on Belarus has slipped from the consciousness of many policymakers. The West became distracted as new crises emerged and Lukashenko appeared to consolidate power and suppress the opposition. However, to ensure regional stability, the Biden administration must contend not only with Russia but with Belarus as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any strategy for Ukraine must see Kyiv as part of a larger European security order that connects the Black Sea with Central and Eastern Europe. This geopolitical perspective should align programs designed to support civil society groups seeking reform in Belarus, protect Moldova from malign influence as its citizens decide on EU membership, and work with European partners to create optimal security guarantees for frontline states. Failing to take a regional perspective risks a victory in Ukraine becoming a stalemate for Europe as Moscow continues its delusional attempt to rebuild an old empire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-degrading-russias-ability-to-access-capital-and-bypass-sanctions&quot;&gt;2. Degrading Russia’s Ability to Access Capital and Bypass Sanctions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Roman statesman and philosopher Cicero, “Endless money forms the sinews of war.” In the modern world, this includes the ability to access high-tech components needed to make precision weapons. Despite Western sanctions, Moscow retains the ability to earn hard currency through oil exports, often facilitated through unregistered ghost ships and third-party refinery loopholes. In March, Chinese imports of Russian oil reached 2.55 million barrels per day, near the all-time high of 2.56 million barrels per day last June. Russia has displaced Saudi Arabia as China’s top supplier of oil. Based on data compiled by Bloomberg, the value of crude exports from Russia for one week in April reached $2.15 billion. While Asia is the primary destination for Russian crude oil, China is not the only country buying these shipments. India accounts for nearly half of the purchases of Russian oil over the past year. Turkey, a member of NATO, also purchases a substantial amount of Russian oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and allied countries must discern a way to cut off Russia’s cash flows. Pressure should be brought to bear on India and Turkey, in particular, to cease buying Russian oil. However, alternatives must be offered. All options should be on the table, including increasing liquified natural gas exports. In fact, the only way Washington can convince Ukraine to stop striking refinery targets deep inside Russia is by showing Kyiv alternatives for reducing Moscow’s cash flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the transatlantic community needs to develop better mechanisms for limiting Russia’s ability to import the critical electronic components required to expand its arsenal of authoritarianism. Modern precision-strike regimes and battle networks rely on microprocessors and other material inputs to pass targeting data to weapons. Russian military theory — from sixth-generation warfare to strategic operation for the destruction of critically important targets (SODCIT) — calls for using long-range precision fires to break enemy will. As a result, ensuring a steady supply of electronics is critical for Moscow’s war machine. No chips, no precision strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite a wide range of Western sanctions, Moscow can still import the electronic precursors required to replenish its missile stockpiles. As a result, Russian factories are producing over 100 long-range precision ballistic and cruise missiles a month. These weapons force Ukraine to keep air defenses around Kyiv, further changing the air balance. Russia can attack Ukrainian forces along with the front and mass fires at different Ukrainian cities. And it is not just Russia: Iranian weapons supporting Moscow’s war often contain restricted electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and allied countries must discern a way to stop the flow of electronics in addition to creating barriers for future shipments. These efforts will require coordinating intelligence and law enforcement efforts to identify front companies used to facilitate Russia’s imports while also mapping the world of cryptocurrency exchanges used to finance illicit activity. It also necessitates considering new legislation that requires firms to keep better track of their sales, including in secondary markets. Despite U.S. secretary of state Antony Blinken’s recent trip, shaming China will not prove sufficient to stop the flow of weapons precursors fueling Moscow’s war machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-combating-the-resilience-of-russian-disinformation&quot;&gt;3. Combating the Resilience of Russian Disinformation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Old ideas about active measures and reflexive control live on in Putin’s Russia and form the core of cyber-enabled political warfare. Microsoft reported Russian network intrusion efforts in over 100 organizations in more than 40 countries outside Ukraine in the first year of the war, often linked to advanced persistent manipulator teams that specialize in planting false narratives across social media. These efforts persist with new campaigns like Maidan-3, designed to undermine confidence in Ukraine and its Western backers. Kremlin operatives also tried to use better-tailored deepfakes to amplify the civil-military tension in Kyiv over the reported differences between Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky and former top military leader General Valery Zaluzhny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Globally, Russia uses cyberspace to wage what researchers at the Atlantic Council call narrative warfare, designed to erode global confidence in Ukraine. Unlike traditional cyber intrusions, the goal is to either cause chaos or shape public attitudes toward the conflict using computational propaganda — creating fake social media accounts, using bots, and targeting content prompts to unique user groups to change public attitudes. This campaign is especially pronounced outside Europe, where the Kremlin seeks to limit global support for Ukraine. Both the Stanford Internet Observatory and BBC have documented extensive misinformation, disinformation, and malinformation campaigns in Africa designed to bolster support for Russia. These measures include not just cyber operations but more overt influence activities like offering low and no-cost access to RT, a known outlet for Russian propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even more disturbing are emerging — but unverified — reports that Russia is increasingly targeting the U.S. public. In April 2024, Microsoft claimed to have documented a new Russian online influence campaign. Using computational propaganda and traditional inform and influence activities, the campaign targeted both think tanks and the general public with content picked up and circulated by the D.C. Weekly and Miami Chronicle websites. The campaign uses doppelgängers — fake versions of real news websites in major democracies — to promote Kremlin themes and messages and even connect unsuspecting users to websites operated by Russian intelligence. Much of this content focuses not just on divisive issues in the United States but on Ukraine. According to Microsoft, “Messaging regarding Ukraine — via traditional media and social media — picked up steam over the last two months with a mix of covert and overt campaigns from at least 70 Russia-affiliated activity sets we track.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to these campaigns, Putin’s operatives are resurrecting their Soviet playbook to bribe, compromise, and exploit elected officials globally. In March 2024, a broad-reaching Russian influence campaign surfaced after the Czech government sanctioned a news site known as “Voice of Europe,” accused of being part of a pro-Russian propaganda network. In Belgium, Russian operatives paid members of the European Parliament to promote pro-Russian narratives and anti-Ukraine sentiments. The covert influence campaign funneled money to politicians from Germany, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Hungary, often through cryptocurrency exchanges, to influence elections for the European Parliament and reduce support for Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any U.S. strategy for victory in Ukraine must address the ease with which Moscow conducts covert influence campaigns and cyber-enabled information operations to distort discourse in free societies. Stopping Moscow from spreading lies and bribing elected officials should be a priority. Preventing the erosion of trust in democracies must become a central pillar of U.S. grand strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4-rethinking-the-arsenal-of-democracy&quot;&gt;4. Rethinking the Arsenal of Democracy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any U.S. strategy should also include rethinking how the United States builds weapons and supports its partners and allies. While efforts by a global network of democracies to arm Ukraine should be applauded, they cannot be sustained if these nations do not address the dismal state of their respective defense industrial bases. Russia has proved more capable of mobilizing resources than the world’s largest economies. NATO intelligence estimates Russia is producing three million munitions a year — three times more artillery shells than the United States and European Union produce to send to Ukraine. This rate of production is why Moscow is firing up to 10 times as many fire missions along the front line as Ukraine. It is also why Russia is expanding its attacks on Ukrainian critical infrastructure. As new missiles roll off the assembly line, Moscow can match them with imported Western electronics alongside Iranian drones and North Korean ballistic missiles to hold Ukrainian cities hostage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address this disparity, the United States must first move from a “stock” mindset to a “flow” mindset. To date, the focus has been on stockpiles, their location, and the impact of sending certain weapons on the broader inventory. But this stock mindset overlooks the importance of support for foreign partners in terms of the flows of key components through the supply chain to the battlefield. Seeing the problem in terms of flows means not just looking at inventories but asking how to accelerate production by considering everything from material sourcing to how regulatory frameworks limit the ability to build new facilities or work with foreign partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also means seeing networks instead of states. The United States cannot produce enough weapons for Ukraine while maintaining its capacity to address other contingencies, but Europe and the United States together can. Therefore, U.S. efforts should prioritize joint production agreements and accelerate the coordination already underway through the coalition system. That means not just replacing the weapons shipped to Ukraine but also changing the regulatory framework — from environmental policies to investment restrictions — that limits U.S. ability to build weapons with democratic partners and allies overseas. Through the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, the West has put in place international coalitions to supply weapons. Now it needs to change how it builds weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasing the flow of weapons to Ukraine will require a new emphasis on creativity and adaptation. For example, there are alternatives to producing traditional artillery rounds that could make any casting facility capable of helping address the shortage of 155 mm shells. The same applies to additive manufacturing, which can be used to make a diverse range of equipment closer to the front lines. U.S. assistance should incentivize more programs like “FrankenSAM,” which helped Ukraine combine legacy Soviet radars and launchers with NATO surface-to-air missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Ukraine has shown that the future of war resides in the use of multiple classes of networked unmanned systems to hold an adversary off balance. The proliferation of these systems has changed the battlefield. In the early stages of the war, teams of volunteer drone operators and special forces were instrumental in helping delay Russia’s advance on Kyiv. In the latest fighting in Ukraine along the eastern front, first-person-view drones (FPVs) and drone-dropped munitions accounted for around 90 percent of the wounded. Of note, these drones did not exist two years ago, showing the breathtaking speed of battlefield adaptation. According to former Ukrainian commander in chief General Zaluzhny, war has changed and created a new form of combined arms that integrates “radio-electronic environment control . . . [and] a combined operation using attack drones and cyber assets.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States can support this bottom-up military revolution by lowering costs for delivering components to Ukraine and supporting deeper defense integration to avoid duplicative resources and programs that could fall prey to corruption. Much of the battle network used to support Zaluzhny’s new war rests on commercial off-the-shelf hardware and software assembled in creative ways by Ukrainians. Accelerating that process means cutting through International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) restrictions and flooding Ukraine with the component parts it needs to keep producing drones and the battle networks that support them. This effort could include new ways of accelerating nontraditional and new defense entrants in the United States and using Ukraine as a battle lab for programs like the Replicator Initiative. Most important, it means using traditional security cooperation vehicles such as foreign military sales, direct sales, and other authorities to support indigenous efforts like Ukraine’s army of drones, a call to produce 1 million FPVs, and the creation of entirely new branches of service dedicated to the changing character of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;5-sustaining-ukraines-economy-and-strengthening-its-democracy&quot;&gt;5. Sustaining Ukraine’s Economy and Strengthening Its Democracy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the $175 billion appropriated to support Ukraine’s defense, over half has been dedicated to military support. A relatively small portion, nearly $31 billion, has gone to provide direct budget support (DBS) to the Ukrainian government to ensure it can fulfill basic obligations, such as paying teachers and healthcare workers. Such assistance is critical, as Ukraine is currently spending nearly 60 percent of its revenues, including foreign assistance, on defense. By comparison, the United States spent 12 percent of revenues on defense in fiscal year 2022. Sending military support to Ukraine will do little good if the United States stands by and allows the Ukrainian economy and state infrastructure to collapse. However, lawmakers have expressed wariness about economic assistance, as evinced by the 154 members of the House who voted in favor of an amendment to strike all nonmilitary assistance to Ukraine from the latest supplemental package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration’s strategy must contend with how to use limited resources to support the continued functioning of the Ukrainian economy. The economy has fared remarkably well under the circumstances. The International Monetary Fund projects a 3.2 percent increase in Ukrainian gross domestic product in 2024. To maintain the tax base needed to fund an active war, a robust economy is crucial. The ability to export goods to the international market, combat corruption, and enhance foreign investment are key to ensuring continued economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s gains in the Black Sea have been critical in this respect. While Ukrainian grain exports via the Black Sea have not reached the levels from before the full-scale Russian invasion, progress continues. In March 2024, 5.2 million tons of grain and maize were sent abroad compared to an average 6.5 million tons a month prior to February 2022. Securing Ukraine’s ability to export goods is a key area in which security and economic goals are inextricably linked. Of the five major Black Sea ports operational prior to the full-scale invasion, only three remain operational, and these have come under increased attack. Enhanced air defenses will protect not only Ukrainian civilians but also their livelihoods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, Ukraine has made significant progress in combating corruption despite simultaneously grappling with an active conflict within its borders. In 2015, Ukraine established NABU and SAPO. In 2023, NABU issued 238 official accusations and SAPO issued 100 indictments for charges of corruption, up from 131 and 56, respectively, in 2022. High-profile officials, including most recently the minister of agriculture, have been implicated. This demonstrates not an increase in corruption but a determination by the government to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse. Indeed, scores of public perceptions of corruption by Transparency International show a 10-point improvement over the past 10 years. U.S. support is critical to ensuring the government continues to make progress on reforms, which is key to increasing much-needed foreign investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasing foreign investment in Ukraine will not only help the economy during wartime but also ensure speedy recovery and reconstruction following the conclusion of the war. Presently, obtaining war insurance remains a major barrier for U.S. firms seeking to enter the Ukrainian market. Given the risks, financing remains scant for those who seek to do business in Ukraine. Proposals to confront these challenges include more nuanced risk mapping of the country by the State Department and the creation of a U.S. government–backed risk pool for businesses using interest from frozen Russian assets. As such, the administration’s strategy document should lay out steps to increase U.S. investment. Late in 2023, the Biden administration appointed former commerce secretary Penny Pritzker as the U.S. special representative for Ukraine’s economic recovery and gave her the mandate to accelerate Ukraine’s economic transformation. This position should be leveraged to develop strategies to confront these challenges in the congressionally mandated strategy document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A U.S. strategy should confront the oft-cited obstacles to increased private investment: rule of law, corruption, and political instability. These sectors are key not just to economic prosperity but also to the consolidation of democracy in Ukraine. In spite of the war, Ukraine is making great strides in these areas, bolstered by the quest to ensure long-term economic security through ascension to the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need for a U.S. strategy is urgent as Ukrainians are preparing for an anticipated Russian offensive this summer. The threat Putin’s despotic regime poses to the West has already crystallized in the string of recent arrests of Russian agents plotting violent acts of sabotage across Western Europe. The reality of the situation is that Ukraine will need further financial support beyond the most recent supplemental for continued defense and reconstruction activities. The strategy should be candid in this assessment while making clear the alternative — sending U.S. troops to Europe if Russia is not stopped in Ukraine — would be far more costly in blood and treasure. A one-time Ukraine skeptic, House speaker Mike Johnson stated: “To put it bluntly, I would rather send bullets to Ukraine than American boys.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the Biden administration is charged with writing the strategy, this is a task the administration and Congress must own jointly. In the days and weeks prior to the most recent vote on Ukraine assistance, Russian-linked media and online accounts sought to amplify narratives about the crisis on the U.S. southern border. By doing this, they aimed to embolden the argument that the United States should not spend money defending Ukraine’s borders but focus resources on its own borders. Russia capitalized on a similar narrative following the tragic wildfires in Hawaii in fall 2023 that suggested the United States was spending taxpayer dollars in Ukraine at the expense of disaster recovery at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These narratives have proved salient. Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Mike Turner stated, “We see directly coming from Russia . . . communications that are anti-Ukraine and pro-Russia messages, some of which we even hear being uttered on the House floor.” House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Michael McCaul noted that Russian propaganda has “infected a good chunk of my party’s base.” The U.S. public remains divided on Ukraine aid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The administration undoubtedly needs a strategy to communicate why supporting Ukraine is in the national security interest of the United States. Following the Russian invasion on February 24, 2022, President Biden did not address the nation on the importance of Ukraine until October 2023. However, members of Congress also bear this responsibility, as they are closer to their constituents and better positioned to make the case as to why Ukraine should matter to Americans living in places like Lima, Ohio, or Fort Worth, Texas. The 311 members of the House and 79 members of the Senate who voted in favor of the most recent national security supplemental package should go on the offensive and explain their support to their constituents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine requires more than U.S. financial and military assistance; it requires political leadership and courage. If Ukraine is to win the war against Russia, the most recent assistance package cannot be the last that Congress passes.&lt;/p&gt;

The countries that are able to secure their own supply chains for critical technologies will be in a position to write the rules of global economic governance for years to come.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-coming-chip-wars&quot;&gt;The Coming Chip Wars&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critical minerals are behind every modern technology, from the latest developments in commercial electronics to the strategic defense equipment required for national security; leading-node semiconductors require over 300 materials, presenting multiple vulnerabilities for adversaries to manipulate their supply. Given that these minerals are indispensable for semiconductors (and the equipment to manufacture them), countries are now more attentive to the necessity of shifting away from trade models that create dependency on strategic competitors. Instead, the United States has pursued a strategy of “friend-shoring” or “ally-shoring,” shifting production to friendlier nations with shared values that are less likely to wield trade as a weapon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s state-sponsored industrial policies, financing, and tax incentives have led to considerable political leverage worldwide over the raw materials required for semiconductor manufacturing; the country has positioned itself as the dominant supplier of raw material inputs for cutting-edge technology. Supply chains are fragile, especially for an industry characterized by its complexity, high-level expertise, and specialized manufacturing chains that cross international borders several times and depend on inputs from multiple private businesses and trusted suppliers. Self-sufficiency in the semiconductor industry is impractical and highly unlikely, but it is possible and desirable to diminish risks and increase resiliency. U.S. allies in the Western Hemisphere are crucial for this undertaking, and the United States should look at all segments of the value chain for the region, not just at assembly, testing, and packaging (ATP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reliance-on-china-as-a-strategic-vulnerability&quot;&gt;Reliance on China as a Strategic Vulnerability&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The semiconductor industry is expected to be worth $1 trillion annually by 2030. Increased demand for semiconductors, especially those at the cutting edge of advanced design and capability, will require greater quantities and new varieties of minerals and metals of all types. China’s concentration — bordering on monopoly — of supply and production of critical minerals creates a vulnerability, leaving the industry exposed to supply chain disruptions. The International Energy Agency claims that China maintains 60 percent of the world’s rare earth mining production and approximately 90 percent of processing and refining. The West’s reliance on China’s minerals poses worrisome risks of supply shocks and China exercising its leverage over prices. A secure supply of critical minerals for the semiconductor industry is not only necessary for the private sector but also a concern for national security and defense; since 2020, the United States has recognized it has no domestic production of 14 of the minerals on the critical minerals list and is “completely dependent on imports to supply its demand.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A detailed understanding of the risks associated with each material involved in semiconductor production is crucial to appreciating and measuring vulnerability. Dependence on China varies considerably for each critical mineral. Moreover, vulnerability should not be calculated merely by possible manipulations of supply but rather by the mineral’s sensitivity to price shifts; the availability of stockpiles, alternative suppliers, and substitute materials; and how quickly alternative production could be brought online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-actions&quot;&gt;China’s Actions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is highly reliant on chip imports from its geopolitical rivals to drive its domestic design and production. Aware of this vulnerability in its tech sector, the PRC has pursued policies to become more self-reliant in the semiconductor industry. In part, this national effort is spurred by the “information innovation” project, launched in 2016 and expanded significantly in 2022, and aims to reduce dependence on technology suppliers from abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2014, the PRC released a policy addressing semiconductors as a core technology. The “Guidelines to Promote National Integrated Circuit Industry Development” indicate “the goal of establishing a world-leading semiconductor industry in all areas of the integrated circuit supply chain by 2030.” As a stated objective, the strategy includes meeting 70 percent of the PRC’s semiconductor demand through domestic production by 2025. In response to U.S. efforts to build a multinational coalition to restrict its access to advanced semiconductor manufacturing technology, China increased its imports of lithography machines used to imprint circuits in silicon wafers by 450 percent in December 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responding to new U.S. export controls on chip manufacturing technology in October 2022 and additional controls in October 2023, the PRC has also increased subsidies to boost the domestic semiconductor industry — totaling an estimated $150 billion in the past decade. In March 2023, Huawei and the Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) spearheaded a technology initiative that managed to produce new chips “at the advanced 7-nanometer (nm) technology node” for the Mate60 Pro smartphone; SMIC, a partially state-owned company, is allegedly capable of creating 5 nm chips, though likely not yet at industrial scale. This has raised questions in the U.S. government about the effectiveness of technology export controls since China has nevertheless advanced in the semiconductor industry. For example, Beijing has prioritized “tool and material production lines free of Western inputs” and new approaches to lay out public-private collaboration to enhance innovation, mostly in advanced lithography technology. Yet despite the narrowing gap in technological advancement, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) continues to outpace its PRC competitors and rivals, as it has been producing 3 nm chips at industrial scale since 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, again as a direct response to U.S. export controls, the PRC has leveraged its dominance in the early stages of supply chains to restrict exports of gallium, germanium, and graphite, which are essential to high-performance chips. In July 2023, alleging national security concerns, China announced the restrictions, which took the form of licensing requirements that mandate exporters first apply for permission from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce. Rather than outright banning exports, China would therefore be able to selectively increase or decrease the flow of gallium and germanium to world markets. While gallium exports remain at historic lows, the PRC has seemingly not sought to choke off U.S. access to the metal completely, taking a “presumption of approval” approach to licensing exports. However, concerns persist that this could rapidly switch to a “presumption of denial” for gallium and a host of other minerals and technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-united-states-responds&quot;&gt;The United States Responds&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September 2020, the Trump administration recognized in an executive order that “America cannot be dependent on imports from foreign adversaries for the critical minerals that are increasingly necessary to maintain our economic and military strength in the 21st century.” The United States has further recognized the supply chain vulnerabilities and geopolitical risks of its dependence on China for critical minerals, with the Biden administration clamping down on China’s access to advanced chip technology and imposing export restrictions intended to flag its military advancement. Part of this acknowledgment was spearheaded by the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, signed into law by President Joe Biden that August and designed to boost U.S. investment and development. Two months later, the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) imposed trade restrictions to cap China’s access to the most advanced semiconductors by limiting access to design capability and manufacturing, blocking expert assistance, scrutinizing investments, or narrowing licensing. The restrictions were “substantially tightened” in October 2023 with measures such as preventing circumvention efforts through subsidiary companies, adding items to the list of manufacturing equipment for chips, or blacklisting companies “to which the export of certain technology is prohibited.” Most recently, the Department of Commerce revoked the licenses that major U.S. chipmakers Intel and Qualcomm relied upon to export semiconductors to Huawei. Establishing export controls to halt the advance of Chinese technology companies is a tactic intended to work in tandem with the stimulus of domestic manufacturing and nearshoring. Alongside the CHIPS and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) sought to catalyze a reorientation of mineral supply chains away from China and toward the United States and other like-minded countries in the Western Hemisphere through tax credits and subsidies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another policy to address the United States’ unsustainable vulnerability is the entry into force of the Minerals Security Partnership, a strategic, U.S.-led alliance that endeavors to diversify the sources of mineral supply. The interconnectedness of semiconductor supply chains has emphasized that the partnership is not comprehensive enough, especially because it does not include “key mineral producers” in the Western Hemisphere such as Argentina and Brazil. Reducing risks in supply chains is challenging, and regulatory and practical obstacles exist among Western allies. For example, just in the United States, the challenge of U.S. higher labor costs vis-à-vis competitors is one of the barriers to relocating industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/DSmjzSp.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;surveying-the-bottlenecks-and-defining-disruption-potential&quot;&gt;Surveying the Bottlenecks and Defining “Disruption Potential”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While China’s dominance over critical mineral supply chains has prompted concern from several corners of the U.S. government and private sector, understanding the nature of the threat is not entirely straightforward. Wielding coercive power through export restrictions, even when those exports are going toward an industry as globally important as semiconductors, is no easy task. Export restrictions are a blunt tool, and both governments and companies are more likely to adapt than cave to political pressures, at least if adaptation is possible in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case of neon gas is especially instructive in this regard. Used as a buffer in the lasers responsible for the deep- and extreme-ultraviolet lithography responsible for advanced chipmaking, the neon industry was highly concentrated in Russia and Ukraine until recently. Moscow’s full-scale invasion in February 2022 brought neon production in both countries to a crawl, cutting off as much as 40–50 percent of global supply. Neon gas prices subsequently surged, alongside those of other rare gases such as xenon and krypton, which also depended heavily on Ukrainian and Russian sources. Notably, however, this did not bring about a significant market distortion in the semiconductor industry, where major producers were able to employ existing reserves and adapt their lithography processes to use less neon. Just a year later, neon prices had practically returned to their prewar levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the neon shortage was an unintentional consequence of Russia’s revisionist foreign policy, even premeditated attempts to deploy critical minerals as a weapon in geopolitical competition can backfire on their wielders. One CSIS study found that in many cases, China’s attempts at economic coercion have proven counterproductive to Beijing’s strategic aims. In 2010, after a Chinese fishing vessel collided with the Japanese coast guard off the disputed Senkaku Islands, the PRC halted rare earth element (REE) exports to Japan. In response, the Japanese government created a budget of $1.2 billion devoted to mitigating its dependence on Chinese REEs. This fund supported investment in the use of alternative materials, recycling and stockpiling of REEs, and acquiring a stake in REE mines in friendly countries such as Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Past success at thwarting China’s economic coercion does not mean the United States and its allies should be cavalier about the ability to adapt should China’s posture change from its current presumption of approval to a presumption of denial for exporting critical minerals. To the contrary, governments and chip manufacturers need to use a more fine-grained approach when surveying vulnerabilities in their mineral supply chains. Rather than looking at market dominance alone, “disruption potential” serves as a more promising standard. This framework was originally used by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to synthesize the United States’ dependency on imports for a particular mineral and the estimated economic value that mineral provides. Applied to semiconductor manufacturing, inputs with the highest disruption potential are defined as those for which supply is highly concentrated in China and for which there are few to no readily available substitutes or alternative suppliers. The subsequent section evaluates five materials according to this definition of disruption potential: gallium, germanium, fluorine, arsenic, and copper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This list is illustrative, not comprehensive. It encompasses elements that are common to virtually all semiconductors, such as fluorine and copper, as well as those needed for specialty chips. Gallium, germanium, and arsenic in particular are widespread among the semiconductors serving national defense functions, including missile defense radars, high-frequency radio, and satellite communications. However, a more fulsome accounting is necessary to map the expansive supply chain for semiconductor minerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Azxu6vk.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;gallium&quot;&gt;Gallium&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the most well-known semiconductor minerals, second only to silicon, gallium has been the topic of extensive coverage following China’s announcement of export controls in August 2023. Gallium wafers are used in lieu of silicon for “wide-bandgap” semiconductors, characterized by their resistance to high temperatures and ability to handle higher voltages and frequencies. Wide-bandgap semiconductors are especially sought after for defense applications (their size and efficiency being key to modern radars), telecommunications (especially 5G networks), and electric vehicles. Demand for gallium nitride (GaN) for the most advanced commercially available gallium-based semiconductors is projected to grow approximately 25 percent on average over the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gallium supply is overwhelmingly concentrated in China’s hands, with 98 percent of unprocessed gallium and 86 percent of total gallium coming from the PRC in 2022. China’s control over gallium is emblematic of Beijing’s broader critical minerals strategy, which seeks to dominate the midstream processing and refining stages of production. Raw gallium is a byproduct of bauxite processing, the primary ore for producing aluminum, of which China accounts for nearly 60 percent of global supply. Thus, while China has less than half the bauxite reserves of Brazil, and less than one-fifth of those of Australia, its willingness to shoulder the environmental externalities that come with mineral processing has provided an unexpected geopolitical edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disruption Potential: High&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gallium has the highest disruption potential of any semiconductor material. Finding alternative sources is dependent upon access to not only bauxite but also smelters capable of recovering gallium from aluminum production. The United States has just four primary aluminum smelters still in operation, while most smelters in Brazil, a country with sizeable reserves, have shuttered their production, unable to compete with China. Disruption potential is exacerbated by the fact that China has dramatically increased investment into its domestic semiconductor industry to advance GaN-based chip production. If the PRC succeeds in taking the lead in advanced semiconductor production using gallium-based chips, it will be able to restrict U.S. access to cutting-edge technology on two fronts, first in the finished products themselves and second in the raw materials needed to produce them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Substitutes for gallium in wide-bandgap semiconductors do exist, notably in the form of silicon carbide (SiC). However, these chips have different performance characteristics, and the near ubiquity of GaN semiconductors in certain sectors (especially defense technologies) would pose a major logistical challenge to merely replacing these chips with ones made from another material. China’s export controls have already made an impact in this regard, with the price of gallium metal more than doubling since July 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/c2utXbJ.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;germanium&quot;&gt;Germanium&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like gallium, germanium wafers can be used as substitutes for silicon in semiconductor technology. Germanium, too, boasts greater thermal resistance, making germanium-based chips suitable for high-performance electronics. Germanium is viewed as a possible solution to the ever-growing desire for smaller and smaller semiconductors. As a material, it boasts significantly higher electron mobility than silicon, allowing devices to wring greater power out of a chip of the same size. Germanium is already used in minute amounts as part of silicon chips to help improve electron mobility, and as the chip industry searches for new avenues to meet the future requirements for increased processing power, its prominence could rise substantially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Germanium is produced either as a byproduct of coal or from zinc production, with China dominating the latter as the source of roughly 65 percent of germanium worldwide. At present, the global germanium market is miniscule, with USGS estimates recording just 140 metric tons of primary production in 2021. By comparison, primary production of gallium was more than three times larger during the same period. Of this relatively small total production, much of this is used for applications such as infrared imaging and fiber optics, with only a small percentage going toward semiconductors. The marginal size of the semiconductor-grade germanium market, coupled with China’s considerable zinc-refining industry, means the PRC is likely sitting on an overproduction of germanium, allowing it to keep prices for the mineral artificially low while maintaining comfortable reserves of its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disruption Potential: Moderate to High&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Germanium occupies a niche but important role in the modern semiconductor industry. Disruption to supply would create problems for certain specialized chips that could potentially reverberate throughout the wider market. While supply is less concentrated in China than in the case of gallium, with important germanium producers located in Canada, low prices mean smelters have little incentive to increase their production. The lack of transparency into China’s minerals sector has generated consternation over Beijing’s ability to flood the market and outprice competitors, a relatively easy feat given the small market size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, while other producers of germanium are available, most do not currently have the capacity to meet the full market demand and have little incentive to build excess capacity so long as prices remain low. If germanium rises in importance for future advanced chips, the risk posed by China’s position in the market will grow. Furthermore, should China pursue a strategy of bundling export restrictions on semiconductor minerals, such as cutting off both gallium and germanium at once, the combined economic impact may be felt more acutely, as chipmakers will have fewer substitutes to turn toward for high-performance materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;fluorine&quot;&gt;Fluorine&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fluorine differs from the other materials considered here in that it does not make up a part of the final chip but is instead an essential input into the chip manufacturing process. Hydrogen fluoride (HF), produced through mining fluorite (also known as fluorspar), is essential both in the etching process for semiconductors and for removing impurities from the final chip. HF is especially valuable for its ability to dissolve the silicon wafer that comprises much of the semiconductor with the required precision to complete the electrical interconnections that allow the chip to function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for the United States, the world’s largest fluorspar mine is located in San Luis Potosí, Mexico, creating a strong proximity and trade advantage — including eligibility for IRA tax credits — while ensuring adequate supply to meet semiconductor demand. However, China retains a preeminent position both in mining raw fluorspar and producing HF. It is the source of approximately 63 percent of global fluorspar, with many semiconductor manufacturers throughout East Asia relying on Beijing for a sizeable portion of their supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disruption Potential: Moderate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If HF access were significantly constrained, there are few readily available substitutes that would be economical to use in semiconductor manufacturing, potentially snarling production timelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, HF supply chains have already been the subject of geopolitical contention. In 2019, Japan restricted exports of HF to South Korea in retaliation for a Korean court order seeking reparations from Japanese companies found to have engaged in forced labor during World War II. These export controls did not significantly affect the Korean semiconductor industry, which supplanted Japanese HF with domestic production and, more significantly, diversified its import sources. The downsides to both policy measures, however, were a significant uptick in South Korea’s dependence on China for HF. Furthermore, experts raised concerns regarding the relative quality of South Korea’s domestic HF vis-à-vis international suppliers. This episode is instructive for two reasons. First, it highlights the potential resiliency of semiconductor supply chains, at least provided substitute sources exist and can be integrated effectively into fabrication processes. Second, concerns over the quality of South Korean HF underscore the semiconductor industry’s risk aversion to “unvetted” suppliers and preference for dealing with well-established vendors in the chips sector — an important barrier to bringing supply back online quickly in the event of a disruption. Notably, South Korean HF exports remain low outside of China and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;arsenic&quot;&gt;Arsenic&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High-purity arsenic metal is primarily used in conjunction with gallium to produce gallium arsenide (GaA) wafers. The technology to produce these wafers can trace its origins to U.S. defense industrial production in the 1970s. Today, GaA wafers have been eclipsed in certain regards by true wide-bandgap semiconductors such as GaN-based ones but nevertheless remain a popular choice for many industries, with demand projected to grow over the coming years. Indeed, the vast majority of U.S. gallium imports come in the form of GaA wafers, whose higher radiation and temperature resistance has seen these chips used for a range of specialized applications from defense to telecommunications. GaA semiconductors are especially useful in LEDs, a sector which is forecast to drive demand through 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arsenic is also used for “doping” silicon — introducing arsenic atoms to the pure silicon to grant the resulting material unique, electrically conductive properties. While arsenic is a plentiful element, it is typically created as a byproduct of extracting and processing copper and gold. The high toxicity of arsenic to humans means these byproducts have little commercial use without the requisite facilities to safely handle and process arsenic metal, an undertaking in which few countries or companies have the desire to invest. Indeed, major copper and gold producers in the Western Hemisphere such as Chile and Peru have seen widespread outcry over arsenic contamination of water and soil as a consequence of their mining activities. China, however, has successfully built up a robust arsenic industry and in 2022 accounted for 95 percent of all U.S. arsenic metal imports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disruption Potential: Moderate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rising popularity of GaN for defense industrial purposes has limited the national security relevance of GaA. However, any restriction on Chinese arsenic exports could be paired with restrictions on gallium, a move that would have substantial ramifications for U.S. and allied chip supplies. The greatest disruption potential arises from the use of arsenic for doping purposes, since the atomic makeup of arsenic allows it to influence the properties of semiconductors in unique ways, with few available substitutes. Nevertheless, arsenic is plentiful enough as a resource, and Japan in particular possesses substantial technical know-how to produce high-purity arsenic metal, meaning markets could likely react to a loss of Chinese supply in time to avert major market distortions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;copper&quot;&gt;Copper&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copper is the industry standard for semiconductor interconnects, the microscopic wires responsible for connecting billions of transistors into the single integrated circuit that forms the backbone of modern computing power. Copper’s conductivity and flexibility make it ideally suited for this role. Indeed, when the first integrated circuit manufactured using copper was unveiled in 1997, it was estimated that this change alone helped increase microprocessor speeds by as much as 15 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copper’s importance in electrical applications extends well beyond the semiconductor industry. Demand for copper is predicted to skyrocket by 2050, driven most notably by the energy transition. According to some estimates, achieving net-zero emissions targets will require as much new copper as humanity has produced in all recorded history. Of this massive increase in copper demand, semiconductors will consume a fractional amount. Still, given the vital role the metal plays in modern chips, it remains important to account for possible vulnerabilities in the copper supply chain. Here China again dominates the midstream, and while the PRC’s copper reserves pale in comparison to those of mining powerhouses such as Chile and Peru, China’s dominance in refining and processing means these countries often ship their raw copper outputs across the Pacific to be converted into a workable final state. This allows China to punch well above its weight in global copper supply chains and, critically, keeps copper-rich countries from progressing further into value-added industries such as advanced refining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disruption Potential: Low&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copper is unlikely to present a bottleneck for semiconductor manufacturing. The sheer size of the copper market means that for China to meaningfully restrict access to copper for semiconductors, it would need to virtually cease all its copper exports. Meanwhile, chip manufacturers would likely be able to adapt swiftly either by procuring copper from alternative refinery countries or exploring substitution with other minerals. Finally, copper’s recyclability means much of a demand shortfall could be compensated by simply reclaiming materials from old chips. Accordingly, any move to restrict copper supply by China would likely deal far more damage to China than it would to U.S. and allied semiconductor production. For now, copper does not feature on the official critical minerals list — the subject of substantial debate — but a move by China to restrict exports would earn copper a spot on the list rather quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/BWJtIfs.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The complexity of modern chips and the ever-evolving chemistry of cutting-edge semiconductor manufacturing mean that a truly dizzying array of inputs are employed at every stage of production. The disruption potential analysis is encouraging, however, insofar as it demonstrates the surprising resiliency of many of these mineral supply chains. Apart from gallium and germanium, most mineral supplies have either moderate or low disruption potential. Nevertheless, supply chains for the minerals examined have a strong nexus in the PRC, granting China considerable freedom to manipulate its export controls across a range of material inputs, scaling up or down in accordance with its objectives. Building resiliency into semiconductor supply chains will require tapping into new networks of U.S. allies. In this respect, the Western Hemisphere plays an important but often overlooked role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bringing-in-the-western-hemisphere&quot;&gt;Bringing In the Western Hemisphere&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Western Hemisphere’s role in meeting future demand for critical minerals is increasingly evident. From copper and lithium to significant REE deposits, the region will be vital in fueling the energy transition and supplying the inputs for new technologies. Notably, it has the latent potential to supply all five of the mineral inputs discussed above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hemisphere’s bauxite reserves are far larger than China’s. Brazil is the world’s fourth-largest producer of bauxite; Jamaica, with an estimated 2 billion metric tons of high-quality bauxite reserves, has seen its industry grow dramatically in recent years, becoming the seventh-largest producer in 2022. The challenge in this case is not one of production but of developing the requisite processing capacity to recover gallium within the Western Hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/DsIP3YO.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of China, Canada and Mexico are among the largest producers of germanium and fluorspar, respectively. Teck Resources is already engaged in germanium recovery from its smelting operations in British Columbia, while the Las Cuevas mine in Mexico singlehandedly generates 18 percent of the world’s fluorspar production. Firms in both countries benefit from close trade integration with the United States through the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), making them natural candidates for strengthening semiconductor-critical mineral supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peru and Chile together account for over a third of total copper production. These copper deposits are often situated near large quantities of arsenic, with Peru in particular identified by the USGS as the largest producer of arsenic trioxide in the world. While neither country possesses the capability at present to produce high-purity arsenic, developing a safe and robust arsenic industry could not only benefit supply chain security but also alleviate some of the environmental hazards associated with copper production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, beyond the resources listed above, the hemisphere’s mineral wealth encompasses a host of other semiconductor-critical inputs. For instance, Brazil possesses an estimated 22 percent of graphite reserves and 17 percent of global REE reserves, both of which are key inputs for chipmaking equipment, including high-purity graphite crucibles and specialized lithography lasers. Brazil’s potential in this space remains locked behind a lack of both new mining and investment in advanced refining needed to process minerals to the required degree of purity. As advances in chip design unlock new processes and manufacturing requirements, it is difficult to predict which materials may come into vogue for the next generation of semiconductors. For this reason, ensuring that like-minded countries maintain the expertise and technical capacity to recover the necessary inputs will be critical for the United States to maintain its qualitative edge in advanced semiconductor design and construction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the hemisphere, the question of semiconductor mineral supplies is one of processing and refining. Gallium, germanium, and arsenic are all generated as byproducts from processing other minerals, while the relatively small quantities used to manufacture chips means it does not require substantial production in absolute terms to make a major impact on the ecosystem. Bolstering refinery capacity may also allow resource-rich countries to climb higher on the value chain by exporting high-purity minerals as opposed to raw outputs destined for Chinese refineries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;obstacles-persist&quot;&gt;Obstacles Persist&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greater supply chain resiliency implies and presupposes two converging interests: an intention to reduce risks for the incoming company and a positive outcome or gain for the receiving country. These two conditions do not necessarily always meet. Given the complexity of social and political dynamics in the region, countries in the Western Hemisphere epitomize this challenge. Although the hemisphere has the potential to serve as an alternative to China and reduce certain risks in semiconductor supply chains, especially in related mining and processing, stakeholders should anticipate some resistance and backlash from local communities and political authorities. In short, increasing mineral production and processing will be no easy feat for a region looking to shed a legacy of commodity dependence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The region certainly embodies an opportunity to mitigate risk — but the benefits countries can obtain from greater supply chain security need to be communicated better. Other benefits include opportunities for workforce training and development, foreign direct investment, addressing inequality in certain areas, increasing tax revenue, reducing irregular migration, and growing local economies. An expanded role for the Western Hemisphere cannot be separated from an effective communication strategy that constantly promotes a dialogue between businesses and impacted communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various political movements in the Western Hemisphere have historically identified themselves as obstacles to “extractivism,” representing strong political backlash. These cultural and ideological barriers persist within the hemisphere’s political environment and should be taken into consideration. The resistance to exporting raw materials in many regional countries has, on more than one occasion, underpinned the nationalization of strategic sectors of the economy because “higher prices for commodities favor resource nationalism.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to these ideological and political obstacles, the mining sector and the redrawing of supply chains have generated concern about local environmental impacts. These industries are not only highly polluting, they also require large amounts of other resources such as water and electricity. In many instances, considerable improvements have been implemented in recent years to address these ecological considerations and Indigenous people’s rights. However, countries with low environmental standards might have a comparative advantage in the short term: the inability of the Western Hemisphere to shoulder the environmental externalities assists not only China but any other countries willing to accept the pollution and associated costs with mineral processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the Western Hemisphere may not be ready yet to alleviate existing chokepoints, it can help address the current challenge. Due to its rich mineral reserves and highly skilled workforce, the region is of utmost importance for any successful de-risking strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;policy-recommendations&quot;&gt;Policy Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rerouting mineral supply chains for semiconductors will not happen overnight. Fortunately, China’s announcement of export restrictions has provided an early warning of the need to move quickly — but without significantly curtailing access to the necessary mineral inputs. A future U.S. strategy should emphasize multilateral coordination to friend-shore processing capacity, substitute critical mineral suppliers, stockpile for both defense and economic security needs, and survey for new and untapped sources of semiconductor-critical minerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Processing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s privileged position in the semiconductor minerals supply chain is due not to its innate resource wealth but to its dominance in the realm of smelting, refining, and processing. Bringing processing capabilities back to the Western Hemisphere therefore promises not only to help counteract China’s influence over semiconductor supply chains but also to allow Latin American countries to advance in the value-added manufacturing space. Whereas countries such as Chile, Peru, and Brazil currently export much of their raw minerals to China for further processing, building up the domestic refinery capabilities in these countries would allow them to export finished materials. In areas such as high-purity arsenic production, it could even allow countries to break into otherwise-untapped new sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encouraging training and knowledge transfer on high-purity refining for semiconductor manufacturing could be one underappreciated element of the U.S. Department of State’s International Technology Security and Innovation (ITSI) Fund. This agreement has focused primarily on workforce development to make the most of limited available funds. Improving knowledge of mineral processing could therefore be a natural extension of ongoing projects that would find purchase in ISTI partner countries such as the Dominican Republic, which already has a robust mining industry. Upscaling mineral processing also goes hand-in-hand with incentives laid out by the IRA, which prioritizes critical minerals originating in countries with free trade agreements (FTAs) with the United States, a category that includes a dozen Western Hemisphere nations. Extending IRA tax credits to include microelectronics produced using minerals from FTA countries could send a powerful signal to further encourage supply chain reorientation for these critical technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should prioritize existing smelting and refining infrastructure, both domestically and in partner countries. It is far easier to upgrade and expand infrastructure than to build new facilities from scratch. Nevertheless, as recently as January 2024 one of the five remaining aluminum smelters in the United States shuttered its Missouri facility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Substituting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two avenues for substituting Chinese-sourced critical minerals. First, the United States and chip manufacturers can look into alternative materials that can fulfill similar requirements in semiconductor design but are not so heavily controlled by the PRC. Encouraging research and development into potential alternatives could present another impactful deployment of ITSI funds with a salutary effect on supply chain security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the United States should seek to identify and connect alternative suppliers with chipmakers who can substitute in for Chinese sources. This latter dimension is perhaps even more critical, as the chip industry’s winner-take-all environment means manufacturers tend to build relationships with just a handful of highly specialized vendors and are strongly risk-averse to new supply sources. According to one analysis, just five companies account for 99 percent of the profits from semiconductor manufacturing equipment sales. The United States can spearhead an international effort to identify, vet, and connect alternative suppliers to semiconductor manufacturers in an effort to subvert this tendency toward market concentration. Within the Western Hemisphere, the U.S. Department of Commerce, in conjunction with embassies throughout the region, can lead delegations from the semiconductor industry to materials suppliers. Bringing vendors and manufacturers closer together can help reassure the latter of the quality and benefits to be gained from diversifying their supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Stockpiling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Defense Stockpile (NDS) previously served as a contingency against potential disruptions to the flow of minerals needed for U.S. defense production. However, following the end of the Cold War, this stockpile has withered to a shadow of its former self. In 1989, the material in the NDS was worth an estimated $9.6 billion (more than $24 billion once adjusted for inflation). Today, it is just under $1 billion. Furthermore, semiconductor-critical minerals such as gallium are not included in the list of materials under management. Scaling up the NDS will be critical for U.S. security as a whole and especially for improving the resiliency of the semiconductor industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to building up national reserves such as the NDS, the United States should encourage semiconductor companies to maintain their own stockpiles. This would ease the reverberations of unexpected disruptions in the materials market and give breathing space for supply chains to reorient. The United States can also provide financial incentives for companies to increase their own stockpiles, such as by offering tax credits on the value of excess minerals purchased but not consumed in a given production year. There may even be potential for the U.S. government to offer to buy excess minerals supply from semiconductor manufacturers to contribute to a revitalized National Defense Stockpile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Surveying&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identifying new sources of minerals for semiconductors demands continued focus. In the Western Hemisphere, countries are investing growing sums to better understand the potential resources beneath their feet, a push that has led to impressive discoveries in both North and South America. This includes one of the world’s largest lithium deposits in the world in the U.S. Pacific Northwest, new REE finds across Brazil, and a rare nickel find in Canada. Nevertheless, gaps persist, especially in South America, where many surveys are either outdated or incomprehensive. The more countries conduct geological surveys, the more likely they are to discover further important reserves. Identifying these and bringing them online will be an important complement to increased processing capacity and help weaken China’s predominance in global minerals markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（14日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第76日審訊。辯方申請重召前《蘋果》社長張劍虹出庭作供，冀就通訊群組 Slack 內的「飯盒會」紀錄提問。辯方作口頭補充陳詞，指稱雖然證人供詞有提及過「飯盒會」，但是當中從沒提及會議紀錄存在；惟法官杜麗冰質疑黎智英本來是 Slack 群組的成員之一，辯方團隊沒有理由不知道 Slack 內有會議紀錄存在。法官押後至周四宣布是否批准重召張劍虹。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表黎智英的羅拔臣律師行合夥人兼事務律師何俊豪（Johnny Ho）昨日親自作供，他指控方證人供詞和文件中從未提及過「飯盒會」的會議重點會被上載至通訊軟件 Slack，直至今年1月29日，辯方庭上盤問張劍虹期間，張才首度提及 Slack。何指，辯方團隊遂於1月30日去信控方索取 Slack 群組的通訊紀錄；控方於2月1日以書信回覆稱沒有相關紀錄。其後辯方團隊嘗試以其他途徑取得過往的 Slack 紀錄，直至2月26日才透過黎智英的女兒 Claire Lai 取得。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 羅拔臣律師行合夥人兼事務律師 何俊豪（右一）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方資深大律師彭耀鴻今陳詞指，雖然控方材料包含一張由張劍虹傳出的「飯盒會」會議重點截圖，但是證人供詞從沒提及這是來自 Slack 的截圖，因此不能說辯方可以就此自行調查。惟法官李運騰指，從表面上看，該截圖明顯是一些紀錄。彭則指，雖然證人供詞有提及過「飯盒會」，但是當中從沒提及會議紀錄存在。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官又問，辯方有否向當事人黎智英索取過指示，從而確認黎不知道「飯盒會」有任何會議紀錄。彭則回應，雖然不爭議黎是部份「飯盒會」的主持人，但是黎已還柙了數年，他無法接觸任何電子器材。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰打斷，指問題並非黎能否接觸電子器材，而是辯方在盤問張劍虹時率先向他指出，每次「飯盒會」之前，均會開設 Slack 聊天群組，因此辯方沒有理由不知道 Slack 紀錄存在。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/GUJWd94.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭則表示，「見林不見樹」的情況時有出現，強調他並非指責控方或任何一方。杜官聞言激動地指，他們已經花費很多天、很多小時來研究本案文件，而彭背後亦有一整個辯方團隊，質疑沒有理由「見林不見樹」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰一度問，假設法庭不批准重召張劍虹的話，會如何對被告黎智英造成不公；又問若然不傳召張劍虹，轉而傳召黎智英女兒 Claire Lai 作辯方證人，以確認相關 Slack 紀錄，會否同樣協助到辯方。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰追問，辯方能否提出任何合理理由，解釋到為何在張劍虹作供期間不就 Slack 紀錄提問。她並強調，司法公正除了包括辯方的利益之外，也包括控方的利益和公眾利益。彭指當時辯方尚未知道 Slack 群組的會議紀錄存在。杜官卻質疑，當張劍虹庭上首次提及 Slack 之後，辯方大可以向法庭表示需時索取相關紀錄，申請押後數天，待取得相關紀錄後才繼續盤問。彭則稱，事實上當張劍虹確認了 Slack 紀錄存在之後，辯方團隊已經即時採取相應行動，包括向控方查問。杜官質疑，黎本來是 Slack 群組的成員之一，辯方根本毋須等待張劍虹確認之後才開始找尋 Slack 紀錄。法官李運騰補充，Slack 群組是由黎智英開設的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行陳詞指，若果法庭批准重召張劍虹的話，並不符合司法公義，而司法公義包括控方的利益及其所代表的公眾利益。控方亦補充，他們手上並沒有任何 Slack 群組紀錄，所以沒有提供予辯方，但是強調控方已經盡了他們的責任去舉證。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭耀鴻最後回應指，看不到若果法庭批准重召張劍虹的話，會怎樣損害公眾利益。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官押後至周四（16日）宣布決定。控方另外確認有5名警員證人準備好出庭作供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（13日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第75日審訊。辯方申請重召前《蘋果》社長張劍虹出庭作供，冀就通訊群組 Slack 內的「飯盒會」紀錄提問。代表黎智英的事務律師何俊豪（Johnny Ho）親自作供，他稱在今年1月29日張劍虹被辯方盤問期間，才首次在庭上聽到「飯盒會」的會議紀錄會被上載至通訊軟件 Slack，辯方翌日去信控方索取 Slack 紀錄不果，之後嘗試自行透過其他途徑，直至2月26日才成功取得 Slack 紀錄。翻查報導，其時張劍虹已作供完畢。控方則質疑，在張劍虹出庭作供之前，辯方團隊理應有足夠時間就「飯盒會」向控方提出詢問，或者自行作出調查。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表黎智英的羅拔臣律師行合夥人兼事務律師何俊豪（Johnny Ho）親自作供，他在2006至2008年做見習律師，之後由2009年起正式執業至今，職責一直都是處理刑事訴訟案件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何確認，自黎智英於2020年8月10日被拘捕起，他一直是黎的法律代表，對於控方的指控內容熟悉，亦收妥由控方提交的書面證人供詞，包括前《蘋果》社長張劍虹、前《蘋果》副社長陳沛敏和前主筆楊清奇。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何亦確認，他大約於2021年12月收妥上述3名「從犯證人」的書面口供，當中有提及過「飯盒會」，至2022年6月21日再收到3人案件轉介至高院的文件。控方其後於2022年11月17日將控方開案陳詞提交予辯方。換言之，辯方從一系列文件中可以知悉「飯盒會」是控方的重要指證。何亦確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方盤問時質疑，辯方團隊有足夠的時間去查問控方或自行作出調查。何則表示「呢方面可能有少少唔同意」，他指控方證人供詞和控方文件中並未提及過「飯盒會」的會議重點會被上載至通訊軟件 Slack，直至今年1月29日，辯方庭上盤問張劍虹期間，張才首度提及 Slack。何指，辯方團隊遂於1月30日去信控方，要求提供 Slack 群組的通訊紀錄；控方於2月1日以書信回覆，稱沒有相關紀錄。何表示，從那時起辯方團隊才開始想辦法，嘗試以其他途徑取得過往的 Slack 紀錄，直至2月26日才成功透過黎智英女兒 Claire Lai 取得。翻查報導，其時張劍虹已作供完畢，接著陳沛敏上庭作供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑，辯方在張劍虹作供之前，分別3次收到控方文件和證人口供，理應有充足的機會及時間向控方查問關於「飯盒會」的材料。惟何表示「有少少唔同意」，因為 Slack 從沒在證人供詞和控方文件中出現過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在辯方資深大律師彭耀鴻的覆問下，何確認，控方所提供的證人供詞從沒有提及「飯盒會」有任何會議紀錄，而他第一次聽到證人使用 Slack 來上載「飯盒會」紀錄的時候，是在今年1月29日張劍虹作供期間。何又提到，本案的已被使用材料（used material）和未被使用材料（unused material）的總和，是他15年律師生涯以來見過最多的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（10日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第74日審訊。控方庭上讀出城大法律學院教授、梁美芬丈夫王貴國的專家報告，他指在美國的《香港人權及民主法案》之下，當某名人士符合「須為法外引渡、隨意拘留或施以酷刑行為負責」，或者「其他嚴重地侵犯香港人權的情況」，便會被制裁；可是王認為上述條件牽涉非常主觀的判斷，加上須與美國法律一併詮釋，難免被錯誤詮釋和濫用，在實際執行上構成脅迫。王又指，《香港人權及民主法案》可能影響美國公民和機構，以及非美國公民，包括被拒批出入境簽證、資產被封鎖及影響與美國企業做生意等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;王貴國毋須出庭作供-庭上讀出其專家報告&quot;&gt;王貴國毋須出庭作供 庭上讀出其專家報告&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控辯雙方早前經商討後達成協議，專家證人、梁美芬丈夫王貴國的證供可以書面形式處理，而毋須傳召他出庭作供。控方代表、高級檢控官陳頴琛遂讀出王貴國的專家報告，他現時為香港城市大學法律學院、中國法與比較法講座教授，曾取得美國哥倫比亞大學法學碩士和耶魯大學法哲學博士。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;王貴國於2022年11月17日就本案提交一份專家報告，其後於2023年11月15日提交另一份補充報告，以講述外國制裁、封鎖和禁運措施的法律後果和時效。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;報告列出美國就香港而實施的制裁和政策等：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;2019年6月，美國議員盧比奧動議《香港人權及民主法案》（Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act），同年11月，參議院和眾議院先後投票通過，至11月27日獲時任美國總統特朗普簽署，使它正式成為美國法律。法案授權美國總統對有關中國官員實施制裁，包括禁止入境美國、資產封鎖；並要求美國國務卿每年提交有關香港的報告。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;2020年6月30日，有美國議員提出《香港安全港法案》（Hong Kong Safe Harbor Act），要求美國政府向示威者批出難民資格。惟至今法案尚未正式成為美國法律。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;2020年7月14日，特朗普正式簽署《香港自治法》（Hong Kong Autonomy Act），成為法律。法案授權美國政府制裁有份損害香港自治權的中國及香港官員、以及與制裁對象有業務往來的金融機構與企業。法案亦支持被「迫害」的香港永久性居民入境美國。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;同日，特朗普簽署《香港正常化總統行政命令》（President’s Executive Order 13936 on Hong Kong Normalization），指稱香港的情況對美國國家安全、對外政策及經濟構成威脅，宣布暫緩或取消對香港的特別待遇，以及授權制裁與香港有關人士及機構（entities）。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;2020年8月7日，美國政府宣布對11名中央及香港特區政府官員實施制裁，包括時任特首林鄭月娥，指他們落實國安法及損害香港高度自治。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;2020年8月11日，美國國土安全部宣布由同年9月25日起，從香港進口美國的產品須註明原產地是「中國」，而不能標籤「香港」。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;2020年8月19日，美國國務院宣布終止與香港簽署的三項雙邊協議，包括逃犯的移交、被判刑人士的移交、豁免國際船運利得稅。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;2020年10月14日，美國國務院根據《香港自治法》向國會提交第一份報告，列出10名被指有份「削弱香港自治」的中央及特區政府官員，以及威脅制裁與該10人有關的金融機構。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;2020年11月9日，美國國務院宣布制裁4名中央及香港特區官員，包括國安公署副署長李江舟、時任國安處副處長劉賜蕙、時任高級警司李桂華（現為總警司）和時任港澳辦副主任鄧中華，指他們威脅香港的和平、安全和自治。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;2020年12月7日，美國國務院以人大常委會製訂《國安法》及DQ 4名反對派立法會議員為由，制裁14名人大常委會副委員長。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;2021年1月15日，時任美國國務卿蓬佩奧發表聲明，以香港警察拘捕55名民主派為由，宣布制裁6名中央政府及香港特區政府官員。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;2021年3月16日，美國國務更新《香港自治法》報告，稱有見人大通過「完善」香港選舉制度的決定及實施《國安法》，宣布更新制裁名單和追加金融制裁措施。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;2021年7月7日，美國白宮發布《與香港有關國家緊急狀態繼續實施的通知》（Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency with Respect to Hong Kong），宣布延長針對香港狀況而頒布的國家緊急狀態，以及延長美國對香港制裁措施一年。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;2021年7月16日，美國國務院、商務部、國土安全部和財政部，以實施《國安法》及《蘋果日報》關閉為由，聯合發表「香港商業警告」（Hong Kong Business Advisory），並宣布制裁7名中聯辦官員。同日美國國務卿布林肯（Antony Blinken）發表一份《國安法》實施一周年的聲明，指稱《國安法》使香港營商環境轉差。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;王貴國指制裁條件牽涉主觀判斷-難免被錯誤詮釋和濫用&quot;&gt;王貴國指制裁條件牽涉主觀判斷 難免被錯誤詮釋和濫用&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;王貴國在報告中指出，在《香港人權及民主法案》之下，當某名外國人符合一些條件的話，便會被實施制裁，包括「須為法外引渡（extrajudicial rendition）、隨意拘留（arbitrary detention）或施以酷刑（torture）行為負責」，或者「其他嚴重地侵犯（gross violation）香港人權的情況」。可是王貴國認為上述條件中，「負責（responsible）」、「隨意（arbitrary）」和「嚴重（gross）」等字眼牽涉非常主觀的判斷，加上須與美國法律一併詮釋，因此上述條件難免被錯誤詮釋和濫用，在實際執行上構成脅迫（coercion）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;王貴國指，《香港人權及民主法案》可能影響美國公民和機構，以及非美國公民，包括被拒批出入境簽證、資產被封鎖及資產利息被拿掉等，如果他們和美國企業做生意的話，也會受到影響。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;王貴國指，《香港人權及民主法案》亦會對香港和中國內地的金融機構造成直接影響，因在全球化營商環境下，美元仍然是國際交易裡的主導貨幣，而且金融機構需要全球化地運作，法案會影響相關金融機構的運作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;王貴國又指，制裁政策與美國其他法律互有關連，所以制裁的實質影響是累積性的，而不能獨立於其他政策，例如美國的《移民和國籍法》、《香港關係法》和聯合國制裁措施等。就大部份人而言，為了避免觸犯《香港人權及民主法案》，他們自然地會避免處理或接觸任何被法案針對的人士和機構。若然被制裁的人在美國境內的銀行戶口有存款，該人便不會提取該筆款項；若然該人持有美國的物業，而且有第三方租用該物業，業主便未能收取租金，因為收租也會被視為一項商業交易。##&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;周達權堅稱飯盒會曾討論過一人一信救香港&quot;&gt;周達權堅稱「飯盒會」曾討論過「一人一信救香港」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，前壹傳媒營運總裁兼財務總裁周達權第4天出庭作供。辯方盤問時指出，在周達權過往出席的所有「飯盒會」之中，從沒有出現過任何有關特刊《自由之夏》的討論。惟周表示：「我唔係好記得。」辯方又指，周出席過的「飯盒會」中也沒有出現過任何關於「一人一信救香港」的討論。周則堅稱：「呢個記得有傾過嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/uGmyVmQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在控方覆問下，周確認他在2020年8月10日被拘捕，當時他向警方提供了手機解鎖密碼，但提出了法律專業保密權（Legal Professional Privilege），但他其後於2022年1至2月左右透過代表律師去信政府，表明放棄相關權利。法官李運騰問，當時是農曆新年之前還是之後，周則表示：「對唔住法官閣下，嗰段時間我都好迷惘，所以我記唔到呢啲嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周供稱，後來警察聯絡他，表示手機和 iPad 均無法以他所提供的密碼解鎖，周當時回覆警方「係得呢個密碼」，對方依然無法解鎖，之後便沒有再聯絡他。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周達權作供完畢。由於辯方申請重召前《蘋果》社長張劍虹出庭作供，法官押後至下周一（5月13日）處理申請，並擬聽取辯方事務律師何俊豪（Johnny Ho）的證供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（9日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第73日審訊。前壹傳媒營運總裁兼財務總裁周達權第3天出庭作供。控方案情指稱黎智英透過召開「飯盒會」來下達編採指示，不過辯方盤問時指，大部份「飯盒會」的討論內容均與《蘋果》生意業務相關，而且「飯盒會」的目的並非讓黎智英下達編採指示。惟周達權不同意。另外，辯方指2018年，前特首梁振英在其社交媒體專頁上公開點名和批評《蘋果》的廣告商，所以《蘋果》便透過其他方式來增加收入，包括推行網上訂閱計劃、支持小店和隨報附送刊物。周確認，並指若果附送比較特別的刊物，會對當日的報紙銷售有幫助，但效果不長久。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指lais-hotel-property-limited非以黎智英名義持有-周達權指黎有斥資買酒店&quot;&gt;辯方指Lais Hotel Property Limited非以黎智英名義持有 周達權指黎有斥資買酒店&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周達權第三天出庭作供，代表黎智英的資深大律師彭耀鴻開始盤問。周早前供稱加拿大公司 Lais Hotel Property Limited 是由黎智英持有，辯方今質疑周的說法是否準確，因公司是黎以信託形式持有。惟周表示這方面不太清楚，但以他所知，「黎生係有畀錢去買嗰啲酒店，同埋佢有去畀指示點樣去營運。」辯方又指，周是該公司的信託保護人。惟周表示不清楚。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指飯盒會目的非讓黎智英下達編採指示-周達權不同意&quot;&gt;辯方指「飯盒會」目的非讓黎智英下達編採指示 周達權不同意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就《蘋果》高層定期召開的「飯盒會」，周達權指以他理解，開會之前同事會先透過通訊軟件詢問出席人士有什麼問題或議題想討論，然後黎智英有可能會作出回應，或者表示屆時開會再討論。周稱他們曾經有一段時間使用通訊軟件 Slack，之後有使用 WhatsApp。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方向周達權展示 Slack 群組介面截圖。周相信他有出席2019年12月16日的「飯盒會」，當辯方指黎說過未能出席該次會議，周則表示不記得。辯方指，黎智英有時候未能出席「飯盒會」，在這些情況下，時任《蘋果》社長張劍虹便會負責主持會議。周確認：「係會嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指某些「飯盒會」上談及廣告和銷售方面遇到的困難，並提出改善建議，而2019年12月6日的「飯盒會」則首次談及替小店登廣告，惟該次會議黎智英並沒有出席。辯方指，大部份「飯盒會」的討論內容均與《蘋果》的生意業務相關，而且「飯盒會」的目的並非讓黎智英下達編採指示。惟周達權不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黎智英2014年12月辭去主席後錄得虧損-2018年重回集團後虧損放緩&quot;&gt;辯方：黎智英2014年12月辭去主席後錄得虧損 2018年重回集團後虧損放緩&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，在2001至2012年之間，壹傳媒有限公司錄得合共超過20億的盈利，惟在2003至2004財政年度裏，因為沙士爆發而錄得接近9千萬虧損。周達權補充，當年除了沙士以外，《蘋果》亦有在台灣開設電視台，因而支出增加。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方總結指，在大約10年之間，壹傳媒經歷台灣的業務投資、2003年的沙士疫情和2008至2009年的全球金融危機，壹傳媒仍然錄得盈利，可謂在黎智英的領導下非常成功。周達權同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，可是在全球而言，紙媒漸漸衰落，為壹傳媒的生意帶來隱憂，因此在2001年起，壹傳媒一直花費不少功夫令收入來源多元化，正如黎智英以主席身份在年報撰文，稱集團正面對挑戰，會研究開拓不同收入來源和迎接新科技，包括在台灣開設電視台及加強數碼平台。辯方指，不幸地台灣電視台不太成功，最終集團以一個大的虧損金額來賣出電視台。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指2014年12月12日，黎智英辭去壹傳媒集團主席一職，往後3年，壹傳媒每年均錄得以億計的虧蝕，直至2018年，黎智英重返壹傳媒集團。辯方續指，往後2018至2021年，集團每年錄得的虧蝕金額有所減少，而且期間碰上反修例運動和新冠疫情爆發。周同意，並補充壹傳媒當時亦有發展網上訂閱系統。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指前特首梁振英點名批評廣告商-故蘋果以不同方法增收入&quot;&gt;辯方指前特首梁振英點名批評廣告商 故《蘋果》以不同方法增收入&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，一般而言營運傳媒的主要收入來源是廣告費，事實上2002至2017年期間《蘋果》的廣告收入，是報紙銷售額的1.6至2倍。辯方續指，在2018年，前特首梁振英在其社交媒體專頁上公開點名和批評在《蘋果》落廣告的企業。周達權則表示，他有聽說過此事，但他未有親自進入梁的專頁看過相關內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，在那時開始，《蘋果》便開始推行網上的免費訂閱計劃，之後轉為收費訂閱，又透過其他方式來增加收入，例如支持小店。此外，辯方指在2019至2020年期間，《蘋果》希望盡可能賣出最多數量的報紙，所以其中一個做法是隨報附送一些刊物。周確認，又指如果附送一些比較特別的刊物的話，會對當日的銷售有幫助，「我觀察到係會有幫助，但唔係長久嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周達權作供未完，案件明日續審。另外，辯方擬向法庭申請重召前《蘋果》社長張劍虹出庭作供，就員工通訊的 Slack 群組提問，法官表示明日將聽取辯方陳詞及處理申請。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;executive-summary&quot;&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This workshop report presents a summary of observations and discussions related to an event on the use of AI in intelligence by 2040, held in February 2024. The future scenario workshop was held to examine the use and implications of AI in a hypothetical 2040. It was based on a hypothetical scenario in which the relationship between a technically advanced economic and military power called Roland and the neighbouring island state Islay deteriorates. It unfolded in three parts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The build-up of military exercises by Roland near Islay and the potential for invasion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roland’s full-scale invasion of Islay.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roland establishing civilian authority over Islay.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop was structured around the scenario phases. The following are key observations that participants made in the context of each scenario phase but have relevance to the broader question of what AI use in an intelligence context will look like by 2040 and what implications and questions follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;part-1-pre-invasion&quot;&gt;Part 1: Pre-Invasion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The adversary’s widespread AI integration in military structures likely constitutes a strategic advantage, increasing accuracy and efficiency, especially for data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, AI dependency and integration also constitutes an additional risk where access can be achieved to the adversary’s systems and data, for example for information on the adversary’s movements of troops and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The quality, not just the quantity, of data is decisive for intelligence purposes. Authenticating information is therefore a key capability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Communication and assessment of information is likely challenging in this scenario, including the communication of accurate information and analysing available information at fast pace.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is unclear how the UK achieves deterrencein this context or what deterrence looks like in a zero-trust, AI-fuelled environment. This relates to both the communication of information and the sharing of capabilities for deterrence purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;part-2-full-scale-invasion&quot;&gt;Part 2: Full-Scale Invasion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI can be used to design efficient evacuations, for example to identify British individuals and their next of kin , or to design and optimise exit plans.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;UK support to allies includes sharing intelligence capabilities and assisting integration and coordination of datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be prepared for a full-scale invasion scenario, the UK government needs to invest in and support the development of key enable rs, such as computing power, communication infrastructure and critical technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The UK government also needs more credible technology leadership to implement such aims.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Procurement needs to become more agile to enable shorter innovation cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Information operations may be less effective in a context of information chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a significant need for authentication methods.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is important that both AI systems and humans are trained in cultural comprehension. At the same time, AI can help to understand culture, history and their lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants further assessed wider implications, such as the need for the UK to expand AI training for all sectors and skills levels, and identified further research questions based on these observations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This workshop report presents a summary of observations and discussions related to an event on the use of AI in intelligence by 2040, held in February 2024. The future scenario workshop was held to examine the use and implications of AI in a hypothetical 2040. The report highlights two major aims of the workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, by using a future scenario, it aimed to contribute to the discussion by setting out how the use of AI might enable a profoundly different approach to intelligence by the year 2040. Second, it aimed to improve UK preparedness for this scenario by informing questions for future research, as well as potential challenges, implications and milestones that need to be reached, both for such a scenario to come about, and to enable mitigation of any risks that could arise as a result of such developments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hypothetical scenario concerns the deteriorating relationship between a technically advanced economic and military power called Roland and the neighbouring island state Islay. The scenario progresses in three parts: the build-up of military exercises by Roland near Islay and the potential for invasion (Part 1); Roland’s full-scale invasion of Islay (Part 2); and Roland establishing civilian authority over Islay (Part 3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;workshop-methodology&quot;&gt;Workshop Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report is based on a two-part workshop with practitioners, representatives from the public and private sectors, and academics. The workshop was co-organised by the Trustworthy Autonomous Systems (TAS) Hub and RUSI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first part of the workshop, participants discussed a hypothetical future scenario illustrating the use of AI in a 2040 intelligence context. They received several prompts for a future scenario (listed below as Parts 1–3). These mirrored the six phases of conflict to structure the discussion. The scenario evolved in three parts, each representing two phases of the conflict cycle (colour-coded below on Figure A). For the second part of the workshop, participants were split into breakout groups reflecting the stages of the scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Six Phases of Conflict, Grouped in Line with Workshop Discussions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;limitations&quot;&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workshop discussions were held at an unclassified level. Access to information, particularly in an intelligence context, and participants’ ability to share their knowledge, was therefore, at times, limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scenario is hypothetical, and participants did not receive background information on Roland’s or Islay’s capabilities or additional context. Given the lack of details about the cultural, historical or political context of Roland, discussion remained speculative at times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;structure&quot;&gt;Structure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report’s structure follows the three phases of the fictional scenario. Each section of the report introduces the specific setting of each part of the scenario. It then offers reflections from the plenary and the respective breakout groups that were charged with examining each part of the scenario in further depth. Finally, a fourth section addresses wider implications that follow from the overall scenario, including legal, ethical and workforce implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-scenario&quot;&gt;The Scenario&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The information boxes in each of the following subsections describe the initial scenario input participants received. The boxes are divided into three progressive phases of the escalation and are followed by the participants’ reaction to each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scenario-part-1&quot;&gt;Scenario Part 1&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Description&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Over the next decade and a half, a large and economically powerful adversary – a state called Roland – expands its technological advantage in AI and uses its technological and economic power to advance its geostrategic ambitions. Through a combination of industrial cyber espionage operations, innovation, widespread exports of its technologies and internal implementation strategies, the country manages to roll out the wide use of AI, including in its defence, intelligence and police sector. Roland has access to some of the most advanced AI systems. Roland has different cultural and ethical norms from the UK and is willing to use AI technologies in ways the UK would not.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It is now 2040. Over the past few months, Roland has repeatedly held large-scale military exercises. It is now feared that Roland will invade a neighbouring country, Islay, an island state. Out of fear of such invasion, Islay has forged close bonds with regional allies and NATO countries seeking to deter conflict.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/V0yD6xV.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: Lead-up to Invasion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI integration as a (dis)advantage?&lt;/strong&gt; Participants considered whether Roland’s widespread integration of AI is a strength or a weakness. Initial assumptions implied that widespread AI integration would lead to greater efficiency and high technological advancement. However, there was disagreement and uncertainty about what AI-enabled weapons and systems would be available by 2040, and whether they might introduce new vulnerabilities. Participants reflected that, while in the medium to long term, military adoption of AI is likely to confer strategic advantage, early adopters may inadvertently introduce new, difficult-to-predict weaknesses. Such weaknesses can be exploited by technologically adept adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wider AI integration could therefore also constitute a weakness if access to Roland’s datasets can be achieved. For example, if Roland is widely using AI systems in its military operations, it would also do so for its troop mobilisation and exercises. If access to such data can be secured, Islay and its allies could accurately monitor equipment and troop movements. A comparison was drawn with the fitness data collected by the app Strava, popular among military personnel tracking their exercise. In 2018, data shared by athletes as part of a public social network revealed base locations and patrol routes. Similar information can draw a telling picture for Islay and allied intelligence services if access to the adversary’s data can be secured. In that sense, the widespread integration of AI could constitute a weakness for Roland as it possibly leads to new vulnerabilities. High standards of operational security are therefore likely to be an even more critical factor in future military conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communication and decision-making in a disinformation environment.&lt;/strong&gt; Observations also addressed implications of sharing genuine information and disinformation. In view of expected domestic but also international disinformation campaigns, enabled by deepfakes and tailored to individuals, experts considered that there is a real risk that any information acquired might be manufactured. One expert described this scenario as an “arms race for who can manufacture and identify fake information more effectively”. In such a context, communicating accurate information also poses a challenge. Technologies such as cryptographic watermarking to verify the provenance of authentic media such as governmental communications will be increasingly important. Experts were concerned about building communication bridges but also the speed at which decision-makers must rely on, assess and judge available information. It is expected that time pressure for data assessment and decision-making is likely to increase by 2040. This enhances the risk that decision-makers do not have sufficient time or inclination to assess the quality of data underlying their decision-making process. AI assistance could be helpful in this context, to address the scale and pace of this challenge, although it might limit the involvement of meaningful human oversight and understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality of data.&lt;/strong&gt; Participants anticipated that more data will be available by 2040, but expressed concern about the quality of data fuelling AI technologies and intelligence work more generally. How do you ensure the data collected or used to train your own AI systems is accurate and useful? Experts argued that the decentralised nature of the UK intelligence community can constitute an advantage, as different institutions would likely use different datasets, thus making them more resilient to false information and enable checks and balances. However, data analysts pointed out that any available data is only useful if it can be turned into information that is useful – a process that currently still requires human input, and that human input is unlikely to scale to meet the data needs in 2040. Testing the information pace prior to such a scenario is thus a key element of preparation. The participants also pointed out that by 2040 it is likely that a large proportion of data available for machine learning models may, in fact, be AI generated. The implications of this remain to be clarified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to communicate for deterrence.&lt;/strong&gt; In this zero-trust context, disinformation and the validation or reliance on false information determine a pre-conflict scenario of the kind given here between Roland and Islay. This includes potential communication between conflict parties and their allies. A fundamental concern is how to deter the adversary without being misinterpreted. Even communication to de-escalate a situation may not be trusted. It is even unclear what deterrence looks like in such scenario, raising questions such as what kind of deterrence signals Islay, the UK and allies would want to send, and what channels to use to send them. Traditional deterrence relies on hardware such as nuclear missiles to signal capabilities and willingness to use them. For some experts, AI technology’s deterrence is much more communication-based, with doubt and need to interpret the adversary’s capabilities remaining. The adversary would have to rely on its own intelligence to assess allied AI capabilities. Other participants considered that deterrence in this context remains of a physical nature , in that AI would be implemented in weapons and other sys tems. One expert added that AI enabled more opportunity for deterrence without putting humans at risk , for example where subsurface weapon systems could patrol the waters around Islay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capability sharing as deterrence.&lt;/strong&gt; Similarly, it was unclear what kind of AI-enabled military capabilities the UK and other allies can provide to Islay to ensure deterrence. Some were sceptical about providing AI technologies to Islay which might be an ally in that context but not in the future. They drew attention to the risk that the UK and its allies might regret providing technologies that could be used against them in the future. This concern reflects experiences of the Cold War, when Western allies provided capabilities to states for deterrence against the Soviets, but which were later used against them. This was the case with training and weapons supplied to the Mujahedeen in Afghanistan, who were equipped by Western powers to withstand the Soviet Union but later turned against former supporters. Providing capabilities to Islay may, however, also become easier with the expansion of AI technologies. One practitioner pointed out that in Ukraine, the delivery of capabilities is restricted due to concerns that weapons may be used for escalation. AI systems, however, could be programmed to only be used for predefined purposes, eliminating the risk of escalation and enabling earlier capability sharing. A technologist supported this assessment, explaining that if Islay were able to circumvent the programmed restrictions by reverse engineering the delivered AI systems, it would have the necessary skills to make them in the first place. However, one participant pointed out that it might not be within allies’ power to decide what AI technologies to share if they are increasingly open source or off-the-shelf technologies. In this scenario, the bar to diffusion may be quite low. The assumption that the UK and its allies can determine who has access to what technologies and capabilities might be a false premise , according to this expert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relationship between AI, deterrence and implications for (de-)escalation were identified as areas of great interest for future research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI to enhance cultural understanding.&lt;/strong&gt; Socio-technical approaches that combine AI with behavioural and social science understanding to improve cultural understanding featured in many additional observations participants made on the scenario. AI was perceived as helpful in some instances but less so in others. For example, some considered that AI technologies could help understand adversaries and their culture, history and ethical norms, including their online security culture. AI’s perceived role in fostering understanding of other cultures was considered particularly helpful given that it has been challenging for the UK and its allies to understand how the adversary thinks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Back to human intelligence?&lt;/strong&gt; Others, however, found that in this convoluted space of misinformation and big data, the importance of human intelligence stood out to provide situational awareness. One human task includes developing indicators and warnings that ensure the UK and its allies are not being deceived. While AI systems can help identify when these thresholds are met, turning these variables into programmable logic in the first place is a human task. This is especially challenging to develop when determining the adversary’s i ntent to launch an invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, participants in the breakout group focusing on this scenario discussed three questions that they considered required further attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/wpc7zrJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 3: Key Questions for Breakout Group Participants&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;description-1&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Description&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A sophisticated propaganda campaign enabled by AI technologies pushes the message of a historical claim to Islay. A purported mass exercise concurrently masks a full-scale invasion of Islay.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/wZTNfnL.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 4: Roland Invades&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI to design efficient evacuations.&lt;/strong&gt; In case of a full-scale invasion, the UK and other countries would seek to evacuate their citizens located in Roland. Experts argued that collected datasets and AI technologies to analyse them can help to identify not only UK citizens and their next of kin but also their locations. Furthermore, AI technologies can be used to identify and optimise exit plans. One participant suggested creating a foreign office evacuation app that leverages AI. An app such as this could disseminate targeted instructions to respective citizens, identifying their best route to evacuation and sending instructions about when to go and where. For example, it could identify an airfield, as well as provide packing instructions. A challenge here is that the app would depend on reliable communication systems – which may be switched off or disrupted in a conflict scenario. However, it was countered that current practices imply that communication systems are too valuable to both parties to a conflict. As a result, it may be unlikely that one party would attempt to switch them off completely. Another challenge was raised by a military practitioner , who pointed out that UK citizens are not normally targetable abroad. In these circumstances, however, exactly that is required. The underlying AI systems would need to be sufficiently flexible and fed by appropriate data. This raises both questions about how and when this data is collected in the first place, and whether it is done so in a way that complies with GDPR and other pri vacy laws. A practitioner in the private sector saw this as less of a problem , based on recent experience of identifying UK citizens for evacuation in Sudan , where some of these capabilities were already implemented. The commercially available information they relied on was indeed GDPR compliant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UK intelligence support for Islay to maintain situational awareness.&lt;/strong&gt; Experts were generally positive about the ability to upskill the intelligence capability of UK allies based on recent experience. While it comes at the risk of losing some of the UK’s control, upskilling Islay by handing over considerable capability of the UK and its allies would improve both Islay’s and the UK’s intelligence-gathering abilities. Data integration is currently still a challenge and takes weeks. By 2040, it will be vastly quicker. One data expert estimated timelines to integrate datasets could move from weeks to hours or days. One expert pointed out that in this scenario, a UK military response is unlikely , as Islay is not part of NATO or another military alliance. Instead, UK support likely plays out in other ways, such as coordination of classified and non-classified data resulting in shar eable intelligence. Allies benefit from the UK’s decentralised intelligence institutions, with data collected by one agency verified by another. Assured quality of data allows the UK and its allies to maintain situational awareness and inform s other steps, for example the designing of particularly effective sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk of centralised technology capabilities.&lt;/strong&gt; The concentration of power in the technology field was considered a risk in this scenario. While militaries retain some autonomy, much of technology capability is developed and implemented by the private sector. The concentration of power is particularly stark for AI technologies, where a few large technology companies hold considerably more knowledge and capability than the public sector. While currently, much of this power is in a few allied hands, this could change by 2040, particularly with the growing capability of open-source AI models. Much depends on the relationship between public and private sectors. Experts warned that it was prudent to assume that whe n a company resides in a specific country, its alliance also sits with said country in a scenario such as this. While commercial concentration is a risk that is difficult to address, possible geostrategic implications are considerable for this future scenario. While some steps have already been taken to diversify and de-risk supply chains, for example for semiconductors, experts were sceptical that these would be significantly decentralised by 2040.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A breakout group discussed these issues further, focusing on three requirements considered necessary to put the UK in a strong position by 2040.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/RofIAoV.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;description-2&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Description&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;After months of occupation, protests in Islay City, one of Islay’s largest smart cities, are gathering momentum in support of resistance. Roland’s regime seeks to suppress these protests.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/7jwdeLf.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 6: Occupation of Islay&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information chaos limiting impact of information operations.&lt;/strong&gt; Experts were sceptical about the impact of information operat ions in this scenario, as large parts of the population may have become desensitis ed to fake news and other misinformation. It is therefore questionable whether propaganda campaigns by Roland would be impactful. On the flip side, even if Islay’s resistance were to produce evidence of atrocities or other unlawful behaviour from occupying forces, there would be questions about whether the wider population would accept them as such, possibly hindering further resistance. One expert argued that if disinformation campaigns continued to proliferate, there would be a risk that, by 2040, people might have become jaded by the overload of genuine information and disinformation. Instead, they might end up believing what they want, closing themselves to genuine information and rational evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need for authent ication methods.&lt;/strong&gt; In this scenario, authentication methods become particularly important for reaching Islay’s as well as Roland’s population. One way to authenticate information is by watermarking it, for example to make fake news or AI-generated information easily identifiable. However, it was unclear who watermarks information and how effective watermarking is. Social media platforms were considered to play a special role in this context – both as potential authorities to regulate or watermark information but also as platforms for intelligence competition, especially prior to an invasion. Another suggestion was that end-users’ technology, such as smartphones, might provide a scoring of the information the user consumes to indicate its accuracy or potential fakeness – a valuable tool that governments might be interested in funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wider technology and communication infrastructure.&lt;/strong&gt; How the UK can support opposition to the occupation and reach Islay’s population also depends on how general communication structures and related technologies will evolve to 2040. One expert referred to the possibility of bypassing government or commercially controlled networks, and the availability of quantum computing to bypass encryption or AI’s capability to break encryption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, the breakout group discussion focused on the following three aspects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Y37hvUy.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 7: Key Requirements Identified by Breakout Group in Response to Part 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;wider-implications&quot;&gt;Wider Implications&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fourth breakout group remarked the wider implications following from the scenario, particularly focusing on legal, ethical and workforce implications. Its three main takeaways are as follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The UK needs to increase AI training for all sectors and skills levels.&lt;/strong&gt; Participants argued in favour of widespread AI training to develop the UK’s AI literacy. This ensures that people are ready to use AI technologies in their everyday work. More specifically, it is necessary to train people in AI-related critical thinking skills and human–AI teaming methods. In a defence context, that might mean training intelligence analysts so they can prompt AI bots/tools in the right way and optimise results from AI in human–AI interactive engagements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The UK needs to develop its AI assurance capacity.&lt;/strong&gt; Participants suggested creating centres of excellence for AI model auditability and the quantification of AI model uncertainty and predictability. However, they argued that these should be managed by the government, regulators or academia. The involvement of AI vendors was viewed critically, due to a perceived conflict of interest. Importantly, assurance should take place prior to the deployment of AI technologies. This is not the case in current AI models: large language models, such as ChatGPT, are released fast and problems fixed later – an approach deemed undesirable by participants.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The UK needs to actively build resilience into UK data and compute capacity for AI.&lt;/strong&gt; Participants agreed on the vital role of data needed to train AI systems. Dependency risks arise where much of this data is sourced from outside the UK. Data access might be contested in the future – for example in a scenario such as the one examined here. Participants therefore agreed that maintaining a UK data archive for AI training could become even more important. Furthermore, GPU clusters are needed to train AI models. Again, clusters outside the UK might be contested, so more local capacity – such as the UK national AI compute cluster in Bristol – is needed. Participants also agreed that there needs to be more UK sandboxing capacity to evaluate AI models, including to test models that are ethically challenging to UK’s stance. Experts pointed out that competitors are often not as ethically constrained as the UK, but considered there is a need to ensure that the UK’s AI models work effectively within and outside the country’s current ethical stance. This would also allow AI models to operate if the UK’s ethical stance changed in the future, particularly if there were an existential threat to the UK. This was considered necessary as it takes years to develop AI models. Therefore, readiness – including sandboxing – needs to happen years before any such changes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report has set out the use case and implications of AI technologies in an intelligence context taking place in 2040. The hypothetical scenario underlying this analysis concerned the deteriorating relationship between the technically advanced economic and military power Roland and its neighbouring island state Islay. The scenario progressed in three parts: the build-up of military exercises by Roland near Islay and the potential for invasion (Part 1); Roland’s full-scale invasion of Islay (Part 2); and Roland establishing civilian authority over Islay (Part 3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the observations made in this analysis are specific to a particular phase of the conflict. For example, the role of deterrence and potential ways in which the UK can communicate or demonstrate deterrence clearly relate to a pre-full-scale invasion scenario. Similarly, some specific use cases, such as the AI-enabled data analysis for evacuation purposes, are context specific and not equally relevant to all scenario stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majority of observations about the UK’s ability to secure a strategic advantage from AI technologies and how to implement and benefit from these technologies by 2040 applied across all stages of the scenario. Participants repeatedly returned to several core themes. From a human perspective, these included the need for more skills development at all levels and training in human–machine interactions, as well as the need for clear technology leadership among senior UK government officials. On the more technical side, there was uncertainty about the exact use cases and advances that could be expected by 2040. Similarly, questions remained as to the legal, ethical and technical restrictions that should be applied to any AI systems in use. However, there was wide agreement on the urgent need for stronger collaboration with the private sector and the wider technology and innovation ecosystem to harness AI’s full capabilities. This also includes need for stronger governmental leadership on technology investment and development of AI and other related technologies, such as compute and future telecommunication infrastructure. Participants also repeatedly stressed the urgent need for a more agile procurement process to enable shorter innovation cycles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nature of the exercise and the limited information on the fictional states involved left room for speculation and uncertainty. However, this also allowed the conversation to identify interesting questions that can guide future research projects. These included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What does deterrence look like in an age of zero trust and disinformation enabled by AI?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How can procurement become more agile to enable shorter innovation cycles and include more start-ups?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What does it mean to be “a global AI superpower”? How does this translate to areas such as compute, data capture, assurance regimes and effective test environments?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How can the UK’s aim of being a global AI superpower be translated into more concrete short- and medium-term goals?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How can the UK fill the skills gap that arises at all levels, including at a leadership level where more technology expertise is needed to be able to set a concrete vision for UK technology leadership?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How can the UK achieve effective human–machine teaming while setting adequate limitations (for ethical, technical and legal aspects) and implementing appropriate regulation?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What data environment is required to effectively use AI-enabled intelligence capabilities by 2040? What does adequate data governance look like that effectively protects individual freedoms while allowing the UK to secure a strategic advantage through AI-enabled analysis? And what data does the adversary use to train its AI systems? Does it rely on data on its own past military practices? What are the implications?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is the historical and cultural context, and how can the UK use AI to understand this context?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;周達權確認有份處理黎私人戶口&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/klOkY0T.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;壹傳媒創辦人黎智英與《蘋果日報》3間相關公司，被控「串謀勾結外國勢力」等罪，案件周三（8日）在西九龍裁判法院（暫代高等法院）展開第72日審訊。控方證人、壹傳媒集團營運總裁兼時任財務總裁周達權第二天作供，控方續問及黎智英名下公司的運作，而周亦確認，佢有份處理黎私人戶口帳目。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周周二確認，自己與黎為離岸公司「LACOCK」董事。及至2020年初，陳梓華成為公司新股東及董事，但他不認識陳，而黎的助手 Mark Simon 曾向他解釋「因為呢個陳梓華，幫阿黎生手、做到嘢，所以黎生將呢間公司轉畀佢作為酬勞」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件由高院《國安法》指定法官杜麗冰、李素蘭及李運騰審理。控方由副刑事檢控專員周天行、助理刑事檢控專員張卓勤、高級檢控官陳穎琛代表；黎智英由資深大律師彭耀鴻、大律師關文渭及有香港執業資格的新西蘭御用大律師 Marc Corlett 代表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1008-開庭&quot;&gt;10:08 開庭&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1010-控方續問黎智英名下公司運作&quot;&gt;10:10 控方續問黎智英名下公司運作&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方繼續就黎智英名下加拿大公司「Lais Hotel Properties Limited」提問，周達權指公司於2010年之前成立﹐主要管理加拿大酒店，例如 Prince of Wales Hotel、Queen’s Landing Hotel，以及 Pillar and Post Hotel，業務與壹傳媒無關，他本人、Mark Simon 和 Robert Jackson 為公司董事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，誰是「Lais Hotel」股東？周稱「上高有一間公司 hold 住」，但不記得該公司名稱，「我記憶應該係黎智英先生擁有」。控方問，周在「Lais Hotel」有何工作？周稱，公司每三個月有一個董事會，每半年一次與核數師開會，每年一個股東大會，「咁我實際上、日常運作我係冇參與」。控方問，周需向誰人匯報？周回答是董事局，主席應該是 Mark Simon。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方再問，周供稱每半年一次與核數師開會，那麼他是否需要處理公司的財務事宜？周稱，不需要處理公司日常財務事宜，而是核數師開會後告知他相關情況，他再去處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1030-周確認有份處理黎智英私人戶口&quot;&gt;10:30 周確認有份處理黎智英私人戶口&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2019年4月25日、由力高顧問有限公司助理財務總監 Linda MENDOZA 傳送至周、Mark Simon 的電郵，副本傳送至員工 Evan Lau，「Kindly approve via return email the following Request For Payments from Lai Chee Ying’s SCSB USD account（請透過回覆電郵，批准黎智英 SCSB 美元帳戶付款請求）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周解釋，Evan Lau 是會計，他向 Linda MENDOZA 或 Mark Simon 匯報，電郵中的「SCSB美元帳戶」是指黎個人的上海商業儲蓄銀行美元帳戶。控方指，該付款請求與 Mark Simon 的計劃有關，涉及200萬美金，詢問周是否知道與甚麼有關？周稱，若 Mark Simon 的計劃獲批准，就會發出付款請求，「我相信黎生 approve 咗，呢個係會計部有嘅程序」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周續指，「咁如果 Linda 佢畀 email 我，就應該已經將呢啲程序行晒，所以我亦都會 approve」。法官李運騰詢問，這是黎的個人銀行帳戶，為何需要周的批准？周稱「我嘅批准，係批准個 payment request form」，讓黎私人公司的核數師查核紀錄，又指他接任工作時，「我係跟返我上手一路咁樣做落嚟」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰再問，周不僅處理黎的私人公司，還處理他的私人銀行戶口？周稱「私人公司就會係 accountant（會計師）做」，又指 Mark Simon 的計劃已獲黎批准，他只是批准相關付款憑證（payment voucher）。周稱，Mark Simon 向 Linda 傳送電郵，「應該有埋黎生嘅 approval」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，為何周稱「應該」？周稱「因為呢一個係公司要有嘅程序，我都認為 Linda 會做咗呢一啲工作，先出呢個 email」。他同意電郵沒有佐證文件紀錄，但重申「呢個係應該有嘅 procedure 嚟，相信 Linda 有做到」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰聞言指，周沒看文件、僅相信 Linda，可算是「橡皮圖章（rubber stamping）」？周稱「如果係咁講，可以係咁講，但係最尾因為呢個戶口係黎先生私人戶口，如果張 cheque 或者 remittance，都係要黎生佢簽返嘅」。控方問，誰設立這程序？周稱「我唔知邊個 set up，但呢個程序係恆之已久」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;針對電郵內的 Mark Simon 計劃，周稱不知道內容，「因為如果寫 Mark’s project，我係唔需要問⋯Mark Simon 同我講，黎生同意呢樣嘢」。李運騰問，周不論如何都會相信 Mark Simon 說法？周稱「咁以往都有其他關於Mark 嘅 project，都有畀過錢，黎生見到個 report 都冇任何嘅異議，咁我覺得係佢冇講到大話囉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1050-控方問及黎名下台灣公司&quot;&gt;10:50 控方問及黎名下台灣公司&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方詢問，是否有一間離岸公司名為「Chartwell」？周同意，以他理解是黎名下的一間台灣公司，但並非由他處理，而是由台灣同事或 Mark Simon 處理，「我實際上係冇參與呢間公司」，亦不清楚 Mark Simon 在這間公司的工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，周如何得悉「Chartwell」是黎名下？周稱「因為我時常都去台灣，咁黎生喺台灣都有佢一班同事，處理佢嘅私人事務，咁有時佢啲私人公司嘅同事會嚟傾計，從而得知」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1054-控方問及黎墊支李宇軒登報事宜&quot;&gt;10:54 控方問及黎墊支李宇軒登報事宜&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示 Mark Simon 於2019年6月27日傳送給 Linda 的電郵，「Linda, Please see the attachment, we are making some payments to newspaper for various advertisements as the groups cannot get their money transferred in time. I will be sending one to you shortly for payment today. We need to pay in this person’s name. Pay in name of Mr Li= LI YU HIN」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;（中譯：請參閱附件，我們正在向報館支付廣告費，但未能及時匯款。今天我會盡快向你發送款項，我們需要以李宇軒名義付款）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，此交易關於甚麼？周稱，Mark Simon 通知 Linda，需要向李宇軒支付500萬元，電郵附件為 Mark Simon 與黎的 WhatsApp 對話，當中提到 Mark Simon 從 Martin 得悉，有人需要500萬元過渡性貸款（bridge loan），Mark Simon 可以在7月4日取回款項，黎遂表示「OK」。至於電郵內所指的廣告費，周稱「我理解係一啲文宣廣告」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，為何 Mark Simon 要向 Linda 發送電郵？周稱，因需要 Linda 簽發支票或轉帳，「阿 Mark 都要（向 Linda）畀埋黎生 approval 先可以做到」，因此在電郵附上他與黎的 WhatsApp 紀錄。控方問，周是否牽涉在內？周稱「我諗我冇參與到」，指 Mark Simon 予他電郵密件副本，僅因他每個月要製作關於黎個人支出的報表，亦不知道該500萬元來源。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2019年6月27日由 Mark Simon 傳送至周、壹傳媒行政總裁張劍虹等人的電郵，「Guys, can you inform them that they have credit for one week and so we will run the ad. And they can pay us within one week. Mr Lai has approved Assisting as they are having trouble moving their money.」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;（中譯：你能否告訴他們，登報人有一周寬限期，我們會投放廣告，而他們可在一周內向我們付款。因為他們在轉移資金方面遇到困難，黎先生已批准了協助。）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周解釋，此有關李宇軒向台灣《蘋果日報》登報事宜，「收到呢個 email 睇到有黎生 approve，我哋就畀咗一個星期 credit 畀呢個客人啦」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1116-小休&quot;&gt;11:16 小休&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1159-周mark-simon-在壹傳媒大樓有固定辦公室&quot;&gt;11:59 周：Mark Simon 在壹傳媒大樓有固定辦公室&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方圍繞《蘋果》「飯盒會」提問。周確認，2019年至2020年期間，自他任職營運總裁後，每周都會參與由黎主持的「飯盒會」，周本人、張劍虹、ICT 部門主管 Connie Chan 會出席。控方問，還有誰人出席？「因為飯盒會有唔同主題，所以要睇吓當時傾啲乜」，例如《蘋果》實體版編輯、壹週刊、《蘋果》網上版、廣告部及業務發展。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰問，Mark Simon 在壹傳媒的角色是甚麼？周稱他沒有正式職銜，「就係黎先生嘅私人助理」，周會聽從其指示。法官李素蘭問，Mark Simon 辦公室在壹傳媒大樓？周同意，他有固定辦公室在壹傳媒大樓，重申他會替黎執行壹傳媒、私人公司上的決定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1212-周飯盒會談及反政府運動黑暴&quot;&gt;12:12 周：「飯盒會」談及反政府運動、「黑暴」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方進一步問及「飯盒會」的內容，周先解釋形式，出席者在開會前在 WhatsApp 提出問題，黎通常會回覆「到時再討論」。其後，「食飯大家有啲傾講啦，咁黎生亦都會講吓，佢對當時個睇法啦，例如當時嘅反政府示威」，亦會討論員工提出的問題。周再指，黎針對問題作出決定，由張劍虹撰寫會議紀錄，再傳送予各出席者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，飯盒會涉及甚麼主題？周指，如果跟報紙相關，「好多時啲話題，都會連帶到當時嘅反政府運動、『黑暴』，咁黎生就會有佢指示，有啲咩會做啦，例如需要多啲人注意，或者可以令到外國有關注」，但不清楚之後編輯做法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;針對周稱「令到外國有關注」，控方問如何達到目的？周舉例，推出《蘋果》英文版、、「一人一信計劃」、「自由之夏」特刊，「咁嗰本特刊有中文版同埋英文版，最主要都係啲相呀、畫冊，關於當時反政府示威呀。咁亦都有少量文字，我冇詳細閱讀，咁英文版係中文版嘅翻譯啦」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方再問，是希望獲得甚麼關注？周稱，是關於香港反政府行動，「或者佢哋所謂嘅『警暴』咁囉，咁亦都希望得到外國嘅支持啦，咁或者係再厲害啲，就係制裁啦」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1230-周蘋果英文版為吸引外國支持&quot;&gt;12:30 周：《蘋果》英文版為吸引外國支持&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，《蘋果》網上版如何吸引更多人關注？周稱，在「飯盒會」曾討論，要多報道反政府示威、示威者，「令到多啲人同情佢哋，呢啲最主要都係啲 video 嚟」。周補充，他由2019年9月、10月任職營運總裁起，參加「飯盒會」，至2020年12月初。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於周有否參與《蘋果》英文版，周稱，他參與 ICT 部分，「make sure launch 到個英文版嘅《蘋果日報》囉」。周解釋，行政總裁著他幫忙管理 ICT，「咁喺呢個情形 make sure 可以準時 launch 到英文版《蘋果日報》，睇住個進度、有咩問題，同埋有咩難題可以幫佢解決到」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，《蘋果》英文版目的是甚麼？周稱讓外國、尤是美國政要閱讀《蘋果》，「咁希望可以爭取到佢哋嘅支持」。他續指，因為當時情況，黎覺得外國支持很重要，令到反政府、反修例運動可以成功，重申「我相信係為咗吸引外國嘅讀者、外國嘅支持」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1433-控方就自由之夏特刊提問&quot;&gt;14:33 控方就「自由之夏」特刊提問&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方繼續圍繞「自由之夏」特刊提問，指中文版於2019年9月20日刊出，英文版於同年10月9日刊出；周確認。控方問，刊物是否派發出去？周稱「我嘅理解係賣㗎喎」，刊物同時是一個畫冊，「記錄返佢哋認為嘅警暴，吸引返啲讀者，同埋想增加多啲力量啩」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，「自由之夏」有否在海外派發？周稱「我記得我冇直接 involve 喺海外發行，但係我記得 Mark Simon 有要求過我攞二千幾本」，包括中文版及英文版刊物，用作海外派發，「我嘅理解佢嘅外國係美國、英國嗰啲地方」，但 Mark Simon 沒詳細交代派發至哪些組織。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰問，在刊物英文版寫有「扣除成本捐 612 人道基金」，為何中文版沒有標明？周稱不清楚，但指「可以做呢個決定，我相信係黎生或者 CEO」，又指記得刊物中英文版的淨收益都捐予 612 人道基金。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1448-周mark-simon-年終奬金由黎私人給予&quot;&gt;14:48 周：Mark Simon 年終奬金由黎私人給予&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2019年12月10日、周與黎的 WhatsApp 紀錄，周稱「老闆，你好，以下是 Mark Simon 過往四年的年終獎金你參考：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 2015 US$200,000
2 2016 US$250,000
3 2017 US$300,000
4 2018 US$200,000」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎回覆「跟去年 US$200,000 Thanks. Jimmy.」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周庭上解釋，年終獎金並非由壹傳媒予 Mark Simon，而是黎私人予他，但不記得哪個戶口，「我理解獎金就係你辦事做到得嘅獎金」。周再指，「因為我收到佢指示係畀呢個 bonus，冇提過係咪因為喺壹傳媒定係同黎生私人做咗嘢而畀，我嘅理解 bonus 係你嗰一年工作做得好，所以佢畀呢個 bonus」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周續指，他收到黎的訊息後轉發給 Linda，由她處理付款，強調相關支票由黎簽發。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1455-周一人一信予特朗普會引好多注意力&quot;&gt;14:55 周：「一人一信」予特朗普會引「好多注意力」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年5月13日黎向周傳送一條眾籌網站連結，名為「US Supporting Apple Daily」，「Anna contacted me, I gave them the rate after speaking with our ad department. Now they put an ad up that lets everybody our discount. (So I just tell everybody it’s subsidized).（Anna 聯絡了我，我與廣告部討論後，給了他們折扣，現在他們登廣告，讓每個人都可以享受折扣。（所以我只是告訴大家，這是有補助的）。）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎再稱「Does this crowdfunding campaign come from Simon lee and his friends? Great idea! We can go the same channel for our US subscription effort. Thanks.（這次眾籌活動來自 Simon Lee 和他的朋友嗎？好提議！我們可以透過相同渠道進行美國訂閱工作，謝謝。）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周回覆「Copy that. I will look into it and come back to you. We also have 美蘋撐蘋果計劃和贈閱卷 and will start work immediately. thanks.（收到。我會調查一下後再回覆你，我們還有美蘋撐蘋果計劃和贈閱卷，即將開始工作。謝謝）、「Hi Boss, this one is not coming from Simon Lee. Thanks!（老闆，這不是 Simon Lee 發起的，謝謝）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，訊息提到的眾籌是甚麼？周稱「我諗我其實當時都唔知，都要一段時間先覆返（黎）」，後來他回覆黎有關「美蘋撐蘋果計劃」，「我問咗其他同事，我之後回覆唔係由 Simon Lee（發起）」。周續指，這並非公司舉辦的計劃，他沒進入連結閱讀相關內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，誰是 Simon Lee？周稱是李兆富，之前曾替《蘋果》工作，「之後我理解佢都有幫黎生做嘢」，但不清楚其實際工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方再展示周與黎有關「一人一信行動」的訊息，黎稱「紙信有蘋果 logo 而且傳媒一定會印出來和報道，有助我們之後推廣美國人訂閱蘋果」，周則稱「會立刻跟進」。控方問，他所指的跟進是甚麼？周稱「咁我應該係搵咗劍虹、印刷廠去準備印呢封信」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，為何「一人一信」有助推廣美國人訂閱《蘋果》？周稱「如果要一人一信寄去畀特朗普，咁個聲音會好大囉，咁亦都會有好多注意力囉，咁從而希望多啲人去subscribe、去訂閱《蘋果》」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/JjCiPNy.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1517-控方完成主問&quot;&gt;15:17 控方完成主問&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又顯示由2019年4月1日至10月31日的「合併現金流量表（Combined Cash Flow）」，周稱是 Linda 製作，「比黎生知道佢收入嗰啲洗費，同埋喺後面見到所有私人公司嘅銀行戶口狀況」。庭上顯示，當中一項紀錄為「Chan Tsz Wah – sponsorship for exhibition $14.4k」，控方詢問是甚麼？周按紀錄表示，「就係 sponsor 佢嘅 exhibition」，但不知道內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方完成主問。辯方資深大律師彭耀鴻提出，由於控方沒有提供《蘋果》的工作平台 Slack 紀錄，其後需由辯方自行擷取，故當前壹傳媒行政總裁張劍虹作供時，無法向張提問，希望重新傳召張劍虹出庭。法官杜麗冰表示周四（9日）會再考慮辯方申請。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1540-休庭&quot;&gt;15:40 休庭&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closer engagement between Russia and China has fuelled assumptions of an emerging axis. The Arctic is often cited as evidence of Sino-Russian alignment due to their growing Arctic ties across the security, strategic and commercial spheres. Beijing frames its Arctic relationship with Russia often in terms of “win-win” agreements and strategies. This term, “win-win”, reflects Beijing’s Confucius thinking, and indicates that the two countries’ bilateral mutually beneficial interests in the region remain far short of the increasingly popular assumption of a brewing Arctic alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resources and transportation (that is, the future history of global maritime trade) are the two primary strategic interests driving China’s Arctic gambit. All components of the Arctic resource “prize” are of interest to Beijing and feature across various policy statements and indeed within China’s 2018 Arctic Strategy. As a burgeoning global trade power, the ability to cut logistics costs and, indeed, transportation times, is of central interest to China. Here, the Northern Sea Route (NSR) – largely hugging the Russian Arctic coastline – links Asia to Europe. Through the Arctic Ocean, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans are connected. Travel time between Asia and Europe via the NSR is about 23 days on average, compared with the Suez Canal’s 37-day average. In 2013, the first Chinese merchant ship transited the NSR and was the first container vessel ever to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s Arctic interest dates to 1925, when it acceded to the Spitsbergen (now Svalbard) Treaty. The treaty benefited the signatories economically by facilitating access to mining rights on the Svalbard archipelago, while agreeing to protect Svalbard from any military buildup. This Arctic archipelago’s scientific and research value was further tapped by China in 2004 when Beijing built the Yellow River Arctic research station – cementing Chinese presence in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the Xue Long (Snow Dragon), China’s first icebreaker, has conducted numerous Arctic research expeditions since 1999. Today, it is joined by Xue Long-2, China’s first indigenously built icebreaker. Murmurs of a nuclear-powered icebreaker about to roll off China’s production yard further point to Beijing’s growing polar capability. In securing observer status to the Arctic Council in 2013, China inserted itself into the Arctic governance ecosystem. But this does not place Beijing at the decision-making table – observers do not vote or lead multilateral discussion within the Arctic Council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond transportation, Beijing seeks to diversify its energy imports across the globe. This makes the resource-rich Russian Arctic Zone (both inland and offshore) an attractive component of China’s diversification strategy. While the Sino-Russian Arctic relationship is predicated on economic foundations, for now, Russia has yet to fall into Beijing’s “debt-trap diplomacy”. Moscow maintains stringent domestic legislation on joint ventures and ownership of sovereign energy deposits. This is a delicate balance. Russia relies on sustained future Chinese demand for Arctic liquified natural gas (LNG), but Moscow has also worked to diversify its capital pools. India, Japan, Saudi Arabia and South Korea are all linked to Russian Arctic energy ventures in one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China does not have a majority share in either of the two key LNG projects on the Russian Arctic’s Yamal Peninsula. Beijing’s share in the Yamal LNG venture is 29.9%, while Russia’s Novatek holds a controlling 50.1% and France’s Total holds 20%. In the Arctic-2 LNG project, China holds 20%, Novatek 60%, Total 10%, and the remaining 10% is held by a Japanese consortium. Russia’s upcoming Arctic energy projects, located in proximity to the existing Yamal Peninsula ventures Ob (LNG), Vostok (oil), Arctic-1 (LNG) and Arctic-3 (LNG), can be expected to attract diverse capital pools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, on the NSR or “polar silk road” front, Russia maintains the upper (controlling) hand. The NSR wraps along the Russian coastline for most of its route. This is important to Russia for two reasons. First, much of the NSR falls within Russia’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and therefore Moscow has deemed it necessary to charge transit tariffs. The tariffs have been accompanied by Russia’s introduction of tight rules and domestic laws for foreign firms looking to use the route. Second, Russia insists vessels can only navigate the NSR when accompanied by Russian nuclear icebreakers. Tapping into NSR potential is thus subject to strict Russian directives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The notion that there is a Sino-Russian Arctic alliance is a misinterpretation of the realities that drive China and Russia together in the Arctic&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While mutually beneficial interests – and the overall sense of “win-win” agreements – facilitate close engagement between Beijing and Moscow in the Arctic, it is still problematic to assume an Arctic “axis” is forthcoming. China’s efforts to increase its engagement in the Arctic are occurring far beyond the Russian Arctic Zone. Iceland was the first European state to sign a free-trade agreement with Beijing, and China’s first intergovernmental framework in the Arctic was struck with Iceland in 2012. Various Chinese state energy interests have been floated in geothermal resources in Iceland – but to date the projects have been abandoned. In 2018, the China–Iceland Arctic Science Observatory opened and continues to operate. Iceland strategically presents as a logistics hub that would act as a key shipping port between Europe and Asia along the NSR. It seems clear that Chinese Arctic strategy is to “internationalise” the Arctic in a way that features and promotes China’s strategic benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is also driven by great power ideology and the prestige afforded by having a global polar footprint. Russia is aware of this simmering rationale for Chinese Arctic strategy. Efforts by China to move beyond the agreed terms of its mutually beneficial arrangement with Moscow within the Russian Arctic Zone, and how closely China adheres to the existing legal and sovereign arrangements of the Arctic Ocean, will certainly be a litmus test for the Sino-Russian Arctic “alliance”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Sino-Russian strategic tensions remain, well beyond the overhanging fear of centuries of mistrust and the issue of the Russian Far East. In June 2020, Moscow accused one of its leading Arctic scientists, Valery Mitko, of spying for Beijing. Mitko was charged with treason for handing over classified information on Arctic research and submarine sensor technology to China. But perhaps more telling is the way that both countries have hushed up the incident, with neither formally commenting on the arrest. For now, Beijing and Moscow appear to agree to disagree – so long as Arctic LNG business is booming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The narrative of Moscow and Beijing working together to carve up the Arctic riches and take control of new global transport corridors has started to make its way into the policy and defence planning documents of Arctic-rim states. Washington’s litany of Arctic strategic planning documents – Naval, Air Force and Coast Guard strategies – feature renewed great power competition in the Arctic as a central security threat. However, the notion that there is a Sino-Russian Arctic alliance is a misinterpretation of the realities that drive China and Russia together in the Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The realities of the Sino-Russian relationship (dubbed by both as one of “mutual benefit”) in the Arctic is best grasped when the limits of the partnership are considered. There are, first and foremost, limits in terms of geographical boundaries. The Russian Arctic Zone is the lion’s share of the Arctic region, home to the NSR and a vast percentage of Arctic resources. The Russian Arctic Zone is also the geographical “limit” of Sino-Russian Arctic “cooperation” as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the eight members of the Arctic Council, Russia took the most convincing to grant China its observer status in 2013. Moscow approved membership, and with it, legitimacy, on the basis that Beijing explicitly acknowledged the sovereignty of Arctic-rim states and reaffirmed its commitment to the legal architecture of the Arctic region – the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia watches, with tempered suspicion, Beijing’s Arctic high sea missions and scientific research agenda in what China sees as a global commons. Yet within the Russian Arctic Zone, Russia welcomes Chinese engagement, but on Kremlin terms. Since 2014, with Western sanctions over Russia’s annexation of Crimea and sustained aggression in Ukraine, Moscow has had a cashflow problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite key economic strategic partnerships in the Russian Arctic, China is busy diversifying itself throughout the region. China is actively engaging with other Arctic-rim powers and has commercial ventures, investment plans and entrenched soft-power strategies in Norway, Canada, Iceland and Denmark (through Greenland).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Despite mutually beneficial interests in the Arctic, commercial realpolitik is at the heart of China and Russia’s engagement in the region&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s Arctic strategy is built on both economic security and frontier border security objectives. The Sino-Russian relationship lends itself to these economic security interests and ambitions, but it is less effective at navigating Russia’s Arctic “siege mentality”. This is largely because of the kind of increased interest and activity that China is undertaking in the Arctic – and against which Russia seeks to secure its vast open frontier. Any deterioration in Sino-Russian ties could threaten this delicate balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian efforts to securitise its economic interests in the Arctic fall short of an expansionist agenda. Beyond the posturing, ultimately Moscow’s Arctic priority remains regional stability. Continued regional cooperation with its NATO-member and Western Arctic neighbours remains a central strategic objective. After all, keeping the arena free of conflict is crucial to ensuring the NSR (and Russia’s future economic resource base) remains open and commercially viable. Russia needs to be able to deliver secure, trusted and unimpeded energy supplies from its northern frontier to Asian and European energy clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same cannot be assumed of Chinese Arctic interests, with clear indicators of an emerging expansionist agenda. While much of Beijing’s recent Arctic Ocean missions have been primarily about “raising the flag” and promoting soft-power public relations campaigns for domestic consumption, it is evident that China is set to stay in the Arctic. While much of the Arctic Ocean is delineated by territorial seas and agreed maritime boundaries, the central Arctic Ocean does hold international waters, which facilitates Chinese engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fragmentation of Sino-Russian relations in the Arctic context might yet emerge from the outcomes of the Arctic continental shelf debate. Via the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, Russia, Canada and Denmark have all submitted formal, yet overlapping, claims to this continental shelf. Should a claim be upheld, the awarded state will then claim exclusive rights to the seabed and the resources beneath the area of the North Pole. This would block China’s access to seabed or resources in the international Arctic waters around the North Pole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, continued efforts to put Moscow and Beijing in the same “basket” when it comes to great power competition in the Arctic “great game” is short-sighted and misses critical opportunities to futureproof the Arctic as a zone of international cooperation, collaboration and low tension. Sino-Russian Arctic ties will continue to be predictable to a large extent. Ties will remain mutually beneficial – until they are not. Predicting this point should be the priority for Arctic stakeholders. The problem appears to be, for now, that many stakeholders assume a fractured or fragmented Sino-Russian Arctic relationship does not exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia and China’s Arctic relationship is not an alliance – it is driven by “win-win” thinking. Such framing is extremely subjective and prone to change. Despite mutually beneficial interests in the region, commercial realpolitik is at the heart of their engagement. For now, the partnership in the Arctic navigates existing fault lines elsewhere, such as Beijing’s failure to acknowledge Russia’s annexation of Crimea and Moscow’s nonalignment in the developing India–China conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sino-Russian mutually beneficial cooperation and engagement within the Russian Arctic Zone is not a Sino-Russian alliance in the Arctic. In a somewhat Confucius-informed position, Beijing wants to “seek harmony and keep differences” when it comes to engagement with Russia in the Arctic. Both countries will remain engaged proactively and collaboratively across industrialisation projects, diplomatic relations and various commercial dealings in the Russian Arctic Zone. But when this “win-win” situation sours, Western Arctic states may indeed be faced with another Arctic security threat – a conflict between Russia and China in the Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;

The question is, “where will the money come from?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe finds itself at both a geopolitical and fiscal crossroads. On the one hand, the European Union is no longer in danger of collapse after a decade of crises. The bloc is beginning to play a stronger global role, with European Commission president Ursula Von Der Leyen endeavoring — and largely succeeding — to lead a “geopolitical commission.” But on the other hand, Europe is facing growing threats and acute challenges to both its security and its economic and governance model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the threat posed by energy dependence and climate change have awakened Europeans to the need to invest in both defense and the energy transition. Europe also fears the possibility that the United States will be less engaged in ensuring European security, especially under a potential second Trump administration. Additionally, the need to support Ukraine and facilitate its European future has revived the potential of EU enlargement, which will require considerable resourcing. Lastly, the rise of China and its predatory business practices has prompted the European Union to take economic security seriously and advance efforts to “de-risk.” As Mario Draghi aptly summed up in the Financial Times, the era of relying on the United States for defense, China for exports, and Russia for energy is over. The former president of the European Central Bank and former Italian prime minister posited: “The geopolitical, economic model upon which Europe rested since the end of the second world war, is gone.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the threat posed by energy dependence and climate change have awakened Europeans to the need to invest in both defense and the energy transition.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet Europe is also finding that this new era of geopolitical competition is costly. Despite having created a monetary union with a common currency, the euro, and a powerful central bank, the European Union lacks a fiscal union and a common fiscal policy. The entire EU budget is less than $200 billion per year (about 1 percent of EU GDP), with 33 percent of that money going to agricultural subsidies. It also has tight fiscal rules (the so-called Stability and Growth Pact) that limit debt and deficit levels for EU member states. A recently agreed reform increases spending flexibility, but the new rules also put pressure on member states to reduce deficits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the quandary facing Europe. It must meet the demands of this new geopolitical era, support Ukraine and strengthen its own defense, provide European public goods, and tackle the climate crisis, but it lacks the appropriate political and institutional mechanisms to fund these investments. The question is, “where will the money come from?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This white paper outlines Europe’s fiscal terrain and presents potential paths forward for the European Union. Whether Europe develops its collective fiscal capacities is of tremendous geopolitical importance and of relevance to the United States. NATO’s defense spending goal of 2 percent of GDP is directly tied to Europe’s fiscal landscape and EU fiscal rules. Moreover, Europe’s capacity to accelerate the energy transition, reduce its energy insecurity, increase its competitiveness, and ensure its economic security crucially depends on the creation of a fiscal union to finance European public goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe is thus at a crossroads. It will not fall apart, as feared in the previous decade, but it could easily stagnate economically and geopolitically without major advances in its fiscal integration. For the European Union — and therefore Europe as a whole — to become a relevant geopolitical actor, Brussels will need to develop its own fiscal capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;For the European Union to become a relevant geopolitical actor, Brussels will need to develop its own fiscal capacity.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;europes-fiscal-terrain&quot;&gt;Europe’s Fiscal Terrain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike in the United States, where the federal budget is much larger than that of individual states, countries in the European Union have relatively high levels of public spending relative to GDP (the EU average is around 50 percent, with some countries, such as France, well above that level). But the bloc, in contrast to the U.S. federal government, spends very little. Also, while U.S. states have credible rules for limiting spending and debt (precisely because federal spending is high), in the European Union such rules are not credible, which generates problems of excess debt and deficits in some member states. This prompted the creation of the Stability and Growth Pact in 1997, which stipulates that deficits should be below 3 percent of GDP and debt levels below 60 percent of GDP. However, these rules were suspended during the Covid-19 pandemic and have recently been reformed because there is wide consensus that applying them without substantial changes would force the European Union into austerity precisely when it needs fiscal flexibility to address its huge challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reasons for the differences between the EU and U.S. fiscal structures are historical. In the United States, political union came before monetary and fiscal union. In 1790, Alexander Hamilton, then secretary of the treasury, transferred the outstanding debts of the federated states to the federal government in exchange for a compromise where states promised to run balanced budgets. On the monetary side, it was only in 1913 that the Federal Reserve was created, inaugurating the contemporary structure of American monetary policy. Otherwise, federal spending in the United States grew as the need to finance public goods, such as defense and infrastructure, increased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the European Union, on the other hand, economic integration began in the 1950s, as most countries had already created or were creating their welfare states, which entailed taxes and spending at the national level. In that context, the EU budget, known as the Multiannual Financial Framework, was created. But it was envisioned — and still is — as a small complement to national budgets for common policies (including agriculture and cohesion funds). In fact, EU rules stipulate that the European budget, which is negotiated for periods of seven years, has to be balanced (i.e., contributions from member states and EU taxes, which are negligible, have to finance all EU spending, and debt issuance is not allowed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, efforts to invest in European public goods with strong positive externalities, such as decarbonization, digitalization, transport and energy infrastructure, or defense, are left to member states. This inevitably leads to shortfalls and discrepancies in investment due to the varying financial capacities of each country, conditioned by its debt and differing national priorities. It also makes pan-European, cross-border investments, whether in infrastructure or defense, more difficult. This creates a typical collective-action problem where joint European action that would benefit all is put on hold, leading to major gaps in European capacity. Not only can this tie the hands of the European Union, leaving it unable to take strong action, but it can also threaten the single market, creating significant disparities between European countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, the European Union (and in particular the eurozone) does not have a coherent and common fiscal policy, but a poorly coordinated one that prevents the adequate financing of many of the urgent European public goods that the new global economic and geopolitical reality makes increasingly necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not news. It has long been recognized that the lack of a common fiscal capacity is a significant gap in the European project. However, in the last year, calls for Europe to take the next step in its integration and develop a fiscal union are coming from increasingly prominent voices and in unexpected places. Leading them is Mario Draghi, who recently wrote in the Economist that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Europe must now confront a host of supranational challenges that will require vast investments in a short time frame, including defense as well as the green transition and digitisation. As it stands, however, Europe neither has a federal strategy to finance them, nor can national policies take up the mantle, as European fiscal and state-aid rules limit the ability of countries to act independently.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He further developed his ideas and called for a fiscal union in the 15th Annual Feldstein Lecture in 2023 (“The Next Flight of the Bumblebee: The Path to Common Fiscal Policy in the Eurozone”). But Draghi is not alone. International institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and a variety of thinktanks and academics have long argued that the European Monetary Union requires a fiscal (and also a political) union to be sustainable — an idea that is backed by significant historical evidence. More recently, Paolo Gentiloni, the European commissioner for economy, has suggested that the bloc establish a central treasury to finance common goods through issuing eurobonds in order to address massive spending demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Momentum is moving toward fiscal union. Should the European Union decide to develop its fiscal capacities, it would be emulating the history of U.S. economic integration. As Jacob Kirkegaard and Adam Posen write, “US national economic institutions formed gradually during the 19th and 20th centuries not only within the confines of a changing federal constitution but also often in response to the specific political events and natural disasters of the time” (emphasis added).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-europe-needs-to-spend&quot;&gt;Why Europe Needs to Spend&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current geopolitical environment provides a clear rationale for collective European investment. There are three clear lines of effort for greater EU spending: defense and foreign policy (including military and economic support for Ukraine), the energy transition, and economic competitiveness. These goals have proved exceptionally difficult given the fiscal constraints explained above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On defense, Europe faces an urgent crisis that requires massive expenditures. The European Union needs to not only support Ukraine’s war effort militarily, but it also needs to urgently rebuild its own militaries. As for Ukraine, wars are incredibly expensive and require massive fiscal outlays and expenditure. The European Union collectively has provided significant economic and military aid to Ukraine. But EU member states have now given away most of their stockpiles of ready military equipment, meaning additional military support for Ukraine requires buying from industry, which is more costly. Moreover, European militaries also require major investment to acquire immediate capabilities — to make up for present shortfalls and to ensure Europeans have the basic capabilities to defend themselves. European states need to spend not just to replace equipment given to Ukraine but also to drastically increase their own stockpiles. Yet, Europe also needs to invest in major capabilities over the medium and long term that both reduce and mitigate Europe’s dependence on the United States. These include the capacity to procure major enabling capabilities, such as air-to-air refueling, as well as invest in the next generation of weaponry, from fighter jets to tanks to air defense systems. This both requires an immediate injection of funding as well as a sustained financial pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While defense is a collective European problem, it is presently funded almost exclusively at the national level. This creates significant gaps in European collective military capabilities, leaving the European Union utterly dependent on the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While defense is a collective European problem, it is presently funded almost exclusively at the national level. This creates significant gaps in European collective military capabilities, leaving the European Union utterly dependent on the United States.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On energy, the needs are great not just for climate but for the competitiveness of European firms, especially in a context in which most great powers, including the United States through the Inflation Reduction Act, are heavily subsidizing energy and green investments. Europe needs to dramatically accelerate the green transition not just for climate purposes but to lower its energy costs, which now largely come from expensive hydrocarbon imports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe needs energy interconnections in order to increase the flexibility and resilience of its electricity system, as well as to be able to leverage the comparative advantages of the different member states in the production of different types of energy. For instance, Spain is becoming a major producer of solar energy, but this energy cannot currently be exported in large quantities to the rest of Europe due to inadequate transmission infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, a subsidy race has begun in the world economy for which the European Union is woefully unprepared. China has increased its support for all types of domestic manufacturing and technology industries, while the United States has revived its own industrial policy with generous support for green and digital industries. The situation is potentially pernicious for European industry because many of the U.S. subsidies consist of tax credits (which are much simpler to implement than European ones). Moreover, the American economy is not permeated with as much bureaucracy as the European Union, and, in addition, its trade and industrial policies contain a series of protectionist clauses that are incompatible with World Trade Organization (WTO) rules (“Buy American”), whereby only products almost entirely manufactured within the United States will be able to benefit from federal subsidies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European response cannot come from each of its individual member states because this would lead those with more fiscal space to inject public funds into their companies, thus undermining fair competition within the internal European market. Therefore, Europe’s response would need to come from industrial policies at the European level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all of these investments, the private sector has an important role to play. However, the fragmentation of European financial markets makes it difficult for private investment to adapt adequately to European needs and thus complement public investments. The European Union therefore will also need to promote the deepening of its banking and capital markets union and move toward the creation of a truly European, risk-free sovereign asset. But since financing public goods and risky investments requires that the public sector takes the lead, it is essential to increase the bloc’s public financial capacities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-europe-could-spend&quot;&gt;How Europe Could Spend&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address Europe’s challenges and to take on a larger geopolitical role, the European Union will need a substantial increase to its budget. In 2022, which is the latest official available figure, the bloc’s GDP was almost €16 trillion ($17 trillion) and the EU budget was €168 billion ($182 billion), equivalent to 1.1 percent of its GDP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union could increase its budget in three ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, member states could increase contributions to the EU budget.&lt;/strong&gt; Member countries pay the European Union every year based on their population and GDP, and those funds are then spent on common policies. To grow the EU budget, larger and richer countries would have to pay more. These countries are typically the ones that benefit most from the existence of the single market. In addition, since the European Union cares about economic convergence and social cohesion between its regions, it is logical that richer countries contribute more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the next EU budget negotiations will not take place until 2027. Member states could in the interim create off-budget vehicles to fund certain priorities. For instance, the European Peace Facility is an off-budget EU instrument, meaning it is not funded by the “EU budget” but by member states contributing at a national level to a separate pot of funds allocated toward a policy priority that benefits the whole bloc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second, the European Union could issue more joint debt.&lt;/strong&gt; More debt issuance at the central level raises complex legal and distributional questions. However, it makes little economic sense that the bloc is unable to issue common debt on a regular basis to finance some specific investments. All other great powers do it. Moreover, the experience of the Next Generation EU (NGEU) — the program launched in 2020 to finance the economic recovery from Covid-19, by which the European Union is issuing up to €750 billion ($814 billion) worth of debt and transferring funds to member states as grants and loans — provides a useful blueprint. In fact, if the European Union were to issue large amounts of debt, it could take advantage of economies of scale which would structurally reduce long-term financing costs and therefore increase the sustainability of national public debts. It would also increase the international role of the euro. There are growing calls from countries such as Estonia for the European Union to issue eurobonds to invest in defense and to provide aid to Ukraine. The issuing of debt for the NGEU program is also leading to investments in the green transition and economic competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debt-financing payments will come out of the EU budget, as they are intended for the NGEU. But increased debt-servicing payments will either require increases to the EU budget or difficult trade-offs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third, the European Union could introduce European taxes.&lt;/strong&gt; These are called “own resources” in the EU jargon because they are collected directly by the European Union. These new European taxes could be “green” taxes, tariffs (such as the Common Border Adjustment Mechanism), levies on multinationals’ profits (as agreed by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development), and levies on financial transactions. Another option, capable of raising much more revenue, would be to transfer a percentage of what member states collect in value-added tax (VAT) to the EU budget. In any case, more EU taxes would be politically difficult, as they may or may not imply lower taxes at the national level (using VAT solves this problem). But they might increase the centrality of the European Union in European politics because citizens would see more clearly that their taxes directly finance European public goods. In this sense, the American saying “no taxation without representation” in the European Union works backwards. There is representation (directly at the European Parliament) and indirectly at the European Commission and European Council, but Brussels has virtually no taxation powers. Approving these new “own resources” requires unanimity by member states, which is not easy, but it does not require treaty change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-political-challenge&quot;&gt;The Political Challenge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is momentum for more EU spending, there is also strong resistance inside the European Union to developing the bloc’s fiscal capacities. The major problem is resistance to the redistributive nature of fiscal integration and common debt issuances, particularly in wealthier Northern European countries. Opposition has become deeply entrenched politically, with claims that the NGEU was merely a “one-off.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difficulties of increasing the EU budget were demonstrated in December, when, despite all the pressing challenges, the increases requested by the European Union were cut. The European Commission’s initial proposal to add €99 billion ($107 billion) between 2024 and 2027 (€66 billion of grants and €33 billion of loans) was reduced to €66 billion (€33 billion of loans and €33 billion of grants), of which only €21 billion is new financing (the rest comes from existing EU funds).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the euro crisis during the 2010s, a divide was created between creditor countries in the north and debtor countries in the south that still persists and impedes consensus. Germany, the Netherlands, and other northern countries are particularly reluctant to mutualize risks and to create financial instruments that increase their solidarity commitments with southern countries, which exhibit higher levels of debt and deficits. They argue that until the usefulness of the NGEU funds can be assessed in 2027, it is premature to consider new joint debt issues. They are also unwilling to increase their contributions to the Multiannual Financial Framework due to tight domestic fiscal environments related to low economic growth, as well as for fear that this will increase support for extreme right-wing parties. The discourse in northern countries is still anchored in the need for rules and spending restraint to avoid the rise of extreme right-wing political groups, which continue to accuse the southern countries of being profligate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the fact that the European Union currently has a majority of center-right (and even some far-right) governments, whose liberal economic visions preach fiscal prudence and a reduced role for the state, also makes it difficult to reach ambitious agreements. Additionally, the ascendency of some far-right parties to positions of power in Europe may make reaching agreement on EU financing efforts extremely challenging. There are tremendous political hurdles to moving forward on fiscal integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it has become cliché to say that Europe is forged through crises. A crisis prompts the need for tangible action, which prompts European states to act. This was evident in response to the Covid-19 pandemic when the European Union bought vaccines for the entire bloc and allocated €750 billion ($814 billion) for its economic recovery, funded extensively through issuing joint debt. The security and energy crises caused by the war in Ukraine may therefore spur further action. The European Union will likely create a fiscal union, perhaps not by setting out with that goal but instead by seeking to address tangible and urgent issues, such as the need to arm Ukraine or accelerate the energy transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-road-toward-fiscal-union-a-permanent-fiscal-capacity&quot;&gt;The Road toward Fiscal Union: A Permanent Fiscal Capacity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that increasing the EU budget will be politically difficult in the short run, an alternative option could be to create a permanent fiscal capacity, which would function as an embryo of a European treasury. A permanent fiscal capacity would be an independent extension of the European budget. It would issue triple-A-rating debt backed by revenues from the European Union’s own resources, thus guaranteeing that the debt would be repaid (if there is political agreement, the issued debt could be rolled over indefinitely, as is the case for most countries with sound fiscal policies).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fiscal capacity would enable the European Union to respond to crises and urgent issues. It could also play a countercyclical role during crises for the eurozone as a whole, complement national automatic stabilizers, support investment in highly indebted member states, and finance specific European public goods with positive externalities, such as those outlined above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to create this permanent fiscal capacity would be the institutionalization of the NGEU as a common financing tool. The logic behind the instrument is simple. The European Union borrows and gives grants or “cheap” loans to member states to finance specific investments and reforms previously negotiated with the European Commission and approved by the European Council. The investments have to focus primarily on the green and digital transitions, as well as defense, and the reforms have to address recommendations that the European Commission makes every year to improve member states’ socioeconomic performance (the so-called “Country Specific Recommendations” of the European Semester).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The disbursement of the funds is conditional. It only takes place once member states have passed the reforms or started the investments. Therefore, it provides a positive incentive for reform: there is a carrot, but there is no stick. If a country does not pass the milestones and targets established in their Recovery and Resilience Facility agreed to with Brussels, it does not receive access to the funds, but it is also not fined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the NGEU funds can be improved in terms of efficiency control or agility in their provision, it would be a mistake to give up the possibility of extending the use of an already implemented and relatively successful (although improvable) mechanism such as the NGEU debt. Some countries insist on canceling the instrument and confirming this experience as a one-off, but the truth is that the current geopolitical demands go far beyond the mere economic recovery needs of Covid-19, which were the original justification for the NGEU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper’s proposed permanent fiscal capacity would imply transfers to member states similar to the current NGEU, but they would be demand-based and without preassigned amounts by country. They should focus on the priorities established above: defense, the energy transition, and competitiveness. Access to the permanent fiscal capacity should be subject to a stricter conditionality, better in terms of milestones, reforms, and assessment than that of the current NGEU mechanism. Governance and ownership should be enhanced through a coordinated decisionmaking process between the European Commission and member states, later ratified by both the European Council and the European Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, part of the spending coming from the fiscal capacity could go directly to European companies that develop investment projects instead of going through member states. This is particularly relevant for defense spending, trans-European infrastructure, and projects of strategic interest entailing substantial research and development investment. Direct procurement by the European Commission could speed up the projects, reduce the administrative burden, and help develop a culture of collaboration between companies from different member states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union will struggle to make progress in addressing the collective European challenges it is facing without massive investment. Yet it is trying to achieve vital goals — ensuring Ukraine’s survival, decarbonizing, rebuilding EU militaries, and enhancing competitiveness — without an adequate budget that supports these objectives, finances basic European public goods, and contributes to the macroeconomic stability of the eurozone. The current debate, however, is focused not on the financial tools needed to achieve preset objectives, but on reducing debt imbalances. While it is important for the European Union to ensure the long-term sustainability of national budgets, it is also important to gauge the financial capacity of the European Union as a whole to take on the current challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While it is important for the European Union to ensure the long-term sustainability of national budgets, it is also important to gauge the financial capacity of the European Union as a whole to take on the current challenges.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if the European Commission were to issue large quantities of debt on a permanent basis, the international role of the euro would be strengthened. The euro is already the second-most internationally traded currency after the dollar, but it still lags in terms of some of the key functions of an international currency, such as serving as a reference for private and official use. Beyond economic factors, the euro has also lacked the political support to become a more entrenched reserve currency. But things have changed. The erosion of the so-called liberal economic order and the increasingly hostile external environment have alerted the bloc’s leaders to the urgent need to bolster their defense and strengthen economic security. The euro is one of the remaining reliable foundations upon which Brussels can strengthen its geo-economic might. The euro, an orphan currency at its inception, can thus find more backing now than could previously have been imagined. Thus, a permanent fiscal capacity or a fiscal union in the European Union would greatly contribute to the project of making the bloc a geopolitical actor.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;前壹傳媒營運總裁周達權：黎智英將其名下離岸公司轉至陳梓華作為「酬勞」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（7日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第71日審訊。已認罪的陳梓華早上作供完畢，結束13天的作供。控方下午傳召前壹傳媒營運總裁兼財務總裁周達權出庭作供，他需就黎的控罪提供真實而全面的證供，來換取控方免於起訴。周提及黎智英名下有很多公司，包括力高顧問有限公司和 Lais Hotel Property Limited，其中力高是黎自資營運的私人公司，財務由黎和 Mark Simon 掌控。早前庭上證供顯示黎智英透過力高向陳梓華支付逾8萬元，以歸還陳去台北和英國的開支費用。就黎智英名下的離岸公司 LACOCK，自2020年1月起，陳梓華成為銀行戶口唯一簽署人，周轉述 Mark Simon 稱陳「幫阿黎生手做咗啲嘢」，所以黎「作為酬勞」把公司轉至陳梓華名下。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華稱國安法後黎智英繼續呼籲制裁 惟辯方質疑陳沒細閱文章內容&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已認罪的被告陳梓華第13天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。控辯雙方昨日均完成提問。其後在法官的提問下，陳稱在國安法生效之後，有在網上見到黎智英繼續呼籲制裁，包括推動「避風港法案」（Harbour Act），又邀請很多外國智庫和政經界名人來做訪問，以及在社交媒體上繼續發表意見。惟辯方代表之一、紐西蘭御用大律師 Marc Corlett 質疑，陳梓華只在 Telegram 上看過一篇或多於一篇的文章標題，便說黎有繼續呼籲制裁，可是他並沒有按進去連結來細閱文章內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方今繼續圍繞此話題盤問，陳承認很多黎智英的文章和訪談均沒有看過，但是他並不是只從文章或訪談去得知黎有繼續呼籲制裁。陳又指，在 Telegram 轉載一個連結的時候，該訊息不會只顯示標題，而是會顯示訪談或文章的摘要，所以他不只看過標題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳稱該訊息是在一個 Telegram 群組收到的，但他不記得是誰人傳送出來，印象中該人傳送連結的同時，有說「喺國際線上嘅新消息或新情報」，而連結內容是關於「外國政府可以限制中國的經濟發展」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華確認從朋友口中得知黎智英邀請外國人訪談-不知道黎有否節目中呼籲制裁&quot;&gt;陳梓華確認從朋友口中得知黎智英邀請外國人訪談 不知道黎有否節目中呼籲制裁&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於陳稱黎在《國安法》生效後推動「避風港法案」（Harbour Act），以及邀請外國智庫和政經界名人進行訪談，辯方質疑以上均是陳從朋友口中得知。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳則指「避風港法案」並非從朋友口中得知，而是他在壹傳媒大樓會見黎智英期間，黎講過「佢會喺美國爭取」，惟他當時不知道黎爭取什麼，後來從黎的私人助手 Mark Simon 得悉黎爭取的是「避風港法案」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就黎智英邀請外國智庫和政經界名人進行訪談，陳確認是因為朋友告知他，所以知道，而他並沒有參與任何相關訪談、不知道訪談內容，也不知道黎有否在訪談節目中呼籲制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3間涉案蘋果公司時任董事周達權出庭作供-獲控方豁免起訴&quot;&gt;3間涉案蘋果公司時任董事周達權出庭作供 獲控方豁免起訴&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方下午傳召前壹傳媒營運總監兼財務總裁周達權出庭作供。周在本案中沒有被起訴，他循法庭特別通道進入庭內，之後以非宗教形式宣誓。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周達權確認，他學歷至大學程度，自1993年加入壹傳媒集團，擔任財務主管；在2016年1月1日至2020年8月25日之間，他擔任壹傳媒集團的財務總裁；在2019年10月至2021年7月2日之間，他亦是壹傳媒的營運總裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周達權亦確認，在2019年1月1日至2021年7月2日期間，他是本案被告3間公司的董事，即蘋果日報有限公司、蘋果日報印刷有限公司及蘋果互聯網有限公司，也是壹傳媒有限公司的行政董事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年8月10日，周達權被警方以「欺詐」罪名拘捕，同日再以「串謀勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」罪拘捕，之後在8月11日獲警方批准擔保。至2020年12月2日，周與黎智英和黃偉強共同被控「欺詐」罪，涉及向科技園有限公司提供虛假陳述。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年6月24日，《蘋果日報》停運。至2021年7月2日，周辭去公司秘書和營運總裁，及至同年9月，他辭去壹傳媒內所有職務。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2022年2月16日，周獲控方發出「免予起訴令」，只要針對黎智英和黃偉強的欺詐、「串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示或複製煽動刊物」和「串謀勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」罪，提供真實而全面的證供，便可以豁免被起訴。在欺詐案件中，周經已出庭作供，黎和黃被裁定罪成，而周的案件則押後。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;周達權指作為壹傳媒財務總裁-需向董事局主席黎智英匯報&quot;&gt;周達權指作為壹傳媒財務總裁 需向董事局主席黎智英匯報&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就周的職責，周指他作為壹傳媒的營運總裁，負責確保整個集團能夠營運，亦負責廣告營銷。此外，他會協助時任行政總裁張劍虹管理資訊科技部門。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而作為財務總裁，周負責管理公司財務部和其他後勤部門，例如行政部、發行部和法律部。他指在職線上，他需要向行政總裁張劍虹、壹傳媒集團董事局和董事局主席即黎智英匯報。周指，黎智英有時會就廣告方面提供意見，也會問及一些公司財務問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周達權指，黎智英名下有很多公司，包括力高顧問有限公司（Dico Consultants Limited）、加拿大公司 Lais Hotel Property Limited 和公明織造廠有限公司（Comitex Holdings Limited）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;周達權指由力高顧問財政事宜由黎智英或mark-simon決定&quot;&gt;周達權指由力高顧問財政事宜由黎智英或Mark Simon決定&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就力高顧問有限公司，周確認他在案發期間以信託形式持有力高的股份，即是代表黎智英持有股份，而黎則是另一名股東和董事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於力高的財務事宜，周稱乃由黎智英或 Mark Simon 其中一人有決定權，有時較細額的帳目則由時任壹傳媒行政總監黃偉強決定，例如公司名下的汽車續保、續牌以及日常行政事宜。除此之外，力高所有其他開支都需要黎或 Mark Simon 批准。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示力高的文件，顯示力高銀行帳戶的授權簽署人是黎智英、Mark Simon、周達權和洪志強。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;力高透過支票向陳梓華支付約8萬元-周達權表示簽署時不知道詳情&quot;&gt;力高透過支票向陳梓華支付約8萬元 周達權表示簽署時不知道詳情&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又展示由力高簽發的支票，顯示抬頭是陳梓華，款項為80,273港元，支票簽署人為周達權和 Mark Simon。周憶述，當時有一個付款要求，而黎智英亦批准了相關付款，財政部同事開了一張支票，周遂簽署。惟周並不知道為何要透過力高來付款，黎也沒有談及相關支票。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;據陳梓華早前證供，在他的英國和台北之旅之後，黎智英把陳和林姓女示威者的旅程相關費用，以支票形式歸還給他，款項合共為80,273元。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英於2019年6月向mark-simon支付300萬元-周達權稱用以籌辦項目惟不知詳情&quot;&gt;黎智英於2019年6月向Mark Simon支付300萬元 周達權稱用以籌辦項目惟不知詳情&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示2019年6月由周達權傳送給黎智英的電郵，顯示2019年5月黎的個人開支報表，其中一筆是給予 Mark Simon 的300萬款項，用來籌辦專案項目，另有一筆200萬美元款項由黎智英匯款至 Lais Hotel Property Limited。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就300萬元款項，周稱他理解是給予 Mark Simon 籌辦一些專案項目：「我理解嗰時2019年6月，可能都係用嚟做吓一啲海外文宣。」惟法官李運騰指周現在是作供，只需要說出他所知道的事情，而不要猜測。周遂表示，Mark Simon 並沒有告知他該300萬元的用途，而且周也不知道該300萬元是從哪一個銀行戶口支取。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示2019年7月的電郵，顯示黎智英在2019年6月的個人開支報表，其中有一筆85萬元美金匯款至加拿大。不過周則表示，因為事隔多年，他不記得自己有否經手這一筆匯款，也記不起誰人或哪個機構是加拿大那邊的收款人。此外，報表顯示黎向壹傳媒支付了一筆貸款。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;周達權指力高沒有實際生意-是黎智英自資營運的私人公司&quot;&gt;周達權指力高沒有實際生意 是黎智英自資營運的私人公司&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，周知不知道力高的性質是什麼，是一間商業上活躍的公司，還是一間空殻公司，或是一間持有物業的集團公司。周則稱，按他理解力商「冇乜實際 business」、「我記憶中係冇乜定期收入」，但是持有一些車和船，以及聘請了一些員工。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官問，那麼力高成立的目的是什麼。周僅表示：「呢間公司喺我接手之前，已經有好多年喇。」周又指，按他理解力高是黎智英的私人公司，由黎自資營運。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;周達權指黎智英轉讓名下離岸公司lacock作為陳梓華的酬勞&quot;&gt;周達權指黎智英轉讓名下離岸公司LACOCK作為陳梓華的「酬勞」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指黎智英名下有一個在英屬處女群島註冊的公司 LACOCK，在香港有一個匯豐銀行本地戶口。控方指，根據控辯雙方承認事實，在2018年4月26日至2020年1月13日之間，黎智英、Mark Simon 和周達權是 LACOCK 銀行戶口的授權簽署人。由2020年1月14日開始，該銀行戶口唯一授權簽署人轉為陳梓華。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周達權指，LACOCK是一間離岸公司，「我記得呢間公司係唔活躍。」他記得，大約在2016年1月1日至2019年中左右，公司董事有黎智英及他本人；不過他不肯定自己有否持有公司股份，還是以信託形式持有公司股份，即「掛名股東」，但是他可以肯定的是黎智英百份百擁有這間公司。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周供稱，在2019年9月處理 LACOCK 的轉讓手續期間，Mark Simon 曾告知他，「呢個陳梓華，幫阿黎生手做咗啲嘢」，所以黎把公司轉至陳梓華名下，「作為酬勞」，之後周便沒有追問下去。電郵紀錄顯示，轉名手續在2019年12月完成。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周達權作供未完，案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

On this basis, the authors evaluate the policy options for the United States.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-hong-kong-matters-to-the-united-states&quot;&gt;Why Hong Kong Matters to the United States&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong has been a valuable partner to the United States for decades, and consequently, the United States has an important stake in the city’s future. Hong Kong is the 15th-largest export market for the United States and a top destination for U.S. consumer products. As of 2023, approximately 1,300 U.S. companies were based in Hong Kong, with banks, law firms, accounting firms, and other financial services the most prominent among this group. What is more, roughly 84,000 Americans live in Hong Kong, while about 250,000 Hong Kong–born immigrants live in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong’s long-standing business climate — characterized by open markets, judicial independence, rule of law, and the free flow of information — has helped embed the city at the center of global trade and investment networks and positioned it as a critical interface between mainland China and the rest of the world. Hence, beyond the bilateral commercial and people-to-people ties, Hong Kong has served as an entrepôt between the United States and the rest of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), playing a critical role in trade, investment, finance, travel, and legal services. Until recently, the people of Hong Kong enjoyed considerable civil liberties relative to those in mainland cities. As a result, beyond the clear utilitarian value of how Hong Kong has benefited the United States and the world commercially, support for Hong Kong’s political pluralism and vitality — and the human rights of the city’s residents — had long been core to U.S. policy toward the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet since 2019, Beijing has taken major steps to significantly erode the once-high degree of political, judicial, and economic autonomy Hong Kong has enjoyed since its handover from the United Kingdom in 1997. The most dramatic of these moves was the imposition of a sweeping national security law in 2020, the Law of the People’s Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (NSL), which marked the key turning point of a years-long effort by Beijing to extend its de jure and de facto control over internal elements of the city’s governance and way of life. The move followed several years of increasing social activism and demands by Hong Kong residents on a range of issues, including for Chinese authorities to fulfill their pledge in the Basic Law to allow for universal suffrage by Hong Kong’s population for the members of the Legislative Council (LegCo) and the chief executive. With major protests emerging during the “Occupy Central” movement of 2014, Beijing began to tighten its grip, culminating in the harsh crackdown on pro-democracy protests and marches in 2019. Authorities followed the NSL with electoral reforms to ensure that Hong Kong is governed by “patriots,” thereby disqualifying many viable candidates for no other reason than the perception that they are not sufficiently “pro-Beijing.” With these concerted legal and political efforts, capped by the recently adopted Article 23–based Safeguarding National Security Ordinance, Beijing has gone a long way to undermining Hong Kong’s “high degree of autonomy” promised in the Joint Declaration, weakening the civil liberties of its residents, and degrading the independence of its legal and judiciary system. Taken in total, these developments have substantially eroded the “One Country, Two Systems” (一国两制) framework that has been in place since 1997 and was supposed to remain intact until 2047, casting a pall over the city’s future as a regional — and global — financial and economic hub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing’s erosion of the “One Country, Two Systems” framework came at an inflection point in U.S.-China ties. When the NSL was adopted, Washington and Beijing were sparring over the origins of Covid-19, but tensions had grown in prior years. The Trump administration had jettisoned strategic engagement in favor of a more punitive approach, reflecting built-up frustration in Washington over China’s unfair trade practices, growing regional assertiveness, deteriorating domestic human rights conditions, and increased economic coercion. The events of 2019–2020 also took place amid growing concern in Washington about the centralization of decisionmaking authority in China’s political system under Xi Jinping and the entrenchment of a statist, security-driven approach to economic and political governance on the mainland. Since 2014, the Xi administration had been centralizing power in party organizations and overhauling the mainland’s national security architecture to address a host of perceived external and internal threats, while continuing to advance the country’s international power and influence. Anti-corruption campaigns targeting political rivals, a suite of new security policies, and crackdowns on civil society were part of this push.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against the backdrop of these developments, Washington and partner capitals tracked the growing activism and protests of 2019 and the subsequent 2020 NSL closely. Congress and the Trump administration quickly enacted punitive measures on individuals and entities involved in eroding Hong Kong’s autonomy, signaled support for the human rights and civil liberties of Hong Kong’s residents, and began to pare back privileges granted to the special administrative region (SAR) based on an expectation of its sustained autonomy — for example, by curbing differential treatment for Hong Kong relative to mainland China under U.S. export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid growing U.S.-China tensions on other issues ranging from technology to Taiwan, as well as the ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, Hong Kong features less prominently in today’s policy conversations. Its Covid-19 control policies arguably compounded this problem, as few international travelers could visit the city for three years. As a result, international perspectives on Hong Kong risk being out of step with the reality on the ground. With that in mind, this report aims to provide an objective analysis of Hong Kong’s status based on on-the-ground discussions with various stakeholders in the city, open-source research, and consultations with the business community, policymakers, and the Hong Kong diaspora.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two of the coauthors (Blanchette and Kennedy) visited Hong Kong in September 2023, and over nine days conducted 35 interviews with a wide range of stakeholders, including representatives from the Hong Kong government, former Hong Kong government officials, members of the LegCo, executives from local and multinational companies and financial institutions, university professors, local and international journalists, NGO leaders, and public interest legal experts. Interviews were also conducted with experts, members of the overseas Hong Kong community, and U.S. policymakers before and after this trip. These discussions were supplemented by wide reading of primary and secondary sources about Hong Kong, China, and U.S.-China relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of this project is to understand ongoing developments in Hong Kong’s political, legal, and economic environment; likely implications for the city’s future as a global business hub; and the options available for U.S. policymakers to preserve a productive relationship that advances U.S. commercial interests and is supportive of any remaining autonomy, consistent with Beijing’s international commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several key findings of this report:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An authoritarian turn in China under Xi Jinping has significantly eroded Hong Kong’s “high degree of autonomy” that was supposed to be maintained until 2047. These challenges are compounded by divisions within the SAR about its appropriate roles within China (and globally) due to growing U.S.-China geostrategic tensions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There remains some resilience of autonomy, and life in Hong Kong is qualitatively different than in other mainland Chinese jurisdictions. However, the overall trend is clearly in the direction of further erosion of autonomy across nearly all domains — the legal and political system and civil society, as well as the climate for companies and investors. Not all of this erosion can be captured quantitatively. Such change does not become obvious until one sees how on-the-ground actors are adjusting — often in subtle ways — to a new political-legal reality.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The U.S. government should reevaluate its current approach to Hong Kong and consider some adjustments. Its policy should be rooted in a pragmatic understanding of what strategies are likely to be most productive (or counterproductive) for U.S. interests and Hong Kong’s autonomy and resilience, rather than symbolic measures. The choice is between three broad policy alternatives:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Penalization. This approach would enact punitive measures against the individuals and entities most closely involved in the erosions of Hong Kong’s autonomy, seeking to raise the costs to Beijing for its behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Resignation. This would assume that Washington and partners are powerless to change clear trends toward erosion in Hong Kong’s autonomy, and it would seek to remove, incrementally, all policy exemptions giving the SAR special treatment under U.S. law.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strategic Engagement. This more proactive approach would seek to extend the SAR’s distinctiveness — and its remaining autonomy — within the PRC for as long as possible, by solidifying practical interactions between state and non-state actors in the United States and Hong Kong but also, when necessary, using punitive measures in a more targeted manner.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-pathway-to-the-current-dilemmas-over-hong-kong&quot;&gt;The Pathway to the Current Dilemmas over Hong Kong&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After over 150 years of British rule, Hong Kong reverted to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. This followed the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration (“Joint Declaration”), which set the conditions for this transfer. Beijing committed to permit Hong Kong a “high degree of autonomy” from the mainland for five decades, except in foreign affairs and defense. Beijing frames this arrangement as “One Country, Two Systems,” a national unification policy Deng Xiaoping outlined for Taiwan and Hong Kong in the early 1980s. Pursuant to the Joint Declaration, China’s National People’s Congress (NPC) enacted the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administration Region of the People’s Republic of China (“Basic Law”) in 1990, a de facto “mini-constitution” for Hong Kong. The Basic Law enshrined this “One Country, Two Systems” arrangement for Hong Kong’s governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For roughly two decades after returning to China’s control, the city enjoyed a relatively high degree of autonomy, facilitating its prosperity and success as a global business hub. Even as China, under Xi Jinping, took a more pronounced authoritarian turn beginning in 2013, Hong Kong’s courts, its civic freedoms, and its economic and regulatory environment all possessed relative autonomy. U.S. policy toward Hong Kong largely reflected this. Under the 1992 United States-Hong Kong Policy Act (USHKPA), Washington treated the Hong Kong SAR as distinct from the rest of China in trade, finance, immigration, and other fields based on the assumption that China was committed to maintaining the city’s autonomy through 2047. The USHKPA was designed to bolster the SAR’s autonomy through this distinct treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Beijing had incrementally made tactical curtailments of Hong Kong’s freedoms in the initial decade after the handover in 1997, its efforts intensified from the mid-2010s. These efforts fueled sequential local protests in Hong Kong. In 2012, for example, more than 90,000 residents, by one estimate, took to the streets to oppose proposed amendments to the city’s school curriculum intended to foster Chinese national identity. In 2014, hundreds of thousands came out to support universal suffrage as part of the “Umbrella Movement” — named for the use of umbrellas to defend against police pepper spray. A new high in public protest was reached in 2019, in response to a Beijing-endorsed legislative proposal to enable extradition to mainland China of criminals accused in Hong Kong. Then chief executive Carrie Lam later withdrew the proposal, but the repression of protestors drew global attention. As a result, the pro-democracy movement received greater public support; in the November 2019 district council elections, voters delivered the pro-democracy camp a majority of seats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This marked a turning point in Beijing’s approach, with the Xi administration apparently feeling that there was a political crisis emerging that could no longer be managed through traditional means and that fulfilling Beijing’s original pledge to maintain Hong Kong’s autonomy and widen suffrage would undermine China’s sovereignty over the city and erode Chinese Communist Party (CCP) control. In June 2020, the NPC Standing Committee bypassed Hong Kong’s legislature to impose sweeping national security legislation on the city. The NSL sent shockwaves through Hong Kong and the international community owing to its expansive conception of national security. It adopted broad and vague definitions for crimes such as subversion, terrorism, secession, and collusion with foreign forces, and it effectively criminalized public dissent of any variety. In the years since, the law has been used to disqualify pro-democracy candidates from public office, decimate opposition parties, curb media freedoms, and quiet public complaints about central government erosion of Hong Kong’s autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The events of 2019–2020, particularly the adoption of the NSL, accentuated the polarization of views among Hong Kong residents about the city’s future in ways that have continued in the years since. A central theme of this debate is over what it means to preserve Hong Kong’s way of life. Pro-establishment stakeholders highlight that Hong Kong has never been fully autonomous or a multi-party democracy in which political leaders were chosen through open elections. Moreover, in their view, Hong Kong residents are apolitical, and they value stability most of all. The push for universal elections, for this camp, is a deviation from the past and tantamount to advocating for a Hong Kong that is entirely independent from the PRC. Those who identify more with the opposition or “pro-democracy” camp point to the fact that although Hong Kong was never a democracy due to British rule, the city has a long history of rule of law, a vigorous civil society, an independent media, an open economy, and direct elections for a portion of the city’s political leadership. In their view, the move toward universal suffrage and opposition to the NSL was important for consolidating and protecting these underlying features of the city’s life. This division about the essence of Hong Kong and its future was on full display during this project’s interviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;signs-of-resilience-and-erosion-of-autonomy&quot;&gt;Signs of Resilience and Erosion of Autonomy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;defining-autonomy&quot;&gt;Defining Autonomy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of the 2023 trip was to assess how Beijing’s tightened grip has affected the city’s autonomy and to evaluate confidence among key stakeholders, such as foreign and domestic businesses, university faculty and students, and the general public, about the city’s future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One challenge in assessing the degree of backsliding in Hong Kong is formulating a clear conception of “autonomy” and determining what would constitute a “high degree” of local discretion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this analysis, autonomy can be conceptualized in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, differences in the way of life between mainland China and Hong Kong, in terms of political liberties, the legal system, social norms, and economic openness — in other words, the extent to which a “One Country, Two Systems” framework is evident in practice. The narrower the gap between these “systems,” the less autonomy there is for Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, the authority Hong Kong officials and members of society have to make their own decisions about the city’s way of life and its system. The more authority for keeping (or changing) this system that lies in Beijing, the less autonomy the SAR has.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two ways of measuring autonomy were referenced when evaluating trends in the city’s status. Through interviews, review of primary documents, and further research, this report identifies signs of retained resilience but also clear erosion of autonomy across three key areas: governance, the economy, and civil society. While in every instance it is a mixed picture, in most domains, more signs of erosion than resilience were evident, and the general trajectory is toward continued erosion going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;legal-and-political-environment&quot;&gt;Legal and Political Environment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ELECTORAL SYSTEM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most obvious loss of autonomy since 2020 is in Hong Kong’s political environment. Far from moving toward universal suffrage as promised under the Basic Law, Beijing now has almost total control of the selection of Hong Kong government authorities. Much of this relates to the adoption and implementation of the NSL and the use of older colonial-era laws to crack down on freedom of association and expression, as well as a set of electoral changes that were enacted in 2021. As one interlocutor shared, these reforms were designed to intentionally remove the “electoral” element from Hong Kong’s political system. Candidates must now be vetted for political loyalty to Beijing, with the aim of a city governed by “patriots.” In addition, the LegCo has been expanded (from 70 to 90 seats), while the number of seats elected directly by Hong Kong residents has been reduced (from 35 to 20). Further, the power of an election committee composed largely of Beijing-controlled organizations to vet and choose legislative candidates has been expanded. Later “reforms” to district council elections in 2023 likewise dramatically reduced the number of seats chosen directly by the populace (from around 90 percent, or 452 of 479, to around 20 percent, or 88 of 470), with most of the remainder chosen by the chief executive and government-appointed committees. Candidates up for election via direct vote must still be vetted for their political loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pro-democracy representation was largely snuffed out by the introduction of these rules, in effect disqualifying those with a history of criticizing Beijing or the Hong Kong government for departing from the political reforms promised in the Basic Law. Simultaneous to these electoral changes, pro-democracy lawmakers were detained for charges under the NSL. In 2021 (the latest LegCo election), only one non-establishment candidate was elected, representing a dramatic drop from 2016, when pro-democracy and centrist or localist candidates won a third of seats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several interlocutors suggested that these changes move Hong Kong’s legislature and district council closer to the mainland’s NPC model, with representation controlled from the top down and no real resistance to proposals from Beijing. Elections for seats in the legislative council and district council continue to be contested, but voter interest has declined precipitously in line with pre-vetting of candidates. In the recent district elections of December 2023, for example, voter turnout stood at a mere 27.5 percent, a new record low, down from a high of 71 percent in 2019 amid the pro-democracy protests. Turnout at the 2021 LegCo elections was a record low of 30.2 percent, down from 58 percent in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RULE OF LAW AND JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong’s strong rule of law tradition has long served as the backbone of its economic success, and in fact Hong Kong’s legal system remains qualitatively different from the one on the mainland in some important ways. Conservative voices interviewed for this report suggested that the then-forthcoming national security legislation, as stipulated under Article 23 of the Basic Law, would be necessary in part because Beijing has shown restraint in exercising its privileges to impose national laws on the SAR. For example, Beijing has not extended its Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law or Counter-Espionage Law to Hong Kong. Interlocutors in this Beijing-leaning group also cited Xi Jinping’s 2022 speech emphasizing that Hong Kong remains a Common Law system as evidence that Beijing is committed to preserving Hong Kong’s legal system and judicial independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, some suggested that Hong Kong’s national security law is not out of step with international practice; many Commonwealth of Nations countries have national security legislation of some variety. They highlighted specifics around the implementation and scope of the 2020 NSL — such as the fact that issuance of charges, warrants, and arrests under the law have been public and visible — to suggest that the legal system remains transparent. Of course, in these countries, national security legislation is embedded in an independent rule of law system that is accountable to voters and faces scrutiny from an independent media, so the comparison has only a superficial logic. Perhaps the most important distinction is that Hong Kong increasingly has less discretion to define its own local national security concerns in the face of Xi Jinping’s expansive framework of the “holistic view of national security” (国家安全观). While the final Article 23 national security law did not contain any references to Xi or his “outlook,” the “public consultation” document released in January by the Hong Kong government made explicit reference to both Xi and his “holistic view of national security.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One important measure of judicial independence is a record of court rulings that go against the Hong Kong government and the clear interests of Beijing. In a prominent case this past year, a judge blocked a government effort to ban the broadcast or distribution of “Glory to Hong Kong,” a song largely understood as an unofficial protest anthem, on online platforms such as YouTube. In recent years, Hong Kong’s courts have also fended off government challenges to the rights of same-sex couples. As another example, the Court of Final Appeal, the city’s highest court, overturned the conviction of a journalist accused of making false statements to access car registration records while investigating attacks on pro-democracy protestors in 2019. Despite high-profile departures in the years since the 2020 NSL, foreigners still serve as judges in Hong Kong’s Court of Final Appeal and foreign law firms remain among the most respected in the city, representing clients on a wide variety of issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Establishes new committee responsible for managing national security affairs in Hong Kong (12), chaired by the SAR chief executive (13) but supervised by and accountable to the central government in Beijing (12) — including through direct oversight by Beijing-vetted secretary-general (13) and national security advisor (15). Committee’s work is not subject to judicial review (14).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Sets up a powerful new central government office tasked with overseeing and supporting national security affairs in the SAR (48–53), with the power to take over national security cases in certain instances (55–56).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Vests power of interpretation of the NSL in the NPC Standing Committee (65).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Extends to a vast jurisdiction, including to alleged violations by non–Hong Kong residents overseas (38).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Requires all candidates for public office to swear oath of allegiance to the SAR (6) — a more expansive provision than in the Basic Law — and disqualifies those convicted for national security–related charges from running in elections (35).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Circumvents due process in trial procedures, including removing presumptive approval of bail (42), closed trials in certain instances (41), and appointment/removal of judges by the chief executive (44).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Commits the SAR to promoting national security education among public, including in schools, universities, and civil society organizations, in the media, on the internet (10).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Note: The numbers in parentheses refer to the relevant articles of the NSL. Source: Information gathered from the 2020 National Security Law.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, while Hong Kong’s legal system may remain qualitatively different than that of mainland China, there are signs of substantial erosion. The 2020 NSL clearly pared back judicial independence as well as due process. One need only look at the administrative build-out of NSL governance and security architecture, which formalizes Beijing’s influence over judicial affairs in the city when national security, broadly and vaguely defined, is concerned. The NSL stood up a new committee equipped with broad authority for national security matters in the SAR, led by the Beijing-aligned chief executive, accountable to and supervised by Beijing, and not subject to judicial review. Local authorities may hand-select personnel in law enforcement and prosecution to manage national security cases and appoint and remove judges to hear national security cases. The Hong Kong government may conduct NSL-related trials without a jury. The central government in Beijing also stood up an office to monitor national security matters in the SAR, and it can take over NSL cases under certain circumstances, including where a “foreign country or external elements” are involved. The NSL rests power of interpretation with the NPC Standing Committee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simultaneous with the build-out of the NSL architecture, older legislation has been repurposed to cover security-related crimes not covered by the NSL itself, including a colonial-era sedition law that remained dormant for 50 years. A large number of opposition activists and politicians have been pursued under the NSL and related ordinances in recent years. As of February 23, 2024, 291 people had been arrested for suspected activity endangering national security since the NSL was enacted. Of these, 174 individuals (and five companies) have been charged under either the NSL or other laws, and 111 have been convicted or await sentencing; 32 have been convicted or await sentencing under the NSL. Cash bounties have been issued for information leading to arrest of least 13 opposition figures and activists overseas, compounding an environment of fear even for activists who manage to escape Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first large-scale case under the NSL came in February 2021, when 47 pro-democracy activists were charged with “conspiracy to commit subversion” for efforts to improve pro-democrats’ electoral chances and force a positive government response to the ongoing protests. Of the 47 charged, 31 pleaded guilty. The trial for the 16 pleading not guilty began in February 2023, almost two years later. Their trial had no jury, and the three presiding judges were all appointed by the chief executive (with approval of a Beijing-controlled committee) under the NSL. Another prominent and ongoing case involves Jimmy Lai, a UK citizen and a long-standing critic of Beijing, charged under the NSL on counts of colluding with foreign forces and, under the sedition law, with publishing seditious material. Lai founded the Apple Daily, among the most popular newspapers in Hong Kong, which ran until June 2021, when it was forced to close after Hong Kong authorities raided and froze the assets of its publishing company under authority of the NSL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local lawyers suggest there is insufficient due process for those accused of security-related crimes. Authorities have the power to detain defendants indefinitely without bail as long as the crime in question is a national security–related one. Trials and pretrial detention times for political charges have been lengthy. Some of the “Hong Kong 47” defendants, for example, were jailed for nearly two years before their trial began. Jimmy Lai spent over 1,000 days in pre-trial detention. His trial was slated to begin December 2022, but was delayed a year after Hong Kong authorities rejected his choice of legal representation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual adoption in March 2024 of the Article 23–based national security ordinance provides additional evidence of the erosion of the SAR’s political autonomy. Local advocates argue that an additional version was needed to fill in the gaps of the 2020 laws passed by the NPC, to account for additional kinds of violations, including colluding with external forces, insurrection, sedition, and espionage. Moreover, they emphasize that because of Hong Kong’s Common Law system, implementation of the law would align with Hong Kong’s historic respect of due process. That said, the law is far from reassuring. It was sprung on the public with little warning, rushed through its review, and adopted by a LegCo bereft of diverse voices in a vote of 89–0. There is sufficient vagueness in terms such as “state secrets” and “external forces” that could give the Hong Kong government substantial leeway in charging and prosecuting defendants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Builds on 2020 NSL by targeting five offenses, broadly and vaguely defined — treason, insurrection, sabotage, “external interference,” and theft of state secrets and espionage (parts 2–6).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Empowers the chief executive to make subsidiary legislation deemed necessary to protect national security (110).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Gives police and courts power to extend pre-charge detention period, restrict access to lawyers in certain cases (76–78).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Allows major offenses, such as “sabotage” and “external interference,” to apply to persons for activities committed outside of Hong Kong (9).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Moves toward mainland’s broad definition of “state secrets,” to include “secrets” on the economic, technological, and social development of mainland China or the SAR (29).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;References “external interference” frequently throughout, consistent with SAR officials’ emphasis on protecting the city from “foreign forces.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DAY-TO-DAY GOVERNANCE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interlocutors shared various perspectives on the degree to which Hong Kong operates autonomously from Beijing in terms of day-to-day governance. One former top official suggested that the fact that the People’s Liberation Army has never been called on to intervene is a sign of Hong Kong’s sustained autonomy. Another former official emphasized a need for realism about the extent of autonomy that Hong Kong as “a local city,” like any city within China, would be granted under the PRC system (which is not a federal system). On the other side of the equation, interlocutors noted that Hong Kong’s civil servants are largely trained to be apolitical, which means they are not able to defend their self-interest and authority when challenged. Two interview sources outside the government suggested that self-censorship among authorities in Hong Kong is on the rise, and although officials may not be receiving direct orders from Beijing, they see it within their professional interests to try to guess what Beijing’s preferences are and to adapt accordingly. Such a dynamic, which is also not uncommon in the mainland, leads to officials often taking more hardline stances than Beijing has requested or potentially desires. While some interlocutors indicated that this dynamic is part of an “adjustment period” as Hong Kong navigates the post-NSL period, it seems likely that this is a lasting, not transient, trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economy-and-business-environment&quot;&gt;Economy and Business Environment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FINANCE AND MONETARY POLICY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong has long had among the world’s most vibrant financial sectors, which represents almost a quarter of the city’s GDP and employs over 7 percent of its population. Local authorities clearly want to preserve this reputation. Monetary policy, macro-prudential regulation, governance of the securities market, and maintaining the peg of the Hong Kong dollar to the U.S. dollar appear largely unchanged since the imposition of the NSL. Innovation in the financial sector remains a focus. Hong Kong is, for example, building out regulatory infrastructure for crypto assets. The city government has issued green bonds that align incentives in favor of decarbonization and instituted disclosure requirements to promote environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals. Government interlocutors pointed to Hong Kong’s role in resolving a U.S.-China audit dispute in 2022 — inspectors from the U.S. audit watchdog Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) reviewed Chinese audit documents on the ground in Hong Kong — to suggest the city was poised to remain a bridge between the mainland and international markets in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, financial sector resilience is not guaranteed. Political instability is a key concern for investors. Many clients of Hong Kong’s private wealth managers, for example, including clients from mainland China, have relocated assets away from the city to the benefit of other regional hubs such as Singapore. Looking ahead, foreign and local businesses and investors have expressed concern that Article 23 and uncertainties associated with broad definitions of key terms like “state secrets” may complicate the picture, jeopardizing research and acquisition of economic and financial data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond this, greater financial integration of Hong Kong and mainland China and involvement from Beijing in this integration are clear trends. “Stock connect” programs, launched before the NSL, enable cross-border investments between Hong Kong and mainland markets. These require extensive consultations with the central government and creation of special systems to allow funds from mainland China to enter Hong Kong’s capital market and economy. In mid-2023, the Hong Kong stock exchange introduced RMB-denominated shares, potentially aiding Beijing’s efforts to drive up use of the Chinese yuan overseas. In January 2024, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority introduced further measures to deepen financial links with the mainland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE REAL ECONOMY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trends in the real economy are a mixed picture. Hong Kong’s economy is still dominated by local private firms and remains deeply connected to global supply chains. The city’s formal approach to international commercial engagement has been stable since 2019, with few formal restrictions on flows of goods and capital. According to U.S. consul general Gregory May, foreign businesses have also been largely spared non-tariff barriers to trade (unlike the situation on the mainland). Businesses involved in pro-democracy activism have encountered trouble, but Hong Kong remains a substantially freer economy than the mainland (ranked second globally in a long-running index).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong authorities appear determined to retain this status, and they still clearly consider the city the connective tissue linking China and the rest of the world — not just through trade but also through arts, sciences, and technology. Hong Kong has signed 250 bilateral agreements with other countries in areas covering trade, taxation, and investment protection and promotion. The SAR is applying to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). Chief Executive John Lee frequently refers to the city as a “super-connector” in China’s international relationships (aligning with terminology deployed by Beijing).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even so, research for this report revealed declining autonomy in many areas that will likely jeopardize Hong Kong’s economic resilience going forward. Local officials with whom the authors spoke were careful not to directly criticize Beijing’s economic policies. They blamed the pandemic and U.S.-China tensions for Hong Kong’s economic troubles over the past years, not policies from Beijing. Similarly, the authors witnessed limited willingness of officials and others in Hong Kong to offer alternative estimates of China’s economic growth rate or challenges that differ from official data and positions. Such differing assessments were common in the authors’ previous engagements with Hong Kong officials in the pre-NSL period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong is aligning with the positions of mainland China in international economic bodies as well. In 2021, Hong Kong stepped in to block the election of an official representing “Chinese Taipei” (the name Taiwan uses when participating in international bodies) to serve as the chair of the World Trade Organization (WTO) government procurement committee, aligning with Beijing’s declared position. The election was uncontested and most other parties were in support. Pro-Beijing interlocutors claimed the Hong Kong position was made on its own, not directed by Beijing. But many capitals have warned that such trends amplify Beijing’s voice in international bodies. Further, interviews also revealed that Hong Kong authorities do not believe Chinese Taipei has a right to join the RCEP — another sign of alignment with Beijing’s positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, the SAR government is driving forward greater economic integration with the mainland, a trend that aligns with the Xi administration’s articulated priorities for the national economy. Many interlocutors highlighted the “Greater Bay Area” (GBA), which connects Hong Kong, Macau, and nine cities in Guangdong, and they identified specific policies designed to promote regional integration and innovation. One was the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Cooperation Zone, announced in 2017, which follows a “one zone, two parks” model purportedly to reflect a “One Country, Two Systems” framework. Yet the clear intent is to reduce the relevance of the boundary between Hong Kong and the mainland. Beijing has been explicit about leveraging Hong Kong’s international reputation and positioning to advance national priorities, such as industrial and technology upgrading. Indeed, the GBA intends to incubate technology companies and research institutes in areas critical to Xi’s high-tech vision, such as semiconductors, AI, aerospace, and biomedical technology. Yet when various Hong Kong officials were asked how coordination within and among the GBA localities would work, there was little by way of concrete — or convincing — answers. It is arguably the case that Beijing would play a key role in facilitating GBA integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relatedly, interviews for this report demonstrated greater interest than ever before among Hong Kong authorities in the need for industrial policy to promote the city’s role in various industries, including ICT and pharma. Government interlocutors referred frequently to “blueprints” and “plans” for R&amp;amp;D and innovation, including joint efforts with the mainland. Despite making integration with Shenzhen and other mainland cities in the GBA a priority, officials were hard pressed to marshal evidence that the initiative would actually strengthen Hong Kong’s economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a sign of closer integration, for the first time in at least 30 years companies from the mainland with regional headquarters in Hong Kong outnumbered U.S. ones in 2022. U.S. firms operating in Hong Kong have fallen continuously in the past years, reflecting growing anxiety among the U.S. business community. Eighty percent of U.S. businesses surveyed by the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) HK in late 2021 said the NSL had impacted their operations. While many U.S. firms and investors plan to remain in the city, less than a third of U.S. companies surveyed by AmCham HK at the end of 2023 planned to expand investment in the next two years. Aside from U.S.-China ties and a slowing Chinese economy, challenges related to the political and legal environment ranked high among the list of complaints. Some business travelers now revert to “burner” devices when traveling to Hong Kong — mirroring a common practice for the mainland — due to concerns about government surveillance. Crackdowns on due-diligence and consulting firms on the mainland, including the Mintz Group and Capvision, and Beijing’s increasingly draconian approach to security have not helped investor confidence in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;civil-society&quot;&gt;Civil Society&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space for Hong Kong’s once vibrant civil society has shrunk substantially in the past years. According to major indices tracking freedom of expression, assembly, and association, Hong Kong’s position has worsened substantially since 2020, although the situation remains qualitatively different from any mainland city. Criminal charges under the NSL and other security-related legislation, high-profile detainments, and the risk of legal difficulties have led to the closure of many independent news outlets and NGOs either by force or preemptively, while journalists, academics, and activists operate in an environment of self-censorship and fear. This trend has accelerated in the wake of the Article 23 national security law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NGOs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to NGO interlocutors, conditions have deteriorated considerably, and NGOs are reportedly dissuaded informally from engaging in policy advocacy. Many civil society organizations, particularly those with international connections, have been forced to disband or relocate. A 2023 report from Amnesty International estimated over 100 civil society organizations have left or been shut down since the enactment of the NSL in July 2020. The group itself famously closed its two offices in Hong Kong in October 2021, citing the NSL which “made it effectively impossible for human rights organizations in Hong Kong to work freely and without fear of serious reprisals from the government.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For civil society groups that continue to operate in Hong Kong, barriers to resourcing and operations have grown. Amended guidelines for charitable groups specify that any group that “takes part in acts or activities . . . contrary to the interests of national security” will not be qualified (or will be disqualified) as a charitable organization. The bounds of acceptable behavior have become more uncertain, given the vague and expanding definition of national security and sensitivity to it under both national security laws and related legislation. Civil society organizations report challenges in obtaining essential services, as providers increasingly worry about running afoul of security restrictions, according to those interviewed for this report. Those receiving international funds, hiring non-local staff, or having overseas connections worry about the potential application of the joint national security laws (which cover foreign collusion) to their work. In a high-profile case illustrative of government paranoia and associated risks for NGOs around foreign engagement, Hong Kong national security authorities in March 2022 pursued a UK-based NGO (Hong Kong Watch) for breach of the NSL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MEDIA AND PUBLISHING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Media freedoms are also generally on a downward trend, although local and international journalists interviewed felt that the reporting environment in Hong Kong is still more open than in the rest of China. This is a relatively low bar, however, given that Beijing has kicked out a substantial portion of the U.S. press corps in the mainland. Hong Kong’s English and Chinese press still run stories about Chinese politics, economics, and society that would not be able to run in the mainland. Journalists remain able to conduct interviews and cover most events largely free of harassment, interlocutors shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, the NSL and the revival of colonial era anti-sedition laws have left a clear mark. On an index of press freedom from Reporters Without Borders, Hong Kong dropped from 58th in 2013 to 140th in 2023, of the 180 countries and territories included. Prominent independent news outlets have been forced to close, with leadership staff arrested. Most notable was Apple Daily in June 2021, but Stand News (a free online news site that adopted a generally pro-democracy editorial position) was also forcefully shut down that year. At least five other independent media outlets chose to close, citing heightened risks for staff. Public broadcaster Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) overhauled its programming under new pro-government management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign publications have gotten in trouble for routine coverage of political events. Hong Kong authorities, for example, reprimanded the Wall Street Journal and New York Times in December 2021 for publishing op-eds on Beijing’s bid to prevent low turnout during the city’s inaugural “patriots only” LegCo election that month and warned they may be guilty of “incitement.” Some journalists shared that the breadth of stories Hong Kong media can cover has narrowed significantly, particularly concerning sensitive topics such as the Hong Kong government, the question of autonomy, and the NSL. Corporate and government records once available to journalists have been shut down or made more difficult to access, interlocutors shared. Foreign journalists who covered the 2019 pro-democracy protests have had visa applications or renewals denied. The New York Times, prominently, moved a third of its Hong Kong–based staff to Seoul following imposition of the 2020 NSL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changes have contributed to a climate of fear and self-censorship. The Foreign Correspondents’ Club of Hong Kong, for example, suspended its annual Human Rights Press Awards in 2022 out of concern that its plans to recognize the pro-democracy outlet Stand News would put staff and members at risk under the NSL and anti-sedition law. A string of arrests under the laws have accentuated the climate, including most notably that of Jimmy Lai. Some journalists and editors simply choose to avoid stories that may be seen by the Hong Kong government or Beijing as too sensitive even in the absence of any codified prohibition. Better safe than sorry is a posture that many have adopted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While bookstores still have a range of books, particularly in English, the spectrum of views in Chinese-language books and periodicals in particular has narrowed considerably, as has the distance between the types of material that one would find in Hong Kong versus mainland Chinese bookstores. There are no longer books available that dig into the professional and personal lives of Chinese officials, for example, and there is a narrower range of books on China’s political history. Instead, more copies of the collected works of Xi Jinping and CCP documents fill the shelves of bookstores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UNIVERSITIES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At universities, the formal tenure and promotion systems, open library access, and curriculum structure largely remain intact from the pre-NSL days. Some university leaders (presidents, provosts, and deans) have shown substantial courage to protect their universities, schools, programs, and students while faced with significant external pressure to limit research, push out heterodox views and faculty, and circumscribe debate and exploration among students. One source said that the worst time for university life was in 2020–2021, but that the situation has stabilized since then. A dependable source said that law schools have been largely able to preserve academic freedom, with their curriculum remaining the same as prior to 2019. Cooperation remains between Hong Kong law schools and those in the West, including the University of Pennsylvania, Harvard, and Columbia, among others, one source shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although formal systems protecting academic freedom remain intact, both external and internal pressures threaten the future of Hong Kong’s globally respected universities. There has been substantial pressure on universities to voluntarily introduce “patriotic” coursework to stay in the good graces of city authorities and Beijing. In August 2022, after Xi visited Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Education Bureau distributed thousands of copies of his speech to schools across the city. Interviews with relevant parties revealed that the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) “reorganized” its Universities Service Center for Chinese Studies to make its collection of Chinese documents unavailable to scholars in Hong Kong, and that online forums for students and teachers have been closed down or made unavailable in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Informal pressures on academics to self-censor have grown. Interlocutors said that on some campuses, “patriotic” faculty members have started social media and whisper campaigns to attack other faculty members and block promotions, some of whom have responded by leaving those universities and Hong Kong altogether. Prominent scholars have faced disciplinary action from Hong Kong authorities or from universities themselves. Soon after NSL enactment, the University of Hong Kong’s governing board moved to fire key 2019 protest organizer Benny Tai under pressure from pro-Beijing lawmakers. Academics now worry about being overlooked for tenure or having their contracts cut short for political expression. University community members interviewed for this report also expressed concerns about the how the Article 23 NSL, which had yet to be passed at that point, could further chill Hong Kong’s research environment by adding uncertainty about what topics and research methods may violate national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These changes have catalyzed a brain drain and created a less robust and diverse academic ecosystem. Indeed, research showed that most new applicants for open positions in social sciences and humanities are PRC citizens with Western academic training, with a major drop in applications from scholars from Europe and North America. One of Hong Kong academia’s traditional strengths is that it attracted top-tier talent from around the world, so a diminishment of that advantage would be a great detriment to the city’s human capital. The 2022–2023 period saw the highest turnover in 20 years at Hong Kong’s eight government-funded universities, with 380 academics leaving, marking a 7.6 percent increase from the year before. Quality scholarship on a range of issues beyond domestic Chinese politics and society is at stake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FREEDOM OF RELIGION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the 2020 NSL and the 2024 Article 23 national security ordinance raise worrying questions about the protection of religious freedom in Hong Kong. In October 2022, Pastor Garry Pang Moon-yuen was jailed for a total of 13 months after being found guilty of sedition and seditious speech. In May 2022, 90-year-old cardinal Joseph Zen Ze-kiun was arrested under the NSL on the charge of “collusion with foreign forces.” Later that year, Zen and five others were found guilty of failing to register a fund that supported individuals arrested in connection with the 2019 protests. Given the focus from the twin national security laws on punishing individuals who support or aid ill-defined “external interference,” the space for Hong Kong’s vibrant Catholic community is certainly at risk, given that it communes directly with Rome (as opposed to the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association in the mainland). As Cardinal Stephen Chow Sau-yan stated in a 2023 interview, “If you come out with something that violates the national security law, then that’s a problem.” He added, “In the past, you could freely say whatever you want. Now you have to be careful how you say it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong is not yet like a regular city in mainland China, but the trajectory is clear and worrying. Areas of resilience remain, but in ways that look largely unsustainable, for example, coming down to the impressively brave behavior of discrete individuals, such as university administrators fighting off curriculum changes. As one analyst shared, Hong Kong is perhaps closer to how Chinese cities operated in 2004–2005 under Hu Jintao: when governance was less ideologically oppressive, there were more open consultations with government authorities, civil society organizations were constrained but growing, and village leaders were chosen through direct elections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The text of the Joint Declaration and elements of the Basic Law indicate that Hong Kong has certain political, social, and economic rules and practices that will remain different from the rest of China, and the decision of whether (and how) to change them rests in part with the officials and people of Hong Kong. However, the reality appears to be that when push comes to shove — both figuratively and literally — the extent of autonomy that Hong Kong authorities have is determined unilaterally by Beijing. Hong Kong can propose how the boundary is drawn and what powers its officials have, but it can only do so through requests. In an interview for CSIS’s China Field Notes podcast, LegCo member Regina Ip noted that Hong Kong could make proposals to and have consultations with Beijing, but that policy across a wide range of domains was ultimately at Beijing’s discretion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within Hong Kong, there is debate about the city’s future and whether the developments of the past years have been positive or negative. There is a clear divide between conservatives, who believe Hong Kong is finally stable and better than it has ever been, and liberals, who believe the city’s vitality is in the process of being snuffed out. One person with a conservative perspective said, for example, that “the ‘one country’ part of ‘one country, two systems’ was ignored by everyone, but things are much better now.” By contrast, liberals are deeply disheartened. One shared that they feel Hong Kong now is a “semi-police state.” They sense a drumbeat toward the city’s “mainlandization.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The distribution of views on these issues is difficult to discern. For one, elections no longer address these questions. Campaigns at the district level, for example, largely focus on bread-and-butter issues with debates about Hong Kong’s degree of autonomy and critiques of Beijing’s oversight largely off limits. Low turnout at elections since the NSL may reflect silent protest, but it may also simply reflect disinterest in politics as elections become less consequential. Public opinion polls on these topics are also a thing of the past, for the same reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of this trajectory, there has been an exodus of Western expatriates and their families from Hong Kong. In a keynote address at CSIS in January 2023, U.S. consul general May estimated that 15,000 U.S. citizens — representing 20 percent of the American population in the city — had left Hong Kong over the past two years, for reasons that included Covid-19 lockdowns but also Beijing’s ongoing crackdowns on democratic freedoms and those who advocate for them. Those who remain do so for distinctive personal and professional reasons that set them apart from many of their colleagues. Very few Westerners are moving to Hong Kong. For the population overall, at least a third of Hong Kong residents suggested interest in emigrating overseas in late 2023. At the same time, the number of mainland Chinese moving to Hong Kong has grown. One consequence is that Mandarin is now far more common than in years past, and Cantonese is far less commonly heard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications-for-us-policy-options&quot;&gt;Implications for U.S. Policy Options&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Washington adjusted its approach to Hong Kong in light of the events of 2019–2020. Congress passed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 (HKHRDA) before the NSL, in response to the proposed extradition bill and ensuing pro-democracy protests. The effort was intended to signal U.S. support for human rights and democracy and to pressure Hong Kong authorities to shelve the bill — requiring, among other measures, the secretary of state to certify annually whether Hong Kong remains sufficiently autonomous to justify special treatment under U.S. law (and authorizing the president to revoke privileges if not). Soon after the NSL was passed, Congress passed the Hong Kong Autonomy Act (HKAA) to sanction officials and entities contributing to the erosion of Hong Kong’s autonomy. Through executive action following the HKAA, the Trump administration sanctioned individuals involved with the NSL and decertified Hong Kong’s special status under U.S. law, pursuing several measures to remove policy exemptions for Hong Kong relative to the PRC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. policy toward Hong Kong remains rooted in a determination to support the SAR’s autonomy, prosperity, and way of life; to protect American individuals and firms in Hong Kong; and to promote the human rights and democratic freedoms of Hong Kong residents. Even as international attention to Hong Kong has declined, the city’s status continues to evolve. The most prominent recent development is the passage of Hong Kong’s own national security legislation, under Article 23 of the Basic Law (the repeat of an effort stopped by public protest in 2003). In past years, Beijing has also continued to flesh out its security apparatus to reflect heightened vigilance around perceived domestic and external threats — broadening the definition of “state secrets” and espionage, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given these dynamics, it is an appropriate time for Washington to revisit its approach to Hong Kong. This report identifies three alternative approaches for U.S. policymakers to consider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Penalization.&lt;/strong&gt; One option is a “penal” approach, rooted in punishing Beijing for its encroachments on Hong Kong’s autonomy. This strategy arguably most closely mirrors the U.S. approach over the past few years. Washington has sanctioned PRC officials and those Beijing has appointed to positions of authority in Hong Kong, including SAR chief executive John Lee. Such sanctions are aimed at raising the costs to Beijing for its behavior. Some argue Washington has further to go, for example shutting down or limiting privileges of Hong Kong Economic and Trade Offices (HKETOs) in the United States or imposing new sanctions on individuals involved in Article 23 formulation. One risk of this penalization strategy is that it could further erode Hong Kong’s economy, by, for example, pushing sanctioned Hong Kong officials closer to Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resignation.&lt;/strong&gt; Another alternative, what might be called “resignation,” would be based on the fact, as detailed in this report, that Hong Kong’s autonomy is on a trajectory of erosion that is likely to continue as long as Xi Jinping leads the CCP. Observers will likely see greater explicit presence of the CCP in Hong Kong, less meaningful elections, narrower space for civil society, more restrictions on information and the media, intensified promotion of “patriotic” education, continued undermining of academic freedom at universities, and a greater use of industrial policy and state tools for economic policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given these trends, the United States could accept and adapt to this reality by removing, step by step, all the policy exemptions that give Hong Kong distinct treatment from China under U.S. law and instead interact with the SAR as just another city in the PRC. There is already evidence of this approach. In line with the Trump administration’s decertification of the SAR’s special status under U.S. law in 2020, U.S. Customs and Border Protection required all goods imported from Hong Kong to use the label “Made in China,” rather than “Made in Hong Kong,” for example (which the WTO later ruled a violation of international trade rules). This broader strategy would translate into wholesale changes in bilateral relations across trade, investment, travel, law enforcement, and other areas. Under this approach, the United States would also oppose Hong Kong’s participation in international organizations, including the WTO, International Monetary Fund, International Olympic Committee, and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The upside of this strategy is that it conforms to the SAR’s most likely trajectory and accepts that Washington and partners are powerless to change that larger trend. Underlying historic U.S. Hong Kong policy was an assumption that China had committed to maintain the SAR’s autonomy until 2047 in ways that justified having a separate relationship with Hong Kong. A resignation strategy acknowledges that the transition period to full takeover by Beijing is over prematurely, and that the facets of political life, the economy, and civil society that made Hong Kong unique are disappearing and unlikely to return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downside of this strategy is that it risks accelerating Hong Kong’s loss of autonomy in every dimension. Beijing will likely conclude it has no choice (or even see this as an opportunity) but to install the CCP more rapidly and make other changes to Hong Kong’s political economy (including eliminating the Hong Kong dollar, for example). While it is right to blame Beijing for Hong Kong’s eroded autonomy thus far, it is worth asking whether pushing the city closer into Beijing’s orbit is in Washington’s strategic interests. In the authors’ view, this is a “feel good” strategy that is unlikely to bring substantial benefits for the United States. Criticizing foreign judges for serving in Hong Kong, for example, may inadvertently reduce safeguards against erosion of judicial independence. Even if this strategy weakens Hong Kong, the SAR’s overall economic heft is small enough on a relative perspective that it will be unlikely to hurt Beijing much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic Engagement.&lt;/strong&gt; The other alternative is to pursue strategic engagement with Hong Kong, across as many domains as possible and for as long as possible, in order to extend the SAR’s distinctiveness, if not pockets of autonomy, within the PRC for as long as possible. The existence of a Hong Kong that runs according to somewhat different rules than the rest of China is a model for other parts of China to see, a place within China with access to a variety of ideas and information and where there are greater legal protections for international business. The U.S. goal here would be to help Hong Kong remain a modest island of openness in relative terms within an authoritarian socialist country. This approach, even while creating immigration and asylum pathways for Hong Kong residents wishing to leave, recognizes that the vast majority will stay in the city — and it is important to support their freedoms. It also recognizes the value that people from all sides in Hong Kong place on a strong and unique relationship with the United States. Furthermore, the strategic engagement approach should not shy away from punitive measures where appropriate, as well as public criticism of further backsliding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this perspective, while sanctions and other punitive measures must remain on the table, the most appropriate U.S. strategy would be to focus on strengthening practical interactions between the United States and Hong Kong. This could include government-to-government communication and dialogue, but it would most certainly involve expanding societal level connections. It would be important to bring a wide range of voices from Hong Kong to the table, both those with pro-government positions and those who are much more critical of the current trajectory — including those forced, for at least the moment, to reside outside the SAR. Track-1 and Track-2 dialogues between U.S. and Hong Kong officials, businesses, universities, think tanks, the media, civil society organizations, and others would go a long way toward reducing misunderstandings on policies and their motivations. Reinstating Fulbright exchanges to and from Hong Kong would be a valuable part of this approach. The overall goal is to slow, where possible, Hong Kong’s slide away from autonomy by reinforcing the connective tissue between the United States and all key actors in Hong Kong, government officials and pro-democracy activists alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deciding how to choose from among these three options is far from easy, as it requires a sense not only of Hong Kong’s trajectory but also of what would be most effective in the long run, not simply in reaction to any specific development or crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with China policy more generally over the past five decades, Washington adopted an engagement policy toward Hong Kong for many years. However, whereas the approach toward China as a whole was geared toward trying to coax reform within China and integrate it into the international system, engagement with Hong Kong was driven not by a goal to change the city, but rather to use the United States’ limited leverage to preserve the city’s economic and social openness for as long as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hong Kong of 2024 looks substantially different than that of 2020, let alone 1997, when the city reverted to PRC sovereignty. The SAR’s autonomy has been substantially eroded by Beijing’s tightening grip. An increasingly closed-off, security-focused Xi administration looks unlikely to reverse course — for Hong Kong or for the country as a whole. This trajectory has resulted in a wave of U.S. sanctions aligned with the penal approach, geared to punishing Beijing and its local allies for reversing course on One Country, Two Systems. The “resignation” approach would extend this logic further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The view of this report’s authors is that a policy built entirely around punishments or giving up on Hong Kong would be counterproductive and result in the further undermining of whatever autonomy remains. As this report has shown, spots of resilience persist, and the best policy approach to managing the challenge of Hong Kong will be rooted in a strong understanding of how its citizens, government authorities, businesses, and civil society organizations envision their city’s future. There remains substantial debate within the city (and among its residents who have moved abroad) about whether developments of the past years have been positive or negative for Hong Kong and how the rest of the world, including the United States, should respond. Although there may be a need for sanctions in certain instances, symbolic opprobrium need not be the central tenet of U.S. policy. Washington would be wise to focus on sustaining what space remains for civic engagement, foreign interaction, and political debate. Such an approach will require patience and persistence, but it lies firmly within U.S. interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, an international coalition of Ukraine’s allies deployed a wide range of sanctions as a core pillar of its response. These sanctions regimes have focused on efforts to restrict the funding and resourcing of the Russian military. However, President Vladimir Putin’s kleptocratic government also relies on an inner circle, which has been rewarded for its loyalty with tremendous wealth. These individuals have also been targeted by sanctions, with bank accounts and trophy assets, such as yachts, being frozen. In anticipation of being sanctioned – or subsequent to designation – these individuals have sought out professional services to construct complex mechanisms for hiding their assets and avoiding the full impact of the sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A critical element of the response to this evasion activity is the work of investigative journalists, including those of the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), which has uncovered information – such as that revealed in the “Rotenberg Files” and “Cyprus Confidential” project – about how these entities and individuals respond, and about the circumvention services they employ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While policymakers have been focused on designing and issuing sanctions packages, historically less focus has been placed on tackling evasion activity, particularly in Europe. Analysing the reporting by OCCRP and others can provide insights into the tactics employed by those seeking to evade sanctions and thus can offer valuable guidance on how to respond in the Russia context and beyond. As this Policy Brief reveals, one critical response to the widespread problem of sanctions circumvention is to disable the professional “enablers” of such circumvention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brief analyses a sample of over 100 relevant recent investigative reports, by OCCRP and other media outlets, on Russian and Belarusian individuals and entities who have been aided by professional service providers in their attempts to circumvent sanctions; as well as official US, UK and EU actions taken against professional enablers and their services since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Using this evidence base, and with an audience of policymakers in mind, this brief identifies common mechanisms by which professional service providers facilitate sanctions evasion and makes recommendations as to how policymakers can work together to minimise the use of professional service providers to circumvent sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-enablers&quot;&gt;The Enablers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Russia’s war in Ukraine entering its third year, and with no military resolution appearing imminent, sanctions – and their effective implementation – will remain a key part of the response to this illegal and unprovoked aggression. At the same time, those targeted by sanctions will inevitably attempt to thwart their impact by exploiting loopholes. Targeting the enablers of this evasion activity will be a critical front in ensuring sanctions are as effective as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “enablers” are professionals who often hide behind a veil of white-collar respectability while providing their clients with services to help them hide, move and invest illicit wealth. These services are frequently provided by lawyers, trust and company formation agents, investment advisers, money managers, real-estate professionals, art and antiquities dealers, and accountants. They can also, as described below, be “one-stop-shop” consultants. The involvement of these enablers falls across a spectrum: at one end sits wilful blindness (for example, choosing not to identify the ultimate beneficiary of opaque financial transactions); and at the other are those that offer active collusion (deliberately hiding and moving assets for Russian oligarchs) by exploiting jurisdictions with lax regulatory oversight and using networks of agents across offshore financial centres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it would be a mistake to focus too much on the type of profession because, as this Policy Brief demonstrates, in practice many enablers from different professional backgrounds perform the same types of services for their clients, such as shell company formation, to take one example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enablers also vary in their level of sophistication. For instance, certain service providers in what is often called the “wealth defence industry” not only create the front-end financial vehicles and offer the asset and legal services necessary to obscure their client’s wealth, but also provide the critical back-end services to contest and attack regulators and the media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the primary focus of this brief is non-bank enablers, which have in the past escaped the kind of regulatory oversight and enforcement that traditional financial institutions have been subjected to, it is critical to acknowledge that banks and elite lenders continue to manage money for clients who are at risk of being sanctioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-services&quot;&gt;The Services&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of the wide range of services provided by the enablers identified through OCCRP and other investigative reporting, as well as the relevant literature, this Policy Brief interprets the term broadly and has identified the following typologies of activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;hiding-wealth&quot;&gt;Hiding Wealth&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Playing the shell game:&lt;/strong&gt; Oligarch ownership is obscured through convoluted corporate structuring that uses shell companies, trusts, nominee directors and the shifting of assets to offshore jurisdictions, including via cryptocurrencies, loan forgiveness schemes, convertible promissory notes and the use of opaque investment vehicles. One example of this behaviour was exposed by the recent Cyprus Confidential investigation, which revealed that Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich held an estimated $2 billion in assets and cash across Credit Suisse, UBS and Barclays. Abramovich’s ownership of blue-chip US stocks, which were used as collateral for bank loans, had been obscured via offshore companies, trusts and complex corporate structures arranged by the Cypriot corporate service provider, MeritServus. In another example from June 2022, the US Treasury Department blocked a Delaware trust holding over $1 billion in assets linked to oligarch Suleiman Kerimov. Although the trust was formed in 2017 and Kerimov was sanctioned in 2018, it took four years for the trust to be identified as blocked. According to the US Treasury’s press release, “Kerimov used a complex series of legal structures and front persons to obscure his interest in [the trust]”. The trust funds were in turn invested in large US companies and “managed by a series of U.S. investment firms and facilitators”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keeping it in the family:&lt;/strong&gt; To avoid detection, enablers often register companies, assets and trusts in the names of relatives or trusted proxies of their clients, as well as using relatives or associates as directors. Investigative reporting has revealed this to be a common typology, with examples including: Russian oligarch Alisher Usmanov’s sister, a gynaecologist, listed as the beneficial owner of 27 Swiss bank accounts; Boris Rotenberg’s bodyguard and Arkady Rotenberg’s girlfriend holding valuable assets; and Alexander Mashenski restructuring ownership of his Belarusian fishing business to benefit his daughter, two months after the invasion of Ukraine. Another high-profile proxy that was exposed through investigative journalism is Eric Whyte, a Canadian and Cypriot citizen, who appears to have no business activities outside the network of offshore companies he allegedly controls – offshore companies connected to assets worth approximately $130 million. OCCRP reporting suggests that the beneficial owner of Whyte’s empire is actually Andrei Kostin, a sanctioned Russian banker with strong ties to Putin.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leveraging networks:&lt;/strong&gt; Enablers employ connections to other money-laundering networks or organised crime. Although they attempt to maintain a veneer of respectability, some enablers are not above working with professional money launderers and criminals. In a sweeping action against sanctions evasion, the US Treasury Department sanctioned Georgios Georgiou for his role in laundering money for “criminal organizations, corrupt businessmen and Russian oligarchs” by using a variety of creative schemes to obscure the beneficial ownership of funds. In its press release, the Treasury noted Georgiou’s provision of services to another sanctioned enabler and founder of a “private equity and corporate structuring entity heavily involved in moving Russian finance into the UAE and money laundering”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;maintaining-control&quot;&gt;Maintaining Control&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pass the parcel of assets:&lt;/strong&gt; Once the source of funds is obscured through shell companies, trusts and investment vehicles, they are invested by the professional enabler (either the same enabler who created the vehicle or a more specialised facilitator such as a real-estate professional). The funds are channelled into desirable assets including shares, real estate, artwork, yachts, jets and other luxury goods, such as precious metals and stones. OCCRP’s investigation into the Russian oligarch brothers Boris and Arkady Rotenberg, “The Rotenberg Files”, has revealed complex investment vehicles, corporate restructures, asset transfers and property schemes involving numerous proxies and permissive jurisdictions, such as the British Virgin Islands and Cyprus, all coordinated by a network of international professional service providers and designed to preserve the brothers’ financial empire and maintain their control over real estate, yachts and companies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Owning 49%:&lt;/strong&gt; Diluting ownership stakes to avoid certain thresholds, such as those that trigger share reporting or financial sanctions, allows the effective control of assets by oligarchs to remain undetected or outside the requirement to freeze those assets. This tactic is often used by enablers in combination with other sanctions-evasion typologies, such as “keeping it in the family”, “pass the parcel of assets”, or “playing the shell game”, to maintain hidden ownership or control. For example, OCCRP investigative reporting in 2022 revealed how, at that time, Usmanov maintained a 49% stake in his main business conglomerate, while the remainder was held by a range of opaque offshore companies and business associates.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;thinking-globally&quot;&gt;Thinking Globally&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shopping around:&lt;/strong&gt; Jurisdiction shopping to take advantage of a lack of sanctions, a delay in sanctions or lax regulatory oversight is one of the most common tactics used by enablers to avoid these measures. OCCRP’s “Russian Asset Tracker” reveals a profusion of oligarch mansions, yachts and planes located in offshore financial centres, such as Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Cyprus, Dubai, Luxembourg, Switzerland, the British Virgin Islands and the Isle of Man. Moreover, recent investigative reporting into large leaks of financial documents, such as the FinCEN files, Panama Papers and Suisse Secrets reports, all bear the classic hallmark of oligarchs using offshore entities to hide their international assets. The Rotenberg Files further reveal how mismatches between the US, EU and UK sanctions against the brothers and their family members allowed them to exploit those differences. While both brothers were sanctioned by the US in 2014, the UK and the EU did not sanction both until years later. For cunning and well-resourced oligarchs, that sort of time lag is a major window of opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passport to financial freedom:&lt;/strong&gt; Enablers often take advantage of the multiple passports of their clients and their clients’ family members to unlock access to favourable jurisdictions. Investigative reporting has identified the Finnish citizenship of Boris Rotenberg and the US citizenship of his wife. Abramovich is a citizen of Israel and Portugal, in addition to Russia. Members of the powerful Vorobyev family are citizens of Israel, Latvia, Singapore and Monaco. If their clients do not already possess useful passports, enablers also facilitate the purchase of citizenship in a preferred jurisdiction. As OCCRP reported in February 2023, five of the 10 people sanctioned by the US for operating a Russian arms sanctions-evasion network acquired EU citizenship through Cyprus’s notorious “golden passport” scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;deflecting-scrutiny&quot;&gt;Deflecting Scrutiny&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the front foot:&lt;/strong&gt; Many enablers offer a one-stop shop, not only constructing the vehicles necessary to shield their clients’ assets from international scrutiny; but also negotiating or aggressively dealing with regulators, compliance officials and journalists who take an interest in their clients’ affairs. An OCCRP report into data leaked from the boutique Swiss investment firm Finaport Holding shows a client list that included dozens of politically exposed persons, among them Russian oligarchs. Correspondence published by OCCRP demonstrates how Finaport employees actively circumvented compliance procedures and forcefully pushed back against due diligence requests from banks, dismissing concerns and threatening to remove their clients’ accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spin and suits:&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to playing defence, some enablers play offence by deploying global public relations strategies and international lawfare against governments, regulators and the media. For instance, in October 2022 The Intercept reported that Yevgeny Prigozhin, then-leader of the mercenary Wagner Group, had recruited UK and US legal firms to challenge international sanctions against him and to sue journalists who had investigated his business dealings. The detrimental impact of such strategic lawsuits against public participation (SLAPPs) is immense, with OCCRP revealing in 2023 that journalists and media outlets in its global network were battling over 60 lawsuits filed by the subjects of their investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;being-prepared&quot;&gt;Being Prepared&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Staying one step ahead:&lt;/strong&gt; With all risk-management strategies, the best outcome is to avoid exposure entirely. Thus, the most accomplished professional service providers engage in all typologies of sanctions-avoidance activity before their client is even sanctioned. For example, OCCRP and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists investigative reporting has revealed that, in the days after the invasion of Ukraine, PwC Cyprus facilitated the transfer of millions of dollars between anonymous shell companies on behalf of as yet non-sanctioned Russian oligarch clients. Similarly, shortly before sanctions were imposed on Roman Abramovich, leaked files demonstrate that trusts holding billions of dollars in assets were amended to transfer beneficial ownership to his seven children.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Conclusion and Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As illustrated by the reporting and analysis presented in this brief, fundamental policy and practice gaps continue to allow enablers to help their clients improperly protect their assets and interests from sanctions. To address the range of activities highlighted above, policymakers should take the following steps, which will also strengthen sanctions implementation beyond the Russia context:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish deterrence:&lt;/strong&gt; Enforcement actions against professional enabler networks that violate existing laws and designations against those that operate in lax jurisdictions must be increased. The EU and the UK lag the US when it comes to designations of, and criminal and civil enforcement against, professional enablers. The chilling effect of US and UK designations against Cypriot enablers in April 2023 should be replicated, while more criminal prosecutions should be brought against those who continue to break the law, following the example of the US Department of Justice’s Task Force KleptoCapture, and greater use should be made of the multinational REPO Taskforce. Currently, being a professional enabler in the UK and the EU is low cost and high reward, with few to no consequences. This is critical as professional enablers serve as nodes for sanctions evasion and can cater to multiple sanctioned clients.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhance coordination:&lt;/strong&gt; Better coordination of sanctions designations across likeminded jurisdictions is required to improve compliance. Although significant strides have been made in multilateral coordination between the US, the UK and the EU, and other likeminded jurisdictions, significant differences in sanctions designations remain, as shown by the Atlantic Council’s Russia Sanctions Database. At the same time, this brief demonstrates that jurisdictional arbitrage is one of the most popular methods for avoiding the bite of sanctions, and that lags in the imposition of sanctions provide legal cover to enablers taking advantage of differences in timing to move and hide oligarch assets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take a “network” approach:&lt;/strong&gt; Sanctions must be imposed on an oligarch’s entire network simultaneously to minimise opportunities to shift assets to family members and associates. Any delay facilitates evasion. The use of family members, such as children, romantic partners, and even low-level associates, like bodyguards or school friends, continues to be a top sanctions-evasion and -avoidance method. Abramovich’s transfers to his children are a case in point. While it is standard in US sanctions programmes to include spouses and adult children, the EU only expanded its sanctions programme to cover immediate family members in mid-2023. But loopholes – such as the use of minors who are unlikely to be sanctioned for legal and policy reasons – persist and should be addressed by, for example, blocking assets that have been transferred to them in an apparent effort to avoid sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Publicise blocked property:&lt;/strong&gt; A lack of information about ownership impedes effective private sector implementation. To enhance private sector enforcement, allies should consistently and publicly identify any property, such as real estate, yachts and artwork, or legal arrangements, such as trusts, in which the sanctioned person has an interest. As described above, particular attention should be paid to any assets that may have been transferred to family members and associates to shield them from sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harmonise ownership and control sanctions rules:&lt;/strong&gt; Harmonisation of the sanctions rules on 50% ownership and control across the US, the UK and the EU is required to enhance multilateral sanctions enforcement. Additionally, the US should expand its “50% rule” to encompass a control standard as lowering ownership of entities to just below the 50% threshold while maintaining control through proxies continues to be a favoured tactic used by oligarchs and their enablers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Close regulatory loopholes:&lt;/strong&gt; Loopholes in the regulation and supervision of professional enablers facilitate sanctions circumvention and evasion. The US, in particular, needs to pass legislation or in certain cases finalise proposed rules imposing anti-money-laundering obligations on those who provide certain financial or related services, including those who incorporate or register companies, form trusts, manage money or other assets, are involved in real-estate closings and settlements, advise on investments, or are engaged in the trade or sale of works of art or antiquities. Those who fail to comply should face more actively applied civil and/or criminal penalties and, as appropriate, the suspension or revocation of licences, along with other disciplinary actions. The UK and the EU should focus on making their existing supervisory regimes more effective and on following through with enforcement to act as a genuine deterrent.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on services:&lt;/strong&gt; As enablers do not adhere to neatly defined professional roles, neither should efforts to regulate them. To avoid inadvertently creating loopholes, legislation and regulations should follow the example of the proposed US ENABLERS Act by focusing on the services provided by enablers across various professions, such as setting up companies and trusts, serving as nominee directors and managing assets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pressure enabling jurisdictions:&lt;/strong&gt; The ability of certain jurisdictions to continue to offer sanctions-evasion services must be addressed. Pressure on enabler jurisdictions, such as Cyprus, the British Virgin Islands, the UAE and Türkiye must be increased to restrict evasion opportunities by designing clearer consequences for their actions. If such efforts are unsuccessful, allies must issue advisories on specific “enabler jurisdictions”, laying out the risks of doing business with them and should consider creating a designation category of “jurisdiction of primary sanctions evasion concern”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhance scrutiny of visa and citizenship schemes:&lt;/strong&gt; Further progress must be made in addressing the abuse of “golden passports/visas” (or citizenship/residency) by investment schemes which are easily exploited by oligarchs and their enablers to shield themselves and their assets. Numerous oligarchs and enablers are reported to have benefited from these types of schemes. More broadly, visa bans should be used more frequently – and the listings publicised and coordinated between allies – to enhance travel restrictions on those who, whether or not in violation of local law, enable sanctions evasion and to highlight those enablers who represent a sanctions-evasion risk.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop more inclusive information sharing mechanisms:&lt;/strong&gt; Investigative journalists and civil society have committed significant resources to revealing sanctions-evasion vulnerabilities and activities. Governments should systematically leverage this capacity by sharing unclassified information with accredited journalism organisations, civil society and the private sector to enhance investigations and compliance. They should also expand or create dedicated liaison and reporting channels for two-way information exchange that shield groups submitting information from legal or other threats.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get serious about tackling SLAPP suits:&lt;/strong&gt; The UK and the EU need to build on recent progress by ensuring that the UK’s anti-SLAPP bill is sufficiently broad and the EU’s anti-SLAPP directive is implemented properly by member states. Effective anti-SLAPP laws are essential to ensuring that the “wealth defence industry” is not able to suppress investigative reporting by journalists and civil society that exposes kleptocrats and their enablers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continue to boost beneficial ownership and control transparency:&lt;/strong&gt; Publicly accessible, central and verified beneficial ownership registries that encompass the full gamut of legal entities and arrangements are indispensable to combating sanctions evasion. Key global centres, such as the British Virgin Islands, must be provided with the analytical resources they need, and journalists and civil society actors must be granted access to such registries to allow them to leverage the information in their investigations, thus serving as a resource for overextended governments. Governments too must upskill law enforcement and other investigative authorities on how to make use of beneficial ownership information.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine grinds into its third year and the range of sanctions targets dwindles, curtailing evasion activities must be a heightened focus for Ukraine’s allies. As this Policy Brief has shown, central to this mission should be an active campaign to disable the enablers which have been revealed by investigative journalists to be, knowingly or unknowingly, facilitating evasion by exploiting loopholes and using a range of obfuscation tactics.&lt;/p&gt;
