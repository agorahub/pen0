&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper’s key findings are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As NATO’s European air forces attempt to transition towards a primary focus on the threat from Russia, and the need to have credible capability in that high-threat, high-intensity context, most are likely to struggle to do so without reducing the breadth of mission sets and capability areas that they currently attempt to cover.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fast jet pilots must work in an extremely physically and mentally demanding role. Despite the vital role of advanced synthetic training, many European air forces will struggle to afford sufficient live and synthetic flight hours to enable pilots to build and maintain the levels of skill required in a Russia–NATO threat context across the full range of missions possible for modern multi-role fighter aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even where air forces can provide sufficient high-quality training flying, both live and synthetic, to generate pilot mission competencies at the required level across the full multi-role mission set, this is not enough to ensure effectiveness without adequate stockpiles of suitable munitions. In particular, the munitions required to be effective against Russian ground-based air defences and Russian combat aircraft in an air-to-air role are very expensive and would be required in much greater quantities than currently owned by most European air forces in any serious clash with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Therefore, to afford a meaningful stockpile of suppression and destruction of enemy air defences, long-range precision strike or long-range air-to-air missiles, most European nations would need to either greatly increase defence spending allocated to combat air, or cut other areas of capability, to afford to specialise in building out munitions stocks required for one or more specific mission sets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The political and geographical location of different countries, as well as the type of combat aircraft currently operated or on order, will affect the potential mission areas in which any given country could credibly and relatively quickly build up seriously high-intensity readiness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Countries can only take risk against some mission areas in order to specialise in being really good at others if this approach is pursued in close coordination with trusted allies who are doing the same in a complementary way, to ensure that, as European air forces, all the required mission areas are well covered.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, the current approach of most states attempting to field small multirole fighter fleets that has preserved apparent sovereign freedom of choice in the relatively permissive or semi-permissive operations since the end of the Cold War may not be practical as a deterrent to Russia. Meeting the cost of ensuring that pilots are sufficiently well trained to survive and be effective against the high-end ground-based and airborne threats that they would face, and that they have adequate stockpiles of suitable munitions, decoys and other enablers, is likely to only be possible for most European air forces if they focus such efforts on a few mission sets each. The only viable alternative would seem to be a huge increase in funding to fill in the gaps across the board.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional assumptions about the direct threat Russian forces could pose to NATO countries in the coming years need to be urgently revised following the failure of the Ukrainian summer offensive in 2023 and Russia’s unfortunately successful pivot to a long war strategy throughout 2024. After a low point in early 2023, Russian industry has significantly increased production output of weapons and ammunition of almost all kinds. This trend is likely to accelerate, as the Russian parliament approved a 68% increase in defence spending in the state plans for the 2024/25 financial year compared with 2023/24. The increase will take Russian military spending to over 6% of GDP and cement a structural economic bias towards long-term conflict, as well as the industrial output to support such a posture. Depleted European stocks of heavy equipment and ammunition – due to donations to Ukraine not having been replaced promptly in many cases – are exacerbating the worsening battlefield situation in Ukraine and the risks posed by the reconstitution of Russian conventional military capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;dependence-on-the-us&quot;&gt;Dependence on the US&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decades, conventional deterrence in Europe of any potential Russian threat to NATO has been essentially assured by the overwhelming power of the US military. Unfortunately, the growth of Chinese capabilities is forcing the US to reallocate ever more of its military capacity to the Indo-Pacific at the expense of other theatres. Many in the Pentagon assess that the period of greatest risk of the Chinese military attempting to blockade or invade Taiwan (sometimes known as the “Davidson Window”) is 2026–28. In the event of a dangerous stand-off or a military conflict in the Indo-Pacific during the coming decade, it is likely that a high proportion of American fifth-generation fighters, electronic attack aircraft, long-range stand-off weapons, air and missile defence systems, and tankers deployed in European Command and Central Command would be transferred to Indo-Pacific Command. This would greatly reduce NATO combat power in Europe. The demands of such a conflict would also limit US capacity to provide rapid large-scale resupply of long-range munitions and spare parts to European militaries in the event of a concurrent Russian attack on NATO territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who argue that the military threat from either China in the Indo-Pacific or from Russia in Europe should be prioritised as the more likely miss a fundamental point. China has a strong interest in supporting Russia to ensure it remains a serious military threat in Europe, as that will split NATO attention and resources. More importantly, in the event of a serious stand-off or actual conflict with China that leaves US forces largely fixed in the Indo-Pacific in the mid-to-late 2020s, Russia will have a strong incentive to take a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to break NATO by testing Article 5 while the US is unable to reinforce NATO effectively. Another factor that must be considered is the risk that President Donald Trump follows through with his repeated threats to either officially or de facto remove US defence guarantees to other NATO nations if transatlantic relations sour during his second term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To prevent a future war with Russia, NATO’s European member states must be capable of largely shouldering the task of deterring Russian military aggression. Historically, states do not start premeditated wars that they perceive as likely to be long, costly and with an uncertain outcome; the opportunistic and cynical nature of aggression under President Vladimir Putin suggests Russia is no exception. However, once at war, Russia has repeatedly shown an unmatched capacity to absorb catastrophic casualties and setbacks without backing down. Deterrence, therefore, requires a demonstrable capability to rapidly defeat any opportunistic aggression by Russia, thus denying the Kremlin any perceived opportunity for an “easy win” that could discredit Article 5 and NATO’s collective defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-vital-role-of-air-superiority&quot;&gt;The Vital Role of Air Superiority&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air superiority is a necessity if European states are to rapidly demonstrate the capability to quickly repulse Russian conventional aggression. Without air superiority, NATO’s European powers lack the recruitment capacity, munitions manufacturing capacity and defence funding to field the scale and quality of high-readiness ground forces and land-based firepower needed to rapidly and definitively repulse a determined Russian attack. Land power is vital, of course, and heavy manoeuvre forces – such as those being built up by Poland, Finland and Germany – are essential to deterrence. However, such forces are still dependent on the ISTAR overwatch and massive firepower that air superiority enables for sustainable effectiveness against larger, battle-hardened Russian forces which possess far more ground-based firepower. This is especially the case for forward-deployed forces since, as the potential aggressor, Russia can mass forces at a point and time of its choosing, whereas NATO has committed to defending “every inch of Alliance territory”. Thus, to avoid being left seriously vulnerable when or if US rapid reinforcement is unlikely, European air forces must be able to achieve and exploit air superiority in a contested area. This requires the capacity to locate, suppress and then destroy the Russian surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems that currently would make air superiority over contested Alliance territory impossible to achieve without a major US suppression and destruction of enemy air defences (SEAD/DEAD) campaign, while also keeping the fighters and long-range missile-carrying bombers of the Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS) at bay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, few European air forces have the stockpiles of specialised weapons needed, nor dedicate the focused aircrew training time required, to field high-end SEAD/DEAD capabilities. As a result, NATO’s practical SEAD/DEAD capabilities against Russia in a direct conflict are heavily dependent on the US Air Force and the US Navy’s Carrier Air Wings. While SEAD/DEAD is perhaps the most glaring area of Europe’s dependence, there are other critical mission sets – such as airborne electronic warfare (EW) and penetrating ISTAR – that are also almost exclusively provided by the US. The primary reason for this is that most other NATO air forces spread their limited budgets thinly by trying to maintain and modernise a range of different multi-role fighters, helicopter fleets and relatively small quantities of enablers such as aerial refuelling tankers. Even for those states that successfully cover these “basics”, there is precious little money and usually too few personnel to allocate to comparatively specialised capabilities such as electronic attack (EA) or penetrating ISTAR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;greater-specialisation-needed&quot;&gt;Greater Specialisation Needed&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To change this situation quickly, European air forces should explore specialisation along national lines within the Alliance – accepting risk against some mission sets/capabilities in order to free up the required funding, personnel and enabling capabilities that will allow other mission sets to be enacted more credibly. This paper aims to explain why such specialisation is necessary and to suggest areas where collective, coordinated mission specialisation could enable a rapid improvement in the combat capability of European NATO air forces, thus helping to deter future Russian aggression. The paper does this by examining two primary areas, divided over two chapters: Chapter I looks at fast jet pilot training and currency requirements for high-intensity conflict scenarios; and Chapter II examines the requirements and costs for suitable munitions across key mission sets. The paper concludes with some recommendations, including several examples of potential specialisation choices that might be made, given: (i) the resource and force structure outlook for certain states’ air forces; and (ii) the differing political conditions often attached to the use of kinetic force for some Allied nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper draws heavily on interviews with instructor pilots and unit leaders conducted during research visits by the author to frontline fighter units across multiple NATO air forces throughout 2023 and 2024, often including backseat observation during numerous live training sorties. This research included frontline visits with the RAF, the French Air Force, the US Air Force, the Royal Canadian Air Force, the Italian Air Force, the German Air Force, the Royal Netherlands Air Force, the Swedish Air Force and the Finnish Air Force. The paper was also informed by observations and interviews with senior leaders and instructors accrued during multinational training and exercises at the NATO Tactical Leadership Programme in Albacete, Spain, and at NATO Air Command in Ramstein, Germany. It also builds directly on similar research conducted throughout 2022, which examined the gaps in NATO air force capabilities exposed by the return of overt Russian military aggression to the European security landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-pilot-proficiency&quot;&gt;I. Pilot Proficiency&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating and maintaining a truly combat-ready force of multi-role fast jet aircrew is one of the most difficult and expensive tasks that Western militaries regularly undertake. A frequent misperception among non-specialists is that the difficult challenge is training pilots to fly fast jets. It is true that it takes anywhere from three to seven years and millions of pounds/dollars to train a pilot to fly a succession of faster, heavier and more complex aircraft to the standard required to join a frontline fast jet squadron, but this is actually only the beginning of the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When aircrew complete their conversion onto a type of fast jet, they are qualified to fly the aircraft in question – such as an F-16, Typhoon or F-35 – and will have been taught how to operate the sensors, subsystems and weapons, as well as learning basic tactics, in the operational conversion unit, before graduating to the frontline. At this stage of their careers they will already have attained several hundred flying hours and around 80–100 hours of live and simulated flying on the frontline type onto which they are converting. According to recent figures released by the UK’s minister of state for the armed forces, the cost of training a British pilot to this stage is approximately £5.4 million. Despite this, in the fast jet world such pilots are still generally not considered to be ready to go into combat: additional mission-specific tactical and procedural training and testing by the instructor pilots on their frontline squadron are needed before they can be certified as “combat-ready” for simple mission sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the RAF, as with many other Western air forces, the first mission that most junior pilots are qualified to fly when they are certified as combat ready is quick reaction alert (QRA). QRA is essentially basic air defence and peacetime air policing, where pairs of armed fighters are maintained at a few minutes’ notice, 24/7, to scramble to intercept, identify, assist or even (if necessary) shoot down unidentified or unresponsive civilian or military aircraft inside or close to national airspace. The mission carries huge responsibility and requires pilots to be on duty for 24 hours at a time, ready to scramble without knowing, initially, the situation they will face. However, in terms of tactical complexity it is relatively simple, since in most QRA scenarios there is no ground-based threat and the assumption is that even if the aircraft is from a hostile state such as Russia, the encounter will not involve weapons release – although, of course, the aircraft are armed, and the risk is always there. Despite the relative simplicity of QRA sorties, the workload and the demands placed on pilots during them can be intense. As such, newly combat-ready pilots with perhaps 100 hours of fast jet flying time and a year on a frontline squadron will remain junior “wingmen” – meaning that in the air they follow and provide support/backup for a more experienced formation leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different air forces have different approaches to how quickly pilots can progress through various qualifications and which mission sets are prioritised. For example, in the RAF or the US Air Force, new pilots are typically combat ready within six to eight months of joining a frontline squadron, and usually progress to their two-ship lead qualifications in the second year. Exceptional pilots might be judged ready to undertake the qualification to lead the basic formation for more advanced tactics, which is four fighters – known as a four-ship – by the end of their first three-year frontline tour. Most others will achieve their four-ship lead qualification midway through their second frontline tour of three years. Particularly tactically competent pilots might then be judged suitable as candidates to attempt the extremely demanding RAF Qualified Weapons Instructor or American Fighter Weapons Instructor courses after a single frontline tour (although two tours is preferred due to the pass rate on the course generally being higher for candidates who have more experience). By contrast, progress is slower in the Swedish Air Force or the Finnish Air Force, where a dispersed operating model and requirement to fly missions regularly against peer (Russian) air threats at low altitudes in bad weather and at night as standard equates to higher complexity. Pilots are likely to be combat ready around a year after joining the frontline, but are generally not considered for two-ship lead upgrade until at least three years on squadron; four-ship lead qualifications usually come after a minimum of about six years. Swedish or Finnish pilots will have typically served about 10 years on a frontline squadron before some are considered suitable candidates for weapons instructor/mission commander training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These total training times should be understood in a context where the traditional minimum NATO standard required for fast jet aircrew in terms of annual flying hours is 180, of which 40 can be in a full mission simulator. However, different air forces’ pilots accrue different flying hour totals depending on financial position, simulator capabilities and cultural attitudes; and 120–40 live flying hours a year is now fairly common across Europe. With costs per flying hour for most fast jets sitting in the range of tens of thousands of pounds/dollars, it is not hard to see why training proficient combat-ready fast jet aircrew is extremely expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;physical-demands-on-pilots&quot;&gt;Physical Demands on Pilots&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extent of pilot training hours can seem strange to the non-specialist, given the sophistication of modern fly-by-wire flight controls and consequently how comparatively easy modern fighter aircraft are to fly from a “stick and rudder” point of view. It becomes more logical, however, once it is understood that a fast jet cockpit is a physically demanding environment to work in, and quite how many things fast jet pilots must be able to do simultaneously in order to perform their missions safely and effectively. Pilots work strapped into rocket-powered ejection seats under a canopy (which acts as a “greenhouse” in hot weather) in seating positions that often rapidly become uncomfortable during longer sorties; pilots also have to wear many layers of uncomfortable protective equipment, which can rapidly cause their bodies to overheat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During flight, pilots are subjected to constant noise and vibration, as well as rapid pressure changes due to varying altitude, and they must deal with the rapid onset of often sustained g-forces whenever the aircraft is being manoeuvred at high speeds. The g-forces in particular place huge strain on the body, especially during basic fighter manoeuvres (BFM) – otherwise known as dogfighting – or when “cranking”, which involves turning hard and sometimes diving to evade incoming missile threats. Under high-g forces of 7–9 g, internal organs are displaced by several inches, and pilots must constantly strain their core and leg muscles and force themselves to pressure-breathe to keep enough blood in their head to avoid loss of vision and consciousness. Staying conscious under high-g is hard work and physically painful for passengers, or in a centrifuge for training, but fast jet pilots must continue to work through it. This means monitoring their radar and EW systems, and maintaining situational awareness through the sensors in the cockpit, constantly mentally assessing their own and adversaries’ weapons ranges and kill probability as each aircraft manoeuvres, and craning their necks to look behind and above to keep visual tally on the enemy and other members of their own formation. All the while, they must make split-second tactical decisions, and constantly communicate with other members of the formation and air battle managers on the ground or in allied AWACS aircraft to maintain deconfliction and tactical effectiveness. For those not regularly acclimatised to such extreme conditions, the overwhelming physical sensations and information overload are also often accompanied by rapid spatial disorientation and severe airsickness. This is one of the reasons why pilots – especially in the first few years of their frontline careers – need to fly at least two to three hours per week to stay physically acclimatised, and be able to work efficiently and constantly learn additional skills despite the intense physical and mental demands of the fast jet cockpit environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;increasing-mission-complexity&quot;&gt;Increasing Mission Complexity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When dealing with mission sets beyond BFM and QRA, things become increasingly complex. For example, relatively basic beyond visual range (BVR) tactics involve four-ship formations operating together as a group. This allows them to efficiently allocate radar scan areas and settings to search for (and target) multiple incoming enemy aircraft across a large vertical and horizontal area. It also allows mutual defensive support, and presents opponents with multiple concurrent missile threats as the distance between opposing formations narrows, which hopefully keeps them flying defensively and thus unable to gain a positional or energy advantage. However, employing such tactics requires experienced pilots who can lead a formation of four aircraft, keep track of what all of them are doing in real time, and coordinate them while manoeuvring hard and managing their own radar, weapons and deconfliction. Such four-ship lead pilots must also be familiar enough with such tactics to plan, brief and debrief each mission thoroughly so that all involved learn lessons from it. This involves providing detailed critical feedback and corrective guidance on every manoeuvre, every missile shot, and every decision taken by friendly and enemy aircraft in a flight – which for complex missions can take many hours. The tactical complexity, weapon and fuel management, deconfliction and communication requirements placed on pilots increases even further for missions such as those that might be required against Russian forces, which would involve not only a hostile air element but also ground-based SAM threats and/or ground targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way that even carefully selected human beings can reach the level of capability required to be effective operators of fast jets in a complex combat environment is by gradually building up currency in myriad component skill sets involved in operating such aircraft, to the point that each task requires very little conscious mental effort or capacity. At each stage where sufficient familiarity has been reached in one set of skills, mental capacity is freed up, enabling pilots to learn to perform additional mission-specific tasks and ultimately also to undertake tactical leadership functions in the air. However, this means that mission currency is critical. If pilots are not able to fly multiple times per week – both for real and in the simulator – they will rapidly start to lose familiarity with key procedures and skill sets for certain missions. The less that pilots fly, the less mental capacity they have for tactical decision-making when flying, because they are no longer able to do the huge number of more basic tasks smoothly without conscious thought while under heavy physical stress. Consequently, the more mission sets that a given fighter force is liable to perform and thus compelled to train for, the more flying hours it will need to be funded for, so that its pilots can gain and then maintain the requisite skills and ability to perform those mission sets under pressure, while managing all the other tasks that must be constantly undertaken in the air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Current Trade-Offs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many NATO air forces fly multi-role fighter aircraft, but currently do not fund sufficient core flying training hours for their aircrew to allow them to maintain high-level proficiency beyond the most common mission sets – meaning that they do not necessarily have truly multi-role capability at any given point in time. During the past 20 years, this has not necessarily been a major problem. Most multi-role fighter pilots who were deployed to perform complex close air support (CAS) and/or battlefield interdiction tasks during counterinsurgency or overseas intervention operations had the luxury of a “work up” training period prior to their deployment. Because campaigns such as Iraq (from 2003) and Afghanistan (from 2006) were enduring operations, fighter units were deployed on rotation from across many air forces, and before each rotation into theatre, pilots would generally undertake anything from several weeks to several months of intensive and focused pre-deployment training to make sure that their CAS skills and other interoperability requirements – such as multi-type tanker qualifications – were fully current. In the current context, however, the skills needed to be effective and survivable when operating as part of NATO’s Regional Defence Plans, including complex mission planning and mutually supportive multinational four-ship tactics in offensive counter-air (OCA), SEAD/DEAD and contested CAS, need to be ready in a crisis, without long work-up times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, where funding for core flying training hours is a major constraint, it may be more effective for air forces to purchase light fighter types such as the Gripen or the newest variants of F-16, which lack some of the top-end capabilities of more expensive types such as the F-35, Typhoon or Rafale. Fighters that are cheap and efficient to maintain and operate can be flown much more for a given flying training budget and so can often enable pilots from cash-constrained air forces to achieve higher levels of mission proficiency and thus capability – at least in non-penetrating mission sets such as defensive counter-air (DCA) – than if they were flying more expensive jets that they could not train with very often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, it is a false economy for countries that operate more expensive heavy or stealth fighter types to try to save money by not funding enough flying hours to hit the NATO requirement. Doing so means that aircrew may struggle to be genuinely capable across the multiple high-threat mission sets that those aircraft were designed to be capable of performing in high-threat scenarios. This is especially problematic in air forces such as the RAF that heavily task their fast jet fleets with conducting relatively small-scale operational and exercise deployments all over the world. If operational flying hours – many of which are spent in long transits or on combat air patrol (CAP) with little training value – are substituted for core flying hours, then key skills and currencies for high-intensity mission sets will quickly begin to atrophy across the force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where it is not possible to fund additional core flying training hours to allow pilots to genuinely gain and retain high levels of currency across multiple complex mission sets beyond “basic” QRA, permissive CAS and air-to-air proficiencies, the logical alternative is to reduce the number of mission sets that aircrew train to fulfil. This can be done either by assigning individual squadrons specific mission sets on which to focus a greater proportion of their training time and hold primary liability for; or, at a national level, by deprioritising certain mission areas (to which other Allies are better suited) in order to concentrate training resources on making sure that some mission sets are deliverable to a very high standard as a specialised national contribution within NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although specialisation in medium and small air forces would reduce overall sovereign “choice” in which mission sets to tackle in any given campaign (and has been avoided by most air forces during the post-Cold War decades as a result), the alternative multi-role approach entails a loss of high-end skills. This was generally judged to be acceptable when most operations were expected to be relatively permissive counterinsurgency and intervention campaigns in which massive US military support led the way. However, the costs of trying to maintain a full spectrum of multi-role proficiencies with limited core training hours and regular deployments is much more problematic when facing the threat systems that Russian forces deploy, and is likely to lead to serious losses in an actual conflict. Where nations have retained either a primary focus on deterring Russia or where a mission set has been maintained that inherently focuses on high-threat scenarios such as SEAD, unit-level specialisation already exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Swedish Model&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Sweden, for example, despite relatively healthy live flying hours of around 120–60 hours per year, each of the country’s three fighter wings has a different multi-role training focus. Every Swedish fighter pilot flying the Gripen C/D first learns to be combat ready in the BVR air-to-air tactics that would be used in the event of a major war with Russia, and all maintain both BVR and BFM tactical proficiency throughout their careers. Then, depending on which fighter wing they are stationed at, pilots will spend most of the remainder of their flying hours training for a specific secondary mission set. F 21 Wing at Luleå specialises in CAS, while F 17 Wing at Ronneby specialises in anti-surface warfare (ASuW) and maritime tactical reconnaissance in cooperation with the Swedish Navy; F 7 Wing at Såtenäs, meanwhile, specialises in producing instructor pilots responsible for converting new pilots onto the Gripen C/D, and also maintains ASuW proficiency. This approach means that even with flying hour totals that are lower than some other NATO air forces, and given somewhat limited use of simulator resources for tactical training, the Swedish Air Force in aggregate is still able to generate and sustain high levels of pilot proficiency across all its core mission sets. At the national level, the Swedish Air Force has – unlike all other European air forces – maintained a very credible ASuW capability. However, currently, Sweden has little in the way of credible SEAD/DEAD or penetrating ISTAR capabilities. It is a prime example of the benefits in terms of credible high-intensity capabilities that can be maintained by medium-sized air forces that choose to specialise in mission sets both at the unit level and the national level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Other European Approaches to Specialisation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other European examples, such as the almost exclusive training focus on the SEAD mission by the Tornado ECR crews within the Luftwaffe’s Taktisches Luftwaffengeschwader 51 and the Italian Air Force’s 155° Gruppo. These units will soon be converted – to the Eurofighter EK variant in Germany and the F-35A in the case of the Italian Air Force – but should retain their focus on the SEAD mission when fully re-equipped. While the Tornado ECR is outdated as a platform, the mission training focus of the units which fly it means that the relevant aircrew possess rare skills among NATO peers, as they are able to specialise in understanding Russian threat systems and the integration tactics required to perform SEAD against them in a supportive role within composite air operations (COMAOs). Even with comparatively high numbers of available flying training hours, the US Air Force in Europe takes a similar approach. Each of the F-16 units based in the theatre maintains multi-role proficiencies, but has a specialist area of expertise to which they devote a greater proportion of their flying training time, and for which they are specifically equipped. For the 52nd Fighter Wing at Spangdahlem that specialist mission set is SEAD, while for the 31st Fighter Wing at Aviano it is CAS. When called to operations at short notice, both units consistently perform better in these two roles than other units that maintain a less focused multi-role training syllabus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;expanding-the-specialist-approach&quot;&gt;Expanding the Specialist Approach&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a strong case for other NATO countries in Europe to explore a similar approach, through specialisation at either the fighter wing/squadron level or the national level. Modern air combat between states is highly punishing for “spirited amateurs”. The lethality of modern threat systems and the tactical complexity involved in executing effective COMAOs against Russian ground-based and aerial threats mean that genuine combat readiness and credibility require intensive training for key mission sets such as SEAD/DEAD and OCA. Consequently, NATO aircrew will have to either fly significantly more training hours (both live and synthetic), or better focus the hours they have by specialising in fewer mission sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As will be explained in the next chapter, the case for specialisation is strengthened when one examines munitions requirements for the various mission sets involved in establishing air superiority against Russian forces. After all, even the best trained pilot is of little utility in a high-end conflict if their air force does not have access to a ready stockpile of suitable munitions for the mission sets for which they are to be employed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-munitions&quot;&gt;II. Munitions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many other aspects of Western military capability, the munitions stocks held by most NATO air forces have been significantly distorted by the specific requirements of decades of expeditionary counterinsurgency and stabilisation operations. These were typically long campaigns against irregular forces that lacked any serious surface-to-air threat or air force, and where ground force numbers were limited by political considerations, making them heavily reliant on CAS to enable them to defend themselves while spread thinly over large areas. Consequently, during the 2000s and early 2010s, most NATO air forces pursued munitions strategies that prioritised the acquisition of bombs and short-range missiles with high accuracy and limited explosive power (to minimise collateral damage), which were also affordable enough to use on a sustained basis during long campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, these are generally not the kind of weapons that are needed to roll back Russia’s ground-based air defences and conduct OCA and DCA at large scale in a high-intensity defensive NATO context. Ordering and increasing stockpiles of more suitable munitions is, therefore, essential and urgent – but this will inevitably be expensive, making it an additional argument for national specialisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;current-european-air-launched-munitions-types&quot;&gt;Current European Air-Launched Munitions Types&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent times, the RAF, for example, has standardised air-to-ground armament for fast jets around the Paveway IV dual-mode laser and GPS/INS-guided bomb and the Brimstone anti-armour/low collateral missile. This consolidation around only a few munition types enabled these sophisticated weapons to be procured at significant scale from high-efficiency production lines that operated continuously (but at relatively low output volumes) over the past decade. The development of long-range stand-off weapons during much of the post-Cold War period, meanwhile, was limited to obsolescence-mitigation upgrades for the Storm Shadow cruise missile that was developed in the mid-1990s, and procurement volumes were low. Likewise, procurement volumes of the advanced ramjet-powered European Meteor missile for BVR air-to-air combat and the US-made AIM-120C/D AMRAAM (advanced medium-range air-to-air missile) were very low by Cold War standards, since there was perceived to be a very limited air-to-air threat. Cluster bombs and the WE.177 air-delivered tactical nuclear bomb were retired in the 1990s, and the ALARM anti-radiation missile for SEAD was retired from service, without replacement, in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consolidation of the RAF air-to-surface arsenal was arguably a justifiable response to the operational pressures of Iraq, Afghanistan and latterly Libya and Operation Shader. However, the consequence today is that the RAF has no air-delivered weapons suitable for SEAD/DEAD and only a limited remaining inventory of Storm Shadow cruise missiles capable of deep strikes against fixed targets such as bunkers. In contrast to almost any other country with operational F-35 squadrons, the UK’s F-35B fleet is currently only equipped with free-fall Paveway IVs for strikes against ground targets – an almost comically inadequate weapon for any seriously contested airspace, let alone for use inside a Russian integrated air defence system (IADS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the same period as the RAF developments outlined above, France developed its own range of AASM “Hammer” (Armement Air-Sol Modulaire, or Modular Air-to-Ground Armament) bombs to provide the primary air-to-ground armament for its Mirage 2000D and Rafale fleets. The AASM can be used with 250-lb, 500-lb, 1,000-lb and 2,000-lb explosive sections and incorporates laser and GPS guidance, with the additional option of imaging seeker heads for automatic terminal guidance against fixed targets. The AASM can also be fitted with a rocket booster section and pop-out glide wings to significantly extend its stand-off range in contested areas, especially when employed from low altitudes with a pop-up manoeuvre. Consequently, the AASM series is significantly more usable in contested airspace than most NATO bomb families or short-range missile types, thanks to greater stand-off range and terminal accuracy in GPS-denied environments. They have already proven useful in Ukraine when fired from the Ukraine Air Force’s Mig-29 and Su-27 fighters in pop-up lofting profiles after a low-level ingress to minimise risks from Russian SAM systems. Excellent integration with the air-to-ground radar and other systems on the Rafale means that this munition would be significantly more effective still in either French or Greek service. However, the trade-off is a higher unit cost than other utility weapons such as the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) or Paveway II/IV families that form the primary air-to-surface armament across European NATO air forces. The AASM is also still not particularly suited for use as a dedicated SEAD/DEAD munition, since it lacks the range to engage long-range Russian systems inside a layered IADS, and is not designed to engage highly mobile targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most other European air forces rely on US-made JDAM GPS-guided and Paveway series laser and GPS-guided bombs for their air-to-surface weaponry. More recently, a significant number, including the Royal Netherlands Air Force, the Swedish Air Force and the Italian Air Force, have also acquired the 250-lb GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) to provide a low-cost stand-off capability. However, as a glide bomb, the SDB is slow and highly susceptible to being intercepted by ground-based air defence systems, and it is also reliant on GPS, which means that its terminal accuracy can be degraded by Russian EW systems and it also cannot hit moving targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One weapon that is significantly more suitable for a high-intensity conflict in a NATO context is the AGM-88E Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile (AARGM). Italy has acquired the AARGM for its ageing Tornado ECR SEAD fleet, and the missile has been ordered by Germany for its upcoming Eurofighter EK derivative that will replace the ECR in Luftwaffe service. It offers significantly greater range and terminal accuracy than the older AGM-88B HARM (High-Speed Anti-Radiation Missile), and also functions as a highly effective airborne electromagnetic intelligence (ELINT) sensor when carried. However, the weapon’s fairly large radar cross-section makes it unlikely to have significantly greater survivability against Russian long-range SAMs and their accompanying short-range air defence (SHORAD) systems than the older AGM-88 HARM family that has been regularly intercepted in Ukraine for around 18 months. Thus, while the baseline AARGM – when used by Tornado ECR or future Eurofighter EK – can provide a very useful suppressive effect that can bolster the effectiveness of a broader COMAO (much like the HARM in previous decades), it is not an ideal primary weapon for destroying SAM threats directly. The Tornado ECR itself is rapidly reaching the end of its operational life and was never designed to face modern layered Russian air defences. The AGM-88E is not currently used by other non-US NATO air forces and, since it does not fit inside the weapons bays of the F-35, it has not been integrated with that aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;munitions-requirements-for-seaddead-campaigns&quot;&gt;Munitions Requirements for SEAD/DEAD Campaigns&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unfortunate truth is that almost all NATO air forces other than the US’s currently lack stockpiles of munitions suitable for a serious SEAD/DEAD campaign. Such weapons need to combine several properties if they are to be effective. First, the weapon must have sufficient stand-off range to be launched from beyond the range at which a hostile IADS can reliably engage the launch aircraft. That stand-off range will obviously vary depending on the penetrating capabilities of the launch aircraft itself, since stealth aircraft can get closer to a given threat than conventional equivalents, for a given level of risk. Second, the weapon must be able to navigate automatically to the rough position of a target SAM or radar system with the aid of an anti-radiation seeker or a GPS-denial-resistant navigation suite that uses coordinates obtained in close to real time, either from the launch aircraft or from other assets that can pass data to the weapon before launch or in-flight. Third, the weapon must be able to actively detect, identify and conduct terminal homing against the target SAM system or radar even once the latter has ceased emitting radar energy and is moving to avoid the incoming missile. Finally, it must be able to reliably penetrate the self-defence capabilities of Russian SAM and SHORAD systems such as the SA-15 Tor and the SA-22 Pantsir; either by being cheap enough to use in large numbers – simultaneously and on a sustainable basis – or by being manoeuvrable, stealthy or fast enough in terminal phases of flight to be hard to shoot down. These requirements are very different from the characteristics of the utility weapons that most NATO air forces are equipped with after decades of counterinsurgency focus, and there are only a few currently available options that can meet them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Candidate Munitions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first weapon that could meet these needs is the significantly more capable and stealthier extended-range variant of the AARGM – the AARGM-ER. In Europe, the AARGM-ER has so far been ordered by Finland, Poland and the Netherlands for use with their F-35A fleets, with likely delivery timeframes commencing in the mid-to-late 2020s. A rough comparison of the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) notices related to 265 missiles for the Netherlands (for $700 million) and 360 missiles for Poland (for $1.275 billion) suggests a unit cost of between $2.64 million and $3.54 million per missile. Training, mission planning tools and other non-recurring costs will also have been included in the DSCA figures, however, so the cost of each missile is probably closer to $2.53 million–$3 million. An even more advanced derivative of the AARGM-ER is also in development, called the Stand-in Attack Weapon, although initially this will be for US Air Force F-35As only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second option for a suitable SEAD/DEAD munition is the UK-developed SPEAR miniature cruise missile, a 250-lb-class turbojet-powered weapon designed for a stand-off range of more than 140 km and featuring a millimetric radar seeker to allow autonomous terminal homing against SAMs and other mobile targets within a target area. Up to eight will fit inside the weapons bays of a single F-35 and the weapon is designed specifically to work with that aircraft’s advanced threat detection, geolocation and targeting capabilities. SPEAR can also be carried on triple launchers by Typhoon, and could provide a useful stand-off SEAD/DEAD effector to support F-35s further forward in an IADS if the weapon were fully integrated and purchased in significant quantities. However, while SPEAR has been in development since 2010 for use with the F-35B, technical challenges and funding limitations have caused serious delays. These delays, coupled with the Ministry of Defence’s limited order size for production weapons, mean that the cost per weapon is high, and initial operational capability on the F-35B may not be achieved until 2028. The US Joint Programme Office has instead given integration priority within the F-35’s flight test and software upgrade schedule to other US and Allied weapons that have been ordered in greater numbers by more countries – such as the AARGM-ER and the Norwegian Joint Strike Missile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Joint Strike Missile, known as the AGM-184A Kraken in US service, represents another potentially useful option for SEAD/DEAD munitions. This subsonic air-launched cruise missile can be carried either externally or internally in the F-35A. According to US Department of Defense budget documents, the weapon features an imaging infra-red seeker for terminal guidance and has a combined GPS, inertial and terrain reference navigation system that allows it to be effective in “GPS-denied environments”, with stealth properties that confer survivability “against advanced threat systems”. However, like the much faster but probably shorter-ranged AARGM-ER, the Joint Strike Missile costs about $3 million per missile (using the US order of 268 missiles, for $848 million, as a guide).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cost-implications-and-trade-offs&quot;&gt;Cost Implications and Trade-Offs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What should be clear at this stage is that dedicated SEAD/DEAD munitions that are capable of reliably penetrating the defences around key Russian SAM systems to start dismantling the ground-based IADS are very expensive, specialised weapons. There are also only a fairly small number of potentially suitable existing weapons that meet the requirements. It is encouraging to see Norway, the Netherlands, Poland and Finland investing in Joint Strike Missile and AARGM-ER at a reasonable scale. Italy has also brought the AARGM into service with the Tornado ECR to replace HARM, and with a planned order for AARGM-ER to equip its F-35As, these are causes for celebration. However, for all these countries, the quantities purchased so far would still run out fairly quickly in a major campaign, and delivery timeframes remain a concern. There is potential for the UK to significantly improve its own capabilities in this area with a large joint order of SPEAR and its stand-in EA variant, the SPEAR-EW. To continue – and ideally rapidly expand – these European SEAD/DEAD munitions purchasing efforts, it will probably be necessary for several of these states to forgo building up significant stockpile levels of other types of munitions. The unit costs of AARGM-ER, SPEAR or Joint Strike Missile are many times higher than those of the sort of direct attack munitions that all NATO air forces have become accustomed to fighting with since the end of the Cold War. It therefore stands to reason that countries that purchase serious stockpiles of SEAD/DEAD munitions will have far less money available for CAS, ASuW and air-to-air weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need to increase stockpiles and the opportunity costs of doing so for SEAD/DEAD munitions also hold true, at least to a certain degree, for air-to-air missiles. European NATO air forces have faced little serious prospect of large-scale air-to-air combat since 1991. Consequently, stockpiles of AIM-120 AMRAAM medium-range radar-guided missiles, the very long-range Meteor missile and short-range missiles such as the AIM-132 ASRAAM, AIM-9X and AIM-2000 IRIS-T are far smaller than stocks of comparable missile classes were during the Cold War, across most air forces. The provision of some of these missiles to Ukraine for use as ground-based air defence interceptors in NASAMS, IRIS-T surface launch standard and surface launched missile and other improvised SAM systems has further eroded stockpiles. However, in any conflict with Russia, units tasked with conducting DCA or OCA would need to expend significant numbers of such weapons over a sustained period. Pilots engaging Russian aircraft would be doing so within the constraints imposed by the ground-based IADS threat, probably requiring a high proportion of BVR engagements. When fighting Russian aircraft equipped with modern radars and long-range missiles such as the R-37M (AA-13), BVR tactics would be likely to rely on significant numbers of low probability-of-kill shots with AMRAAM and Meteor to force hostile pilots to “go defensive” early (thus gaining control of engagements). Such tactics would inherently involve expending multiple weapons per target destroyed in many situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DCA missions to intercept salvoes of cruise missiles and Shahed-136/Geran-2 one-way attack drones would also consume large volumes of short-range missiles. This was vividly demonstrated during the DCA missions flown successfully by Israeli, American, British and French fighter aircraft against the Iranian attack on Israel on 13 April 2024. Such DCA interceptions are nevertheless an essential component of any strategy to enable the UK – and NATO more broadly – to rapidly improve integrated air and missile defence coverage in Europe, alongside ground-based SAM systems. Consequently, fielding robust capability across the DCA or OCA mission sets during a conflict of any meaningful duration will require having not only aircrew with sufficient proficiency and currency for the tasks against realistic Russian threats, as well as suitable aircraft, but also a significantly greater inventory of air-to-air missiles than most European air forces currently possess. In the absence of significant increases in overall air force funding, procuring such missiles in sufficient quantities is likely to require most European nations to forgo purchasing other classes of munitions – in other words, de facto mission specialisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;gps-dependence&quot;&gt;GPS Dependence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside the need to rapidly expand dedicated SEAD/DEAD, stand-off precision strike and air-to-air munitions stocks, another problem facing NATO air forces is the heavy reliance on GPS guidance for many counterinsurgency-era weapons systems. Russian forces have routinely used a wide range of tactical-, operational- and strategic-level GPS denial and/or spoofing systems during the war against Ukraine, as well as periodically demonstrating the ability to disrupt GPS at significant distances during NATO exercises and via disruption of civilian GPS services in the Baltic region. Perhaps even more worrying for NATO forces is that Russian forces have demonstrated the capability to rapidly adapt their EW tactics and waveforms to seriously degrade the accuracy of Western ground-launched and air-launched GPS-guided munitions. Generally, weapons such as the GMLRS rocket, GBU-62 JDAM and Excalibur GPS-guided artillery shell proved highly effective for the first month or two after they were supplied to Ukrainian forces, but once Russian EW operators started to dial in their effects, the performance of these systems began to rapidly degrade, to the point that in some cases they are now less precise than unguided equivalents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that the versions of weapons supplied to Ukraine may not be the most up to date in the NATO arsenal, due to security concerns around Russian capture of the most sensitive guidance kits, and so performance in Ukraine should not be taken as entirely indicative of a given weapon’s performance in NATO service. However, for the initial period of any clash with Russian forces, GPS guidance for existing weapons should not be assumed to be 100% reliable, and accuracy is likely to degrade fairly quickly after the initial few weeks of a conflict. Even where a high level of jamming resistance has been successfully designed into a weapon, it will still need to be rapidly upgraded once in service, or else risk losing effectiveness within months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The net result is a need to invest in a greater number of weapons, ideally across a wider variety of types than a basic analysis of target numbers to stockpiles would suggest, since effectiveness will be degraded by GPS spoofing/denial and other EW techniques, as well as Russian SHORAD coverage. In addition, air forces will need to invest in improving the rate at which they upgrade weapon guidance/seeker programming and aircraft mission data to keep pace with the increasingly rapid pace of adversary EW adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted, however, that if a successful SEAD/DEAD campaign can be mounted despite the likely denial or serious degradation of GPS in the first phases of a clash, airpower assets may be able to reduce the EW threat to munitions and sensors over time. This is because a NATO air campaign, in the wake of initial SEAD/DEAD successes, would probably include dedicated efforts to rapidly locate and destroy high-end Russian EW systems. Many of these EW systems must emit significant amounts of energy to have effects at longer ranges, and so can be detected and triangulated relatively easily, especially by the F-35 with its combination of sensor fusion, passive ELINT collection capabilities and geolocation capabilities. Destroying or suppressing major EW systems deployed by forward Russian forces would then allow effective use of GPS guidance against remaining Russian ground forces, at least in localised areas and/or for specific periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, it appears to be an unavoidable conclusion that regenerating the wartime capacity of the non-US air forces in NATO in a defensive context against Russia in the short to medium term will require states to make hard prioritisation decisions on munitions stockpile investments. The counterinsurgency-era solution of a consolidated mix of precision-guided bombs and short-range missiles optimised for efficient low-volume production and low collateral damage cannot deliver what is needed for SEAD/DEAD, DCA, OCA or deep strike. The relatively high cost of the weapons required for these mission sets means that achieving adequate stockpiles to guarantee reasonable combat endurance and effectiveness will come at a major opportunity cost for most small/medium-sized air forces – unless they also receive significant increases in funding. Given limited industrial production capacity and consequent lengthy delays to desired delivery timescales for many advanced munition types, national specialisation choices on mission sets could also help to enable delivery schedule negotiations and optimisation within NATO for each munition class, replacing the current “first come, first served” approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Conclusions and Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is vital that Russia be deterred from using a perceived window of opportunity to directly attack a NATO member’s territory if, in the coming years, the US is either militarily overstretched by a concurrent crisis in the Indo-Pacific, or appears to have politically disengaged from European defence commitments. Airpower is critical to rebuilding European NATO members’ ability to collectively repel and thereby deter opportunistic Russian aggression without large-scale reliance on US assets. Put bluntly: Russian leaders are very unlikely to take the risk of direct conflict if they believe that European NATO members can roll back Russia’s IADS through a SEAD/DEAD campaign and establish air superiority over any contested territory. It is difficult to see how non-US NATO members could achieve a similar level of conventional force overmatch in the medium term via any approach other than doubling down on airpower, given the many demographic, industrial and timeframe constraints on attempts to rapidly expand and reform land forces and navies. By contrast, the air assets required to conduct a successful SEAD/DEAD campaign and push back the VKS already largely exist in Europe, with the notable exception of sufficient specialised munitions stocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it will take significant investment and focus to realise the latent potential of Europe’s air forces in a high-intensity context. In this context, a number of recommendations can be made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-recommendations&quot;&gt;Key Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There must be a wider recognition among air forces and ministries of defence that developing and maintaining aircrew proficiency and currency in many of the more complex mission sets – such as OCA, DCA and SEAD/DEAD – require a lot of both live and synthetic flying training time dedicated to those tasks. This means that maintaining multi-role proficiencies to the levels required will require either greater resources for core flying training, or greater mission specialisation and focus during training compared with the approach employed during the past few decades. While simulator time helps with the high-intensity side of aircrew proficiency generation and currency, there are only so many hours in the working week, especially if a small force is constantly deployed on real-world operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given the high cost of flying hours for modern fast jets, it makes sense for countries that are unable to afford major increases in overall flying hours to concentrate a greater proportion of available flying training hours on the core tasks that they might credibly be allocated by NATO in a war. Such an approach might take the form of either a reduced mission liabilities set for squadrons or air forces as a whole; or a significant reduction in the tempo of overseas deployments and low-end exercise activities to allow the force to focus its valuable time on training for core mission sets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given the costs involved in purchasing relevant quantities of the specialised and expensive munitions needed for high-intensity conflict against Russian forces, there will be opportunity costs elsewhere in the inventory. Medium-sized air forces, therefore, should focus their efforts on specific mission sets rather than aim to purchase a full range of munitions types in totally inadequate quantities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where such specialisation decisions are to be made, however, they must be made in close coordination with other Allies and in accordance with an honest assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of each country.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;technical-and-geopolitical-considerations-for-implementation&quot;&gt;Technical and Geopolitical Considerations for Implementation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of assessments that ought to contribute to decisions on increasing the mission specialisation of a given air force, one of the most obvious being the inherent capabilities and drawbacks of its existing aircraft. For example, it makes little sense for a country that exclusively flies the F-35 to focus on DCA, since the aircraft is specifically designed for operations inside contested airspace, incurring a considerable cost and complexity premium to be able to do so. Essentially, the F-35 is a relatively inefficient asset for conducting QRA scrambles or holding DCA CAP stations to guard against hostile aircraft or missiles, at least compared with aircraft designed for those tasks, such as Typhoon or Gripen. Equally, for nations that operate exclusively 4th- or 4.5th-generation fighter fleets, a choice to focus on SEAD/DEAD and OCA would be comparatively inefficient, since, compared with the F-35, their assets inherently require a much greater degree of enablement and suppressive weapons use at scale to be survivable in a high-threat environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also political and geographical factors that might naturally lead certain NATO countries to choose to specialise in certain mission sets rather than others. For example, political conventions and constraints on the use of lethal force in Germany, alongside its geographic position at the heart of Europe, make it logical to suggest that the Luftwaffe focus primarily on DCA, and potentially supportive SEAD from stand-off, but not DEAD, OCA or deep strike. Experience from multiple conflicts since the end of the Cold War suggests that policy decisions in Berlin to authorise the Bundeswehr to take part in offensive strike operations as part of any NATO response to an attack by Russia would take significantly longer than in many other European capitals. In stark contrast, flying DCA CAPs and holding extended numbers of QRA assets at readiness in multiple locations would probably be authorised almost immediately. Given that the Luftwaffe already has a large and growing fleet of Eurofighter Typhoons, a decision to focus its capability-development efforts on acquiring large quantities of air-to-air munitions and realistic training and exercising for DCA at larger scale would make a great deal of sense. This might well come at the expense of integration and acquisition funding for other strike and stand-off weapons, and of training time for tasks such as interdiction and CAS. However, such a trade-off would be a price worth paying if it enabled Germany to demonstrate commitment to seriously enhancing its practical DCA and QRA capabilities in a NATO context. Such a demonstration by Germany could also provide risk mitigation, allowing Allies such as the Netherlands or Belgium – which have smaller fleets of F-35s – to take more risk on DCA and QRA training, readiness and weapons stocks, thus allowing them to focus on SEAD/DEAD and OCA. Clearly, geographical location relative to other Allied nations and proximity to various potential threat vectors will also influence the options that different countries feel that they have (or do not have) for taking on certain tasks or accepting risks against others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nordic Air Forces grouping is perhaps the best current example of the potential benefits available via cooperative specialisation. Norway and Finland – frontline states with both maritime and land borders with Russia – will soon operate fighter fleets solely comprising F-35As. Denmark will also shortly exchange its F-16s for F-35As, albeit at a significantly smaller scale. Sweden, by contrast, has a more protected land position, and operates a larger number of Gripen C/D (and soon new Gripen E) fighters. Following decades of close cooperation on a more ad hoc basis, these four air forces have recently committed to the Nordic air forces grouping, which includes a combined air operations centre. The joint planning visibility and regular exercises together allow each of the four nations to plan its own capability and training focus around a very significant level of trust in what the other three will provide in the event of a war. Sweden not only has more fighter aircraft than any of the other three Nordic states, but the Swedish Air Force can also afford to fly them more, as the Gripen is very economical to operate. Under the new concept, there is the opportunity for the Swedish Air Force to specialise in training and equipping its squadrons for DCA, ASuW and contested CAS. It can accept risk against penetrating OCA and SEAD/DEAD capabilities in the knowledge that Norwegian (and soon Finnish and Danish) F-35s will fight alongside it in any conflict against Russia, and will be well trained and equipped to cover those mission sets. The reverse is also true: Norway, Finland and Denmark can focus more of their F-35 weapons acquisition and training time on making the most of that platform’s inherent offensive potential, in the knowledge that they have a significant degree of defensive and anti-ship cover in the form of Swedish fighters that will operate with them in any conflict. As a result, the Nordic model promises to deliver collective combat capabilities that are significantly more potent than the four countries could achieve separately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;trust-burden-sharing-and-credibility&quot;&gt;Trust, Burden Sharing and Credibility&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For any air forces looking to the model of cooperative specialisation, with all the benefits that it promises, the key point to remember is that such cooperation relies on trust. Trust must be built up through consistent practical demonstrations of both military capability and political commitment. Burden sharing only works if both parties take on burdensome responsibilities and prove that they can carry them out. However, if medium and smaller European NATO air forces take the Russian threat seriously and are committed to building up warfare readiness and capacity quickly to ensure it is deterred, then cooperative mission specialisation appears to offer the most efficient route to doing so within the resource constraints and force structures available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may be seen as a step too far for the traditionally largest and arguably most capable European air forces – in particular the RAF and the Armée de l’Air et de l’Espace – which are culturally and doctrinally wedded to maintaining broad-spectrum forces. But the fact remains that, even for the UK and France, trying to maintain a broad-spectrum force on inadequate budgets with heavy deployment schedules for real world tasks over the past decades has led to varying degrees of hollowness across high-intensity mission readiness and a stark lack of suitable munitions stocks for defending NATO against Russian aggression. Unless funding is significantly increased and discretionary activity cut down to enable a greater focus on core NATO missions, greater mission specialisation may be needed here too – albeit with more choices available, thanks to the larger existing force structure of these two air forces than in the case of most other Allies. In the harsh light shone on Western forces, industrial capacity and political decision-making by Russia’s war on Ukraine, hollow forces appear far more obvious and far less credible to allies and adversaries alike.&lt;/p&gt;

Continued support for semiconductor design is vital for national security and global competitiveness.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. semiconductor design industry is a critically important strategic asset. It enables technological leadership in defense systems and fosters competitive advantage in manufacturing industries such as computing, telecommunications, autonomous vehicles, and medical devices. Design accounts for over 50 percent of total value added in the production of semiconductors—more than any other activity associated with the production process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. designers are the global leaders in every major segment of the industry, not just among leading-edge fabless firms. It is unsurprising, then, that the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022—which was designed to respond to major shortcomings in the U.S. semiconductor ecosystem—does not devote much attention to design, focusing instead on chip manufacturing, manufacturing equipment, and packaging. However, reflecting its importance, the U.S. design industry faces a growing challenge from Chinese firms, which, backed with state support, are gaining global market share at the expense of U.S. designers. The recent release of the Chinese artificial intelligence DeepSeek app, which rattled Silicon Valley and financial markets, demonstrates the speed at which assumptions of U.S. technological leadership can be upended by China’s rapidly growing innovation capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In part, this reflects the impact of U.S. export controls. While these controls have disrupted the operations of Chinese chip design firms over the short run, their imposition has catalyzed an unprecedented state-backed effort to promote the self-sufficiency and international competitiveness of China’s design sector. This pushback by Chinese companies against Western sanctions has already produced startling achievements, most notably Huawei’s 2023 introduction of the Kirin 9000S system-on-a-chip (SoC) manufactured on a 7 nanometer (nm) process for use in its Mate 60 Pro smartphone—a feat which, to the surprise of U.S. policymakers, occurred much sooner than anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the strategic and economic importance of maintaining U.S. chip design leadership along with China’s determination to challenge it, U.S. policy deliberations over a possible “CHIPS Act 2.0” need to recognize the critical contributions of this industry. Ultimately, the United States will need to implement a range of policy measures to support continued U.S. leadership in design as well as in manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chip-design-and-national-security&quot;&gt;Chip Design and National Security&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stakes are genuinely important. U.S. semiconductor design leadership means that U.S.-designed chips are superior to those from all other countries in terms of performance, sophistication, energy efficiency, and security—representing enormous strategic leverage. Moreover, because these chips are incorporated into virtually all U.S. defense platforms, the quality and reliability of the chips embedded in U.S. systems play a key role in battlefield performance, information acquisition, and evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The offshoring of U.S. chip manufacturing capability means that the most advanced U.S. designs are fabricated outside the United States, concentrated primarily on the island of Taiwan. This represents a significant strategic vulnerability for the United States, one that is at least beginning to be addressed. Yet a much greater vulnerability would emerge if the United States’ ability to create the most sophisticated and mission-specific chips were to be eclipsed by that of a strategic adversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security:&lt;/strong&gt; If an adversary could design and deploy chips more advanced than those in use by the United States, it could win a commanding advantage in every aspect of military preparedness, up to and including a major conflict. Should segments of the U.S. economy and defense industrial base ever find it necessary to utilize chips designed in China (or another adversarial state) because those chips were not available from domestic or friendly sources, then the United States’ defense posture, cybersecurity, and counterintelligence operations could be compromised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;If an adversary could design and deploy chips more advanced than those in use by the United States, it could win a commanding advantage in every aspect of military preparedness, up to and including a major conflict.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artificial Intelligence:&lt;/strong&gt; Nowhere is the need for continued U.S. design leadership more apparent than in artificial intelligence, particularly with regard to the AI systems expected to determine both economic advantage and battlefield capabilities in the twenty-first century. Today, most leading-edge AI chips are designed by Nvidia, with other sophisticated U.S. design firms such as AMD making major advances. It is therefore no coincidence that recently tightened U.S. export controls have restricted not only the export of chip design software to “countries of concern” but also specific U.S.-designed chips with advanced AI applications. To counter these restrictions, China is mounting well-funded efforts to improve its design capability for the chips needed to support AI. The 2025 release of the DeepSeek app is an indicator that these efforts represent a serious and multifaceted challenge—as one Chinese observer put it, “we should have confidence that China will eventually win the AI war with the US.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cybersecurity:&lt;/strong&gt; Chip design is also at the forefront of the ongoing struggle to ensure cybersecurity and to thwart hacking and tampering efforts, to which a number of “countries of concern” are reportedly devoting unprecedented resources. In a virtuous cycle, design leadership would improve the ability to protect design information and to trace and control design intellectual property (IP). Designing security into chips is becoming a multifaceted and complex challenge—as one engineer at one of the world’s leading fabless firms (Xilinx, which was subsequently acquired by AMD) observed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have to be able to encrypt the data coming in and encrypt the data going out. We may be able to reprogram your device and make sure that it’s coming from an authenticated source. And finally, we need to protect the IP that’s inside this device through cryptography and IP threat protection, with DPA (differential power analysis) resistance and things like that. All the security features that exist in our high-end devices need to be available in a low-cost FPGA [field programmable gate array].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Manufacturing Caveat:&lt;/strong&gt; It is of course true that, at the leading edge of the chip industry, the sophistication of chip design must be paired with equivalently sophisticated manufacturing capability, capacity, and equipment, and as such, access to manufacturing capability and capacity must also be considered in assessing the security threat of an adversary’s chip design industry. China’s Huawei, for example, may design highly advanced chips, but its ability to manufacture such a chip at scale appears severely constrained, as China’s most advanced foundry, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), is still generations behind the leading edge in both its processes and the equipment it deploys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this dynamic, Huawei and SMIC have proven to be a formidable partnership, reportedly stretching older-generation equipment to manufacture a chip at the 5 nm process, albeit with tremendous inefficiencies and at great cost. It is important to note that this is a capability that even the United States will lack until the various leading-edge CHIPS projects across the country begin high-volume production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, and perhaps most importantly, the design industry is far more diverse an ecosystem than just the leading edge. In many categories of semiconductors not defined by the density of their components, Chinese firms have the design talent, manufacturing capacity, scale, and resources to compete effectively with Western firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chips-act-largely-aimed-at-manufacturing&quot;&gt;CHIPS Act Largely Aimed at Manufacturing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2024, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo spoke at CSIS to provide an update on the U.S. government’s implementation of the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 (widely referred to as the “CHIPS Act”). This strongly bipartisan legislation was enacted primarily to address gaps and vulnerabilities in the country’s supply chain for semiconductors, most notably the absence of manufacturing capacity on U.S. soil for the most advanced chips as well as limited manufacturing capability for “foundational” chips with applications in the automotive, telecommunications, defense electronics, and other manufacturing sectors essential to the U.S. economy. The CHIPS Act authorizes and appropriates $39 billion in federal funding to encourage semiconductor manufacturing on U.S. soil, with an additional $12 billion allocated for various research initiatives such as the National Semiconductor Technology Center (NSTC), National Advanced Packaging Manufacturing Program (NAPMP), and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) metrology research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In her address to CSIS, Secretary Raimondo underscored the advantages associated with the U.S. edge in chip design in the country’s overall competition with China in microelectronics. While the secretary was right to celebrate the strengths of the U.S. design industry, the existing CHIPS Act does not address the needs of U.S. chip designers in this increasingly competitive segment of the industry. The 400-page act is principally concerned with arresting the erosion of the domestic U.S. chip manufacturing base. To do so, it provides direct grants to support both foreign and domestic manufacturing firms in the United States. Although the act also includes a 25 percent tax credit for investments in chip manufacturing, a benefit estimated at $46 billion by the Congressional Budget Office (but one that may considerably exceed that amount), it only indirectly addresses chip design. U.S. chip design firms are not eligible for the direct federal funding authorized by the act or for the 25 percent tax credit; the federal funding is being directed toward manufacturers and their upstream equipment and materials suppliers only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, for chip design, there is only a relatively small and indirect amount of funding being allocated. NIST has released a vision for the NSTC that spells out, among many other initiatives, a plan for a “design enablement gateway” intended to “facilitate collaboration, reduce cost and time to market, and broaden access to important tools and information, all while respecting private companies’ IP.” The Department of Commerce CHIPS Office plans to allocate $5 billion to support the NSTC, operated by the National Center for the Advancement of Semiconductor Technology (Natcast), as well as other R&amp;amp;D and workforce initiatives. The portion of this outlay that will be allocated to chip design is comparatively modest relative to the resources going to chip manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to question the wisdom of the CHIPS Act’s focus on manufacturing. The act was intended to address emerging and existing gaps and vulnerabilities in the U.S. chip supply chain that pose immediate risks to national security and future economic well-being. These immediate vulnerabilities are in the manufacturing and packaging of advanced chips. The design sector is not a “gap” or “vulnerability” in the U.S. chip supply chain—on the contrary, the United States is far and away the world leader in innovative ability, market share, and international competitiveness in this crucial sector. The sector is thus not an obvious candidate for public policy initiatives intended to mend holes in the U.S. industrial fabric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, viewed in a global competitive context and looking beyond the immediate challenges in chip manufacturing, the question of government support comes to the fore. As noted, design is the most valuable element in the entire chip production chain, and for that reason, China is supporting efforts by Chinese firms to challenge U.S. design leadership. The relative levels of public support combined with the absence of market discipline and growth in the Chinese talent base pose significant challenges to the U.S. industry’s ability to sustain its strong global position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-chip-design-landscape-today&quot;&gt;The Chip Design Landscape Today&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;current-us-global-dominance-in-design&quot;&gt;Current U.S. Global Dominance in Design&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the U.S. semiconductor design industry is the strongest in the world, it is important to recognize that it is heterogeneous, consisting of five main types of companies. In each of these subsectors, U.S. firms enjoy a strong global competitive position, at least for now. According to a 2022 study by the Semiconductor Industry Association and the Boston Consulting Group (henceforth the “SIA/BCG study”), 50.2 percent of global semiconductor revenues in 2023 were derived from the design activities of U.S.-based firms—2.5 times as much as from any other region. With respect to logic devices, U.S.-based design activities accounted for 65 percent of global revenues in 2022. These revenues, and companies’ willingness to draw from them to invest massively in R&amp;amp;D, are essential to maintaining the U.S. lead across a range of technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrated Device Manufacturers (IDMs):&lt;/strong&gt; IDMs are vertically integrated entities that both design and manufacture semiconductors. Major U.S.-based IDMs include Intel Corporation, Micron Technology, and Texas Instruments. Intel is currently forecasting that its design effort will progress dramatically—by five chip nodes in four years—entering what it calls the “Angstrom Era.” While currently facing some turbulence, Intel’s stated goal is to incorporate 1 trillion transistors in a single processor package by 2030, about 10 times the current number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fabless Firms:&lt;/strong&gt; Fabless firms focus exclusively on semiconductor design, outsourcing the production of chips based on their designs to foundries that specialize in manufacturing, thereby avoiding the enormous capital costs associated with the most advanced manufacturing. This enables these firms to concentrate on chip design—and, more importantly, to concentrate their substantial R&amp;amp;D expenditures only on chip design. By comparison, IDMs must invest major sums in both design R&amp;amp;D and the capital outlays needed to build the fabs and the assembly, test, and packaging facilities that fabricate the chips they design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The economic advantages of being fabless are compelling. Seven of the world’s top ten fabless firms by revenue are U.S. companies, including Nvidia, Qualcomm, and AMD. In addition, five of the world’s top ten global firms in 2023 by annual revenue were fabless firms. Finally, from a U.S. semiconductor industry point of view, five of the U.S. industry’s top six companies by annual revenue in 2023 were fabless firms. The U.S. semiconductor industry has largely embraced the fabless business model and its avoidance of the heavy capital costs of production. The United States is the current global fabless leader, an important factor underlying the U.S. industry’s global leadership in chip design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, U.S. strengths in design now underpin the growth in AI. Artificial intelligence chips designed by Nvidia account for over 80 percent of the market for advanced AI chips and “underpin all of the most advanced AI systems.” Nvidia is one of the United States’ five most valuable firms, with a market valuation of over $3 trillion as of July 2024. A central goal of the CHIPS Act was to ensure that at least some of these advanced chips could be manufactured in fabs within U.S. borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs):&lt;/strong&gt; OEMs use semiconductors in other products they make, such as smartphones and automobiles. In recent years, OEMs have begun designing advanced chips tailored for use in their own end products, and U.S.-based OEMs have enjoyed dramatic successes designing custom chips. Apple, for example, designed its own “Apple silicon” series processors, first for its smartphones and tablets, then replacing Intel-designed and fabricated chips for its PCs in 2020—reaping “huge benefits,” particularly via increased PC market share. Other major U.S. OEM chip designers include Amazon and Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electronic Design Automation (EDA) Firms:&lt;/strong&gt; EDA firms provide automated design tools and many types of services to chip designers. While not chip designers themselves, their software is indispensable for the design of advanced semiconductor devices. The world’s three leading EDA software firms—Synopsys, Cadence Design Systems, and Mentor Graphics—are located in the United States; Mentor Graphics is owned by the German firm Siemens but operates in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intellectual Property (IP) Providers:&lt;/strong&gt; IP providers license intellectual property that can be used as building blocks for new designs, avoiding the cost and added time of developing an entirely new design from scratch. Many firms license IP as a source of revenue, but in 2021, U.S.-based firms accounted for the largest share (72 percent) of revenues from EDA and IP blocks, with Europe accounting for most of the rest (20 percent). The leading European firm in this space is UK-based Arm Holdings, which licenses processor cores to design companies. As of 2020, Arm cores drove 90 percent of mobile phone applications worldwide and 34 percent of the entire semiconductor industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;clouds-on-the-horizon&quot;&gt;Clouds on the Horizon?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the dominant position of the U.S. chip design industry, one could fairly ask: What is the problem? Recent projections of an eroding global market share have not materialized. The 2022 SIA/BCG study, which warned that U.S. market share fell from 50 percent in 2000 to 46 percent in 2020, forecast that it would fall further to 36 percent by 2030, reflecting the emergence of the Chinese chip design industry (which accounted for almost zero percent of the global market in 2000, rose to 9 percent in 2020, and was forecast to hit 23 percent in 2030). To be sure, the most recent data available, from 2023, shows the U.S. share recovering to 50.2 percent by 2030, reflecting recent market successes of U.S.-designed AI- drive server chips. However, the advent of China’s DeepSeek AI app, developed despite U.S. export controls on AI chip technology, suggests that the 50.2 percent figure may be overly sanguine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, figures depicting only total global market shares mask trends in submarkets that concern industry observers. The gross numbers in the SIA/BCG study and in more recent surveys do not reflect the fact that U.S. chip design firms are not the market leaders in every semiconductor design product subsegment, nor do they show that in some areas, U.S. designers face growing challenges from China. According to the SIA/BCG study, in 2021, U.S. firms held an overwhelming share of submarkets for advanced processors (88 percent) and analog devices (58 percent) and maintained the leading share in other logic devices (31 percent, versus 28 percent for Europe). Still, in other important categories U.S. firms trail the market leaders:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optoelectronics:&lt;/strong&gt; In 2021, U.S. design firms accounted for only 13 percent of the optoelectronics market, versus 35 percent for Japan, 15 percent for China, and 15 percent for Korea. In 2023, the Chinese Academy of Engineering designated optoelectronic semiconductors as one of 14 “challenges it wants to crack.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory:&lt;/strong&gt; In 2021, U.S. firms accounted for 28 percent of the memory market versus 57 percent for Korea. But in late 2023, China’s leading DRAM developer, ChangXin Memory Technologies (CXMT), unveiled a concept design featuring gate-all-around (GAA) transistor architecture, which is equivalent to global state-of-the-art memory designs. This shows significant Chinese progress in design, although CXMT’s timeline and capacity for manufacturing such a chip remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-Optical Sensors:&lt;/strong&gt; In 2021, U.S. firms held an 18 percent share of the market for non-optical sensors, versus 31 percent for Europe and 22 percent for Japan. China’s 2021 Three-Year Action Plan for the Internet of Things calls for targeted support for temperature, gas, motion, photoelectric, velocity, and biochemical sensors (e.g., non-optical sensors).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discrete Devices:&lt;/strong&gt; Discrete devices are chips with only one transistor. Although not technologically sophisticated, these have ubiquitous applications and represent a supply chain risk if not available in adequate quantities to U.S. manufacturers. In 2021, U.S. firms held a 27 percent share of the market for discrete devices, versus 36 percent for Europe and 26 percent for Japan. According to one source, China attained self-sufficiency in discrete chips in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Next Generation of Design Engineers:&lt;/strong&gt; Even in EDA tools, where U.S. firms hold an apparently insurmountable edge over China, Chinese observers see a long-range opportunity for their country. One commented in 2019 that “if you look at the main [U.S.] companies in this software market segment, the average age of many [of their EDA engineers] is like 50 years old now. So, this is an opportunity for China to invest [in talent and other resources to support EDA research and development],” especially since academic researchers in the United States are not getting enough funding to pursue further EDA development. “So, these professors and a lot of engineers have moved on to do something else.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-need-for-a-long-term-well-financed-effort-on-talent&quot;&gt;The Need for a Long-Term, Well-Financed Effort on Talent&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above comment highlights the importance of a long-term view of a nation’s talent base and support for the research that will underpin future private investments. The U.S. Chips for America Strategy, which outlines the planned implementation of the U.S. CHIPS Act, acknowledges that at present, “there is a severe shortage of workers who are trained and ready to fill new roles in specialized construction, fab operations, and semiconductor design,” and forecasts that as much as $8 billion will be required to expand the existing worker base. In chip design, initiatives are needed to scale up the existing workforce and create pathways through community colleges and four-year institutions to feed students into the design pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that China is and will remain the United States’ principal strategic competitor, a key question for U.S. policymakers is whether the recent strides of China’s chip design sector represent a competitive and strategic challenge to the United States. Clearly, they do. A 2023 study by the European research consortium Digital Power China posed the same question from a European perspective and concluded that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The growing competitiveness of Chinese chip design companies has so far been neglected by policymakers in Europe. Despite the recent U.S. export controls targeting China’s semiconductor industry, it is highly likely that Chinese chip design companies will gain global market share in a range of industry sectors in this decade. This presents challenges across the dimensions of national security, supply chain resilience, and technological competitiveness for Europe, its end-customer industries and semiconductor companies. Importantly, most of these challenges are not addressed by the proposed European Chips Act and will require different and tailored policy responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arguably, the same could be said of the U.S. CHIPS Act. The challenges the report describes in security and competitiveness for Europe are clearly the United States’ challenges as well. To address them, U.S. policymakers need to break away from the constraints of outmoded views on global trade and industrial policy and instead address the reality and effectiveness of the state-backed enterprises focused on challenging the U.S. design industry. Tailored measures to support U.S. design firms are necessary in the face of this unprecedented Chinese national effort to displace them. Both serious resources and adaptive policies will be required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinas-advances-in-chip-design&quot;&gt;China’s Advances in Chip Design&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s share of the global chip design market grew from virtually zero in 2003 to 7 percent in 2023. While these growth figures are impressive for a new entrant, they do not suggest a serious threat to U.S. global leadership in the near term. However, one must recognize the long-term challenge represented by the Chinese government’s determination to transform the country’s design sector into a global competitive leader and a pillar of China’s national defense posture, as well as the magnitude of government resources being committed to that effort. Although China’s chip designers have been set back by Western sanctions, it is likely that sustained governmental support at scale and the growing quality of Chinese research and engineers complemented by the large domestic market will enable the nation’s design sector to continue to expand its global market share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;massive-government-support&quot;&gt;Massive Government Support&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In global competition for high-tech industry, there is arguably no parallel for the sheer scale of China’s commitment of public resources to the semiconductor industry. In 2014, the State Council released the National Guideline for the Development and Promotion of the Integrated Circuit Industry (“National IC Plan”), setting forth a long-range plan to promote the domestic semiconductor industry. Concurrently, it established the China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund (also known as “the Big Fund”) to undertake investments in the semiconductor industry, combining government, private, and public-private funds. Wenwu Ding, the president of the Big Fund, said that the plan was to make $100 billion dollars available to the semiconductor ecosystem from central, regional, and local governments and public/private investment vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In global competition for high-tech industry, there is arguably no parallel for the sheer scale of China’s commitment of public resources to the semiconductor industry&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These measures were followed in 2015 by the State Council’s release of Made in China 2025, a ten-year plan for promoting national manufacturing industries—particularly “core development sectors” such as semiconductors, which were to be promoted for “breakthrough development.” At the end of 2022, China was reportedly planning to spend an astonishing $143 billion over the next five years to promote the domestic semiconductor industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese National IC Plan emphasizes the importance of semiconductor design. A 2024 joint study by the Semiconductor Industry Association and the Boston Consulting Group found that in the first two rounds of funding from the Big Fund, Chinese fabless design companies received billions of dollars in public funding. In 2024, the Chinese government announced a third phase of the Big Fund, with registered capital of $47.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to calculate with precision the total amount of Chinese government funding directed to chip design; in addition to fabless firms, the first two rounds of investment from the Big Fund directed over $10 billion to IDMs, which included but was not limited to design activities. These firms, which include Huawei, Tencent, Xiaomi, and Alibaba, have developed robust internal chip design capabilities—usually through subsidiaries—that have surprised Western analysts. In addition, regional and municipal governments, particularly those of Shanghai and Shenzhen, have provided strong direct support to China’s chip design firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflecting the government’s support for the chip design industry, venture capital has poured into the design sector. In 2020, 67.2 percent of venture capital investments in the Chinese semiconductor industry were in IC design. In addition, China exempts key design firms from corporate income tax for five years after their first profitable year and taxes at a reduced rate of 10 percent thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government’s demonstration of support for the semiconductor design sector has fostered a “gold rush” of start-ups in the design space, in which barriers to entry are relatively low, particularly when compared to manufacturing. According to one report, as of September 2020 there was an astounding total of 138,000 semiconductor design start-ups in China, most of them registered after the formation of the Big Fund in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken on its own, a vast landscape of firms responding to abundant funding does not indicate success. Huge numbers of these firms have failed and will continue to fail. In the summer of 2024, for instance, the promising start-up X-Epic, a developer of indigenous EDA software, reportedly slashed its 400-person workforce by half, “casting a shadow over Beijing’s efforts to achieve tech self-sufficiency,” in one observer’s view. X-Epic’s predicament is representative of the broader asphyxiation of China’s start-up ecosystem since the pandemic. According to the Financial Times, China’s start-up launches in 2024 totaled just 260, down from a peak of over 50,000 in 2018. “The whole industry has just died before our eyes,” one Chinese executive lamented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the downturn, there has been some success with a few key players emerging, including Loongson Technology, a designer of general-purpose microprocessors; Black Sesame, a designer of low-power automotive chips; Biren Technologies, a designer of general-purpose GPUs; and Horizon Robotics, a designer of autonomous driving computing chips. Nor has the ecosystem died. At present, there are over 3,000 fabless design firms in China, collectively with double-digit annual growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-impact-of-western-export-controls&quot;&gt;The Impact of Western Export Controls&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the growing geopolitical threat posed by China’s increased capabilities in this industry, the United States and some allies began curtailing the export of semiconductor technology to China in 2019, when the Trump administration placed Huawei and 68 of its non-U.S. affiliates on the Entity List—effectively barring them from using U.S. chip technology and software, including all U.S. EDA tools, when their licenses expired. At the time it was believed that “without American EDA tools, it would be basically impossible for Huawei to design chips.” Since then, the Biden administration has further tightened controls on exports of U.S. chips, chip technology, and chip design and manufacturing tools. In 2022, it announced multilateral controls on the export of certain EDA tools that can be used to design gate-all-around field effect transistor (GAAFET) architecture, currently the most advanced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western sanctions dealt a serious blow to China’s chip designers, which could, until 2022, rely on U.S. EDA design tools and IP. Reflecting the apparent ease of accessing foreign technology, relatively little had been done to develop domestic EDA capability or ownership of IP: “So long as indigenous firms could tap the best of what the world had to offer, local investors had low economic incentives to reinvent the wheel.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to losing access to the most advanced chip design tools, Chinese chip designers experienced diminished access to foreign foundries, particularly TSMC, which had formerly fabricated their most advanced designs. By curtailing its services for Chinese designers in response to Western export controls, TSMC dealt a blow to HiSilicon, Huawei’s design subsidiary, and Zeku, the chip design subsidiary of Chinese smartphone maker Oppo, causing Zeku to shut its doors. Two top Chinese designers of AI chips, MetaX and Enflame, have reportedly submitted downgraded versions of their designs to TSMC to comply with U.S. restrictions. The two firms had previously marketed their chips as being comparable to Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, the Chinese government and chip industry have demonstrated considerable resilience and ingenuity in response to Western sanctions. Although the sanctions have indisputably disrupted China’s semiconductor industry in the near term, the response has been to implement countermeasures which, over the long term, will substantially enhance the competitiveness of the Chinese chip industry and reduce its dependency on foreign technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sanctions are thus having the concerning longer-term effect of incentivizing China to create its own indigenous design tools and encouraging unprecedented support for the industry. In a sense, the sanctions have highlighted the structural advantage of Chinese firms. They do not have to have better technology, much less be profitable; they only have to capture market share, allowing them to move down the cost curve and up the learning curve while reducing Western competitors’ revenue—and therefore their resources to invest in the next generations of technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;huaweis-central-role&quot;&gt;Huawei’s Central Role&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s dominant telecommunications equipment maker, Huawei, is also the country’s largest consumer of semiconductors and its leading chip designer, primarily through its design subsidiary, HiSilicon. According to a widely cited Bloomberg report, the U.S. blacklisting of Huawei in 2019 induced the Chinese government to turn to the company as “the effective captain of China’s effort to develop a self-sufficient chip industry . . . In Huawei they have a rare national champion with the grit, scale and technological prowess to push back.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huawei overhauled its operations to redesign its equipment and software so they could function without U.S. technology. Huawei’s current-generation smartphone, the Pura 70 line, incorporates 33 China-sourced components and only 5 sourced from outside China. At the same time, Huawei began to provide engineering expertise and financial support to smaller companies in key parts of the semiconductor supply chain. HiSilicon, the largest chip design company in China, is best known for its development of all the chips for Huawei’s smartphones and tablets, most notably the Kirin range. One of its recent chips was recently shown to outperform Nvidia’s flagship V100 device in some respects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to Huawei’s efforts, a number of China’s big data equipment manufacturers are stepping up their efforts to promote advances in domestic chip design, including Baidu, Tencent, Xiaomi, and Alibaba. These firms bring substantial resources and proven track records and may well offer a path to a more robust domestic industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-challenge-of-indigenous-eda-tools&quot;&gt;The Challenge of Indigenous EDA Tools&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of 2023, EDA tool firms Cadence, Synopsys, and Siemens EDA controlled 80 percent of China’s market. U.S. export controls have compelled these firms to curtail some China sales—including, significantly, EDA software containing GAAFET technology, which is needed to support the design of AI chips. Although China has little to no prospect of developing its own advanced EDA tools in the near future, U.S. leadership should not be taken for granted over the longer term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;from-policy-neglect-to-focus&quot;&gt;From Policy Neglect to Focus&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDA was neglected by Chinese government policymakers until the advent of sanctions. As one industry observer noted: “For the longest time, Chinese industrial policymakers didn’t realize [EDA software] is the real bottleneck.” Somewhat belatedly, China’s current Five-Year Plan now lists EDA as the “first cutting-edge technology in the semiconductor industry where China needs to make breakthroughs.” Reflecting this change in orientation, domestic EDA developers are receiving substantially increased government financial support and have made some early gains. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2022, the municipal government of Shanghai said it would subsidize 30 percent of the cost of chip software investments such as EDA tools.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The same year, the municipal government of Shenzhen committed to providing a subsidy of up to $1.4 million to companies that buy “home-grown” EDA tools.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A number of executives from U.S. EDA firms have left to join Chinese rivals “as Beijing seeks to break America’s near monopoly on this key segment of the semiconductor industry.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s leading EDA developer, Empyrean Technology, experienced a sixfold increase in revenues between 2018 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In April 2024, the Chinese firm Xinhuazhang introduced its first EDA design software that can work on domestically made processors (Huawei’s Kunpeng processors and Phytium’s Feiteng devices). As observed by one industry expert, “this is a significant development for China’s semiconductor industry as domestic chip designers can now design devices and simulate them using solely domestic software and hardware.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relevantly for the long-term effectiveness of Western sanctions, EDA tools are software, which are more difficult for Western allies to control than hardware like lithography equipment. A recent article in the MIT Technology Review notes that “EDA software tools are distributed online, so they can be pirated. Chinese companies could either hold onto the EDA software they have already purchased or resort to hacking licenses or acquiring them through shadow entities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese firms are seeking to acquire Western companies with EDA competencies—in 2022, the United Kingdom rejected a bid by a Shanghai software developer to take over Pulsic Limited, a developer of chip design software. One analyst suggests that Chinese design firms can continue to acquire EDA tools by setting up shell companies with no apparent connection to firms on the Entity List as a legal front for acquiring EDA licenses, perhaps in collaboration with foreign EDA vendors. And in April 2022, the U.S. EDA supplier Synopsys was reportedly under investigation by the Department of Commerce for allegedly sharing its design software with HiSilicon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-risc-v-challenge&quot;&gt;The RISC-V Challenge&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese government is encouraging domestic chip designers to utilize RISC-V reduced instruction set architecture for custom processors as an alternative to licensing IP blocks from Western firms such as Intel and Arm. RISC-V is an open-source architecture managed by a Swiss foundation that allows semiconductor design teams to access and implement RISC-V standard free of charge. It is not subject to U.S. and allied export controls, and Chinese entities including Alibaba, Huawei, ZTE, and Tencent are active participants in the RISC-V foundation. Members of the U.S. Congress recently warned that China might use RISC-V to circumvent U.S. export controls on general computing processors, should the United States decide to adopt them in the future. In April 2024, the Department of Commerce said that it was reviewing the national security implications of China’s use of RISC-V technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Beijing Open-Source Chip Research Institute, a group of research centers that includes the Chinese Academy of Sciences and hyper-scalers Tencent and Alibaba, is developing indigenous chip design architecture based on RISC-V. According to the Silicon Triangle report, “if it succeeds, the group’s Xiangshan RISC-V architecture could free China from IP constraints imposed by Arm, the Cambridge-based company whose technology underlies most cell phones, including Apple products.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government incentives are being offered to spur adoption of IP that implements RISC-V in chip designs, and domestic design firms are reporting successes in applying RISC-V architecture. The municipal government of Shanghai was the first to kickstart RISC-V development in 2018, offering specific financial incentives to encourage companies to develop RISC-V processors and related IP. In that year, the city oversaw the formation of the RISC-V Industry Alliance, convening local start-ups in a collaboration that had grown to 173 companies by mid-2023. In 2023, nine leading chip design firms, including Alibaba’s chip unit T-Head and Baidu-backed StarFive, formed a patent alliance for RISC-V to enable IP sharing and third-party licensing to promote a “healthy” open-source environment and the “rapid development of RISC-V technologies.” The municipal government of Shenzhen is providing up to $1.4 million to firms that are working on open standard RISC-V chip design architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These efforts are bearing fruit, with Chinese chip designers reporting successes in applications of RISC-V architecture:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In December 2022, a dozen Chinese chip firms launched 11 new RISC-V-based chips with applications in wireless communications, automobiles, security, and energy management.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2023, Alibaba’s chip design subsidiary, T-Head, launched a RISC-V-based controller chip, Zhenyue 510, for applications in artificial intelligence training, online transactions, and big data analysis. A T-Head executive said that his company was launching an initiative to encourage 150,000 developers to learn about and secure international credentials with respect to RISC-V.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alibaba’s research arm, Damo Academy, announced in 2024 that it expects to launch the next generation of its RISC-V XuanTie processors, the C930, in 2024. The new chip has applications in 5G communications, robotics, and financial services.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;upgrading-domestic-foundries-for-independence-from-the-global-network&quot;&gt;Upgrading Domestic Foundries for Independence from the Global Network&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, to reduce its dependence on foreign firms, China is now devoting massive government resources to upgrading its domestic chip foundries—an effort which, if successful, would partially mitigate indigenous designers’ loss of access to TSMC and other Western foundries with respect to the production of high-end designs. Domestic foundries such as SMIC and Hua Hong Semiconductor are reportedly “actively” increasing capacity, particularly for the production of legacy chips used in current industrial applications. Total Chinese foundry capacity is forecast to grow by 15 percent in 2024 alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western sanctions prevent Chinese foundries from utilizing ASML’s most advanced lithography equipment, based on extreme ultraviolet (EUV) technology, which is needed to make the 2, 3, and 5 nm chips supporting advanced artificial intelligence. An open question is how far Chinese foundries can push their existing chipmaking capabilities to close the gap with Western chip firms. Huawei “shocked the world” in 2023 by unveiling its 7 nm processor in collaboration with the domestic foundry SMIC. As noted earlier, Huawei is reportedly set to launch a smartphone with an SoC manufactured with SMIC’s 5 nm process in October 2024. Whether these chips can be produced cost effectively at scale remains to be seen from a commercial perspective, but it does suggest they might be able to produce chips to meet high-end defense requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recent-chinese-chip-design-achievements&quot;&gt;Recent Chinese Chip Design Achievements&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the Chinese chip design sector has been shaken by Western export controls, it is rapidly developing workarounds. An executive at a Chinese EDA firm said in December 2024 that while China “is blocked from advanced processing technologies, both in software and hardware . . . using 3D stacking and heterogenous integration offers a long-term viable solution to bypass sanctions.” The implementation of U.S. export controls has been paralleled by significant Chinese advances in chip design, calling into question the long-term effectiveness of U.S. restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 2022:&lt;/strong&gt; The U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) releases initial export controls on advanced chip technology and manufacturing equipment to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 2022:&lt;/strong&gt; Moore Threads Technology, a U.S.-blacklisted Chinese GPU design firm founded by a former Nvidia executive, is proving adept at quickly developing alternatives to foreign-restricted chips with consumer electronics applications. The company’s MTT S80, introduced in 2022, is being compared favorably by video gamers with Nvidia hardware. Although the MTT S80 does not perform as well as Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 3060, it costs about 40 percent less, opening opportunities to capture significant market share and the associated revenues to fund further development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 2023:&lt;/strong&gt; Tencent announces that despite Western sanctions it is entering mass production of a chip developed in-house, a video transcoding processor called Canghai that will be used to power cloud gaming and video streaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 2023:&lt;/strong&gt; BIS releases updated controls to close loopholes, expand sanctioned firms, and control additional categories of equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;December 2023:&lt;/strong&gt; HiSilicon designs the Kirin 9000s, the 7 nm SoC that supports Huawei’s Mate 60 Pro smartphone—a development that startles U.S. officials concerned about the effectiveness of U.S. and allied chip export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;December 2023:&lt;/strong&gt; ChangXin Memory Technologies (CXMT) presents a paper at the IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting indicating “its design capabilities for gate-all-around (GAA) transistors—the most advanced transistor type for cutting-edge 3-nanometre grade chips.” CXMT’s presentation “grabbed the attention of industry analysts, as the design of such chips typically involves technologies that are subject to US export restrictions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 2024:&lt;/strong&gt; Huawei is reportedly considering incorporation of 5 nm chips designed by SMIC despite U.S. sanctions in upcoming versions of its Mate 70 smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September 2024:&lt;/strong&gt; ByteDance, the owner of TikTok, is reportedly planning to use TSMC to manufacture two of its 5 nm chip designs to reduce dependency on Nvidia chips. ByteDance denies these reports, stating that all of its chip projects are “in compliance with relevant trade control regulations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 2024:&lt;/strong&gt; SenseTime group, a partially government-owned Chinese AI software firm, discloses that it was using “a lot” of domestically produced chips “to train its large language models as part of its efforts to rapidly develop a homegrown AI computing ecosystem.” The company noted, in particular, Huawei’s latest AI accelerator, Ascend910C, which it said offers “a significant performance improvement.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 2024:&lt;/strong&gt; TSMC reportedly tells multiple Chinese customers that it was suspending production of their AI and high-performance computing chips in order to ensure compliance with U.S. export controls. Similarly, Xiaomi is reportedly “preparing a self-designed mobile processor for its upcoming smartphones in an effort to reduce its reliance on foreign suppliers Qualcomm and MediaTek.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;December 2025:&lt;/strong&gt; The Biden administration expands its blacklist of Chinese chip firms, extending it to Chinese suppliers of EDA software, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, specialty gases, and infrastructure firms supporting Huawei’s chip development efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 2025:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States tightens its controls on exports of semiconductors to China, restricting all exports of chips under or at 14 and 16 nm, with transistor counts exceeding 30 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 2025:&lt;/strong&gt; China’s leading designer of memory chips, YMTC, has reportedly “achieved a significant technological breakthrough despite US sanctions,” a “dual deck” memory device joining two wafers together through hybrid bonding to produce a total of 294 gates. Memory chip leaders like Samsung and Hynix are reportedly watching these developments with the concern that YMTC’s hybrid bonding technology may enable stacking of additional layers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;potential-chinese-workarounds-to-sanctions&quot;&gt;Potential Chinese Workarounds to Sanctions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese policymakers and industry executives are exploring innovative ways to work around Western sanctions, efforts which likely would not have been undertaken absent the restrictions. While at first glance some of these solutions appear far-fetched, it is not inconceivable that they could lead to destabilizing breakthroughs—an excellent example of which is the January 2025 release of the DeepSeek AI app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Packaging:&lt;/strong&gt; A stratagem reportedly being used by Chinese chip designers to offset the impact of sanctions is engaging Malaysian packaging firms to assemble GPUs to support AI, a move that apparently does not violate the sanctions. As noted in Malaysian news sources, “advanced packaging of chips can significantly improve chip performance and is emerging as a critical technology in the semiconductor industry,” enabling, among other things, the creation of “chiplets where chips are packaged tightly to work as one powerful brain.” While China lags behind Taiwanese, Korean, and U.S. firms in advanced packaging technology, it still promises to stretch the performance of domestically designed and manufactured chips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photonics:&lt;/strong&gt; Chinese scientists have reportedly developed a low-cost method for producing photonic integrated circuits for use in supercomputers and data centers using photons to communicate information, based on the material lithium tantalate. The discovery is expected to help “reduce the impact of US sanctions.” In October 2024, China’s silicon photonics JFS Laboratory disclosed that it had succeeded in lighting up a laser light source integrated with a silicon-based chip, filling in “one of the few blanks” in China’s optoelectronics technology.” Chinese scientists are also reportedly experimenting with alternatives to silicon substrates to circumvent sanctions, such as silicon carbide, cubic boron arsenide, and graphene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alternative Forms of Lithography:&lt;/strong&gt; China’s Tsinghua University has announced a plan to bypass Western restrictions on the export of lithography machines by developing a particle accelerator with an electron beam that can serve as a high-quality light source for on-site chip manufacturing. The plan is to build a “colossal” factory housing multiple lithography machines arrayed around the particle accelerator, enabling production of 2 nm chips in high volume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;long-run-prospects-chinas-inherent-advantages&quot;&gt;Long-Run Prospects: China’s Inherent Advantages&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Western sanctions have dealt a severe blow to China’s semiconductor design ecosystem, they have also served as a major stimulus to the indigenous development China has sought for decades. And it is important to keep in mind that over the long term, China’s design sector enjoys intrinsic advantages that will ensure that its global market share grows throughout the remainder of this decade and beyond. The massive and focused government support noted above is assured, providing major incentives in resources and reliable ongoing support for firms to invest—a situation in sharp contrast to that endured by early-stage Western firms. China also benefits from other positive factors, such as the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Massive Domestic Demand:&lt;/strong&gt; China consumes over half of the world’s semiconductors, and demand from domestic OEMs represents an enormous potential advantage for Chinese chip designers. Chinese OEMs account for 27 percent of global chip demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Domestic Alternatives:&lt;/strong&gt; As noted, traditionally China-based OEMs have depended heavily on imported chips, but “as a direct result of US export restrictions, non-US OEMs are increasingly turning to locally designed semiconductors.” The geographic proximity of Chinese designers to domestic OEMs represents an added advantage. Restrictions on the sale of advanced Nvidia AI chips, for example, induced local OEMs to turn to Huawei-designed Ascend chipsets as an alternative; an executive at a major Chinese internet company said that the performance of the Huawei chipsets “was inferior to Nvidia chips, but we can definitely use them.” Over the longer term, Chinese strengths in 5G, Internet of Things, electric vehicles, and other end-use markets will increase demand pull for Chinese chip designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human Capital:&lt;/strong&gt; In 2020, China graduated 2 million people with bachelor’s degrees in science and engineering, more than double the United States’ 900,000. While the quality of these graduates may vary, semiconductor design is unusually reliant on creative individuals, and over the long run China’s ability to educate vast numbers of students with the requisite skill sets constitutes an enormous competitive asset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2018, China launched the 2029 STEM Action Plan to promote students’ access to STEM education, and in 2019, China added STEM to its primary school curriculum. Concurrently, the Ministry of Education created IC doctoral programs at 19 universities. Significantly, a European study observed in 2023 that for the first time, at the 2023 International Solid State Circuits Conference—a highly prestigious academic semiconductor conference—a majority of the accepted papers were submitted by Chinese institutions. At the same time, the 2022 SIA/BCG study of the U.S. design sector warned that “the supply of [U.S.] design talent is dwindling” and forecast a shortfall of 23,000 designers by 2030, reflecting “the number of experienced engineers leaving the industry” and the inadequate number of U.S. STEM graduates. This situation is compounded by current restrictions on immigration limiting access to high-quality engineers eager to work in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Need for Policy Continuity and Resources at Scale&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2024, Secretary Raimondo called for CHIPS-related follow-on legislation supporting additional investments in semiconductors: “Whether you call it Chips Two or something else—continued investment [is needed] if we want to lead the world.” Gaurav Gupta, an executive at the Gartner consultancy, strongly concurs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is the first time this money has been made available. And, as a result, you’re seeing a lot of chipmakers announcing new fabs and capacity expansions . . . But this has to be a more consistent policy from the US government through the next decade and beyond if they’re really serious about bringing back more chip manufacturing here in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To realize the new Trump administration’s goal of sustaining U.S. technology leadership in semiconductors, doubling down on support, backed by substantial and sustained investments and incentives, is essential. For this effort to succeed, U.S. policymakers need to recognize the strategic importance of the chip design sector and the unprecedented challenges it faces. Chip design is the highest value additive stage of semiconductor fabrication, accounting for over 50 percent of the value of a semiconductor, more than even front-end fabrication. Design leadership represents a huge economic and strategic advantage for the U.S. economy. As such, it is by far too valuable a competitive advantage to lose, and public policy deliberations to secure the future of the U.S. semiconductor industry must be broadened accordingly to assure continued leadership in semiconductor design. The industry’s current success is no guarantee of its future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;To realize the new Trump administration’s goal of sustaining U.S. technology leadership in semiconductors, doubling down on support, backed by substantial and sustained investments and incentives, is essential. For this effort to succeed, U.S. policymakers need to recognize the strategic importance of the chip design sector and the unprecedented challenges it faces.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-policies-are-needed&quot;&gt;What Policies Are Needed?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The incoming Trump administration has recognized the strategic challenges facing the U.S. semiconductor industry. While the exact policy measures needed to ensure the continued success of U.S. chip design remain to be determined, the 2022 SIA/BCG study offered valuable suggestions for policymakers’ consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase Investment:&lt;/strong&gt; Increased public investments and tax incentives to support chip design R&amp;amp;D are needed, particularly as the doubling of precompetitive chip R&amp;amp;D from 2023 to 2027 authorized in the CHIPS Act has not been appropriated. Given Chinese government focus, subsidies, and investments in research and talent, these funds need to be made available to U.S. labs and universities. Investment resources are essential for the United States’ long-term ability to compete, a perspective China fully understands and is reflected in the scale of its R&amp;amp;D and educational investments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promote Domestic Talent:&lt;/strong&gt; As in the space race, financial incentives are needed to increase the number of students entering STEM fields and to encourage undergraduates and graduate students to enter the field of chip design.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grow the Talent Pool:&lt;/strong&gt; There should be a targeted, national security–based reform of immigration policies to enable well-trained foreign chip designers to enter and remain in the United States. Given the challenge, the United States needs policies comparable to those put in place to attract international physicists for the Manhattan nuclear program.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recognize the Calming Value of Trade:&lt;/strong&gt; U.S. chip design leadership would be aided by adopting trade and export control policies that do not accelerate the balkanization of global markets and that reduce incentives for autarkic policy approaches. Despite intensifying competition and the need for policy measures to address the challenges posed by Chinese mercantilism, the global economy remains tightly linked. Greater disruption in this sector could be costly and may well be counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expand Tax Incentives:&lt;/strong&gt; It is worth noting that an investment tax credit of 25 percent for chip design was nearly included in the CHIPS Act, a proposed measure that would be essential to include in the next round of legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These and other measures should be part of ongoing policy dialogue to identify industry needs and policies to ensure continued U.S. leadership in this strategic segment of the semiconductor industry. What the United States cannot afford in terms of its global competitiveness and national security is to take a business-as-usual approach in the face of government-backed global competition for advanced technologies. The United States is ahead in this crucial industry; it should not wait until it has fallen behind to support chip design in the face of the Chinese challenge. On the contrary, with the right policy and financial support, the United States can continue to surge ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

In a new Interim Report, its AI Policy Study Group indicated significant changes in the country’s AI strategy. Hiroki Habuka unpacks the document’s implications for Japanese AI governance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early 2024, it seemed clear among the major developed economies that significant new regulatory frameworks for artificial intelligence (AI) were imminent. In the United States, the Biden administration had passed a sweeping AI executive order in October 2023, and congressional leaders were working toward comprehensive AI legislation for 2024. Meanwhile, the European Union was preparing to pass the EU AI Act, which it ultimately did in May 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan was also a participant in this prevailing trend. Two key publications from the first half of 2024 strongly signaled that Japan was heading toward new legislation aimed to more comprehensively regulate AI technology: in February, a concept paper from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, and in May, a white paper by the Japanese Cabinet Office’s AI Strategy team. Both documents recommended the introduction of new regulations for large-scale foundational models. All signs suggested that Japan was moving in parallel with its allies toward establishing a strengthened regulatory structure for AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of 2024, however, the prospects for tough AI regulation in the United States and Europe had changed significantly. Not only did the United States never pass AI legislation, but also U.S. voters reelected President Donald Trump, who fulfilled a campaign promise to repeal the Biden administration’s AI executive order on the first day of his second term in office. The European Union, for its part, is still working to implement the AI Act, but influential documents such as the Draghi report on EU competitiveness suggest widespread concerns in the European Union that its AI regulatory efforts may have gone too far and stifled innovation. These concerns have been carried forward in the European Commission’s white paper “A Competitiveness Compass for the EU,” which emphasizes the necessity of achieving simpler, lighter, and faster regulation. At the AI Action Summit, EU President Ursula von der Leyen committed to reducing bureaucratic hurdles. Meanwhile, the French government is reportedly working to ensure that implementation of the AI Act is more focused on promoting innovation and less focused on regulating potential harms than drafters of the legislation anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan, like its U.S. and EU allies, is hitting the brakes on the race to regulate AI. On February 4, 2025, the Japanese government’s Cabinet Office released the interim report of its AI Policy Study Group (henceforth “the Interim Report,” or “the Report”), which outlined a very different vision for AI regulation than the country’s two reports from the first half of the previous year. This CSIS white paper outlines the direction of Japan’s AI regulatory approach in 2025, based on the contents of the Interim Report, while also incorporating Japan’s response to the so-called DeepSeek Shock. A summary of the Interim Report is provided in the Appendix for reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;maintaining-a-sector-specific-approach-to-ai-regulation&quot;&gt;Maintaining a Sector-Specific Approach to AI Regulation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AI Policy Study Group is an expert committee established under the Cabinet Office; it serves as the central body overseeing Japan’s AI policy development as a whole, covering both regulatory and promotional policies. In contrast to the ambitious regulatory trends observed during the first half of 2024, the Interim Report published by the AI Policy Study Group in February 2025 adopts a markedly more cautious stance. The Interim Report underscores Japan’s preference for relying on existing sector-specific laws rather than imposing sweeping AI-specific regulations, in accordance with the principle of technological neutrality. It also highlights the importance of voluntary risk-mitigation initiatives undertaken by businesses, while committing the government to the continuous monitoring of emerging risks and necessary measures. As part of this effort, the Report suggests new legislation to establish a government strategic leadership body to enable the collection of necessary information for policies and cooperation on information about major incidents, but without legal sanctions. This marked departure from earlier proposals is reflective of the complex nature of AI risks, the current limitations in assessing the safety of advanced AI models, and the broader trend of regulatory easing observed under the new Trump administration—whose repeal of the Biden-era AI executive order set a clear and early precedent. Additionally, the outcome of the October 2024 general election in Japan, in which the ruling Liberal Democratic Party lost its majority, has resulted in a fragmented Diet, making the advancement of ambitious legislative reforms a formidable challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI systems are designed to make sophisticated inferences and decisions based on large datasets and numerous parameters using statistical and probabilistic methods. In this sense, the dangers posed by AI are less about fundamentally introducing new types of risks and more about amplifying existing risks. From this perspective, the stance outlined in the Interim Report, which places greater reliance on existing legal frameworks and voluntary industry measures, appears reasonable and consistent with Japan’s established policy approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;balancing-business-led-ai-governance-and-strategic-government-leadership&quot;&gt;Balancing Business-Led AI Governance and Strategic Government Leadership&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Interim Report, it appears likely that the Japanese government will rely on businesses’ voluntary commitments to address AI risks under existing laws. However, simply delegating risk management does not mean that all businesses will immediately be able to address risks appropriately. In particular, startup companies—which are key drivers of innovation—often lack sufficient resources to dedicate to safety and governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, this white paper proposes that the government’s newly established strategic leadership body take the initiative in reducing the cost and complexity of responsibly implementing AI across society. This would be accomplished by continuously producing outputs such as clarifications of the interpretation of laws in specific areas, guidance on methods for evaluating AI safety, updates to the AI Guidelines for Business (a risk management framework), and contractual guidelines for entities across the supply chain. In fact, the Japanese government previously pursued similar approaches in 2024, proposing guidance on the interpretation of existing laws as well as directions for new legislative measures in specific areas such as copyrights, other intellectual property rights, and personal information, as well as measures to address disinformation and misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-key-to-success-transparency-and-effective-guidance&quot;&gt;The Key to Success: Transparency and Effective Guidance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the Japanese government does successfully transition to a continuous production of outputs relevant to AI, it should move away from closed, non-transparent discussions—like those of the current AI Policy Study Group—and instead adopt a transparent multi-stakeholder process that brings together knowledge from a wide range of fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, it is essential that, in principle, information requested from private businesses not be conducted for the purpose of criticizing companies; instead, it should aim to gather best practices and conduct proactive evaluations. Sensitive information should be handled cautiously, such as by limiting its disclosure to specific recipients, so as to ensure that the innovation and economic growth incentives of AI developers and providers are preserved. The information collection mechanism should be operated in a way that avoids creating a situation where businesses that cooperate are criticized based on the content they disclose, while those that refuse to cooperate face no scrutiny—a “no good deed goes unpunished” scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;japans-response-to-the-deepseek-shock&quot;&gt;Japan’s Response to the DeepSeek Shock&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it is worth touching upon Japan’s response to the DeepSeek Shock. The emergence of DeepSeek—a high-performance, small-scale, and low-cost AI model from China—garnered significant attention in Japan. Interestingly, the Interim Report was drafted and released for public comment before the DeepSeek Shock occurred in January 2025, with only the final version published in February after the event. However, in the end, the DeepSeek Shock had little impact on the content of the Interim Report; the Report had already rejected the idea of regulating only large-scale foundational models (an approach initially proposed in early 2024). Moreover, the Report emphasized that, even if future regulations were considered, risk assessments should be conducted based on actual risks rather than on model size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, concerns regarding national security risks associated with Chinese-developed AI models remain. For example, during Diet deliberations, it became a point of contention that DeepSeek described the Senkaku Islands—territory claimed by both Japan and China—as “China’s inherent territory, both historically and under international law.” In response, Prime Minister Ishiba adhered to the policy direction outlined in the Interim Report, stating that the government would accelerate preparations for legislation that authorizes the government to first issue administrative guidance and, if deemed insufficient, take stronger measures against AI risks. In addition, on February 6, 2025, the Japanese government issued an advisory to government ministries and agencies regarding the use of DeepSeek. This notice primarily highlighted that data acquired by DeepSeek is stored on servers in China and thus subject to Chinese legal jurisdiction. However, beyond this, it largely reiterated existing guidance issued in 2023 regarding the use of generative AI by government agencies, such as prohibiting the entry of sensitive information into AI prompts and requiring agencies to consult the National Center of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity and the Digital Agency in cases involving systems used for national security and public safety operations, as well as those handling highly confidential information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of now, Japan has no specific restrictions on the use of DeepSeek by private entities. In fact, the country’s private sector has largely welcomed the emergence of DeepSeek. This is due not only to its high performance, small scale, and low cost, but also its open-weight nature. Many tech companies have already begun developing and offering their own fine-tuned versions of DeepSeek’s models tailored to their specific needs. Moreover, concerns over national security biases and the absence of built-in safeguards can be substantially mitigated through additional fine-tuning conducted by these companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this does not mean that DeepSeek and its derivative models are exempt from regulation. As analyzed in detail in the table in the Interim Report (see this paper’s Appendix), existing laws already regulate the manipulation of information through disinformation and misinformation as well as the unauthorized use of acquired data. Furthermore, the new legislation hinted at in the Interim Report is designed to enable the government to collect potential legal violations and best practices for risk mitigation, ensuring that emerging AI risks are effectively addressed within Japan’s regulatory framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;looking-ahead-japans-ai-policy-in-a-shifting-landscape&quot;&gt;Looking Ahead: Japan’s AI Policy in a Shifting Landscape&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the global outlook for AI governance becomes increasingly uncertain in 2025, Japan’s role in contributing to international rulemaking through frameworks such as the G7 and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development will grow in importance. It will be a critical test for Japan to design and implement legal systems, under a constructive public-private partnership, that can manage various risks to an acceptable level while maximizing the benefits that AI brings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;appendix&quot;&gt;Appendix&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS OF THE DRAFT INTERIM REPORT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Interim Report presents a vision for the future design of AI policies in Japan by elaborating on five basic approaches and six specific policy proposals including potential new legislation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;KEY POINTS OF THE DRAFT INTERIM REPORT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;emphasis-on-voluntary-initiatives-by-businesses-and-a-softer-regulatory-tone&quot;&gt;Emphasis on Voluntary Initiatives by Businesses and a Softer Regulatory Tone&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Interim Report emphasizes that AI risks should primarily be addressed by the voluntary initiatives and creative efforts of businesses. It suggests that the establishment of new regulations targeting large-scale AI models or the adoption of comprehensive AI regulations (such as those in the European Union) is not currently being considered as a policy direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this does not mean that all responsibilities are left entirely to businesses. The Report proposes establishing a strategic leadership body within the government to enhance coordination among relevant ministries and agencies. It also recommends enacting necessary legislation for government-led information collection, aiming for the integrated implementation of AI-related policies based on best practices from businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-five-basic-approaches-to-legal-systems&quot;&gt;The Five “Basic Approaches to Legal Systems”&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Interim Report consists of two main parts: “Basic Approaches to Legal Systems” and “Direction of Specific Legal Systems and Policies.” For the former, the following principles are outlined:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Respecting Voluntary Initiatives by Businesses&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Given the conservative compliance approaches of Japanese companies, the establishment of new regulations is expected to have a significant chilling effect. Therefore, the Report emphasizes respecting voluntary initiatives by businesses and limiting regulations to areas where such voluntary efforts are insufficient to adequately address risks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Leveraging Existing Sectoral Laws in Lieu of Comprehensive AI Regulation&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;While the prevailing opinion is that Japan addresses AI risks primarily through a soft law approach, it is a misconception that Japan lacks hard laws related to AI. The Interim Report lists numerous existing laws addressing various risk areas, such as the leakage of confidential information, intellectual property rights infringement, privacy, malfunction, deepfakes, bias, information manipulation, and cyberattacks (see Table 1 below). The Report proposes addressing AI risks by evolving these existing laws within their respective sectors. Conversely, comprehensive and cross-sectoral regulations like the European Union’s AI Act are clearly not being pursued.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Minimal and Technology-Neutral Regulation&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;According to the Interim Report, even when new legislation is necessary, it should be limited to truly essential areas. The principle of “technology neutrality” should be observed to avoid imposing disproportionately high requirements solely on AI. In principle, new regulations should not be created merely because a technology is labeled as “AI” (any more than it should be regulated merely because it is “software”), as this is both legally difficult and unnecessary. Care should also be taken to avoid hindering legitimate research and to ensure that startups and other businesses can comply with regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Risk-Based and Case-Specific Approaches&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As part of general measures, the Interim Reports recommends encouraging the use of the “AI Guidelines for Business,” which should be continuously updated based on the results of government-led information collection (see section 2 below). The responsibilities of AI developers, providers, and users should be carefully considered, with a focus on promoting the sharing and coordination of necessary information among stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;For AI risks inadequately addressed by existing laws, responses should be determined on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the severity and nature of the risks. The Report highlights the importance of avoiding arbitrary enforcement or undue chilling effects when conducting fact-finding investigations necessary for policy decisions or requesting information-sharing cooperation from businesses. The Interim Report also states that regulations should not be uniformly applied based on the scale of AI models (e.g., floating-point operations per second, or FLOPS) or the number of users but should instead be tailored to actual risks (i.e., taking a risk-based approach).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Contribution to the Formation of International Norms&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Building on the Hiroshima AI Process established by G7 members at the 2023 Hiroshima Summit chaired by Japan, the Interim Report emphasizes respecting principles agreed upon in various international frameworks, such as the United Nations’ Global Digital Compact, the Council of Europe’s Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence, the OECD’s AI Principles, and the resolutions of the Global Partnership on AI.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To ensure the international alignment and interoperability of rules, the Report advocates for Japan’s active participation in international standardization efforts, such as those of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). It also highlights the importance of consolidating and sharing domestic and international knowledge through collaboration among the AI Safety Institutes established in various countries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-six-specific-directions-for-legal-systems&quot;&gt;The Six “Specific Directions for Legal Systems”&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on the basic approaches outlined above, the Interim Report presents the following specific directions for legal systems:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strengthening the Government’s Strategic Leadership Functions and Establishing a Strategic Plan (“Matters That Should Be Legislated”)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The process of AI research, development, and application involves diverse actors and complex activities that interact with one another. Therefore, the Interim Report emphasizes the necessity of a government-wide strategic leadership function to oversee and coordinate these activities. This includes wide-ranging participation from relevant ministries and agencies, along with a strategic plan outlining strategies for AI safety and utilization. To ensure the effectiveness of this strategic leadership body, its establishment and authority to request cooperation from relevant administrative agencies should be codified into law.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Promoting Transparency and Appropriateness and Introducing Information Provision Requests (“Matters Suitable for Legislative Action”)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To ensure AI safety, the Report highlights the importance of transparency and appropriateness.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Regarding transparency, the Interim Report recommends the sharing of necessary information along the AI value chain among developers, providers, and users to prevent risks from materializing. However, to avoid excessive disclosure that could compromise trade secrets or sensitive information during the research and development stage, information sharing should be limited to what is “truly necessary.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To ensure appropriateness—which likely refers to objective safety and reliability—the Report proposes that the government develop guidelines based on international standards, such as those set forth in the Hiroshima AI Process, while encouraging voluntary initiatives by businesses. The guidelines may include provisions requiring AI developers and other relevant parties to take measures to reduce inappropriate outputs, disclose and share information on the overview and risks of AI systems, and promote appropriate transparency of training datasets. Additionally, attention should be paid to international trends in misinformation and disinformation countermeasures, such as requirements to notify users when a service is AI-powered or to label AI-generated content as such.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To support these measures, the Report suggests codifying provisions that enable the government to request information from businesses to understand their situation and provide necessary support. However, such requests are not expected to immediately impose mandatory obligations on businesses; instead, they are likely to encourage voluntary cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Voluntary Evaluations for AI Systems and Certification for AI Governance&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As AI becomes increasingly integrated into products and services, it is desirable to establish agreed-upon evaluation and certification systems for both AI systems and the governance of organizations using AI.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Interim Report suggests that for AI systems, safety evaluations should primarily rely on businesses’ voluntary risk assessments. On the other hand, third-party certification is identified as an effective approach for the governance of organizations using AI. This may include obtaining certifications under standards such as ISO/IEC 42001.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Investigating Major Incidents and Information Disclosure to the Public (“Matters Suitable for Legislative Action”)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;For AI models that are widely used by the public or integrated into critical infrastructure services, the government should collect information on the actual conditions of their implementation and any ensuing risks, including risks arising from the involvement of diverse stakeholders in the supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In the event of major accidents or issues caused by AI, the government should investigate the root causes, provide guidance to stakeholders on preventive measures, and disclose relevant information to the public. To ensure cooperation from businesses in such cases, the Interim Report suggests introducing a legal framework that enables the government to request information from domestic and international businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Promoting AI Adoption by the Government and Developing Procurement Guidelines&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To promote the adoption of highly safe AI systems, the government should develop guidelines that clarify criteria and procedures for AI procurement, addressing risks such as those related to supply chains and specific risks unique to AI.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The government is also encouraged to take the lead in using AI to enhance the efficiency and quality of administrative services and operations. However, in areas where AI-based automated decisionmaking could significantly impact the rights and interests of citizens, the government should carefully recognize the associated risks and proceed with caution. Additionally, existing agreements on the handling of sensitive information should be reviewed and updated as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Addressing Risks to Life, Physical Safety, Systemic Stability, and National Security by Relevant Ministries&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In areas with significant societal impact—such as medical devices, autonomous vehicles, and critical infrastructure services—relevant ministries and agencies should address risks through existing laws and guidelines while considering revisions or new legal instruments if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;For systemic risks, such as where multiple AI systems may become interconnected in the future leading to large-scale disruptions due to unexpected behaviors, relevant ministries should continue to assess and address these challenges. Similarly, for national security risks, such as the use of AI in chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats and cyberattacks, relevant ministries and agencies should deepen their examination and responses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long-range precision strike capabilities and the ability to defend against them have an increasingly prominent place in Russian and NATO thinking about current and future warfare. This paper assesses the role of long-range strike on the modern battlefield and the relative competitive advantages of each side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper finds that the deterrent and competitive effects of long-range strike outweigh their impact in conflict. While militaries often do find ways to weather the impact of long-range strike (as well as interdiction from the air – which is separate but related), doing so is disproportionately costly. Moreover, narratives regarding the impact of strike have an independent effect on military behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Russia’s case, the country’s military thinkers have long been invested in the idea that the ability to dislocate an opponent at depth is of decisive importance on the modern battlefield. True or not, this will influence Russian decision-making in two ways: first, the speed at which forces can be dislocated in depth incentivises forward deployment and readiness, both of which run counter to scaling; and second, layered air defences against missile threats can be prohibitively costly in terms of interceptors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compounding this challenge is the fact that Russia has lost strategic depth, meaning that missiles which would previously have been understood as being effective at tactical ranges can now impact operationally and even strategically relevant targets. Russia can surmount this, but at a considerable opportunity cost in terms of layering air defences. This means that relatively anodyne strike capabilities such as short-range ballistic missiles can have a disproportionately competitive effect for NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equally, the Alliance faces its own competitive challenges. Chief among these is that both protecting critical military capabilities and providing security to a wide range of civilian targets will stretch NATO’s surface-based air defences beyond the limits of their capacity. In addition, the currently federated space-based infrastructure of Allied nations will become an economy of force target for Russia if it wishes to avoid running an arms race on unfavourable terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper discusses how the Alliance can use its own competitive advantages to shape Russian decision-making, and how it can mitigate the risk of Russia doing the same thing in return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Militaries have placed increasing emphasis on the ability to see and strike in depth since the latter stages of the Cold War, when Western concepts of operations, such as Follow-on Forces Attack, placed a heavy emphasis on the ability to engage the Soviet second echelon at operational and even theatre depths. Capabilities including guided multiple-launch rocket systems (GMLRS), Gryphon ground-launched cruise missiles and Pershing-II intermediate range ballistic missiles (IRBMs) were, in tandem with fixed-wing aircraft, intended to disrupt and attrit Soviet forces and dislocate the USSR’s command-and-control (C2) structures before contact on the Forward Line of Own Troops (FLOT). The Soviets in turn believed that the convergence of high-fidelity sensors, processing power and deep strike were driving, in the words of Marshal Ogarkov, a “military technical revolution”, in which forces would be able to find, fix and engage each other at increasing speeds and distances. This drove the development of capabilities such as the OTR-23 Oka (a predecessor of the Russian Iskander short-range ballistic missile, SRBM).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In parallel, the threat posed by deep-strike capabilities reinforced an existing institutional emphasis on both ground-based air defences and methods of disrupting adversary kill chains in both the USSR and post-Soviet Russia. By contrast – and despite initial similarities with Soviet/Russian approaches – much Western thinking about the idea of a revolution in military affairs for the two decades immediately after the Cold War placed considerable emphasis on the ability to use presumed access to both ISR and precision strike (albeit in the form of airpower, rather than long-range missiles) as a scalpel with which to engage elusive targets in politically complex terrain. On the other side of the coin, layered air and missile defence capabilities were assumed to be a requirement for achieving a high probability of kill against a well-defined and numerically limited number of threats, so as to offset the risk of chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear use by opponents with weaker conventional weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dynamic has changed considerably in Europe, where a number of militaries have returned to emphasising the importance of achieving deep interdiction. The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has reinforced this, prompting significant investments in both air-to-surface and surface-to-surface strike capabilities, as well as integrated air and missile defence (IAMD) capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of this, there are grounds for an examination of the way in which the ability to prosecute both the offensive and defensive components of a modern strike campaign can reinforce deterrence and competitive advantage in Europe. The question bears examining as both air defence and strike – despite their utility – require complex enablement and exquisite systems, and incur opportunity costs with respect to the ability to invest in other capabilities. In particular, some observers have questioned the military advantage of being able to see and strike deep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-areas&quot;&gt;Key Areas&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this paper is to examine three key areas of enquiry. First, it provides an examination of the utility of deep-strike capabilities in the context of the operating environment in Europe. Second, it provides a net assessment of Allied and Russian strengths with respect to their ability to both prosecute strike campaigns and defend against them. Finally, the paper provides a set of principles which might be used to guide Allied procurement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major hypothesis of the paper is that the capacity for deep interdiction is of strategic significance but, paradoxically, is unlikely to be militarily decisive. Its significance pertains to both its deterrent value and its value as a competitive tool that forces an opponent to take on costly countermeasures. As a consequence, procurement of both strike and IAMD capabilities should be guided by a logic of relative cost imposition – the degree to which one’s own force and Russia’s are compelled to accept opportunity costs to mitigate the risks that deep-strike capabilities create – rather than by a purely military logic that examines the offensive or defensive utility of a given tool in conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper intends to contribute to the development of a conceptual foundation through which the roles of deep strike and IAMD as tools of deterrence, competition and warfare can be understood. The paper focuses on the balance of forces between NATO members on one side (with a particular focus on the Alliance’s European members) and Russia on the other. The authors’ deductions emphasise the competitive approach, which should guide Allied efforts at generating deep-strike and IAMD capabilities, but the programmatic questions of how capability should be delivered are beyond the paper’s remit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The methodology of this paper includes desk research, operations analysis and a review of 15 years of Russian military journals such as Военная Мысль (Military Thought), Вооружение и экономика (Armaments and Economy) and Современная авиация (Modern Aviation.) The purpose of this review was to identify patterns in Russian thinking about the risks posed by Allied strike capabilities and the counterinvestments Russia should make. The research also used a support tool developed by a partner organisation, DIEM Analytics, which uses deep neural networks to forecast an actor’s behaviour, based on both formative experiences and past behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the outputs of the paper are not definitive with respect to procurement choices, they seek to shed light on the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What are Russian leaders likely to see as the opportunities and challenges they face in the contemporary deep battle?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What are the strengths and limitations of any effort to achieve deep effects?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where do these efforts add value and when do they present an opportunity cost?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which principles should guide NATO efforts to offset the Russian threat beyond the FLOT?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-the-utility-of-striking-at-depth&quot;&gt;I. The Utility of Striking at Depth&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would appear that the ability to strike in depth is useful, but rarely decisive. The historical record of efforts to do so, whether through airpower or surface-to-surface capabilities, is mixed at best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;deep-strike-for-battlefield-interdiction&quot;&gt;Deep Strike for Battlefield Interdiction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Battlefield interdiction (historically provided by airpower) played an important role in the Vietnam War (during Operation Linebacker I) and the 1991 Gulf War, but the most important effects air assets provided were in the close battle. Longer-range US airpower failed to close the Ho Chi Minh trail, and theLinebacker II raids did not stop the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) from moving into position. In the absence of US close air support in subsequent battles, the NVA would have overwhelmed the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. Although air strikes on railheads caused initial backlogs, the NVA was able to rely on forward-positioned stockpiles and then pivot to a truck-based system (which was capable of moving 10,000 tons of goods by road) to resource attacks such as its assaults on Qang Tri and An Loc, with the latter assault supported by 78,000 artillery rounds. By contrast, close air support against NVA forces in combat did prove critical, inflicting the majority of casualties incurred by the NVA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, during the 1991 Gulf War, US strategic interdiction as part of Operation Instant Thunder did not have the desired effect of paralysing the Iraqi C2 system to the point that it could not coordinate troop movements. Subsequent interdiction operations inflicted considerable losses on units redeployed from depth (largely from the Iraqi Republican Guard), but none of these units was degraded to the point of non-functionality. Supply-line disruptions caused by air strikes on 126 highway and rail bridges were generally circumvented much more rapidly than might have been expected, through the use of ferries, pontoons and dredging. Similarly, attacks on truck convoys were accommodated through the use of smaller convoys. However, this is not to say that the ability to strike in depth had no impact on Iraqi supplies. Although well supplied, the Iraqi military lost much of its capacity to redistribute supplies in a rational manner, leading to uneven distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, in the war in Ukraine, the impact of long-range strikes (albeit at tactical ranges) to achieve supply-line interdiction has been more positive, although still mixed. Both Russia and Ukraine have employed strike platforms capable of engaging targets at up to corps depth, including the HIMARS rocket system in the case of Ukraine, and the Russian Tornado-S. The HIMARS’s initial effect on the Ukrainian battlefields was dramatic, with the ability to strike the munitions storage sites and C2 structures of an artillery-centric Russian army playing a major role in the culmination of the Russian offensive in the Donbas, which began in July 2022. However, the Russian army adapted to the threat of the extended-range GMLRS in a number of ways, including moving ammunition storage further to the rear of its lines and adapting its approach to electronic warfare to account for the threat posed. In theatres such as Kherson, reliance on the Antonivka bridge – which was rendered unusable – forced the Russian military to supply forces through a costly and time-intensive effort involving ferries and barges, which compelled its withdrawal from the city. However, the impact on Russian logistics, while significant, was not critical. Russian rates of fire across the frontline steadily rose after the initial shock of exposure to precision fire and, at the time of writing, amounted to approximately 10,000 shells a day. Interdiction of supplies in depth has imposed high levels of friction on the Russian army, but it has not prevented it from delivering large volumes of personnel and materiel to the frontline. The results, while important, fall short of operational paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;targeting-command-and-control-and-communications&quot;&gt;Targeting Command and Control and Communications&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second approach to the use of deep-strike capabilities is as a means of targeting C2 nodes and undermining an opponent’s broader capacity to communicate. Here, the ability to strike at depth appears to have achieved some effects (although the sample size is smaller, since the ability to reliably target C2 nodes is largely a product of the era of precision strike).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Gulf War, a key objective of Operation Instant Thunder was to separate Iraq’s political leaders from frontline units and Iraqi society more broadly. Despite the significant levels of disruption achieved, neither the Iraqi political system nor its military were paralysed. The Iraqi military was, however, compelled to emplace a network of field cables to enable a degree of communication (but not coordination) and to limit communication between units more generally. This does not seem to have affected the Iraqi army’s ability to deploy or coordinate its forces at the operational level, but it does appear to have slowed the tactical responsiveness of Iraqi forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Ukraine, the effectiveness of missiles such as Storm Shadow in tactical terms seems to have been high, at least based on what can be gathered through open source literature. However, the desired operational-level effects have been less clearly visible. It is apparent, for example, that the ability to target Russian command posts beyond 90 km did not decisively alter the course of the Ukrainian counter-offensive – which might be attributed to the fact that the sequencing of strikes and offensive activity was not tightly coordinated. One reason for this may be that a considerable amount of shaping activity goes into individual strikes, and that cruise missile attacks are often preceded by days of attacks with lower-cost UAVs to saturate and dislocate surface-to-air-missile (SAM) systems. The heavier the burden of enablement, the harder it becomes to sequence effects, given that this adds a layer of complexity to planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a NATO context, staff at an Allied air component command will have their duties divided between missions such as offensive counter-air, suppression of enemy air defences (SEAD), defensive counter-air, close air support, and interdiction (with the allocated proportions varying over time). Currently, tasks such as intermediate target development are highly time consuming (as reflected in the 72 hours it takes to generate an air-tasking order), and this challenge will need to be overcome if dynamic strikes at a high tempo are to be delivered at operational depth. In ground formations that control strike assets such as Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS), the challenge of target development might in some ways be simplified by a unit’s narrower geographical focus and the fact that it is synchronising fewer capabilities, but it will also have fewer personnel available to plan strikes, and more limited access to ISR from higher echelons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russian-deep-strike&quot;&gt;Russian Deep Strike&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s own deep strike campaign has a similarly mixed record. The Russian military’s long-range strike campaign in Ukraine has employed a range of weapons, including ballistic missiles (the KH-47M2 Kinzhal and the 9M723), cruise missiles (such as the 3M-14, the KH-101 and the KH-22) and cheaper one-way attack UAVs. In the initial phases of the war, the Russian aim appears to have been paralysis of the Ukrainian system and in particular its C2 structures – an approach that delivered limited results, and ultimately gave way to a process that placed much heavier emphasis on targeting critical national infrastructure (CNI) and Ukraine’s energy grid in particular. Russia’s own relatively slow planning process, in which targets selected by the military district-level command had to be fed into Akatsia-M (Russia’s battle management system) at the national defence management centre to create the equivalent of a Joint Priority Integrated Targeting List (JPITL) over the course of 48 hours, is likely to be the reason for its failure to strike dynamic targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has tactically employed capabilities such as the Iskander and the Tochka-U ballistic missiles. In many instances, these systems have been used in the Donbas against targets such as SA-11 TELs (transport erector launchers) and GMLRS, among other systems, using feeds from UAVs coordinated via Strelets. However, in late 2022 the balance of Russia’s efforts shifted heavily in favour of striking fixed targets. The Russian strike campaign against Ukrainian energy infrastructure has been a qualified failure. At no point has the Ukrainian energy grid suffered systemic failure (despite coming very close at several points), and strategic bombing has not proven destructive to national morale. Nonetheless, the campaign has had the effect of forcing the allocation of Ukrainian SAM systems to the defence of CNI – limiting the cover for frontline units against the Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS) over time. Moreover, the Ukrainian network of SAM systems, despite being Europe’s most robust before the war and having been augmented with Western systems, has seen increasing shortfalls in interceptor capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus far, then, there is only limited evidence that the ability to strike at operational and strategic depth can have a transformative effect, despite its utility as a means of enabling other assets (for example by forcing the allocation of ground-based air defences away from the frontline).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;precision-strike-as-a-competitive-tool&quot;&gt;Precision Strike as a Competitive Tool&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the limitations described above, the capacity for deep interdiction has a strategic significance that extends beyond its battlefield utility. This mismatch between strategic significance and battlefield utility is understood with respect to other capabilities (most obviously nuclear weapons), but is often omitted from discussions of conventional deep strike. There are a number of reasons for reframing how precision strike is viewed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, there is a widespread perception (including in Russia) that improvements in pervasive ISR, processing power and availability of strike capabilities may be on the cusp of making deep strike decisive, even if it has not been thus far. Whether this is true or not, Russia is likely to make strategic decisions based on this assumption. Second, while militaries can offset the impact of strike, this often involves both financial and operational costs that are disproportionately burdensome. Finally, building a military to offset the effects of strike narrows the force design options available to an actor. For example, the Soviet Union and then Russia responded to the risk of deep interdiction by emphasising forward positioning, readiness and layered organic air defences. For post-Soviet Russia, this necessitated, however, a smaller force that could be made highly ready and thus enabled. For Russia, as it contemplates increasing the size of its military under the plan of former minister of defence Sergei Shoigu, the requirement to counter deep strike would necessitate considerable force design trade-offs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, as noted, the past military performance of efforts at deep interdiction may not be predictive of the future. In discussing the course of the conflict in Ukraine, Russian authors have assessed that the interval between Western satellites passing over Russian positions is around 15 minutes. While US efforts to deliver space support during the conflicts of the early 21st century were deemed to have been supported by too few satellites to enable a major strike campaign, many Russian authors have assessed that the growth of the commercial space sector has fundamentally changed this dynamic. Moreover, the challenge of false positives is described by A S Scherbakov and N C B Nikulin as transient, and will probably be resolved if a combination of multispectral imaging and databasing of target signatures are used over time. The resolution of commercial multispectral satellites such as DigitalGlobe’s Worldview-3 sensor means they can generate images with a 1.2-metre resolution (each pixel represents a 1 metre by 1 metre square on the ground, which is what some Russian authors estimate to be the resolution at which targets such as armoured personnel carriers can be reliably classified). Moreover, the existing commercial systems of companies such as Maxar can generate sufficiently reliable information for points of interest to be identified. Combined with a range of automated tools for classification, many of which already exist under the aegis of Project Maven, the scope and diversity of space-based ISR may bring to fruition the kind of reconnaissance strike complex that was envisioned in the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, a range of other tools with adequate processing power can be more fruitfully used. For example, in 2011 the UAVs employed by the US military generated 327,000 hours of footage, most of which has not been used; tools to sift relevant data from noise in peacetime could significantly abet tasks such as advanced target development and pattern-of-life analysis. Similarly, aspects of planning, such as the generation of a JPITL within a Combined Air Operations Centre, can be accelerated through automated network analysis to identify key nodes in an opposing system. Greater processing power, meanwhile, can accelerate and augment targeting processes in ways that enable forces to exploit the growth of available data. To use a practical example, the US XVIII Airborne Corps estimates that processing times can be reduced to around two minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another reason why the competitive utility of deep strike may increase is that the existence of relatively scalable second-tier precision strike capabilities offers the promise of increasing the tempo at which a modern strike campaign can be prosecuted. There is an inverse relationship between the cost of being wrong and the willingness to rely on partial data or probabilistic inferences. For example, the major limiting factor on the tempo of Ukrainian strike operations has been the requirement to use a limited number of long-range strike capabilities judiciously. The emergence of systems such as one-way attack UAVs and reductions in the cost of some components (such as microelectronics) can change this dynamic. This is not because new systems are necessarily cheap – the IAI Harop loitering munition, for example, costs almost as much as a cruise missile, and while the Iranian Shahed-136 costs significantly less, this comes at a price in terms of functionality (lacking a seeker, for example). Rather, the absence of key long lead-time items, such as turbofan engines, makes it easier to increase the scale of a given capability. The more available a system is, the less elaborate the process of target development enabling its employment needs to be. The scale and tempo of a strike campaign can thus be increased, as seen in the case of the employment of UAVs in the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irrespective of whether their battlefield utility dramatically increases, deep strike capabilities have several important competitive functions with respect to shaping how an opponent prepares to fight. Athough the ability to see and strike at strategic depth rarely wins wars on its own, it can play an important role in dislocating an opponent’s capabilities. The existence of systems capable of striking at either tactical or strategic depth imposes opportunity costs in terms of the practical allocation of air defences. During the Gulf War, roughly half of all Iraqi SAM systems, including longer-ranged SA-6 and SA-8 SAMs, were committed to the defence of rear areas. In the case of the 1972 Easter Offensive, NVA forces were well supported, but it is nonetheless notable that the North Vietnamese integrated air defence system (IADS) expended more missiles over Hanoi during the Christmas bombings than they did on the frontline over the course of the Easter Offensive (and expended 68 SAMs for every bomber struck, which eventually led to the depletion of their SA-2 stocks ahead of the Paris Peace Accords).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Ukraine, the requirement to defend cities and CNI against Russian cruise missiles, one-way attack UAVs and ballistic missiles has resulted in challenges for the Ukrainians with respect to providing ground-based air defence (GBAD) to the frontline – in turn allowing the VKS to operate more freely against Ukrainian forces. The effect in terms of resource allocation is likely to be accentuated for Russia, because Russian military literature demonstrates a systematic fear of strategic paralysis inflicted by strikes on C2 nodes. Indeed, although the effects of Operation Instant Thunder were marginal in the context of Operation Desert Storm, their impact on Russian decision-makers was considerable. Examples of this include the emphasis placed by figures such as Russia’s Chief of General Staff General Valery Gerasimov (among several others) on the impact of non-contact warfare in conjunction with information operations as a means of dislocating a state’s control. While the poor record of this theory of victory in Ukraine might drive a reassessment, articles published in military journals since the invasion appear to double down on this logic. This reflects the fact that organisations often learn first-order lessons about implementation more readily than they reassess fundamental assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a subjective element to any evaluation of the utility of long-range precision fires and other deep strike capabilities. As with any military tool, the way in which an opponent views and responds to it is of considerable importance when evaluating its competitive utility. For example, while the military utility of the US Strategic Defence Initiative was questionable, its subjective impact on Soviet policymakers’ assessments of the military balance was considerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russian-perspectives-on-long-range-strike&quot;&gt;Russian Perspectives on Long-Range Strike&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Russian thinking, long-range strike serves several functions. First, long-range precision strike is viewed as an important enabler of a state’s ability to prosecute an extended conflict by targeting the defence industrial capacity of a rival state or coalition. Efforts to target infrastructure critical to the successful prosecution of a protracted conflict, including (but not limited to) key components of a state’s energy grid and defence industrial facilities, are deemed to be an integral part of both Russian military planning and Russian assumptions regarding how an Allied strike campaign might progress. The template for this is the Allied air campaign against Serbia during the Kosovo war, which is assessed by a number of Russian authors as having inflicted crippling damage on the Serbian energy grid. The ability to both inflict damage and deflect efforts to eliminate Russia’s own productive capacity is viewed as central to the ability to demonstrate the capacity to win a protracted war and thus force war termination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, long-range precision strike has a crucial role in the Russian concept of deflecting strategic aerospace attacks. Russian military authors describe combined (and primarily US-led) aerospace attacks involving the convergence of cruise missiles, hypersonic weapons, UAVs and fixed-wing aircraft aimed primarily at knocking out targets such as airbases and C2 nodes. Russia assesses its own air and missile defences as insufficient to deflect this presumed integrated aerospace threat, which in turn necessitates the ability to strike adversary airbases and conduct (rather vaguely defined) “counter submarine-launched cruise missile” operations on the open oceans. The “air-space” theatre is described as a critical and integrated independent theatre of operations in which strike and air defence must be coordinated. It is also of some note that all US investment in prompt global strike capabilities is interpreted as being, at a minimum, a challenge against which Russia must hedge, and that Allied precision strike capabilities are viewed as an extension of US assets. As such, the regional allocation of US capabilities to a given combatant command (for example, US Indo-Pacific Command) may play a limited role in how Russia assesses the balance of forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia effectively faces two challenges, which draw on the same resource base. At operational-strategic depth, the perceived risk of paralysis will, as discussed, weigh heavily on the minds of Russian decision-makers. Equally, however, Russian military assessments of the threat posed by airpower at tactical depth correctly assume that Allied advantages in the air pose considerable risk to Russian ground forces. It has previously been assumed that assault by 50–70 tactical aircraft will inflict 50% attrition on an advancing Russian motor rifle brigade. Defence against both types of attack – which requires many of the same defensive SAM and EW systems – has depended on strategic buffer zones provided by client (or at a minimum neutral) states on legal instruments such as the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, and on the assumption that Russia would commit its forces on a pre-emptive basis. As things stand, two out of Russia’s three lines of defence have effectively disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It follows that Russia will expend outsized resources on long-range strike and IAMD as it reconstitutes its military – a pattern of investment that characterised Russia’s last state armament programme. President Vladimir Putin’s 2023 claim that Russia is producing three times as many SAM systems as the US, even if spurious, illustrates the extent to which Russia views this as a priority area for investment. And even with this claimed rate, it is notable that massing air defence systems on the 1,200-km frontline in Ukraine has required other frontiers to be effectively stripped bare of SAM systems. Assuming that a comparable or greater production rate is viewed as being at least an aspiration, and as a prerequisite for deploying forces effectively, maintaining this rate of production will necessarily compete with other avenues for expenditure, including the recruitment and training of additional forces, while air defence systems will draw on inputs such as solid fuel propellant and microprocessors that are employed in other systems. This would, in turn, incentivise something along the lines of the Serdyukov-era force structure – a smaller Russian military that can be made ready more quickly and be protected. Confronting such a force structure would prove easier for the Allied force design envisioned under NATO’s force model, which is being built to emphasise readiness, but which would struggle to sustain attritional combat against an echeloned Russian force comparable to the one envisioned under the plans laid out by Shoigu, which included 14 additional divisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results from the DIEM Analytics model show a slightly different pattern. There is no obvious relationship between Russian defence investments and the degree to which long-range strike is discussed in Russian military literature. Investments in long-range strike (in terms of ground forces that can operate in the close battle) appear to correspond with periods in which Russia has engaged in low-intensity fighting. This could reflect two possibilities. First, long-range strike is viewed as a means of cost saving, much in the way that nuclear weapons sometimes were during the Soviet era (for example, during the Khrushchev era, when the need for nuclear weapons was used as a basis for reducing conventional forces). Whenever a greater desire to focus on small-scale operations at reach has characterised Soviet and Russian thinking, this has typically led to attempts to deter through an economy of force effort in the European theatre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second possibility is that Russia views adversary long-range strike as part of a single problem set alongside low-intensity “local wars” on its periphery. This latter view is best captured in an article co-authored by V Selivanov, a senior academic at the Russian Academy of Rocket and Artillery Sciences, which postulates that the threat of long-range strike represents a means of paralysing Russia’s response to local conflicts on its periphery with states aligned with or allied to the US, and of setting the conditions for Russia’s own allies worldwide to be supplanted. In this context, the balance of long-range strike capabilities is the basis for strategic freedom of action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;potential-shifts-in-russian-thinking-about-precision-strike-and-force-design&quot;&gt;Potential Shifts in Russian Thinking about Precision Strike and Force Design&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the large-scale conflict in Ukraine, Russia might re-envision its approach to force design, emphasising a more traditional mass-based force model, comparable to the one outlined by Shoigu – and this is what the DIEM Analytics model suggests. This in turn would imply a greater emphasis on the close fight, an assumption that the capacity to win a protracted conflict (rather than triumph in short, sharp wars) is critical, and a relative de-emphasising of the importance of deep strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this depends on the lessons Russia learns from the Ukraine conflict and on its view of how Allied forces are modernising. At the time of writing, Russian publications produced since the conflict in Ukraine began still place considerable emphasis on non-contact warfare, and it is not clear that the Russian military views the Ukrainian conflict as a template for the type of force design needed to confront NATO (as opposed to a large but local conflict where NATO’s major contribution to Ukraine has been the provision of standoff capabilities and ISR). A continuation of pre-existing assumptions would not be surprising, since institutionalised views are resistant to change, except in periods of acute crisis&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Russia can be induced to re-emphasise fighting the deep battle at the expense of other capabilities, this is not without its own challenges for NATO, which currently faces considerable shortfalls in IAMD capabilities, particularly if American systems (which will likely be in considerable demand in the Pacific) are unavailable in large numbers. Russia has a competitive strategy of its own here. The threat of a Russian SODCIT (strategic operation to destroy critically important targets) could drive Allied investments in air and missile defence for both civilian and military targets, which could easily prove unaffordable. This would, moreover, impose the same opportunity costs as those Russia could be forced to face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In effect, then, the successful side will be the one that invests in deep strike and IAMD in ways that minimise its opportunity costs and maximise those of the opponent, rather than the side which generates enough capacity to “win” in strictly military terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-a-net-assessment-of-allied-and-russian-weaknesses-in-a-strike-campaign&quot;&gt;II. A Net Assessment of Allied and Russian Weaknesses in a Strike Campaign&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are fundamental asymmetries between the challenges that NATO members and the Russian military will face when they consider the defence of their operational rear areas and their defence at strategic depth. It should be noted that, conceptually, this distinction is somewhat less clear for NATO than it is for Russia: for frontline states on the Alliance’s eastern flank, the two categories overlap almost entirely. However, a subdivision of threats into range categories and an effort to keep critical capabilities beyond the reach of more numerous short-ranged threats, where possible, will probably characterise Alliance planning as well. In light of this, this paper uses this range-based terminology, despite the fact that it does not overlap entirely with the doctrinal lexicon of the Alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For NATO, capacity in areas such as GBAD (and interceptor stockpiles more broadly) represents a challenge. Moreover, the structure of NATO’s IAMD architecture, in which Allies allocate national resources to an Alliance-level C2 structure, is an additional limiting factor. This having been said, the expenditure of air defence interceptors in the context of Ukraine is an imperfect proxy for the Alliance’s requirements, insofar as the temporal window within which an IAMD capability must be at its most effective is determined by the duration of an Allied SEAD campaign (rather than being an open-ended commitment). Once Russian air defences had been suppressed, the launch platforms for missiles would become significantly more vulnerable. As such, from a purely military standpoint, the Alliance should not face an open-ended air defence commitment in the way Ukraine has – it needs to defend critical targets such as airbases for long enough to ensure that a SEAD campaign succeeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as discussed below, the interceptor expenditure in this more limited context will be considerable, and Russia’s chosen approach can complicate this challenge. It is likely that Russia intends to combine early attacks to suppress Allied airpower with a SODCIT aimed at NATO infrastructure. The demands of defending both civilian and military infrastructure could quickly become unsustainable, and could draw surface-based systems from more militarily critical missions. Ensuring that this occurs would be Russia’s best competitive strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, NATO members can, collectively, field considerably more air assets than the VKS, and the platforms fielded are generally technically superior to their Russian counterparts. Indeed, it is this asymmetry that has driven the Russian focus on ground-based SAM systems, which, while not unsophisticated, are considerably less complex than aircraft, and which in a defensive role provide much less coverage. For example, at the time of writing, to maintain persistent MIG-31BM orbits in Ukraine without adequate tanker support, the VKS has had to mount 96 sorties a day – effectively employing a significant portion of Russia’s MIG-31BM fleet in a comparatively small theatre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mobility of air-based systems allows them to close off larger channels with smaller numbers of systems in aggregate compared with GBAD capabilities, and can enable intercepts with comparatively short-ranged interceptors. However, three factors will affect the Alliance. The first will be the degree to which airpower can be deployed in a contested and denied environment. For NATO as a collective, for example, the FLOT and areas at least up to corps depth (90 km) will (in the initial stages of a conflict) be locations where all but fifth-generation aircraft will operate at risk, creating a greater demand for ground-based systems in these areas. Second, the ability of aircraft to operate from airbases close to the Alliance’s eastern flank will to some extent be contested by Russian long-range precision fires. For example, Iskander SRBMs operating from Kaliningrad and Belarus can cover much of Poland. Beyond this point, airbases remain vulnerable to suppression, although this would require Russia to place high-value platforms such as bombers and guided-missile submarines at risk, since firing cruise missiles (Russia’s primary option for suppressing airbases at theatre depth) at their maximum ranges restricts their manoeuvrability and provides defenders with ample warning time. Consider, for example, Russia’s failure to suppress the Ukrainian air force’s 7th Air Brigade, which operates Storm Shadow missiles, despite multiple strikes on its western airbase of Starokostyantyniv. The distances Russian cruise missiles need to traverse to reach western Ukraine mean that their targets are typically able to disperse ahead of the strike’s arrival. There are, however, supporting capabilities that are harder to move, such as autonomic logistics information system terminals and mission programming computers, so the threat to air assets remains. Moreover, a Russian IRBM capability, such as the RS-26 Rubezh, will substantially increase the challenge of airbase defence at depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, since aircraft are inherently multirole systems, they will be drawn between multiple tasks, with defensive counter air (DCA), as a matter of convention, being allocated 35–40% of available airpower in the first five days of a conflict. Any growth in this requirement, or the allocation of this proportion of Allied airpower for longer periods, will have considerable knock-on effects on planning for other tasks such as offensive counter air (OCA) and SEAD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second facet of defensive operations which must be considered is that layering can only be achieved over limited areas. While the mobility of airpower can allow for zonal defence of wide areas, it is likely that the ground-based systems needed for ballistic missile defence (BMD) will need to be prioritised. This will probably result in politically difficult trade-offs between defending critical military facilities (against which it is likely that ballistic missiles will be used) and civilian infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;optimising-capability-laydown&quot;&gt;Optimising Capability Laydown&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To examine the question of what the most efficient capability laydown for NATO’s Area of Responsibility (AOR) might look like (with efficiency defined as limiting interceptor expenditure to the greatest extent possible), the authors ran a 1,000-run Monte Carlo simulation to examine the various force laydowns that could be achieved in the Allied AOR. The assumptions underpinning the model were that the coverage of aircraft roughly corresponds to that achieved in the context of the April 2024 Iranian attack on Israel, and that the single shot probability of kill (SSPK) of individual interceptors across category types was 0.8 (based on the test standard demanded of US and Allied systems). It is also assumed that three intercept attempts per object are required in the final defensive layer (assuming a ripple firing shot doctrine) and that one intercept can be attempted in the first layer for both BMD and intercepts of air-breathing threats. The function for assessing the number of interceptors allocated to each layer isx + dqx, where d is the number of intercepts required in the second layer and x the number in the first. It is presumed that the coverage of the first (airborne) layer of air defence considerably exceeds the second (by a factor of 5:1). The availability of aircraft is presumed to vary by up to 50% (to account for both readiness and the effects of suppression) and their ability to patrol 100 km from the FLOT is presumed to not exist, since all but fifth-generation aircraft are likely to be unable to do so freely in the early days of a conflict. The composition of the Russian missile threat is based on the first two months of the conflict in Ukraine, as well as on the two most intensive periods of bombardment in 2023–24. BMD interceptors are subdivided into longer-ranged interceptors, such as Aster-301NT, and dual-use hit-to-kill interceptors, such as PAC-3. Running a simulation based on these (admittedly very simplified) assumptions yielded the results shown in Table 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/V6r0naV.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Ratio of Different Interceptor Types Used&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advantages that NATO enjoys in the air mitigate (but do not eliminate) the requirement for a large number of surface-based BMD-capable interceptors, and the number of squadrons committed to DCA in this context represents a considerable portion of Allied airpower (although the proportion of airpower this represents becomes far smaller if the readiness of Allied aircraft increases). Notably, despite the fact that air intercept accounts for a considerable portion of the overall interceptions achieved, a comparable number of GBAD interceptors and a proportionately larger number of BMD interceptors are still required. This could reflect the fact that IAMD closer to the FLOT has to be provided by surface-based systems, and that the variable availability of aircraft must be accounted for. Moreover, all BMD is presumed to be surface-based. It is also of note that the shoot-look-shoot approach to surface-based BMD presumes long-range radar comparable to the AN/TPY-2 or the Green Pine, which can track quasi-ballistic threats but which do not exist in large numbers within the Alliance. Where such radar do exist (for example, as part of the NATO BMD system), they are not integrated with the IAMD mission, for policy reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, if a higher availability of aircraft is presumed, the results are effectively inverted, and considerably fewer squadrons are allocated to DCA, as illustrated in Table 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/axWDdHG.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 2: Ratio of Different Interceptor Types Used Assuming Higher Aircraft Availability&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has several implications. First, it might reasonably be presumed that NATO airpower considerably mitigates the effect of lower availability of surface-based defensive systems. This presumes, however, that sufficient early warning and point defences are available to ensure a higher number of available of airframes, particularly in the context of a significant ballistic missile threat. Second, the Monte Carlo runs assume a rate of interception that can only be achieved if aircraft are equipped with up-to-date radar (such as the AESA radar, which is due to be fitted to the UK’s Typhoon fleet) and enabled by AWACS or long-range early warning radar. Third, AWACS themselves will face unacceptable risks until the IADS in Kaliningrad is suppressed, since systems such as the S-400 can operate at their maximum ranges against high-flying targets. This in turn would imply that the requirement for surface-based systems closer to the frontline will be considerable; any nationally driven reallocation of these assets to defend civilian targets could prove dangerous. Equally, national or multinational efforts to deliver defences against the Russian missile threat to both civilian and military targets across the theatre could quickly prove prohibitively costly (given the costs of defending critical military targets) and would impose opportunity costs elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key deduction from the results might be that the adequate enablement of airborne DCA capabilities represents the fastest and cheapest way for NATO to mitigate the air threat (as presently constituted) beyond distances of 500 km, while surface-based capabilities should be prioritised for the defence of forces (rather than of CNI) in the early stages of a conflict, given that the areas in which deployed forces operate will see the greatest demand for surface-based air and missile defences (in view of the difficulty of flying many air assets in these areas), and the unaffordability of generating layered defences for both the frontline and rear areas. Several pathways to achieving this suggest themselves, including role specialisation among states that do not operate large numbers of fifth-generation aircraft (and which will therefore not operate within an IADS early in a conflict).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Alliance can considerably reduce the strain on interceptor stockpiles by both ensuring aircraft readiness and allocating limited GBAD capabilities to force protection. This does not reduce the strain of surface-based ballistic missile defence, which is invariant, but Russia is likely to have limited numbers of ballistic missiles (which represent no more than 13% of Russian missiles used in Ukraine), and most Russian ballistic missiles will have tactical ranges for the short to medium term. It does, however, presume the availability of AWACS support and of suitable aircraft that can distinguish between elusive targets in clutter. The latter represents a capability gap in many Allied air forces, including the RAF, which is yet to upgrade the radar on its fourth-generation Typhoon aircraft to AESA radar. Equally, an increase in either the volume or range of the Russian ballistic threat can considerably increase the strain on both first-layer surface-based BMD systems (which, outside the maritime domain, are entirely American) and dual-capable systems such as PAC-3. Moreover, the number of interceptors expended for BMD missions increases eightfold in the absence of longer-range surface-based radar such as the AN/TPY-2. Notably, Allied BMD radar, such as the SPY-1 systems in Poland and Romania, can already play this role, but do not do so (for policy rather than technical reasons).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difficulties faced employing AWACS in locations such as Poland can potentially be offset through the employment of other elevated sensors, which can serve as a stand-in until the suppression of Kaliningrad. An example might be the use of elevated sensors on aerostats, which was pursued under the JLENS programme (a tethered aerial detection system, with demonstrated effectiveness – its major challenge was the tethers, not sensor fidelity). As such, the outcome of an effort to suppress Kaliningrad will also have considerable effects for the deep battle, and not just for operations in a theatre such as the Baltic states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should also be noted that, past the early stages of a conflict, Russia will face its own challenges, since many of the launch platforms on which its deep-strike capabilities depend are either non-survivable (such as surface vessels) or relatively limited in number. Russia’s bomber fleet, for example, would operate at some risk on NATO’s northern flank once a maritime component command was set up. This might be less of a challenge when striking civilian infrastructure (which can be engaged at the limits of a missile’s range from within Russian airspace), but against time-sensitive or defended targets, cruise missiles need to be fired at ranges which leave spare fuel capacity for the missile to manoeuvre, while ballistic missiles need to be fired on energy-efficient trajectories – all of which requires bomber personnel to place themselves at risk. Russia can, of course, mitigate this risk through a greater reliance on ground launchers, although this introduces its own challenges: soft-skinned TELs need to be distributed from their operating bases early to avoid suppression, which can rob a force of early operational surprise and complicate communication and the coordination of salvos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO members thus face relative challenges in terms of capacity, but these can be mitigated through an effort to better leverage airborne sensors and effectors and by a level of prioritisation that eschews efforts to deliver unachievable levels of magazine depth. In the early stages of a campaign, NATO’s primary risks will emerge from the potential suppression of airbases – suggesting a rationalisation of GBAD capabilities is necessary to prioritise this function. Over time, the risk to a broader target set will grow, but if the IADS in Kaliningrad is suppressed, airborne sensors that allow the risk to be more readily mitigated can be employed. The need for elevated sensors that can be employed during the period in which AWACS cannot be easily used will require individual Allies to invest more heavily in alternative elevated sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russias-geography-and-the-growing-cost-of-integrated-air-and-missile-defence&quot;&gt;Russia’s Geography and the Growing Cost of Integrated Air and Missile Defence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the offensive side of the ledger, several asymmetries will pose conundrums for Russia in addition to ISR advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first challenge that Russia will face is that the changing territorial extent of the Alliance makes the distinction between “tactical-operational” and “operational-strategic” missiles, which the Russian military has historically used in its lexicon, less clear cut. From Finland, for example, an SRBM such as the precision-strike missile can reach a number of targets that the Russians would dub “strategic”, such as Severomorsk and Olenya Guba. Many of these systems can be launched from otherwise “tactical” systems such as HIMARS and M270. While Russia does not lack air-defence systems (although its BMD capabilities are more limited), uncertainty regarding adversary targeting will impose complications Russia has not faced in Ukraine, where there has been less of a problem deciding whether to allocate capabilities at tactical or strategic depth since, barring intermittent UAV attacks, there has been only a marginal threat at strategic depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Russia may face specific challenges with respect to defending against ballistic missiles. Even though BMD has been viewed as a core function for the S-300V series and a role for the S-400, it is notable that neither is especially effective in this role. In the case of the S-400 it is likely that the seekers on the 40N6 and 9M96 do not operate at a frequency higher than Ku band. The decision to opt for a blast fragmentation solution and a Ku band-seeker imposes costs with respect to the BMD mission compared with higher-frequency Ka band-seekers. The higher the frequency of a seeker, the lower its position error and the greater the granularity of its returns, which enables the use of more reliable hit-to-kill interceptors. The use of a solution comparable to the PAC-2 GEM-T could reflect a decision to focus on air-breathing targets, but may also reflect either challenges with seeker design or the fact that the Elbrus-800 computer on the S-400 is slower to process the trajectory of fast-moving targets. In the latter case, a lower-frequency (and thus longer-ranged) seeker tends to be required to scan a wider area, since the difference between the estimated and real location of a target is likely to be greater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it cannot be ascertained with certainty which of these hypotheses is correct, it is of note that experts with prior experience of Russian and Soviet SAM systems have suggested that these systems have historically faced challenges with processing speed and overheating. Importantly, newer Russian systems, such as the S-500, will carry a hit-to-kill BMD capability in the form of the 77N-6. The A-235 interceptor, fielded as part of the Moscow BMD system, will also carry a hit-to-kill interceptor. As such, the window of vulnerability to ballistic missiles could be closing, although this would require Russia to procure both systems and interceptors at scale, adding additional strains to an already heavily burdened complex weapons pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intersection of geography and BMD is important here, since systems such as the A-235 and S-500 were procured with a view to defence against more limited numbers of intermediate- and long-range ballistic missiles. In the present operating environment, Russia will face a dual challenge against air- or surface-launched SRBMs: its IADS performs poorly against ballistic targets, and its loss of strategic depth will make it difficult to ascertain whether SRBMs are being used tactically or strategically. This being said, NATO members field relatively few tactical ballistic missiles, although this may change with the prospective purchase of both ground- and air-launched systems by several member states. Russia does have other options for tactical BMD, such as the S-300 V4, but the X-band seeker on the 9M82 likely provides limited granularity (which is traded for range) and a lower integration rate for returns, which potentially explains the modest claim of 0.5 probability of kill against tactical ballistic missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, defence against low-flying targets such as UAVs and cruise missiles is at least partially dependent on more limited numbers of airborne enablers, such as AWACS and interceptor aircraft like the MIG-31BM. A defence against low-flying objects can still be prosecuted without these capabilities, but at a cost in terms of the warning times available to ground-based systems. This can be overcome by layering short- and longer-ranged systems to create overlapping zones of radar coverage, even though this represents a relatively inefficient means of employing systems that are likely to be needed elsewhere. Moreover, airborne systems are more visible – and thus more vulnerable to suppression – than ground-based TELs. Air defence is possible without an over-reliance on airborne assets but, as discussed, this is a resource-intensive task for ground-based systems, which Russian forces will need near the FLOT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, emerging capabilities such as hypersonic weapons are likely to pose a considerable challenge for Russia’s IADS, which currently lacks the means for the (comparatively) simple task of exoatmospheric BMD. The challenge perceived by many Russian authors is that hypersonic weapons would act as a breaching capability to set the conditions for the use of slower cruise missiles, fixed-wing aircraft and UAVs. Russia is certainly not alone in this analysis. The space-based sensor layer needed to enable birth-to-death tracking of hypersonic projectiles, as well as glide phase interceptors, probably exceeds the capacity of most states, bar the US (and potentially China in the future). Moreover, no NATO member other than the US is likely to field hypersonic missiles in the foreseeable future (given the costs and lead times involved), although the US will field the US Army’s Dark Eagle long-range hypersonic weapon in Europe under the 2nd Multi-Domain Task Force. It might be plausibly argued that the limited numbers and high costs of any hypersonic system in Europe will necessarily narrow the target set against which it can be used to a limited number of possible alternatives, and that the provision of localised defence of key targets (for example, national C2 nodes) is in some ways easier against hypersonic glide vehicles than against comparably ranged ballistic missiles (which are typically faster in their terminal phase).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the presence of hypersonic weapons in Europe would pose a broader question to Russia: how interceptors are allocated. Systems such as the S-500 are allegedly being developed for full spectrum counter-air operations combining new interceptors such as the 77N6-N and 77N6N-1 as well as older interceptors such as the 9M96 and 40N6 – with the system fielding 10 interceptor types in total. However, any given system can only be loaded with a finite number of any type of interceptor. Even if it were assumed that, for example, the 77N6 series is capable of intercepting hypersonic projectiles, it will defend areas that can be simultaneously targeted by SRBMs and cruise missiles, even at what would previously have been regarded as strategic depth. Of course, this challenge can be overcome by layering – allocating the tasks of air defence and tactical BMD to systems such as the S-300V4 and S-400 (as well as shorter-ranged systems) – but this negates the emphasis on multifunctionality, which was meant to ensure that the S-500 did not have to operate with large numbers of accompanying systems as part of a multi-system IADS in which it draws heavily on other systems for self-protection. Furthermore, it is not obvious that the 77N6 series – apparently an updated version of the 9M82 anti-ballistic missile, which did not eventually receive a hit-to-kill warhead – will live up to claims made of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In effect, Russia can defend key points against theatre-range missiles, but must either layer shorter-ranged defences around the S-500 to achieve this effect or risk the saturation of these systems by cheaper tactical missiles. Furthermore, the results from the Monte Carlo model show that even small numbers of tactical ballistic missiles can impose prohibitive costs on a single-layer defensive system (eliminating 65 SRBMs requires the expenditure of 624 interceptors, assuming an SSPK of 0.5, for example). Given this, employing longer-ranged interceptors may not be discretionary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Russia’s Dilemma&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian military, then, faces a very specific problem. Its lack of depth would appear to incentivise a force structure built to ensure high readiness and high levels of force protection for both rear areas and frontline units. However, its planned force design would imply the need for a larger force, probably including partially formed “skeleton units”, which would need to be augmented by conscripts in a crisis – a time-consuming process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the greater the requirement for organic force protection, the harder it becomes to adequately protect any element of the force structure in a cost-effective way. In effect, despite the implied lessons that Russia is learning, as forecast by both the DIEM Analytics model and its own planned force design, the need to offset the risks posed by Western precision-strike capabilities would drive it in a different direction, closer in form to the smaller but more heavily equipped force envisioned under the Serdyukov reforms. In effect, then, deep-strike capabilities can impact Russia’s capacity to build a force around an attritional approach intended to leverage superior combat mass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia will also have to choose between the defence of rear areas and frontline forces; and much of its military literature, as discussed, emphasises the former. As a consequence, Russian efforts to defend rear areas can simplify the task of SEAD near the FLOT and thus make the employment of NATO airpower easier (but by no means easy). Relatively short-ranged strike capabilities, then, can serve as an important enabler for NATO airpower – the Alliance’s optimal competitive strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The threat is currently somewhat notional for Russia. European NATO members field relatively limited surface-to-surface fires capabilities and theatre missiles (with the exception of maritime strike capabilities, such as the Tomahawk land attack missile). However, European states collectively field 3,000 air-launched cruise missiles (ALCMs) in the 500-km range (although the combat readiness of these missiles is not uniform, and donations to Ukraine have likely impacted stockpiles). Of course, ALCMs will need to be launched at distances that account for the IADS threat, but to pose this threat across an extended frontline, Russia would need to thin out its IADS in ways that affected the defences allocated to its forces at the FLOT. Moreover, the purchase of SRBMs (such as ATACMS) and precision-strike missiles by a number of European countries, including the UK, Poland and the Baltic states, will alter the surface-to-surface threat environment considerably. This is not to suggest that a formidable European strike capability is necessarily on the horizon. Rather, the major deduction is that, in tandem with limited numbers of capabilities that only the US can produce, increases in European stocks of existing relatively short-ranged ballistic and cruise missiles can have a strategic effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-balance-of-isrcounter-isr-capabilities&quot;&gt;The Balance of ISR/Counter-ISR Capabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the previous sections suggest, defensive capacity will be a challenge for both Russia and the Alliance, although it is likely that the challenge will compound for Russia over time. While both parties have incentives to win the fight for information, Russia has an especially strong rationale for denying NATO a level of situational awareness that Russia itself is unlikely to be able to generate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;AWACS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the Alliance has a relative – albeit fragile – ISR advantage both in the air and in space. NATO’s Airborne Early Warning capability is currently in transition. Existing AWACS are being phased out, with some improvements taking place until 2035, when the Alliance Future Surveillance and Control (AFSC) programme comes into place. AFSC is intended to deliver a “system of systems” as part of the wider multi-domain operations effort, drawing on novel capabilities such as AI and uncrewed systems. For now, a limited Allied fleet of 14 Boeing 707 AWACS aircraft is stationed in Geilenkirchen Air Base in Germany. Its maintenance is a continuing problem, while the operational number is decreasing. While AWACS will see upgrades in the meantime, such as to its communication system, the airframe, cited as the “biggest liability concern”, will not be upgraded. This could be an area of vulnerability, which could be partly mitigated simply by having more maintenance personnel and higher availability of necessary resources – some aircraft are reportedly being cannibalised for parts to fix better-maintained aircraft in the fleet. Individual NATO members will, of course, make national contributions in an Article 5 context. However, the risks faced by AWACS near Kaliningrad, and the fact that surface-based IAMD assets cannot process radar tracks from AWACS across the Alliance (and in many cases within countries), pose significant challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Space Assets&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of space-based reconnaissance, there are several sovereign systems that can be relied on, including the French CERES (Capacité de Renseignement Électromagnétique Spatiale) satellite constellation, but this represents a federated architecture, rather than an integrated one across which data can easily be shared. NATO is also building a digital constellation, “Aquila”, which is set to benefit from both sovereign space-based ISR capabilities and commercial capabilities, thereby enabling the Alliance to make use of a growing private sector, especially in Luxembourg. While several countries in Europe rely on the space-based ISR capabilities of the US, in the absence of sovereign assets, capabilities are currently being developed and invested in to reduce this dependency; the British ISR constellation ISTARI, for example, was launched in August 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, there is a patchwork of different systems that can provide reliable reconnaissance from space, and which can be tasked at short notice. Presently, the US has the most comprehensive constellation, as the success of Aquila proves in terms of information sharing. More broadly, the processes involved in disseminating information pose a challenge. The sharing of information, especially when classified, has often been difficult, even among NATO Allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine, however, has demonstrated how, in an emergency, red tape can be cut and information can be made available. This is especially true given the ability to access commercial capability – for example, the satellite imagery that the US has been able to provide to the Ukrainians. To facilitate this, the US “doubled the commercial electro-optical imagery” over Ukraine and increased its “purchasing power fivefold”, in addition to passing on data gathered from more sensitive assets via US headquarters. The question is whether the lessons learned from such emergency situations can now be applied to make routine processes smoother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s Earth observation (EO) and intelligence constellations cannot be compared to the combined Allied capabilities – most Russian assets in orbit are past their expected life expectancy, with limited prospects for replacement. This is especially true in comparison with the commercial offerings that NATO Allies can draw from, where new sensors are being deployed constantly. The fact that Russia relies on satellite imagery, but cannot solely rely on its own assets, is evidenced by Russia having bought satellite imagery on the global market since April 2022. Most commercial providers of imagery are Western, a point noted by Russian authors, and this supply chain may become subject to further restrictions, which might target Russia’s future access to imagery. The fact that the Chinese satellite technology company Spacety was sanctioned for allegedly providing synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery to the Wagner Group may suggest that Russia can – in part at least – also rely on Chinese EO capabilities, which are considerable: figures from 2022 show that China has more than eight times as many remote sensing assets as Russia (262, compared with Russia’s 32). Chinese assets, though, are likely to be positioned primarily to surveil China’s zone of interest: the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Counterspace capabilities are thus likely to be an integral part of the Russian arsenal. This is not new; as a number of authors in journals such as Voennaya Mysl have pointed out, Soviet planning for defeating an aerospace attack also included a heavy emphasis on counterspace operations, and the decision to combine air and space functions under the VKS was primarily driven by the assumption that counterspace operations are inextricable from the deflection of massed aerospace attacks. In particular, Russia has placed great emphasis on its EW capabilities, which can interfere directly with the navigation of precision weapons. In Russian military thinking, EW is considered critical to “force multipliers”, and a firm component of Russia’s asymmetric challenge. There is further evidence that Russia might be developing a space-based jammer satellite (Ekipazh) in addition to its ground-based capabilities. Given the nuclear reactor the satellite is supposed to possess, this asset would allow Russia to continuously jam satellites, and on a wide-reaching basis, as the power source is unlimited and the curvature of the Earth cannot interfere with the range of the signals, as it would on the ground. In terms of the physics, the Earth’s curvature will not obstruct a jamming signal, but that signal must still have sufficient power to block out the power of the signal that the targeted satellite is receiving. The effective radiated power (ERP) of a jamming signal diminishes the further that signal has to travel, meaning it may become ineffective if the targeted satellite is far enough away from the jamming satellite. The jamming satellite could be moved closer to the targeted satellite, but this could expend valuable fuel. Moreover, the ERP of the jamming signal will be limited by the power that the reactor can generate, while also needing to power the jamming satellite’s other signals. In a nutshell, a jamming satellite’s effectiveness would still be constrained by the ERP it can generate and by its proximity to the targeted satellites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it should be noted that there is no concrete evidence to suggest that Ekipazh has entered plans for operational deployment, the fielding of such a capability would represent a logical step for Russia, meaning that the question of how communications might be made more resilient remains germane. It is claimed that ground-based EW systems such as the Krasukha-4 and the Murmansk-BN are effective against SAR satellites, although the rate at which Ukraine’s partners have been able to provide Ukraine with data is grounds for some conservatism in assessing the effectiveness of Russian EW in a counterspace role. It seems that further systems are being developed – including an EW system that could prevent optical and radar reconnaissance satellites from imaging by preventing their signals from reaching the relay satellites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Other Counterspace Weapons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia also has an arsenal of kinetic counterspace weapons, for example, the ground-launched ballistic missile Nudol, which was successfully tested in November 2021. Russian BMD interceptors such as the A-235 are also dual-hatted as kinetic anti-satellite weapons. Additionally, Russia employs the Soviet-era 78M6 Kontakt on the Mig-31 interceptor. However, it is unlikely that Russia would make use of its kinetic counterspace arsenal, and especially not in the initial phases of a war. This is because the number of assets that would need to be targeted would effectively render the affected orbit unusable – including for Russian assets. This calculation is particularly important when considering that Russian long-range weapons also rely on satellite guidance – both from GPS and from GLONASS, the Russian GNSS (global navigation satellite service).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has also been developing directed-energy countermeasures against space-based reconnaissance assets for some time, although there is some uncertainty regarding the specifications of emerging systems. One of these systems might be Peresvet, a laser system announced in 2018, which was reportedly designed to prevent the space-based detection of mobile ICBMs. If targeted by Peresvet, the reconnaissance satellite is temporarily dazzled. Furthermore, Russia’s ground-based satellite laser ranging facilities could, in theory, be used for the same purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, Russia’s Krona optical space surveillance systems might be being outfitted with dazzling or blinding capabilities, according to open source investigations that discovered bank guarantees and other reports. There have been conflicting reports about the 1LK222, a laser system attached to an aircraft (as yet unnamed), which would be designed to specifically counter the infrared spectrum – it is currently unclear whether the programme has been cancelled by Russia’s Ministry of Defence. The current evidence of Russia’s laser development is somewhat patchy – but there is precedent for these developments, and the evidence emerging seems to suggest that several lines of effort are being dedicated to the temporary dazzling of optical sensors aboard satellites. However, it is unclear how many of these systems, if any, are fully operational, and whether they would be able to serve the purpose of concealing mobile launcher systems consistently, and at a scale that would bring Russia a genuine advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Limits of Counterspace Capabilities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Counterspace operations could provide Russia with a cheap means of avoiding an otherwise unwinnable race to develop both air defences and precision-strike capabilities, given its loss of strategic depth and the aggregate force balance. However, there are limits to the effectiveness of counterspace capabilities. This is particularly true with respect to kinetic kill vehicles such as Nudol, which create considerable amounts of debris and are thus an indiscriminate tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attacks at scale with relatively indiscriminate capabilities would necessarily run counter to the aim of fighting a limited war in the service of political aims. While such attacks are more conceivable in the context of a larger-scale conflict, in which second-order effects are less of a consideration, a total conflict is unlikely to be consistent with wider Russian strategic aims. Russia’s non-kinetic options, such as space-based EW and long-range jammers, including the Murmansk-BN, represent a more strategically credible capability. However, the reliability of these systems is open to debate, given Russia’s inability to deny Ukrainian satellite communications and the difficulties Russia has faced in denying Ukraine’s allies the ability to provide it with data from electronic intelligence soaks. The growing diversification of the space-based ISR assets ecosystem, alongside the increasing use of multiple frequencies (including Ka band for communication), mean that ISR and communications disruption on a sustained basis will be increasingly difficult to guarantee with soft kill alone. Much depends on Allied efforts to generate resilience. Russian authors have devoted considerable attention to the possibility of kinetic attacks on ground stations, although a combination of hardening and IAMD can mitigate this risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of technical solutions to the challenge of counterspace capabilities, including frequency hopping, shuttering satellites and adaptive nulling (ignoring parts of the frequency spectrum an opponent is jamming). Millimetre wave communications can also prove highly resistant to jamming – one of the factors to which the Russians attribute Starlink’s success. However, it must be presumed that both ISR and positioning, navigation and timing will be intermittently disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EW capabilities, including the R770 Zhitl, the Krashuka-3 and the Murmansk-BN, can also be employed against the effector rather than the ISR complex, and EW platforms can be employed to jam radio frequency communications and GPS signals. However, this will probably have greater effect against stand-in munitions, such as JDAM, than against standoff capabilities, which combine GPS with terrain contour matching and digital scene mapping area correlation. In effect, Russia has better options for cost-effective defence in the close area than it does at the army deep and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is of greater significance for intermediate target development than for weapons guidance. Western weapons systems might be affected by GNSS jamming or spoofing, although many of them do have fallback options in case of interference. Storm Shadow/SCALP-EG relies on three elements: GPS, INS (inertial navigation system) and terrain referencing, with an infrared seeker for the target approach. Taurus KEPD 350 uses GPS and INS with image-based and terrain reference sensors; its manufacturers consider the weapon “GPS-independent”. The US Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile uses GPS, INS and an infrared seeker for target guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coordinating a counterspace campaign would also pose challenges for Russia, however. First, the capabilities on which such a campaign depends are expensive and, in some cases, reliant on foreign inputs that can be constrained. Moreover, space-based observation and early warning is of importance to Russia as well, and Russian planners cannot be insouciant about the consequences of a kinetic attack on satellites with which their own early warning systems share orbits. In addition, NATO members can also engage in “strategic binding”, intertwining capabilities either within or across nations in ways that make selective attacks more difficult. For example, EO satellites in geosynchronous orbit (comparable to China’s Yaogan-41) would cohabit an area with early warning systems such as SBIRS, making them more difficult to strike with kinetic capabilities without producing unpredictable effects; this would also have the advantage of providing angles for observing hypersonics, which can otherwise be obscured by thermal clutter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In effect, then, there would be limits to any Russian effort to use counterspace and counter-ISR capabilities to mitigate the challenge of having to resource a layered defence against deep-strike capabilities while protecting frontline forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;allied-counter-c4isr&quot;&gt;Allied Counter-C4ISR&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of Western countermeasures in the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS), it must be assumed that Europe will continue to rely on US systems. US predominance in the field is best represented by the Navigation Warfare Program, which enables the US to jam and interfere with civilian GNSS signals within a local area of operation – a capability that has already been demonstrated in exercises. It is also likely to be able to jam military GNSS receivers, especially given the money and time spent on EW capabilities. It is, however, difficult to determine from open sources how effective US systems would be in counteracting the jamming or spoofing of military GPS signals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picture in Europe is more mixed: while France has incorporated GNSS jamming in its Exercise Black Crow 24, it has been observed that the UK trains its troops in unrealistically permissive environments when it comes to the EMS, which may also be the case for other NATO members. Given US predominance in terms of systems available and its experience, there is likely to be a dependence on US systems in Europe if they are needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian missiles depend on GNSS signals to varying degrees. Similarly to Western missiles, they rely on different factors, including INS and DSMAC (digital scene matching area correlator). As the stockpile of precision-guided missiles dwindles, not only older missiles but also missiles with different intended purposes have been used for land attacks. It is not inconceivable that Russia would adopt tactics from the Ukraine war, including using anti-ship and air defence missiles for land attacks, specifically where the intention is to terrorise the civilian population, with no intention of carrying out a precision strike. Among the modern variants, the air-launched K-101/Kh-102 used in Ukraine rely on the GLONASS constellation, TV terminal guidance, an electro-optical correction system with terrain maps, and INS. It is not entirely clear which navigation mechanisms are used by the ground-launched 9M729 (SSC-8), but its predecessor, the 9K720 Iskander (SS-26), employs inertial guidance, GLONASS, an optional optical seeker (which also uses DSMAC), and a terminal guidance system. Unlike GLONASS or GPS, INS cannot be jammed, but it needs to be supplemented by further systems to keep the flight path accurate, as it otherwise accrues error over time. Meanwhile, the Shahed-136, one of the most heavily used UAVs during the war, has INS in addition to its GPS system, and employs preset target coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general terms, both Russia and the West use deep-strike systems that would be vulnerable to electronic interference. Russia’s advantage lies in the testing of systems during the war in Ukraine, including the patching of vulnerabilities. On the other hand, the GLONASS constellation that is still built into a variety of strike capabilities is more volatile than GPS – not only was deployment of its newest generation of satellites delayed, thereby holding back the update to the system, but also Russian fighter pilots were seen to attach civilian GPS systems to their cockpit instrumentation, which does not inspire confidence in the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;escalatory-dimensions-of-a-strike-campaign&quot;&gt;Escalatory Dimensions of a Strike Campaign&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second relatively cost-effective offset available to Russia to counter opponents’ deep-strike capabilities is the threat to employ sub-strategic nuclear weapons, which would be consistent with Russian nuclear doctrine and recent statements regarding likely revisions. In practice, the threat of a large-scale employment of sub-strategic nuclear weapons could deter a massed air assault on Russia. Making this threat credible would, however, require the mobilisation of Russia’s nuclear arsenal and the placement of tactical nuclear weapons on a hair-trigger warning to account for the effects of C2 disruption. This, in turn, would make the prospect of limited conflict difficult to contemplate – the mechanisms to signal limited intent being effectively removed as a prerequisite for Russian war planning in this context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The threat to employ sub-strategic nuclear weapons in response to a massed conventional air assault also has implications for Russia’s own concepts for deflecting Allied airpower through the massed use of long-range precision fires. Employing long-range precision fires carries the implicit risk of a response in kind, and by extension the possibility of placing Russia in a position where it must either escalate or invalidate its own deterrent threats. In effect, the threat to employ nuclear weapons as a deterrent against long-range precision fires also constrains Russia’s own capacity to employ precision-strike capabilities. This has ramifications for the close fight, in which Russia’s ability to limit Allied sortie rates (and thus the effectiveness of a SEAD campaign) partly depends on its ability to hold airbases at risk with long-range precision fires. In practice, a change in Russian nuclear thresholds could constrain critical Russian capabilities as much as it does Western ones – or even more so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An aggressive counter-ISR campaign represents a less escalatory alternative for Russia, particularly if it employs non-kinetic assets. While unlikely to prevent the employment of Allied precision-strike capabilities entirely, such an approach could impact tempo and coordination. The major challenge to a counter-ISR campaign is relative uncertainty about its likely effects – a dynamic best illustrated by the limited effects of Russian counter-ISR in Ukraine. More “brute force” approaches, such as kinetic air-launched anti-satellite missiles, obviate this challenge, but at the risk of incurring wider political costs (since many states’ capabilities are likely to be affected) and capital costs, as a relatively large number of interceptors would be required. Moreover, counter-ISR efforts that could be interpreted as being aimed at strategic early warning are likely only to be employed in extremis, given the mutually catastrophic consequences of targeting early warning systems or being perceived as doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In effect, Russia would face two choices – a large and probably expensive expansion of its air and missile defence architecture, or the adoption of a posture that required it to engage in both counter-ISR and nuclear posturing relatively early in a crisis. Both approaches involve considerable dilemmas for Russian leaders, either at the level of resource allocation or in terms of escalation control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several deductions can be made based on the analysis in this paper. First, a net assessment of the balance of capabilities able to affect the army deep and beyond suggests that in many ways Russia may be more disadvantaged than NATO. The changing geographical boundaries of the Alliance mean that the traditional Russian distinction between operational-tactical and operational-strategic missiles no longer holds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, exacerbating this challenge for Russia does not require NATO’s European members to develop exquisite or especially long-ranged capabilities. In many ways, short-ranged (up to 500 km) air-to-surface and surface-to-surface fires can have similar effects, particularly with respect to BMD. This depends, however, on the availability of US capabilities in areas such as hypersonic weapons, since the costs of conventional prompt strike and the lead times associated with developing it make any effort to achieve this on a national basis or at the European level an uncertain enterprise. Off-the-shelf purchases of existing medium-range strike capabilities are probably more cost effective. Where domestic industrial aims are a concern, they might be better served by generating the capacity to produce key bottleneck components (for example, rocket propellant), which can both ensure domestic content and create greater symmetry in transatlantic partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the capacity of non-US NATO members to generate targets is both limited and relatively vulnerable to disruption. While the growing scale and diversity of the space-based ecosystem for ISR provision makes counterspace operations difficult, soft-kill options remain a relatively cheap offset in which Russia could invest further. Of equal importance is ensuring the availability of geospatial intelligence and human capital sufficient to enable intermediate target development and advanced target development, for which the Alliance is currently heavily reliant on the US. There is also a question of how systems that can have both tactical and operational roles (for example, the precision-strike missile) fit within Allied C2 structures, and the degree to which their use should be part of an air campaign’s planning, in the way maritime strike assets such as Tomahawk often are. Building the organisational capital to sustain a strike campaign may, then, be of greater significance to NATO than the ability of member states to generate small numbers of relatively exquisite capabilities, such as hypersonic weapons. As things stand, Russia will have to undertake considerable burdens to defend against far more simple threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With respect to air and missile defence, the Russian threat as currently constituted is most problematic at the FLOT and up to army deep. Beyond this point, NATO’s considerable advantages in numbers and quality of aircraft can allow it to offset what is primarily a cruise missile threat with a lower rate of interceptor expenditure than might be presumed if only surface-based responses to threats are considered, although this depends on the availability of systems such as the E-7 Wedgetail AWACS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also noteworthy that the demand for hit-to-kill interceptors, per the modelling for this paper, is considerable (and in excess of the demand for air-to-air interceptors in the early days of a conflict). This would become more acute if a Russian IRBM threat developed in Europe (this paper considers a Russian hypersonic glide threat unlikely, since Russia has not yet demonstrated the operational capability of the Avangard, and the Kinzhal is not hypersonic per se). However, as things stand, the relative paucity of hit-to-kill interceptors represents a more acute capability challenge. This is a concern, since much of the serial production of surface-based interceptors being undertaken in Europe is focused on systems such as PAC-2 GEM, rather than on hit-to-kill interceptors, as BMD is an area where the efficiencies provided by Allied advantages in the air are less significant. Equally, the survivability of ground-based TELs will be reduced as a conflict wears on, and if SEAD efforts succeed. Moreover, Russian targeting early in a conflict is likely to be narrowly focused on disrupting air threats, reducing the aperture for defenders. Russian targeting can be made more inefficient if surface-to-surface threats have to be tracked and engaged as part of the effort to deflect an aerospace assault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In effect, deep-strike capabilities represent an area where the Alliance can both shape the contours of Russia’s force generation, and reinforce specific lessons that Russia believes it has learned from previous conflicts, in ways that result in inefficient resource allocation that will necessarily slow the reconstitution of Russia’s forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-findings&quot;&gt;Key Findings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kenya’s political stability outlook and its role in shaping regional peace and stability have made it an influential member of the East African Community (EAC).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the years, Kenya has sought to consolidate partnerships in the bloc as a means of economic expansion, particularly in the finance and transport sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Peace and security initiatives have accompanied this effort, as instability inhibits economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kenya’s economic expansion has generated geopolitical tensions that threaten long-term cooperation and broader stability in the EAC, particularly as Kenya takes the helm of the bloc instead of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), which had been tipped for the position.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report analyzes Kenya’s political and economic influence in the EAC through the nation’s initiatives in the DRC as Kenyan President William Ruto takes up the rotational leadership of the bloc for the next year.i The EAC now comprises eight member states: Burundi, the DRC, Kenya, Rwanda, Somalia, South Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda. The report explores the impact Kenya has had on expanding the regional bloc over the last five years (2019–2023), Kenya’s influential role in stabilizing the region, and how Kenya’s intervention in the DRC has consolidated business interests that were established in 1967 when the two countries first forged diplomatic relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report also focuses on challenges and opportunities around Kenya’s economic initiatives in the DRC. It deals with Kenya’s financial initiatives, analyzing how they spur private investment in the country and their impact on trade at large with other members of the EAC. The aim is to understand how Kenya is rising as a regional power within the EAC by extending its influence across other member states, especially the DRC. This study is mainly qualitative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report, which draws from a review of academic literature, official documents, and commentary on the EAC, is based on field research conducted in Nairobi, Busia, and Mandera, Kenya, and in Kinshasa and Goma, DRC, in the fall of 2024. At the request of the interviewees, their comments have been kept anonymous. In conducting this study, the researchers met with a broad cross section of informants: government officials, trade association leaders, business operators, youth leaders, diplomats, current and former politicians, independent journalists, local political analysts and academics, and military officers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Kenya’s presence in the DRC may be traced to the 1960s, when the two countries achieved independence, relations between them reached new levels following DRC President Félix Antoine Tshisekedi Tshilombo’s rise to power in January 2019. When the DRC joined the EAC in April 2022, a new dynamic emerged, increasing Kenyan investments in key strategic areas, such as the financial system, aviation, and the oil and energy sectors, and earning Kenya a significant, influential position in the Congolese economy. While these investments benefit the DRC to some degree, they also have a negative impact on a country that has limited industrial output. The DRC has a consumer market where local investors and companies do not compete as they would in a more liberal economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report provides explanations for this recent dynamic in Kenya’s economic initiatives, specifies the implications for the DRC and the region, and sheds light on the initiatives’ prospects by interrogating—using a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) approach—the chance for Kenya to maintain its current position or to increase its influence, even if a change of government occurs in the DRC. The conclusion offers recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background-kenyas-political-and-economic-influence-in-the-eac&quot;&gt;Background: Kenya’s Political and Economic Influence in the EAC&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenya is widely considered an economic and logistical pillar of the EAC due to its political stability outlook, well-established infrastructure, and regional peace initiatives. Since the inception of the bloc in 1967 and its revival in 1977, Nairobi has sought to be a dominant regional power despite the EAC’s rotational leadership and egalitarian ideals. President Ruto is embarking on his tenure as the leader of the EAC by “enhancing regional competitiveness, promoting value-added production, boosting intra-regional trade, and attracting greater investment to the region’s economies.” President Tshisekedi notably skipped the EAC summit on December 1, 2024, which also marked 25 years of integration; insiders noted that he had been tipped to take up the post but had been beset by the security crisis in the eastern DRC and may not have been in a position to lead the bloc. The two have had an uneasy relationship, partly due to Ruto’s perceived forceful style, compared with the pragmatic and conciliatory approach of his predecessor Uhuru Kenyatta, who was initially spearheading the DRC’s peace process. Indeed, prior to winning elections, Ruto was the subject of derision for remarking that the DRC had “no cows” and would need Kenya to import milk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, tensions persisted between the two countries after Kenya spearheaded a failed peacekeeping mission, seeking to play a larger role in economic initiatives in the DRC off the back of its historic political and economic expansion in the country and its ambition as an aspiring hegemon of the EAC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International relations lecturer Dr. Gilbert Kimutai describes regional hegemons as “countries that are able to shape the fortunes of other countries through their greater economic power, military might, and political influence. They are countries that have dominant influence or authority over others.” A journalist covering regional developments observed that Kenya has demonstrated these qualities by being the gateway to the region, particularly considering its strategic positioning near the Indian Ocean and its use of infrastructure to sustain interconnectedness and consolidate shared political and diplomatic values. These have partly driven the growth of Kenyan business interests in the region and, notably, as this paper assesses, in the DRC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key DRC sectors in which Kenya has grown its footprint include banking and finance, insurance, transport, hospitality, and import and export. Some of Kenya’s earliest investments in the DRC predate the latter’s official inclusion in the regional bloc. Since the 1970s, Kenya’s port of Mombasa has enabled Congolese traders from the eastern provinces to import and export goods. Kenyan financial institutions were also instrumental in providing loans and capital to Congolese businesspeople, establishing cross-regional trade and partnerships. The DRC Kenya Chamber of Commerce noted that this first-to-market advantage enabled Kenyan businesses to quickly set up shop in the DRC, particularly between 2015 and now, tapping into a population of nearly 100 million people. Therefore, the expansion of Kenya’s private sector players into the DRC—and the stability and acumen these have brought in—have provided a strong foundation for government-led expansion and cooperation between the two countries, especially as the DRC seeks increased political and security support from the EAC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April 2021, during a state visit by former Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta in Kinshasa, the two countries signed four pacts on general cooperation that cover the joint promotion of scientific, technical, and sociocultural programs. A year later, exports from Kenya to the DRC were worth $141 million, while exports from the DRC to Kenya were worth $30.4 million. A trade mission sponsored by Equity Bank on behalf of the two governments in April 2022 saw more than two dozen Kenyan companies pledge to invest $1.6 billion into the DRC. A Kenyan journalist who has been tracing the expansion of the EAC over the past five years observed that the relationship has remained asymmetric due to Kenya’s political and economic advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;impact-of-the-relative-adoption-of-the-eac-charter&quot;&gt;Impact of the Relative Adoption of the EAC Charter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenya has consistently advocated for the EAC to be better integrated, ostensibly to extend its economic reach in the region. An international relations lecturer at the United States International University-Africa attributed this to Kenya’s capitalist approach, which has been enhanced by foreign direct investment (FDI) and the fact that the country has often “taken on the burden of streamlining protocols.” An integral element of integration, however, is the relationship between member states. According to the African Development Bank (AfDB), “the major challenges of regional integration in East Africa” are the “lack of complementarity in trading, low competitive position of countries to supply goods in the region . . . institutional capacity weakness to advance regional integration, and failure to address political issues related to regional integration.” For instance, in August 2013, Kenya entered into a separate pact with Uganda and Rwanda—the coalition of the willing—that undercut trade with Tanzania as competition heightened. This undermined the Common Market Protocol, which sought to abolish restrictions on trade and movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expectation within Kenya’s business community had been that the DRC’s entry into the EAC would further harmonize trade, especially after Tshisekedi pledged in 2021 to undertake reforms that would streamline the tax and regulatory environment for ease of business. However, the uneven adoption of the EAC’s administrative mechanisms continues to hamper not only trade relations between Kenya and the DRC, but also broader intraregional trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 1 outlines the various steps EAC members must take to fully ratify the charter and highlights the member states that have fully adopted various tenets to compare levels of compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/fiNufEg.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tensions between Kenya and the DRC, partly driven by differences between the respective leaders of the two countries, as highlighted earlier, will likely slow the ratification of the EAC charter, as well as planned reforms outlined by Tshisekedi, potentially undermining years of preexisting cooperation in the private sector. For the moment, Kenyan businesses are not experiencing operational difficulties, demonstrating the capacity to disentangle political tensions from the broader economic benefits. Nevertheless, an audit and advisory firm that recently established operations in Kinshasa observed that the DRC will continue to need support to enable regional businesses to navigate the country’s legal, regulatory, and tax environment. It also identified two other areas that would be affected by the geopolitical tensions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business uncertainty:&lt;/strong&gt; Kenya-based businesses may slow partnerships and trade due to limited diplomatic cover (the DRC has yet to approve Kenya’s ambassadorial appointment more than seven months down the line), which can hurt local economies and the potential for investment and growth.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loss of market access:&lt;/strong&gt; Barriers such as trade restrictions or new tariffs risk being applied with limited diplomatic recognition, which leads businesses to risk losing revenue and diminishes market opportunities for Kenyan businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, investor confidence has not declined, as the risk appetite of most Kenyan businesses appears high, according to one consultant with a risk advisory. Despite the internal security issues facing the mineral and agricultural sectors that Kenyan companies have sought to expand in, businesses are likely willing to withstand periods of political tension, as many established operations prior to the current challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;courting-the-drc-peace-and-stability-for-business-expansion&quot;&gt;Courting the DRC: Peace and Stability for Business Expansion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, it is imperative to discuss Kenya’s involvement in the DRC by briefly reflecting on the failed security intervention. Although Kenya and the DRC already have well-established bilateral relations, the prevailing sentiment when Presidents Kenyatta and Tshisekedi signed bilateral deals in 2021 was that further integration through the EAC could be achieved only alongside mechanisms for peace and stability, particularly in the eastern regions, which are the gateway to the central African nation. A journalist with the East African, a regional weekly paper, stated, “DRC’s entry to the bloc could not be separated from tackling insecurity because the entryway from neighbors to the country is through the volatile east.” He added that Kenya’s previous role in peace and security initiatives in the region, including in South Sudan (another EAC member state) and Somalia (the latest entrant), partly underpinned Tshisekedi’s confidence at the time in Kenyatta’s ability to stabilize the east. At the same time, a Mombasa-based historian observed, “While such security issues may have informed Kenya’s entry into such a volatile theatre of conflict, a close reading of Kenya’s intentions in DRC may reveal other economic considerations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenya’s military intervention against the resurgence of the March 23 Movement (M23) became the first true test of the Eastern African Standby Force, established in 2004 but operationalized only in 2011 to intervene in growing regional conflicts. The forces’ capacity was reinforced by the adoption in 2012 of the EAC Conflict Management Act, which “seeks to prevent internal, cross border, and regional conflicts affecting partner states; bring together conflicting parties for mediation; encourage the parties to a conflict to resolve conflict amicably; encourage cooperation among partner states in conflict management; and coordinate post-conflict management.” The DRC is so far the first and only site of military intervention by the force, dubbed the East African Community Regional Force (EACRF). This was alongside the Nairobi process, in which members of armed groups active in the eastern DRC took part in peace talks with the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EACRF did not engage in direct combat as had been widely anticipated, and Ruto expressed disappointment at the lack of additional funding to support the regional troops. As this failed to materialize, the rationale for a more aggressive posture for the EACRF dwindled. Geopolitical relations further aggravated mistrust, with a prevailing perception that Kenya sided with Uganda and Rwanda, which have long been considered sponsors of M23 despite repeated denials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An EACRF insider noted that despite relative success in upholding ceasefires and delivering humanitarian aid in North Kivu, a lack of understanding about the mandate of the force precipitated its failure. A series of papers examining the nine-month intervention also observed, “Each contributing country’s different understanding of the mission fueled suspicion, confusion, and misinformation,” which in the long run threatens to undermine Kenya-DRC relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;kenya-as-a-traditional-congolese-economic-partner&quot;&gt;Kenya as a Traditional Congolese Economic Partner&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenya and the DRC established diplomatic relations in 1967. Their economic ties have always been fluid and facilitated by the geographical position of the DRC in the heart of Africa, linking East Africa to the Atlantic Ocean. Several eastern DRC provinces (notably, North Kivu, South Kivu, Ituri, and Tshopo, among others) are economically dependent on the Central Corridor, which includes Mombasa, Kenya, as the import and export port for the Congolese on the Indian Ocean. The Directorate General of Customs and Excise (DGDA), a public Congolese agency that collects taxes levied on exports and imports, has representation at the port of Mombasa, where goods transit from or to the DRC, as in the case of the Tanzanian port of Dar es Salaam. Kenya is also a destination for many Congolese migrants. According to a Kenyan official, more Congolese reside in Kenya than Kenyans in the DRC for several reasons, including personal security and employment, business, and educational opportunities. The current Kenyan population in the eastern DRC is likely about 2,500, including around 50 investors, whereas Nairobi alone is home to at least 10,000 Congolese. This migration often goes together with business and the creation of enterprises. Congolese investments, financial placements, and loans to Kenyan companies make the DRC, among other EAC partner states, the highest holder of Kenyan foreign liabilities, estimated at $1.4 billion in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Kenya and the DRC established diplomatic relations in 1967. Their economic ties have always been fluid and facilitated by the geographical position of the DRC in the heart of Africa, linking East Africa to the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenya’s economic involvement in the DRC gained momentum at the beginning of the 1970s. Nairobi became a hub for Congolese traders from Beni and Butembo in North Kivu Province. Gold, timber, and coffee from the DRC were already transiting there to the port of Mombasa. Conversely, Congolese traders were receiving goods from Nairobi long before discovering the trade route to China. An informant reported that Congolese were receiving support in terms of loans and other facilities in Kenya to sustain this business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenya’s investments in the DRC are notable chiefly in the service sector, such as transport, oil, hospitality, and telecommunications. For instance, Jambojet, an airline founded in 2014, launched its direct flight from Goma to Nairobi in September of 2021. It is the second Kenyan airline, after Kenya Airways, to operate continuously in the DRC. Congo Petrol is the largest Kenyan company in the oil sector operating in Kinshasa, Goma, Lubumbashi, and Kolwezi. Incorporated in 1997, it has become a distributor and licensee of the Dalbit brand which was established in Kenya in 2002. Another example is the Serena Hotel, which belongs to Vanny Bishweka, a Congolese businessman based in Goma, but is managed by Kenyans. Other small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have been established in Kinshasa, such as Fontana Hotel in 2003 and African Digital Networks in 2011. Sojax Paint Company, created in partnership with the Congolese in 2017, has branches in North Kivu, South Kivu, and Ituri provinces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This demonstrates that, for a long time, the Kenyan government has had a clear policy of trading with the DRC, aiming to make it a consumer market for goods and services produced in Kenya or distributed by Kenyans. However, the Kenyan government has made limited investments in the DRC’s production sector, and Kenya has never been the DRC’s top economic partner. According to figures from the Congo Central Bank (BCC), 43.5 percent of Congolese imports come from African countries—mainly from South Africa, Zambia, and Tanzania. The DRC is ranked sixth among Kenyan export markets. In terms of Congolese exports, however, China is the top DRC trade partner, while South Africa comes first among African countries. A Kenyan official indicated that his country seeks to do more business with the DRC, improve its economic position, and catch up with other African states. This competitive mindset alone may be the driver of the new dynamic in Kenya’s rising investments and growing influence in the DRC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recent-dynamics-kenyas-growing-economic-influence-in-the-drc&quot;&gt;Recent Dynamics: Kenya’s Growing Economic Influence in the DRC&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On January 24, 2019, Tshisekedi came to power following the tenure of former President Joseph Kabila. The peaceful transfer of power was a milestone because it had not happened in the DRC since its independence. For the first time, people hoped for a return to stability and a good business climate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenya seems to have understood this and has taken initiative to increase its investments, mainly in the banking sector. This choice has three justifications. First, Kenya has been present in the Congolese banking market since Equity Group Holdings acquired Pro-Credit Bank in 2015; the subsidiary was renamed Equity Bank Congo. Second, the market is still largely available, as only around 7 percent of the population have bank accounts, similar to Kenyans in the early 1990s, according to James Mwangi, Equity Group’s managing director. Third, banks are the catalyzers of entrepreneurship thanks to the support services they provide to investors, such as safe placements, financial transactions, and loans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second DRC bank that Equity Group Holdings acquired is the Congolese Commercial Bank (BCDC), incorporated in the DRC in 1909, whose main shareholder was the family of Belgian tycoon George Forrest. Equity Group Holdings bought up to a 65 percent stake in this entity in December 2020, and BCDC merged with Equity Bank Congo to form one entity named Equity BCDC, which officially opened on April 21, 2021. With a balance sheet in excess of $3 billion, Equity BCDC became the second-largest bank in the DRC, behind Rawbank, which was created by the Rawji family, of Indian origin, in 2002. One year later, another Kenyan company, Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB), purchased an 85 percent stake in Trust Merchant Bank (TMB) in December 2022, whose assets were worth $2.2 billion in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investments like these are not unique to the DRC because Kenya has also bought subsidiaries in other EAC member states. A case in point is Rwanda, where “KCB acquired a 62.06 percent stake in Banque Populaire du Rwanda (BPR) from the British financial services conglomerate Atlas Mara Ltd in 2021 and later increased the stake to 76.67 percent by acquiring additional shares from the minority shareholders.” However, what is changing with respect to the DRC is Kenya’s growing interest in the Congolese market, the scale of its investments, and the trend to consolidate the partnership from a long-term perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of benefits, the DRC has surpassed Rwanda as the most profitable market for Kenya among other EAC member states. According to the Central Bank of Kenya, subsidiaries of Kenyan banks in the DRC have recorded 45.5 percent of the total pretax profit of Kenyan banks within the EAC market, or $229 million in 2023. Equity BCDC has realized a net profit of $102 million. There is a scramble for the DRC market because it is lucrative and underexploited. More Kenyans are investing in the oil sector—for instance, by establishing fuel stations for local consumption. Other companies are extending the range of their market, as in the case of Congo Petrol, which now serves the west of the country and established a new branch in Kinshasa in April of 2024. Kenyans are also investing in the energy sector through GL Energy Africa, established in Kinshasa in July of 2024, which aims to create energy solutions, such as building electricity plants, for public or private corporations that may be in need. The entity is part of Janus Continental Group, a larger company based in Nairobi. Overall, Kenyans are looking for more markets given the “booming private sector and a vast expansion of SMEs,” implying a high productivity of the local Kenyan industry. With a population of over 100 million, the DRC alone offers a significant market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, on the political front, the DRC effectively joined the EAC in 2022, creating hopes for a new business environment. The scale of its partnership with Kenya expanded through the conclusion of a general cooperation framework in April 2021. The bilateral agreement covers various matters of common interest in the economic, political, and security areas. This development reflects a tight rapprochement between the two countries. Kenyatta, the former president of Kenya, played an important role because he is considered the godfather of the Cap pour le changement (CACH) political coalition, created in Nairobi, which had supported Tshisekedi’s candidacy during the Congolese presidential election of December 2018. Kenyatta’s close friendship with Tshisekedi facilitated the latter’s interest in joining the EAC. Among the Congolese, however, the decision to join the EAC was contentious, as they did not vote for the consequential commitment. The population of eastern provinces tended to support the decision, while those living in other parts of the DRC never embraced the idea. Nevertheless, strategic trade missions and meetings were organized to attract investors on the territory of both countries. It is necessary to explore the consequences of this economic dynamic for the DRC and the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications-for-the-drc-and-the-region&quot;&gt;Implications for the DRC and the Region&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenyan investments in the DRC come with benefits and costs. Benefits represent the gains, and costs represent the losses or negative impacts for the DRC and the EAC region. The implications of these investments are tied to the context: The DRC appears to be economically weaker than Kenya, which is the largest economy in the EAC, with a gross domestic product (GDP) of $116.6 billion, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). In contrast, the DRC’s GDP was $83.1 billion in August 2024. Furthermore, the Congolese economy is less diversified and is supported mainly by exports from the mining sector. As a reminder, Tanzania is the top Congolese trade partner within the EAC in terms of both imports and exports. This signals that while Kenyans are investing in the DRC and making more tangible profits than in any other EAC member state, Congolese do not reciprocate with a similar dynamic in Kenya. This is due to shortcomings in production activities. Apart from producing raw materials—timber in particular—the DRC is mainly a consumer market. As an informant from the BCC stated, “We do not have an economy, and we have not even figured out how to put one in place.” After the admission of the DRC into the EAC, the few Congolese assets in Kenya fell by 30 percent, from $1.4 billion in 2021 to $969 million in 2022. The economic relationship between the two countries is therefore unbalanced, and the deficit will widen as long as the DRC remains unproductive and weakened. Kenya is not to blame; rather, the Congolese government’s economic policies and governance are perceived as not living up to the power potential of the DRC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The DRC appears to be economically weaker than Kenya, which is the largest economy in the EAC, with a gross domestic product (GDP) of $116.6 billion, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). In contrast, the DRC’s GDP was $83.1 billion in August 2024.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The negative impacts are higher for the Congolese side. In fact, there is a wide perception among Congolese that Kenya’s investments in the DRC may end in an economic hegemony with devastating adverse effects on local investors who cannot effectively compete with Kenyan investments. Kenya dominates the oil sector in the eastern DRC, for example, in terms of the supply chain and fuel distribution. The same is true for the food product, beverage, and equipment sectors. A civil society activist reported a case in the cement sector in which Nyiragongo Cement, a new Congolese company created in 2014 and headquartered in Goma, nearly went bankrupt because of insecurity, among other factors, due to the ongoing armed conflicts around the production site. The company has failed to compete against products imported from Simba Cement, a Kenya-based corporation. Yet, he added, the cement business had received financial support from the Industry Promotion Fund (FPI) and a tax exemption from the DRC government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another civil society informant said Kenya’s influence is such that the DRC cannot withstand economic shocks without Kenyan investment in certain areas, such as the banking sector. This is a matter of national security for the DRC since all banks are now under majority foreign control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Kenyan investments also generate benefits for the DRC. One of these is the opportunity to restore security in the eastern DRC, which has been affected by protracted armed conflicts for around three decades, including ongoing aggression by Rwanda and Uganda that is currently supported by rebels of the M23. The DRC has bargaining leverage to engage in strategic diplomacy, pushing the Kenyan government to exercise its influence on other EAC member states involved in these conflicts in order to pacify the region. Through this, the DRC could gain peace, Kenya the security of its investments, and the region new economic opportunities. The strategy could also encourage the DRC to further its integration into the EAC without hesitation, because in joining the community, it expects “a real impact on the course of stabilization processes” in its eastern provinces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On an economic level, the benefits for the DRC are rather standard: employment for Congolese and payment of various taxes. For instance, Equity BCDC had 1,713 staff in 2023. Kenyan banks have facilitated the digitization of services and opening of accounts for millions of Congolese, including public servants who are paid by them following an arrangement with the DRC government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the most significant benefit is probably the support banks give to households, individual entrepreneurs, and companies. TMB, in particular, resorts to leasing operations to finance start-ups as well as small and medium companies. Leasing is a method of financing investments that allows a company or an entrepreneur to use the equipment of their choice or a property in return for a monthly charge and to decide at the end of the contract whether to purchase the equipment or property. Another unique mechanism TMB has carried out in the Congolese banking landscape is the offer of life insurance, which partly compensates for the deficits of the Congolese social security system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equity BCDC has been more successful. For example, it acquired the Emmanuel 4 boat company through the financing of the Silimu establishments. The vessel now facilitates maritime transport on Lake Kivu from Goma to Bukavu. Equity BCDC has extended its approach to the grassroots by providing small loans to individuals in the informal small trade to help them survive. It also provides, in compliance with the social responsibility of corporations, socio-financial services such as loans, training, and supervision to young entrepreneurs, particularly in agriculture. Thus, Equity BCDC trained 1,665 farmers in financial education and agricultural entrepreneurship in 2023, and a loan volume of $589,840 was disbursed to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;challenges-and-limitations&quot;&gt;Challenges and Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These benefits, however, are marred by a multitude of factors that inhibit inclusive banking services and regional trade. First, the demand for financing and loans is very high, especially in the extractive industries, trade, and household sectors, and banks cannot serve everyone. As a banker in Kinshasa explained, banks are commercial entities, and any bank exercises caution before carrying out a given financial operation by assessing the cost, profit, and risk. He added that the risks of non-reimbursement are equally very high because of the absence of solid loan guarantees. In 2023, for instance, Equity BCDC canceled around $13 million in outstanding loans to SMEs that were unable to repay on schedule. For the informant, it is up to the DRC government to find alternative solutions for investors, either by providing banks with risk-sharing guarantees or by financing investors directly through its own mechanisms, such as the FPI and the Entrepreneurship Guarantee Fund in the Congo (FOGEC). Banks can strive only to complement these governmental efforts. Equity BCDC is already on this path. It has concluded several partnerships with international development agencies, such as the African Guarantee Fund, the International Finance Corporation, the French Development Agency, and the U.S. Agency for International Development, to improve its financing capacity toward SMEs and receive risk-sharing guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, some investors, entrepreneurs, and traders are reluctant to use available banking services because of expensive charges. In the example of Equity BCDC, an informant in the Goma branch of the Congo Business Federation (FEC) noted that an international transfer of $100,000 could entail, in addition to undue delays, a commission of up to $3,000, which could prompt potential customers to place their money in banks incorporated in Rwanda so as to pay their foreign suppliers at a lower cost. A similar practice, he added, could be observed among small traders who would rather request loans from microfinance institutions and thus avoid unbearable charges for opening bank accounts or withdrawing cash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, banks cannot cover the whole country; therefore, many Congolese do not have access to banking services. In 2022, TMB, for example, reported over 2 million customers, 105 branches, and 3,000 points of sale across 33 cities and 21 of the country’s 26 provinces. Equity BCDC is even absent in the provinces of Maniema (east), former Bandundu (south west), and Equateur (north west). This is due to the size of the country, which encompasses 2.345 million square kilometers and is devoid of essential communication infrastructure that could facilitate access to remote areas. From an economic perspective, banks normally operate in areas that are secure and free from violent armed conflicts, where the market is available and lucrative and therefore does not require excessive further investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these factors and obstacles raise legitimate questions about the prospects of Kenya’s economic initiatives in the DRC. It is particularly necessary to highlight the chance for Kenya to maintain the level of its investments or increase its influence in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;prospects-for-kenyas-economic-influence-in-the-drc&quot;&gt;Prospects for Kenya’s Economic Influence in the DRC&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a net potential for Kenya to gain more influence in the Congolese economy, even if, to date, it is behind the top six DRC trade partners: China, South Africa, the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, Zambia, and Tanzania. Kenya has the advantage of being familiar with the Congolese market in a handful of strategic areas, such as the financial system, and making a profit. There is also the will to expand this experience, as evidenced by newcomers in the Congolese economic landscape. In the banking sector, in particular, Kenya has encountered almost no competition from other EAC member states. Profit may have a multiplying effect because it increases Kenya’s assets and constitutes an incentive for diversifying investments. All this can encourage more Kenyans to do business in the DRC. Kenya will still benefit from a liberal economy and Congolese liberalization policies, which have extended economic opportunities to various areas: mining, energy, agriculture, telecommunications, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are at least two major weaknesses. On one hand, the relative limitation of Kenyan investments to a few strategic areas, as specified above, prevents Kenya from benefiting from other lucrative sectors, including public infrastructure such as roads, hospitals, water supply systems, and housing. Yet these are among the DRC’s priorities according to the 2023–2026 Public Investment Program (PIP). As Kenya is already making significant profit from its economic initiatives in the DRC, its brand image could be tarnished if the Congolese government claims Kenyans care only about their interests and neglect the DRC’s development priorities. As an informant from civil society noted, the trend is almost the same for all EAC partners—that is, the DRC is exploited, either legally, illegally, or through violence, without giving it the slightest chance to recover. Some Western political figures, such as Herman Cohen, have proposed allowing East African countries such as Rwanda to exploit Congolese resources, with the DRC gaining tax payments under the framework of trade and regional economic integration, as well as gaining peace. The public has criticized this role of providing resources and money to other countries, considering it a major obstacle to the DRC’s development. If Kenya wants to make its economic presence more meaningful to the Congolese, it should expand its initiatives to the aforementioned DRC development priorities, and banks could provide financial support. Kenya would thus be on the path of countries such as Uganda, which in 2021 concluded an agreement with the DRC to build the Kasindi-Beni-Butembo and Bunagana-Rutshuru-Goma road sections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, it is worth noting the Congolese administration’s and justice system’s harassment of foreign investors in general and Kenyans in particular. In the example of Equity BCDC, Mr. Jean-Pierre Bemba and others orchestrated a judicial procedure to seize and sell the bank’s headquarters in Kinshasa, claiming a debt of $9 million against Western Union Company, which uses the services of the bank for money transfers. A lawyer based in Kinshasa explained that the claim was related to allegedly false testimonies and cooperation provided by Western Union to the International Criminal Court (ICC) in a case in which Bemba and others were prosecuted for corruptly influencing witnesses. Despite the judgment of the Constitutional Court in November 2022 stopping the seizure—in particular for violating the right to property guaranteed by the Congolese constitution—Bemba and others persisted in trying to sell the bank’s headquarters without having any legally valid title. Even if TMB does not face as much harassment as Equity BCDC, it has reported cases of the tax administration arbitrarily closing its branches in the cities of Mbandaka and Kananga without notice. In fact, tax harassment in terms of the number of levies and the multiple and sometimes irregular collection services is a common concern for Kenyan investors. This raises the question of respect for the rule of law and the fight against corruption as prerequisites for a good business environment in the DRC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are opportunities to improve the situation. First, the DRC government has announced that the 2002 Investment Code will be further modified. This is an opportunity to alleviate taxes on Kenyan companies by expanding the reach of the legislation to currently excluded sectors and other domains that may be of interest to Kenyans: mining and oil, banks, insurance, and other commercial activities. In this regard, support from the National Agency for the Promotion of Investments (ANAPI) in terms of tax exemption and technical assistance for the application of this legislation is likely to push more investors into those sectors and reduce ongoing administrative harassment. Second, if the general cooperation framework agreement concluded between the two countries in 2021 is carried out in good faith, then it may result in a complementary bilateral investment treaty that will provide specific protective measures of a legal, fiscal, judicial, and political nature for investors in the territories of each party beyond the guarantees they hold in accordance with other international and regional instruments. The EAC treaties are among the latter instruments, beginning with the community’s constitutive act, which aims to promote economic integration through “a Customs Union, a Common Market, subsequently a Monetary Union and ultimately a Political Federation.” But the DRC has neither ratified nor implemented these arrangements in its domestic legal order, therefore rendering them inapplicable to citizens of EAC member states. As an informant within the Congolese Ministry of Foreign Trade stated, “DRC is a member of several regional organizations of integration but largely remains outside trade arrangements.” The Congolese government has nevertheless pledged to apply EAC treaties, as it admits that though they do not yet benefit the country, they will make Kenya freer to invest in the DRC thanks to uniform regional rules on the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital and the right of establishment and residence within the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these prospects are realistic and achievable, but they may be compromised if two major threats are not eliminated, the first of which is the insecurity problem due to continued armed conflict in the eastern DRC. No long-term investments can flourish where peace and stability remain elusive. As discussed, Kenya has an interest in contributing to the resolution of these conflicts, which is why it led the EACRF to stop M23 rebels in North Kivu province. However, the mission failed because of various factors, including planning deficits, lack of coordination between troop-contributing states, divergent views and interests, and, chiefly, the DRC government’s ineffectiveness and complacency toward Rwanda and the rebels. The EACRF, whose deployment began in November 2022, was obliged to withdraw as the Congolese government refused to renew its mandate beyond December 8, 2023. It was replaced by the Southern African Development Community’s Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (SAMIDRC). As the lead nation of the EACRF, Kenya suffered a major blow, tarnishing its image among the Congolese people as a DRC ally. This could negatively affect the current economic relationship between the two countries should political and popular perceptions treat Kenya as a hostile country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, another threat is the DRC’s attempt to retreat from the EAC—a subject which has been at the center of public debate since the failure of the EACRF. There is a broad perception that the EAC is useless, and the DRC cannot remain a member while other member states attack it with impunity. In addition, the DRC considers EAC trade arrangements unfavorable, making the country more dependent on foreigners because it largely lacks production capability. Although the population has exerted pressure on the Congolese government, a withdrawal would mean the rejection of economic integration and a return to a variety of drastic trade barriers, including the imposition of visas. This is not in the interest of the population of the eastern DRC, which depends closely on East Africa. This may be the reason why the Congolese government is very cautious about moving in the direction of withdrawal and it is not yet on the official agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;All of these prospects are realistic and achievable, but they may be compromised if two major threats are not eliminated, the first of which is the insecurity problem due to continued armed conflict in the eastern DRC. No long-term investments can flourish where peace and stability remain elusive.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusions-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Conclusions and Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenya has significantly invested in the DRC, even though it is not yet among the top Congolese trade partners (China, South Africa, the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, Zambia, and Tanzania). Its economic initiatives are driven by the fact that Kenya is looking for more markets abroad due to the dynamic, high level of productivity of its local companies and industries. The DRC market is equally large and lucrative, and it is underexploited. Another factor behind Kenya’s continued investments in the DRC is the diplomatic rapprochement between the two countries, as evidenced, mainly, by the conclusion of a general bilateral cooperation framework in 2021 and the admission of the DRC into the EAC in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenya is present in some strategic areas of the Congolese economy, such as the banking, oil, transport, and energy sectors. This gives Kenya economic influence in the DRC. Notably, Kenya has acquired the major banks Equity BCDC and TMB, which are an integral part of Kenyan regional corporations—that is, Equity Group and KCB, respectively. These acquisitions have improved its position as an emerging power within the EAC. Congolese and other investors are already benefiting from their financial services even though these services lack an inclusive character because access is still limited for some, while others avoid banking because of excessive or unbearable charges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chance for Kenya to maintain its position in the DRC or to increase its economic influence will depend on its ability to consolidate its achievements and significantly expand the range of its investments in other lucrative areas that constitute development priorities of the Congolese government—notably, agriculture, mining, and public infrastructure such as roads, hospitals, water supply systems, and housing. It will also depend on the accessibility of the Congolese market in accordance with the principles and objectives of a liberal economy, on how the DRC positions itself toward regional integration within the EAC, the gains it makes in the security arena, and positive perceptions of Kenya as an ally rather than a hostile country undermining the interests of Congolese people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the above, it is appropriate to make the following recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DRC should remain a member of the EAC; ratify, implement, and apply the community’s treaties; and align its domestic legislation to regional legal standards, specifically those related to the EAC’s customs union and common market.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DRC should improve its business climate by reforming its tax system, the investment code, and justice system as a prerequisite for the rule of law and economic prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kenya should establish holistic investment opportunities that not only underpin its ambitions for further economic expansion but also contribute positively to the DRC’s stability outlook.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kenya should develop a stronger bilateral defense and security partnership with the DRC to help the latter rebuild its security sector.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both countries should work together and use the EAC mechanisms to resolve the armed conflicts in the eastern DRC and restore peace and stability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DRC and Kenya should support banks in partnering with development agencies so as to increase their capacity to finance young entrepreneurs and SMEs, as well as to develop reliable risk-sharing guarantees capable of leading to inclusive banking services.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Banks should be interconnected with subsidiaries established in each EAC member state in order to facilitate regional trade, such that any placement or transfer of money is possible in any state on the same account and is considered local to further the free movement of capital.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kenya and the DRC should conclude a bilateral investment treaty complementary to other international and regional arrangements that are binding on trade and business in general.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relations between Kenya and the DRC may still be sustained through robust business partnerships that predate the central African nation’s entry into the EAC. The business community remains an integral part of aligning the economic goals of both countries and building resilient joint activities of mutual benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can continue to complement the Nairobi process, which, with additional political goodwill from members of the regional bloc, is likely to support stabilization efforts in the east. Finally, deployments of the EACRF should be made not only in cases that align with Kenya’s economic interests; this broadening would facilitate more effective responses in the event of subsequent interventions by the EACFR as, for instance, conflict-affected Somalia joins the EAC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these findings, the following recommendations are put forward:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The EAC should continue to prioritize peace and security initiatives to stabilize the DRC, which will consolidate investments and promote trade and economic stability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The EAC Secretariat should expedite the implementation of the road map in order to streamline relations and the adoption of outstanding administrative issues.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The regional force should be depoliticized and provided with a clearer mandate that addresses the real needs and aspirations of the populations to prevent the pitfalls of mistrust that undermine peace and stability initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the foreseeable future, however, as a community, the EAC will remain fragmented due to the competing ambitions of political leaders and countries. Conflicts in the region pit EAC members against each other, with the interests of local elites taking precedence over economic integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑文章稱：「將來修訂了『逃犯條例』還可以隨時拉你鎖你，多神奇的權力」，是毫無根據的說法，只是基於黎的個人感受，目的是引起讀者恐懼。黎堅稱有合理理由作為根據。控方又指，文章有意激起香港居民間的不滿；黎否認，重申只是講述自己的感受。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑黎嘗試向讀者散播其主觀感受-黎否認發自內心撰文&quot;&gt;控方質疑黎嘗試向讀者散播其主觀感受 黎否認：發自內心撰文&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指文章稱：「冰封三尺非一日之寒，特首高官對我們蔑視的態度，是在京官對香港人的厭惡和摒棄心態的薰陶下，不由自主的條件反射」，是黎的個人偏見、主觀判斷和感受，又質疑黎嘗試將這種感受向廣大讀者散播。黎則否認，強調自己無論撰寫任何文章，均是發自內心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文章提到：「我們都心中有數，特首高官那種不屑我們的輕蔑態度，正反映出中央對香港人的態度；大把大陸人等着來香港，你們香港人這麼麻煩，早走早着好了。在他們心中我們早已被放棄，想你走之心形諸於色，對你棄如敝屣便蔑視你。蔑視往往是令人絕望的心理因素。」控方質疑這是黎的主觀判斷、個人感受，而他想想向讀者散播這種感受。黎否認，重申文章所述是發自其內心，他亦否認有意使讀者有相同感受。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑黎誇大議題的迫切性鼓吹讀者行動&quot;&gt;控方質疑黎誇大議題的迫切性、鼓吹讀者行動&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文章指：「為甚麼我們要出來遊行？因為行動才有效果，反對的文字和反對的聲音抽象得只會一瞬即過。」、「從以上實例證明，若然我們只是在聲音或文字上提出反對，林鄭和高官只會堅持自己對『逃犯條例』的成見。不過，若我們人多勢眾站出來遊行，無論他們多機心叵測，亦要面對我們堅決反對惡法的事實，他們可能會畏縮而妥協。我們不能放棄讓他們看到為了保衛家園，我們會去到盡，堅決抗爭到底的事實。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指黎鼓吹讀者行動？黎稱只是鼓吹市民出來示威，而示威也屬於一種行動。控方提及黎早前供稱「行動勝於空談」；黎回應他只是想市民出來示威，以保護自己的家園。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指黎在文中稱：「難道不值得你們為他們作最後努力」，是誇大議題的迫切性。黎否認誇大迫切性，強調只是呼籲人們出來遊行保護家園。控方指黎嘗試激起市民對政府的敵意及引起憎恨；黎否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑，黎在文章中未有提及任何建設性的對話。黎稱：「因為沒有任何具建設性的對話，我怎樣提及？」杜官追問黎同意還是不同意？黎稱不同意。控方最後指文章意圖引起對政府憎恨、藐視和不滿；黎一概否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎批評控方案情與事實無關屬想像-官提醒只需回答同意與否&quot;&gt;黎批評控方案情與事實無關、屬「想像」 官提醒只需回答同意與否&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示2020年4月26日黎的專欄文章〈專橫暴政打壓 我們氣魄不滅〉，當中稱：「中共出擊撕掉《基本法》，摧殘香港一國兩制特別行政區地位。沒有釋法權利的港澳辦和中聯辦高調曲線釋法，稱兩辦並非《基本法》22條所指的一般意義上的『中央人民政府所屬各部門』，公然向港府奪權。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑「撕掉《基本法》」和「高調曲線釋法」等，並沒有官方說法支持或任何事實基礎，只是黎的意見。控方指文章意圖引起市民憎恨特區和中央政府，以及激使香港居民循非法手段改變現有合法制度。黎批評這是控方的「想像」，並且不能同意他的「想像」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方籲黎只需要回答同意或不同意，以免浪費法庭時間。黎反指：「可是如果你能夠說事實，也可以令事情更加簡單。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此時，法官杜麗冰打斷，重申控方必須向黎指出其案情，這是控方的職責，若黎不同意便回答不同意，毋須與控方爭辯。黎則反問，如果控方的案情與事實沒有關係，為什麼要花時間逐一提問？杜官重申控方必須逐一指出其案情，可能黎有點欠缺耐性。此時黎插口說他並非欠缺耐性，只是控方的案情與事實無關；杜官隨即提高聲量，嚴正地表示：「如果他（控方）的提問與事實沒有關係的話，我會制止他」，並重申控方有權履行他的職責，而黎只需直接回答同意與否。黎聽罷問，他是否有權向控方提問作出質疑？杜官則指黎無權質疑，籲黎毋須與控方爭辯，以節省法庭時間。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認其文章煽動暴力-反指和理非是最具力量&quot;&gt;黎否認其文章煽動暴力 反指「和理非」是最具力量&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎的文章稱：「今日我們明知有事，中共打到嚟必然大清算大清洗，清算不聽話的人，清洗英國殖民地遺留下來保護港人自由的法治和機制，把香港人變成任由習帝擺佈的奴才，因此我們會繼續起來抗爭到底，希望趁習帝內外危機四伏，和慘遭武漢肺炎瘟疫人命摧殘和經濟淪陷後，各國尤其美國向中國責難及局部制裁，迫使中共不敢太明目張膽，暫時克制對香港的迫害⋯⋯」控方問黎是否提倡制裁？黎確認，並表示當時一廂情願地認為美國會向中國責難及局部制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文章又稱：「中共最怕也最難克服的是香港龐大的人民力量，這些溫和但大多數的市民，是我們整個逆權運動最強大的力量，若被嚇怕不敢再出來示威遊行，剩下屬於小撮的勇武派便容易處理了。和理非的大部份香港人抗爭意志被嚇窒了，小撮的勇武派便失去了市民眾志成城的維護和支持，衝擊暴力的士氣和勇氣被削弱，中共便輕易制服這幫人，我們整個運動儘管不是完結，也畫上休止符了。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在盤問下，黎確認他希望運動繼續下去，但強調「和理非」示威者才是最有力量。控方問黎是否不想勇武派被制服？黎則澄清，其文章是說不想「和理非」被制服，使勇武派也被制服。控方指黎意圖鼓吹市民使用暴力。黎反問：「我說非暴力是最有力量，你怎樣可以詮釋為暴力？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，文章意圖引起市民憎恨政府、引起香港居民間的不滿或離叛，以及引起或加深香港不同階層居民間的惡感及敵意。黎一概否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指slack部份群組相隔多月不見飯盒會會議重點&quot;&gt;控方指Slack部份群組相隔多月不見「飯盒會」會議重點&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，控方續就通訊軟件 Slack 群組紀錄提問，並向黎智英出示其帳戶版面，顯示當中8個群組，包括「港蘋online對話」、「港蘋報紙對話」、「港蘋online news對話」、「香港蘋果紙主管」、「港蘋online中層」「港蘋video talk」、「港蘋深化內容」和「港蘋紙廣告」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在庭上曾供稱，每星期輪流與其中一個部門舉行「飯盒會」，由於一共有8個部門，因此每個部門相隔兩個月才有一次「飯盒會」。然而控方指從黎的 Slack 紀錄中，各部門並非相隔兩個月便有一次「飯盒會」紀錄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方先展示「香港蘋果紙主管」群組對話。黎稱群組被創立是為了「特別目的」，因當時《蘋果》正籌備推動訂閱，而訂閱牽涉各個部門的主管，因此需要將不同部門主管加入群組。法官李運騰問及，訂閱是網上訂閱還是報紙訂閱？黎指是網上訂閱。法官杜麗冰問，那麼為什麼需要所有部門的主管加入群組？黎指因為所有部門都牽涉新聞內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提到，時任執行總編輯林文宗的訊息與網上訂閱無關。黎則重申，改善內容質素與訂閱有關，以吸引讀者訂閱。黎並確認沒有獨立記憶，若然缺乏紀錄的話，便記不起「飯盒會」討論過什麼內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著展示「港蘋online中層」群組，創立於2019年3月6日，在同年3月12日之後便再沒有新訊息。黎稱該群組是用來與中層職員討論商業計劃，並非一個獨立的部門，所以沒有恆常召開「飯盒會」，但是曾經舉行會議討論訂閱計劃，惟黎稱已不記得會議內容。法官李素蘭指從群組中看不到任何會議重點的紀錄。黎則稱不知道為何群組有一段長時間沒有任何訊息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指，部份訊息下方顯示曾經「修改（edited）」，而黎就著訊息的回覆也未能看到。黎一概表示不知道原因，又指負責截圖的人可能他們未有替他的回覆截圖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎供稱，只有可執行的提議才會被紀錄在會議重點之中，當討論有成果的時候，便有可執行的提議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，從「港蘋online對話」紀錄可見，在2019年10月至2020年1月，這大約10個月之間，並沒有任何「飯盒會」的會議紀錄，問黎知不知道原因。黎稱不知道。控方又舉例指，從「香港蘋果紙主管」群組對話可見，從2019年2至9月期間沒有任何「飯盒會」會議紀錄，中間相隔了7個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問黎，是否有可能在相關時段曾經舉行「飯盒會」但是未有紀錄會議重點？黎不認為有這個可能性，因為會議必定能得出可執行的提議，「不能想像在整個會議期間，沒有任何可執行的提議。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件押後至下周一（24日）早上續審，然而當日下午，黎將在法庭內、在法官不在席之下檢視涉案文章，以紀錄是否曾經閱讀過該些文章。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;黎智英：愛國教育實為「洗腦」、灌輸階級鬥爭仇恨 官質疑以多年前往事作根據&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，今（19日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第135日審訊，黎智英第43日作供。控方就黎的專欄文章〈2020年和勇一起撐下去〉提問，質疑黎指控警員喬裝黑衣人破壞店舖，是意圖引起讀者對警察的憎恨；又質疑黎未有在文章中譴責暴力。黎否認引起憎恨；雖然他未有直接譴責暴力，但也未有鼓吹暴力，又稱他在文章中質疑「裝修」的黑衣人是否「我們的勇武手足」，是「間接譴責」暴力。另外，文章稱：「這場逆權運動正促使中共加強對學生換頭洗腦」，控方質疑黎毫無根據地作出揣測。黎否認揣測，並指透過教育來迫人愛國是錯誤的，因這是將國家置於人民之上，猶如「將僕人置於主人之上」，是顛倒真理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎沒有人認為叫喊光時是錯-惟因為政府後來變成是錯的&quot;&gt;黎：沒有人認為叫喊「光時」是錯 惟因為政府後來變成是錯的&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方向黎出示2020年1月5日黎專欄文章〈2020年和勇一起撐下去〉。在盤問下，黎解釋他對「勇武派」的理解，他認為「勇武派」是出現在示威前線的人士，但是不一定所有「勇武派」都會做出暴力行為，例如當中有的人只是參與暴動，但是沒有做出暴力行為，當警察來到時，他們便立即跑到後方，那些便是「非暴力的勇武派」。而黎視自己為「非暴力」及「和平」。法官李素蘭問到，勇武派是年輕人嗎？黎同意，指他們是「渴求變革的年輕人（Young Turk）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文章提到，黎看到一個十四、五歲戴口罩的少女，大喊：「黑警死全家！」和「香港差佬，X你老母」，他當時對何俊仁說：「有這樣的後生，我哋冇得輸。」黎並在文中稱：「有這樣疾惡如仇的優秀勇敢年輕人，香港真是塊福地。」黎在庭上表示，當時被運動的氛圍影響和誤導，「我認為這個回應是低俗的（bad taste），而我感到後悔。」黎又稱，他不同意「黑警死全家」和「香港差佬，X你老母」這兩句口號，認為這是低俗（cheap）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/yowaO7Q.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎支持另一句口號「光復香港 時代革命」嗎？黎重申未有思考過，因這是一個普遍的口號，當時很多人叫喊。法官杜麗冰質疑，黎是參與遊行的其中一員，在現場聽到有人叫喊這個口號，怎麼會未曾思考過支持與否呢？黎則稱因為這口號在當時是很普遍，反問：「為什麼我要思考（支持與否）呢？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方則指黎其實是有思考過，因他的文章提及過「光復香港，時代革命」，所以必定在他的腦海之中。黎則回應：「你可以充當心理學家，但是我不同意。」黎又指，他未有想過這句口號是對或是錯，「因為政府，它後來變成是錯的，但是當時而言沒有人認為它是錯。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問黎是否支持「光時」，黎否認。控方又問在國安法之後，黎是否繼續支持「光時」？黎亦否認，並指認為它是違法的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;文章懷疑警方喬裝黑衣人-控方意圖引起對警察憎恨&quot;&gt;文章懷疑警方喬裝黑衣人 控方：意圖引起對警察憎恨&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提到，黎在文章中指：「我不知道『裝修』匯豐銀行的黑衣人是否我們的勇武手足，但是打爆中國人壽店舖玻璃的兩位黑衣人便甚有可疑。」控方問黎為何稱呼該些人為「勇武手足」？黎稱因為他們也在同一場運動中，這是自己稱呼他們的方式。控方問：「因為你是勇武隊的一份子？」黎回應：「你知道我不是勇武隊的一份子。」法官李運騰問，根據文章標題「和勇一起撐下去」，黎是否想團結不同群體的人？黎同意。控方追問，黎是否將自己與勇武派聯繫起來？黎否認，重申這是他稱呼同樣參與運動的人士。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方引述文章指，有人質疑兩名打爆中國人壽店舖玻璃的黑衣人是喬裝警員，「若然這推斷屬實，警方的目的便是要製造暴亂，藉此行使警暴恐嚇和理非遊行人士，使他們以後再不敢出來遊行，曲線鎮壓我們的遊行人數，削弱我們的抗爭聲勢，令抗爭運動逐漸凋零。」黎在庭上稱，他只是提出問題，從沒說過他肯定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，從文章中似乎看不到任何譴責暴力？黎則稱他對於暴力抱負面態度，所以才會問「裝修」匯豐銀行的黑衣人是否「勇武手足」。李官質疑，因為黎希望避免批評「裝修」匯豐銀行的黑衣人？黎稱他只是引述其他人所說的話，那些黑衣人可能是喬裝警員。李官問，所以黎是基於其他人的言論，而不是自己耳聞目睹？黎確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方遂指，黎在文章中作出猜測和揣測，嘗試指控警察喬裝示威者以製造暴亂。黎否認作出猜測和揣測，稱只是引述新聞報導所述情況，並且只是提出疑問。控方又指，黎有意圖引起讀者對警察憎恨。黎亦否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎強調文章只是反映市民情感警民關係差&quot;&gt;黎強調文章只是反映市民情感、警民關係差&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，黎在文章中使用「裝修」一詞來形容破壞店舖的行為，是採用了勇武派的語言，黎這樣做是為了證明自己是勇武派的一份子。法官杜麗冰亦指，文章予人印象黎是支持「勇武手足」，對於匯豐銀行被破壞使用「裝修」一詞，因為黎懷疑這是否喬裝警員所為，然而對於中國人壽店舖玻璃被破壞，黎則使用不同的言詞，問黎是否同意？黎僅稱，他認為破壞匯豐是負面、不好的事情，所以提問這是否「勇武手足」所做的。杜官反駁指，黎僅形容「裝修」匯豐銀行，對有關行為不具批判性。黎則堅稱他在文章中以負面的方式提問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官提到文章指「當然這是以奸人之心度警察之腹的陰謀論，但事到如今，我們若仍未認定警方是謊言和陰謀氾濫的奸人精，就真有點天真無邪了吧。」李官問這是否黎當時的結論？黎回答：「在當時，是的。」控方問，黎認為警是「謊言和陰謀氾濫」嗎？黎確認。控方指，黎透過這文章意圖引起對警方的憎恨。黎否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎的文章續指：「事到如今，警察殘害市民的暴戾，已使他們成為市民面對的最大的敵人。最初我們的口號是『香港人加油』，然後是『香港人反抗』，現在惡化到有些人叫喊『香港人報仇』，當然仇恨不可取，卻令我們知道警民關係惡化到甚麼程度。」黎稱以上是當時香港人主要情感，他認為仇恨當然是不好，但是顯示到當時警民關係有多麼差，強調上文只是反映市民的情感。控方問，這些是市民的情感，而市民又是否包括黎？黎否認有這樣的想法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，黎的文章提到爭取特赦被捕示威者能夠「團結前線的手足」。黎表示認同。控方質疑黎的文章未有譴責暴力。黎則堅稱，他沒有譴責暴力，同時也沒有鼓吹暴力，並且對於破壞店舖的行為抱持負面看法；他對於破壞者的身份有懷疑，某程度上也是對暴力的「間接譴責」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎所謂的愛國教育其實是洗腦&quot;&gt;黎：所謂的「愛國教育」其實是「洗腦」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方引述文章指：「教育是我們今後抗爭重要的戰場。中共將這場抗爭運動的責任推到教育制度上，把教育界變成政府施政失當的代罪羔羊。⋯⋯是的，這場逆權運動正促使中共加強對學生換頭洗腦，教育局長楊潤雄已對教育界文革式施壓亮劍，明言學校認為涉事（反送中）教師『沒有問題』，學校、校長的態度立場就可能『有問題』，如果覺得校長不能勝任，可以取消其校長資格。中共加強對學生換頭洗腦已然啟動，我們不能讓中共發動文化大革命式的破壞，摧毀我們原有的教育價值觀和文化。對每一位教師和校長因言入罪，我們和勇派必須挺身而出，嚴正反抗。」控方質疑這是黎的揣測。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎則反駁指這不是揣測，因時任教育局局長楊潤雄說過，那些認為教師參與「反送中」是沒有問題的學校和校長，才是有問題的。黎又表示，他認為所謂的「愛國教育」其實是「洗腦過程」，因為當愛國是出於自願的時候才是高尚，但若然是透過教育來強加於人，便是錯誤的，因為這是將國家置於人民之上，猶如「將僕人置於主人之上」，是顛倒真理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，楊潤雄的言論並未提及中共，質疑黎作出揣測。黎同意是揣測。控方續指黎意圖引起市民對政府的憎恨。黎表示：「我沒有引起仇恨，我不同意。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官提到，文章稱：「中共的換頭洗腦教育灌輸的是階級鬥爭的仇恨和邪惡。」李官問黎是否指稱中共透過洗腦教育來灌輸階級鬥爭的仇恨和邪惡？黎同意，並稱這是根據他在中國內地的親身經驗，他認為這是在中國可能發生的事情。法官杜麗冰指，但是這已是很多年前的往事，問黎怎能以那麼多年前的事作為根據？李官問黎是否指六十年代？黎確認。控方問黎是否想向讀者散播這種情感？黎稱只是想讀者警覺有可能發生什麼事情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指黎有意藉文章引起市民對香港及中央政府的憎恨、藐視及不滿。黎表示：「完全不同意。」控方又指，文章有意激使市民以非法手段改變現有政制、引起居民間的不滿、煽動市民使用暴力以及不守法。黎一概不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指出，在2019至2020年間，黎從沒有譴責示威者的暴力行為，是因為想運動繼續下去，又指黎希望運動能維持某程度上的暴力，以免失去國際支持。黎一概否認，重申他反對暴力的原因是不想破壞運動的道德高地，影響國際社會的支持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑李怡文章提倡dq主任應被制裁&quot;&gt;控方質疑李怡文章提倡「DQ主任」應被制裁&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示《蘋果》全版廣告「誰殺死 他 她 他 和 她 ……」、2019年10月7日報導〈壹週刊：女示威者警署內遭折磨叉頸掂胸侮辱阻瞓覺〉和2020年10月25日社評〈蘋論：警暴消失的「太平日子」將來臨（古立）〉。黎均稱不認為或不記得曾看過，控方遂未有繼續提問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著問黎有否閱讀已故作家李怡所撰寫的社評。黎稱很少，又指李不是那種會談論國際議題的作家。控方指，黎一直以來爭取懲罰侵犯人權的官員，有關國際的文章不會引起黎的興趣嗎？黎稱這不代表他要閱讀所有文章，否則他會很忙碌。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方遂展示李怡的專欄文章〈夜行人吹口哨〉，刊登於2020年8月10日。文章提及8月7日美國宣布制裁11名中港官員，當晚「不僅11人及其家人睡不著，恐怕一些追隨者，一些做了昧著良心事情的人也睡不著」，並舉例指「DQ主任，作惡黑警，港大校委會18名成員」等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指黎在美國宣布制裁翌日（即8月8日）發布Twitter帖文：「那些取消候選人資格的選舉主任又如何呢？他們應該在個人方面為這些決定負責任嗎？（How about those election officers (選舉主任) who disqualified #DQ the candidate nominations? Should they be personally responsible for making the decisions?）」，而李怡在文中亦有提及「DQ主任」，是否與黎的帖文想法一致，即是提倡「DQ主任」理應被制裁？黎則稱他的帖文是指「選舉主任」，而不是「DQ主任」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指slack群組有的訊息被刪除&quot;&gt;控方指Slack群組有的訊息被刪除&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方較早前呈上通訊軟件Slack的《蘋果》員工群組紀錄，惟控方爭議相關紀錄的真實性和完整性。控方向黎展示多項群組對話，當中顯示有的訊息被刪除。惟黎稱未有為意，也不知道誰人刪除。他稱控方的問題屬技術性問題，而他無法解答。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認曾向張劍虹提及邀請美國退休軍官jack-keane擔任直播節目嘉賓&quot;&gt;黎否認曾向張劍虹提及邀請美國退休軍官Jack Keane擔任直播節目嘉賓&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行就網上節目「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」提問。時任《蘋果》社長張劍虹曾供稱，黎向他提及邀請到美國退休軍官 Jack Keane 擔任節目嘉賓，張當時表達憂慮，惟黎回應：「佢哋（中共）咁搞我，我一定去到盡㗎，我冇得褪㗎。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎今在庭上重申，他從沒有向張談及 Jack Keane 及其他朋友，他有可能在其他場合說過上述說話，但是並非關於 Jack Keane。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎堅稱除張志偉外-其他蘋果高層沒參與製作live-chat節目&quot;&gt;黎堅稱除張志偉外 其他《蘋果》高層沒參與製作Live Chat節目&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提到，黎早前供稱「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」是他的個人節目，與《蘋果日報》無關，然而控方展示一連串訊息反駁說法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其中2020年5月30日的訊息，時任動新聞總監張志偉在群組中交代 Live Chat 的製作安排，提及黎將會在節目中與外國讀者互動，顯示節目並非只是關於黎一個人。黎則堅稱節目是其個人節目。此外，張劍虹在群組中表達對於國安法的憂慮；黎則稱這是張自己的憂慮。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰指，從訊息可見，《蘋果》管理層似乎參與在節目製作，例如張志偉制訂執行計劃並向群組交代。黎同意張參與其中，但是其他管理層並沒有參與。法官李素蘭又質疑，若然節目是黎的個人節目，為何張志偉會說他們會將直播片段發布在黎的 Twitter 帳戶上，而不是由黎的「徒弟」李兆富做這件事。黎則稱李兆富僅負責 Twitter 帖文，然而這是直播節目。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎又指，因為他使用《蘋果》及其職員，所以才會在群組中交代節目安排，讓其他管理層知道。他重申，只有張志偉及另外2名職員參與節目，張劍虹則只是表達關注，而其他管理層則只是被通知。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訊息指目的是和外國讀者互動控方可見節目與蘋果有關&quot;&gt;訊息指「目的是和外國讀者互動」控方：可見節目與《蘋果》有關&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示2020年7月2日的訊息，張志偉在群組中提及 Twitter Live 將於7月9日早上開始做，「目的是和外國讀者互動，打國際線，宣傳英文版蘋果」，控方指這顯示直播乃與《蘋果》有關？黎則稱是他與讀者互動，而非《蘋果》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指，張志偉的訊息指「老闆話題會圍繞港版國安法」，是否張提出建議？黎則稱原本是自己提出，而不是張。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，2020年7月6日，張志偉向群組傳送一系列宣傳 Live Chat 的連結。至7月7日，黎與張志偉透過訊息溝通，當中提到黎的私人公司職員 Lucia 提議的話題。惟黎稱觀眾的提問才是節目的「話題」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方黎以蘋果twitter帳戶錄製直播&quot;&gt;控方：黎以《蘋果》Twitter帳戶錄製直播&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，首次 Twitter Live 是在7月9日播出。當日時任英文版主筆馮偉光（筆名盧峯）和張劍虹分別在英文版群組中，表達對節目的意見，其中馮指節目猶如「獨白」。黎其後回應，提議日後節目可以邀請外國學者對談。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，其後第二至四次直播分別在7月17日、7月23日及7月30日進行，期間訊息顯示黎獲告知所有流程安排、由職員 Lucia 準備的問題、推送通知（push notifications）和直播畫面截圖等，可見節目涉及《蘋果》。黎同意，但補充 Lucia 並非《蘋果》的職員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，張志偉在7月30日向黎傳送首四次直播的觀看次數，並指第四次（即7月30日）直播的觀看次數增加，因為黎的個人 Twitter 帳戶轉發了該次直播。控方指從中可見直播是使用《蘋果》的 Twitter 帳戶錄製，而黎直到第四次才予以轉載。黎稱不知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎指蘋果管理層協助節目技術層面-但堅稱live-chat屬其個人節目&quot;&gt;黎指《蘋果》管理層協助節目技術層面 但堅稱Live Chat屬其個人節目&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示張志偉於2020年11月17日的訊息，告知黎將會邀請以色列前副總理夏蘭斯基出席Live Chat 節目。控方指，節目無論從製作、宣傳以至準備展示，全都由《蘋果》員工負責，並且涉及《蘋果》的資源，而這也是《蘋果》管理層之間的共識。黎則稱共識只限於在英文版群組裡的管理層。控方續指，Live Chat 其實屬於《蘋果》的節目。惟黎堅稱：「這是我的節目」，而《蘋果》使用它及支持它。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問及，《蘋果》的管理層是否同意協助黎製作節目，而黎同意他們將節目上載至《蘋果》的平台？黎同意。控方指，由此可見，Live Chat 節目的確與《蘋果》管理層有關。黎指他們的確有參與和涉及節目的技術層面，但是黎堅稱這是他的個人節目。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 2019年7月1日示威者佔領立法會（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎佔立會示威者僅破壞具象徵性物品-作為抗議政府姿態&quot;&gt;黎：佔立會示威者僅破壞具象徵性物品 作為抗議政府姿態&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，2019年7月1日示威者闖進立法會之後，張志偉向黎傳送數張相關照片。黎同意該些是示威者作出的暴力行為。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提及黎於2019年7月10日在美國出席「保衛民主基金會」（Foundation for Defense of Democracies，簡稱FDD）的對談講座。期間黎形容示威者破壞了一些東西，但是造成的破壞是很小，加上破壞的手法是作為抗議政府的象徵式姿態，這不是破壞的意圖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑黎聲稱示威者沒有意圖破壞的說法。黎則解釋，示威者是有意圖破壞，但是相關意圖並非純粹破壞，而是作為一個抗議政府的象徵，大樓內亦有很多東西沒有被破壞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎將佔領立會事件形容為沒有意圖，因為黎想令事件聽起來沒那麼暴力，以避免失去國際支持。黎則稱講座上的言論只是反映他對形勢的判斷。法官杜麗冰指，黎叫陳梓華聯絡勇武派，希望他們平息暴力，黎亦不希望香港失去國際支持，並且減低事件的暴力程度，「這不是你會下意識地做的事嗎？」黎則稱當時只是道出事實，又重申示威者並沒有觸碰任何貴重的物品，只是破壞一些具象徵性的物品，例如塗污往屆立法會主席的相片、打破玻璃和塗鴉口號等，作為抗議政府。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問，黎認同示威者這樣做嗎？黎否認。控方又問，黎想市民同情示威者？黎同意，又表示：「我認為這是暴力行為，但不是極端暴力。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱不認同勇武派受訪言論-但允許蘋果發布報導&quot;&gt;黎稱不認同勇武派受訪言論 但允許《蘋果》發布報導&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示2019年10月9日的《蘋果》報導〈和變勇 「是政權，迫我進化」〉，內容提及兩名本來是「和理非」的示威者，受訪稱因為政府不回應訴求及警察暴力執法，而逐漸變成「勇武」示威者。當中一條副標題為「最初怕犯法 現在不怕死」，控方問黎是否欲透過報導來激使讀者使用暴力和憎恨政府？黎否認，稱這只是一篇訪問。控方問，《蘋果》是否支持受訪者觀點？黎否認，強調《蘋果》發布訪問不代表就支持相關觀點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又提到，報紙版面上方的橫條有「官迫民反」四字，問《蘋果》是否認同相關觀點？黎稱同意。至於他本人是否認同，黎則稱沒有思考過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示2019年11月15日報導〈屠龍隊邊緣呼喚全民勇武／三罷〉，提及：「四名屠龍成員接受《蘋果》專訪，認為要緩解前線壓力甚至取得勝利，必須在全民勇武或全民三罷中二擇其一。」黎稱文章僅報導受訪者所說的言論，作為傳媒只是訪問及反映受訪者的說法，而讀者自有他們的判斷。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提到其中一張相片為四名受訪者的合照，下方含有描述：「8月初屠龍隊才成軍，是真正走在最前線、無畏無懼的示威者。」控方質疑《蘋果》有意美化「屠龍隊」；黎否認美化，並堅稱只是描述他們是誰，沒有鼓吹任何東西。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在盤問下，黎表示同意「三罷」，但他不認同受訪者提議「必須在全民勇武或全民三罷中二擇其一」，並表示：「我認為這是有點兒瘋狂。」控方質疑，黎沒有要求員工不要發布報導，並允許他們發布一些他不認同的內容？黎確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑，黎沒有叫受訪者不要使用暴力，再者《蘋果》有他們的聯絡方法，可是黎卻沒有要求員工聯絡他們、籲他們停止使用暴力。黎則稱他沒有受訪者的聯絡方法，而且他沒有責任在每次訪問中勸說他們。控方質疑，黎早前卻要求陳梓華聯絡勇武派以平息暴力？黎指因為陳屬於勇武派的群體之中。控方指，黎透過《蘋果》來煽惑人們使用暴力。黎表示：「完全不同意。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/8yU4CDI.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑黎沒譴責暴力-黎認沒譴責暴力-但認為暴力應該受控&quot;&gt;控方質疑黎沒譴責暴力 黎認沒譴責暴力 但認為暴力應該受控&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方繼續向黎出示2019年12月24日其個人專欄文章〈我們堅持下去才有希望〉，當中提及：「那天跟陳日君樞機談起，他說要避免滲透，勇武派是時候組織領袖團隊，有了領袖團隊便有了原則和勇武的底線，滲透者的過激行動便輕易被揭發，因而想利用我們的運動作為權鬥的彈藥就難以得逞。勇武的手足們，請考慮一下陳樞機的意見。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑，從上文可見，黎並不只是想減弱示威者暴力，而是希望勇武派組織領袖團隊，使他們能夠維持某程度的暴力。黎否認這樣說過。控方追問，但是黎沒有譴責過暴力？黎同意他沒有譴責過暴力，但是他認為暴力應該受控。控方續指，黎並沒有說過要停止暴力。黎則稱他說過需要底線。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，若果黎直接籲「停止暴力」，不是更加簡單嗎？黎則稱這樣說的話不會有效，勇武派不會聆聽。控方指，黎乃希望示威者能繼續以暴力的方法示威。黎重申他是希望勇武派有領袖團隊，訂立原則和底線。控方指黎的意思是認同以暴力手段示威，但是暴力程度應是受控的？黎回答，至少是受控的程度，而不是超越界限。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提議，黎有意透過文章來煽惑其他人使用暴力。黎否認，又指從文章中看不到任何關於煽惑暴力的內容，批評控方：「你編造故事。」控方代表周天行則說，重點不是他有沒有編造故事，而是黎需要基於問題而直接回答同意或不同意，以免浪費法庭時間。黎聽罷反駁：「我認為你最好不要透過編造故事來浪費法庭時間。」控方接著反駁時，法官李運騰打斷，指應交由法庭作出相關判斷。控方最後指出，黎藉文章引起市民對政府的憎恨、藐視和不滿。黎不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;散庭前，李官問及控方盤問進度。周天行表示對於盤問能夠在3月中完成感到樂觀，又稱有可能提早完成。李官表示很高興聽到控方這樣說。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one of its final acts, the Biden administration introduced what may be the most ambitious exercise of technological statecraft in modern history—the Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion (AI Diffusion Rule). What was once a simple line drawn around China and a small handful of countries has turned into a sweeping, interventionist framework that dictates not just who can import advanced semiconductors and how many, but where they can be deployed, under what conditions they must be secured, and even how AI capabilities can be shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;unpacking-the-us-calculus&quot;&gt;Unpacking the U.S. Calculus&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some ways, the framework is a carefully modulated equation, attempting to balance multiple, often competing variables in a single formula. On the one hand, the United States needs to prevent the diversion of advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) to China, increasingly through third countries, to ensure that China never reaches escape velocity in the AI race. DeepSeek may have tilted the board, but the equation holds—China still faces stubborn compute bottlenecks in inference scaling and deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the exponential growth in compute demand makes it neither practical nor expedient to limit AI infrastructure to U.S. soil. American and allied firms must expand overseas, but every new deployment introduces an additional vector for diversion. This tension is further complicated by market dynamics. U.S. and allied hyperscalers and neocloud providers operate on economic logic, not national security priorities. They will naturally gravitate toward locations where power is cheap, infrastructure hurdles are minimal, and financial incentives sweeten the deal. But for the United States, these same AI-friendly jurisdictions may not always be reliably aligned with its priorities, nor can they be easily insulated from Beijing’s reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-three-tiered-framework-first-class-coach-and-no-ticket&quot;&gt;The Three-Tiered Framework: First-Class, Coach, and No Ticket&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AI Diffusion Rule introduces a three-tiered framework for AI access. Tier 1 (T1) countries ride first-class, with near-frictionless access to advanced GPUs. Tier 2 (T2) nations, by contrast, are stuck in coach—allowed on the train but kept at a distance from the front cabin—facing strict caps on GPU access. This is an admission of the practical limits of enforcement. Rather than trying to police every node, the rule seeks instead to depressurize the flow of compute globally so there is less surplus floating around that could eventually find its way to China. T2 companies that sever supply chain ties with China and meet stringent compliance standards, however, can import and deploy more GPUs. Together, these controls aim to funnel advanced GPUs into narrow, auditable corridors. The stated objective, however, is clear: to keep T2 countries at least a generation behind the frontier, which the rule defines as 10²⁶ FLOP—an order of magnitude beyond the current capability threshold of 10²⁵ FLOP, where models like GPT-4, Gemini 1 Ultra, and Claude 3 Opus operate. In other words, an upgrade to business class is possible, but first-class is off-limits. Meanwhile, Tier 3 (T3) countries like China are left on the platform, locked out entirely, forced to find their own slower track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-firewall-with-no-backdoors-a-full-stack-approach-to-diversion&quot;&gt;A Firewall with No Backdoors: A Full-Stack Approach to Diversion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States is also taking a full-stack approach to preventing diversion. The framework goes beyond physical hardware controls to close gaps in cloud computing access and cyber theft of model weights, which are the final mathematical parameters that encode an AI system’s learned capabilities. It is not just about controlling where compute flows, but ensuring that wherever it is deployed, it remains securely barricaded and tethered to U.S. regulatory oversight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-collateral-damage-on-allies-and-partners&quot;&gt;The Collateral Damage on Allies and Partners&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AI Diffusion Rule is a technocratic tour de force, but at what cost? Observers tend to stall on the obvious, first-order questions. Can Huawei and domestic firms backfill for NVIDIA? Not in the short term. Huawei remains at least one to two generations behind both in GPU performance and fabrication capacity. Will frontline NATO allies like Poland and the Baltic states feel slighted? Yes, and bitterly so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while the first cracks are easy to spot, the real risk is what follows. How will T2 countries metabolize the rule, adapt to its constraints, and respond in the long run? Countries have now seen the U.S. export control regime grow by the better part of a thousand pages over 30 months and witnessed the once modest and polite fiction of “small yard, high fence” turn into a global regulatory ordinance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, where countries once abided the mailed fist when it was directed against China, they may now recalculate, recognizing that the same grip, once reassuringly distant, can just as easily tighten around their own throats. Well-capitalized AI aspirants in T2 will bristle at the fact that their AI ambitions depend on Washington’s goodwill and that they are being deliberately kept a generation behind the frontier. The presumption that they will meekly accept dependency or permanent subordination is naive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The default assumption is that T2 countries will either seek to climb into T1 or drift into China’s orbit. They will of course attempt the former. Political opportunism demands nothing less. But this binary framing overlooks a third, and perhaps more disruptive, possibility: A bloc of T2 nations may collectively chart a “Third Way,” not to rival U.S. technological primacy, but to carve out a functional, mid-tier AI stack that provides sufficient strategic autonomy. “De-risking” is often framed as a Western response to China, but T2 nations may now apply the same logic to Washington. The risk for the United States is not open rebellion. It is the slow, deliberate, and accumulative drift away from U.S. control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another overlooked fracture in the AI Diffusion Rule is how it may incentivize open-source migration as an escape hatch. If an advanced model is trained on U.S.-controlled hardware, its weights are also now subject to U.S. export controls, unless they are open-sourced and made publicly available. This creates an incentive for T2 nations to lean into open-source AI development. Optically, while the United States builds a walled garden, China, through DeepSeek and other initiatives, positions itself as the patron of open-source development. Ironically, the AI Diffusion Framework, meant to lock in American advantage, may instead midwife the very outcome it sought to prevent—an alternate AI stack and increased open-source development where China, as its most prolific contributor, emerges as the de facto leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common rejoinder is that the AI Diffusion Rule only affects a handful of countries, since most global AI data center capacity is already concentrated in the United States and T1 nations. But this grossly understates the fallout for economies like Malaysia, which was on track to become the world’s third-largest data center country by 2026, as well as India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE)—nations that had staked their AI ambitions on expanded compute access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reasoning also rests on an implicit assumption that T2 countries do not need as much compute, because few were ever serious AI contenders. Leading AI research only takes place in a narrow corridor of countries (e.g., China, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States). But saying “you were never going to win anyway” is a significantly different proposition from saying “you are not allowed to try.” No one tells a kid in the United States that they cannot be president. Empire operates on the same principle. Its benefits must always seem within reach, even to those who will never grasp them. Otherwise, it will breed resentment, not cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the United States may believe that the risk of AI proliferation is so severe, and the timeline to artificial general intelligence so short (2–3 years), that the cost of alienating T2 nations is an acceptable trade-off. But if the United States is trying to consolidate long-term control over the global AI stack, this approach may be too heavy-handed and self-defeating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;understanding-the-tiered-framework&quot;&gt;Understanding the Tiered Framework&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;t1-the-inner-circle&quot;&gt;T1: The Inner Circle&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;T1 comprises 18 countries and reads like a roll call of long-standing allies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Five Eyes intelligence partners (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom);&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Close Western/NATO allies (Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom); or&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Semiconductor heavyweights (Taiwan, the Netherlands, Japan, and South Korea).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But like all alliances, the omissions are as telling as the inclusions. Not all of “Old Europe” or NATO made the cut—Greece and Portugal are missing. More strikingly, Poland, Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania are conspicuously absent, despite their vigorous support for U.S. security initiatives, especially in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This partial listing underscores that unofficially, there is a secondary filter. It is not enough to be a stalwart ally on paper; to guarantee lockstep compliance, the United States wants partners whose re-export controls and enforcement frameworks mirror its own. For Washington, even otherwise-dependable allies may fall short if they lack the institutional capacity, enforcement rigor, and willingness to guarantee strict adherence, or if they are viewed as potential diversion risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;t2-eclectic-middle-ground&quot;&gt;T2: Eclectic Middle Ground&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lion’s share of nations fall into T2, a catch-all group that lumps together an eclectic mix of countries with vastly different levels of trust, capacity, and AI ambitions. India, Israel, Singapore, and Switzerland are placed alongside Yemen. There are several reasons why countries may have ended up in T2. Some, like Saudi Arabia and the UAE, have emerged as key investors in AI but remain outside the Western intelligence-sharing orbit. Others, such as India, are forging close strategic and trade ties with the United States but have a legacy of nonalignment. Switzerland, with its long-standing tradition of fierce neutrality, fits a similar mold. Meanwhile, countries in Southeast Asia and those in Eastern Europe that are officially close U.S. partners have been flagged as diversion risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;t3-the-usual-suspects&quot;&gt;T3: The Usual Suspects&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;T3 is a familiar roster of U.S. arms-embargoed countries—China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia, joined by the likes of Burma (Myanmar), Syria, and Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;t1-access-and-restrictions&quot;&gt;T1 Access and Restrictions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;T1 countries will have unrestricted access to advanced GPUs. Companies headquartered or with an ultimate parent in a T1 country can deploy as much computing power as they want within T1 nations. Through a one-time Universal Validated End User (UVEU) authorization, they can also deploy GPUs in T2 countries, albeit within certain limits. Beyond access to hardware, the rule also ring-fences the training of frontier models in T1 countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, even T1 status comes with conditions. U.S.-headquartered companies must keep at least 50 percent of total AI compute in the United States, 75 percent in T1 countries overall, and no more than 7 percent in any single T2 country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The numbers are striking. But based on data from the AI and semiconductor research firm SemiAnalysis, the bulk of AI data center capacity is already concentrated in the United States and T1 countries—over 50 percent in the United States alone and more than 75 percent across T1 nations. SemiAnalysis further projects 10+ gigawatt (GW)-scale campuses coming online in the United States over the next two years, reinforcing its lead. Figure 2 shows the stark regional disparities in planned data center capacity through 2027, with North America dominating global capacity—roughly four times larger than either Europe and the Middle East or Asia Pacific, while Latin America trails behind for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To qualify, however, companies must meet 19 separate certification and policy requirements, covering everything from GPU installation reporting and transit security to personnel vetting, monitoring, recordkeeping, and even sanitization and disposal procedures. The strictest requirements revolve around cybersecurity controls for model weights, mandating rate-limiting on data access and restricting interactions to narrowly defined application programming interfaces (APIs) to prevent rapid exfiltration and unauthorized probing of models through interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, UVEUs must follow “know your customer” (KYC) and red flag guidance, including notifying authorities when training an advanced model. The primary concern is subsidiaries conducting large-scale training runs above the prescribed threshold (i.e., 10²⁶ FLOP) and then transferring model weights to China. Collectively, these safeguards are designed to prevent GPU diversion, unauthorized access, and the theft of model weights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For companies that clear these hurdles, the payoff is substantial: a near-universal hall pass, granting broad authorization to scale AI infrastructure worldwide. UVEUs will also be exempt from the restrictions on model weights—which, under the rules of the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), otherwise require a license to export, re-export, or even transfer within a country—provided the destination is a T1 country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;t2-access-and-restrictions&quot;&gt;T2 Access and Restrictions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BIS has imposed country-level caps on advanced GPUs for T2 nations, measured by total processing performance (TPP), a metric quantifying aggregate compute capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, TPP is abstract and lacks immediate real-world clarity. As such, a conversion method is often employed to translate TPP into a more tangible benchmark—NVIDIA’s H100 equivalents, the current industry standard for AI workloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each T2 country receives a fixed allocation of 49,901 H100-equivalent GPUs through 2027. This is not an annual quota—once exhausted, whether in 2025 or 2026, no additional GPUs can be imported until after 2027. To accommodate smaller-scale needs, BIS allows T2 entities to acquire up to 1,699 H100-equivalents without a license, though they must notify BIS. These purchases do not count toward the 49,901 H100-equivalent installed base cap, offering flexibility for low-volume imports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-shrinking-reality-of-50000-and-1700-gpu-caps&quot;&gt;The Shrinking Reality of 50,000 and 1,700 GPU Caps&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first glance, an allocation of ~50,000 H100-equivalent GPUs, which would cost roughly $1.25 billion, appears substantial—roughly more than double the compute used to train GPT-4, which was trained on roughly 25,000 less-performant A100 chips. However, the H100 will soon become a previous-generation chip, set to be replaced in 2025 by NVIDIA’s newer B200 and GB300 GPUs. When the permitted TPP is converted into these next-generation units using numbers from SemiAnalysis, the effective number of GPUs shrinks—from 50,000 H100s to 21,987 B200s, and then 13,192 GB300s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This downward trend accelerates when accounting for hardware improvement rates. According to Epoch AI, ML hardware performance has doubled every 1.9 years, meaning that by 2027, a 13,192 GB300 allocation will be effectively reduced by half. Similarly, the seemingly permissive ~1,700 H100 threshold for small purchases translates to fewer than 500 GB300 GPUs and an even smaller number of 2027-equivalents. These calculations reveal how quickly nominally generous caps become more restrictive, limiting the compute available to T2 nations in practice. It is worth noting that future hardware performance is uncertain. NVIDIA’s generational leaps might yield larger or smaller performance gains than projected and come sooner or later than expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-t2-countries-can-increase-their-caps&quot;&gt;How T2 Countries Can Increase Their Caps&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies from T2 countries looking to deploy a significant number of GPUs can apply for a National Validated End User (NVEU) authorization, provided they meet stringent security requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By so doing, they receive an export license allowing a phased-in installed base of up to approximately 100,000 H100 equivalents by the end of 2025, 270,000 by the end of 2026, and 320,000 by the end of 2027. Again, these are not trivial numbers. 100,000 H100s is three times larger than the compute capacity of xAI’s Colossus supercomputer facility in Memphis, Tennessee, the largest U.S. GPU cluster in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as discussed earlier, these caps shrink dramatically when accounting for hardware improvements. When the allocation is converted, the 320,000 H100 equivalents allowed drops to 140,666 B200 equivalents and 84,400 GB300 equivalents. Factoring in hardware improvements—i.e., doubling every 1.9 years—this number shrinks even further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to obtain NVEU status, T2 applicants are “strongly encouraged” to first secure a government-to-government assurance before seeking approval from four federal agencies—the Departments of Commerce, State, Defense, and Energy. While UVEU applicants must also clear this multi-agency review, T2 firms face structural disadvantages compared to T1 hyperscalers and neoclouds, which already operate within established compliance frameworks, observability systems, and security protocols, making many of the requirements routine. In addition, T2 NVEU applicants will also face heightened scrutiny in demonstrating efforts to sever supply chain dependencies with China. While not all countries are equally exposed, many have integrated Chinese networking equipment and hardware into their infrastructure due to cost advantages, making compliance both technically complex and costly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;t3-access-and-restrictions&quot;&gt;T3 Access and Restrictions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be a presumption of denial for all T3 countries—in regulatory parlance, that means an automatic “no” for any export license applications involving T3 entities. None of the streamlined “VEU” routes (universal or national) apply. In principle, a T3 company cannot just waltz through licensing hoops—it is effectively shut out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-uneven-impact-of-the-ai-diffusion-rule&quot;&gt;The Uneven Impact of the AI Diffusion Rule&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of the rule will, unsurprisingly, be uneven. While it is tempting to cast T1 as the “winners” and T2 as the “losers,” this would be an oversimplification. Even within each tier, the outcomes will be far from uniform—some T1 countries will gain disproportionately, while others in T2 will feel the brunt of the restrictions more acutely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, some T2 countries may benefit under the new rules. For instance, entities in parts of the Middle East and Central Asia—where any chip purchase previously required an export license—now have pathways to access controlled chips without a license, provided they stay within the bounds of low-volume purchase pathways (LPPs) or individual country allocations. Countries like the UAE, which spent months negotiating deals such as the Microsoft-G42 partnership and has already secured a memorandum of understanding with the United States, will welcome the added clarity and are well-positioned to obtain an NVEU status. Conversely, other T2 nations that previously faced no restrictions will now find their access significantly tightened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broadly speaking, the new rule is likely to be a net negative for T2 nations with significant AI data center capacity pipelines, particularly if that capacity is not slated for use by U.S. hyperscalers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;biggest-losers&quot;&gt;Biggest Losers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on SemiAnalysis data, Malaysia will be the hardest-hit country. Its data center capacity has been surging, rising from just 100 megawatts (MW) in 2023 to a projected ~3.5 GW by 2027, and positioning it to become the world’s third-largest data center country, behind the United States and China, by 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly half of Malaysia’s projected 2027 capacity is optimized for cutting-edge NVIDIA AI accelerators, with facilities capable of supporting power densities of up to 130 kilowatts (kW) per rack. This has drawn major investments, including NVIDIA’s $4.3 billion partnership with Malaysian conglomerate YTL to build supercomputing facilities and cloud AI services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malaysia is likely to get caught in the crosshairs of the rule as it become a key destination for Chinese colocation and leasing activities. By 2027, ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, is expected to lease 628 MW of its total data center capacity. Similarly, DayOne (formerly GDS) is adding 415 MW by 2026, much of which is leased to ByteDance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oracle finds itself in a bind—hence the escalating blog posts from Executive Vice President Ken Glueck on December 19, January 5, and February 4. Oracle’s strategy relied heavily on Malaysia, with $6.5 billion in planned investments that will likely exceed the new 7 percent country cap for T2 nations. While it could theoretically rebalance through aggressive expansion in T1 countries, this would require significant new investment and strategic repositioning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Malaysia, India will be the hardest-hit county. However, unlike Malaysia, India’s AI infrastructure is more closely tied to U.S. hyperscalers, offering some insulation from the restrictions. Still, with ~3 GW of planned data center capacity, India closely rivals Malaysia in scale, but has even larger ambitions. Mukesh Ambani, India’s richest person and chairman of Reliance Industries, recently announced plans to build a 3 GW mega data center campus in Jamnagar, Gujarat, which would be the world’s largest, with a projected investment of $20–30 billion. The facility is intended for AI workloads and is expected to rely on NVIDIA’s leading-edge Blackwell AI processors. The new restrictions threaten to derail these initiatives, potentially thwarting India’s aspirations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond Malaysia, Southeast Asia overall is likely to suffer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singapore was an early mover in the data center boom of the 2000s, leveraging its connectivity infrastructure. But its energy constraints quickly caught up. In 2019, Singapore imposed a moratorium on new data centers after projections showed they could consume 12 percent of the nation’s electricity by 2030. Since then, Singapore has allocated modest expansions—80 MW for four new data centers by 2023 and a 2024 pledge to add 300 MW, prioritizing green energy options. Given its fundamental constraints, however, Singapore’s growth will remain capped, relying on reshuffling its deck to retire legacy facilities and optimize existing capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indonesia, meanwhile, is less handicapped by similar limitations and has been muscling in on the AI data center space. It recently completed Phase 1 of the BDx CGK4 campus in Jatiluhur—a renewable-powered AI data center park, scalable up to 500 MW, offering high power density of up to 120 kW per rack, liquid cooling technologies, and high-speed connectivity to meet the demands of AI workloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indonesia’s ample land, energy, and ability to leverage renewable power have also made it a natural magnet for Chinese investment, with Tencent Holdings pledging $500 million to develop its third data center in the country by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil will be the most affected country in Latin America and has positioned itself as a regional AI data center powerhouse. Leading the charge is Scala Data Centers, whose São Paulo campus is set to expand beyond 350 MW, but its real centerpiece is the so-called AI City—a proposed 4.75 GW campus that will cost upward of $90 billion. Ordinarily, such a proposal would be laughed out of the room, but the proposed site is located next to an idle 3 GW substation and surrounded by untapped wind and hydro power, resources that few other nations can match. With the right financial backing, it could be the largest AI data center in the world. The new U.S. restrictions would, however, significantly undercut these plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the UAE and Saudi Arabia show relatively small confirmed capacities through 2027, this understates their long-term aspirations, with several gigawatt-scale projects that extend well beyond 2027. Most, however, have not yet started earthworks. The Gulf states possess two distinct advantages: huge energy reserves and the ability to deploy state-backed capital with near-limitless patience to build the next generation of AI data centers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Near-term development is led by G42/Khazna, with 406 MW of planned capacity across 13 campuses, including a flagship 100 MW Dubai Ajman campus. However, its true ambitions are reflected in its longer-term plans. According to SemiAnalysis, G42/Khazna is planning a staggering 5 GW aggregate pipeline across the Middle East, while Google is eyeing a 3 GW pipeline near Saudi Arabia’s King Salman Energy Park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;biggest-winners&quot;&gt;Biggest Winners&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the AI Diffusion Rule does not create outright “winners,” apart from the United States, which by design will be the primary beneficiary, T1 countries’ AI infrastructure plans will not be at risk and can proceed without regulatory headwinds. In addition, they are likely to siphon off deployments originally earmarked for T2 nations now caught in the rule’s constraints. Based on SemiAnalysis data, Australia emerges as a standout case among T1 nations, followed by the United Kingdom, Japan, Ireland, Germany, Canada, South Korea, the Netherlands, and Spain. In fact, nine out of eighteen T1 countries have more than 1 GW of planned AI data center capacity, compared to just four countries across all T2 countries, with five T1 countries exceeding 2 GW of planned capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia will likely be the largest beneficiary of the rule, particularly in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region, with its ~3 GW of planned capacity. Australia’s energy landscape provides a crucial competitive advantage. Unlike Japan and South Korea, which rely heavily on imported energy, Australia is one of the world’s largest energy exporters. Australia’s consistent year-round solar irradiation also translates directly to data center economics, enabling cost-effective power purchase agreements (PPAs) for data center operators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, colocation accounts for approximately 75 percent of Australia’s market. While hyperscalers like Microsoft, Google, and AWS can self-build and operate their own facilities, colocation providers offer a compelling alternative: ready-to-use data center facilities that cloud providers can quickly lease, which means lower capital requirements and faster time to market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Australian market is anchored by three mature colocation providers that rank among the world’s best—the “three Goliaths”: AirTrunk, NextDC, and Canberra Data Centers (CDC). NextDC’s 550 MW mega campus demonstrates its capacity for large-scale development, while the ability of AirTrunk, a homegrown success story, to deploy direct-to-chip liquid cooling is particularly significant as the industry faces a big transition: NVIDIA’s upcoming Blackwell AI chips (GB200) require this advanced cooling technology to handle power densities up to 130 kW per rack. Many data center operators globally, including tech giant Meta, have had to completely redesign facilities to accommodate these new requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What truly distinguishes the “three Goliaths” is their focus—instead of serving a broad mix of enterprise clients, they primarily build for hyperscale cloud providers—and already well understand their exacting technical requirements and scaling needs. Combined with its privileged T1 status under the new rules, Australia is ideally positioned to capture displaced AI computing demand from restricted Southeast Asian markets like Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-theory-of-success-for-the-united-states&quot;&gt;The Theory of Success for the United States&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AI Diffusion Rule will funnel T2 countries toward U.S. hyperscalers and allied T1 neoclouds as the default gateway to advanced compute, which the U.S. largely controls, creating a de facto lock-in of AI infrastructure worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rule is not just about controlling who gets access to U.S. compute; it is also about forcing countries to choose sides. In order to secure U.S. compute, T2 NVEU applicants will also have to sever supply chain dependencies with China—i.e., they need to declare for Washington and eject Beijing, or risk falling behind. But company-level decoupling will not suffice; securing U.S. approval will require formal government assurances at the national level to get into Washington’s good graces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;creating-economic-pressure-the-approval-gap-between-uveu-and-nveu&quot;&gt;Creating Economic Pressure: The Approval Gap Between UVEU and NVEU&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the path to securing NVEU status appears straightforward, as highlighted previously, the process presents significant practical hurdles that could create dangerous delays for countries with ambitious AI data center plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many projects, like those in Malaysia, are purpose-built for top-end AI training, with ultra-dense power racks, advanced liquid cooling, and infrastructure optimized for next-generation chips like NVIDIA’s Blackwell line. Yet, even with an NVEU license, TPP limitations and supply constraints may prevent operators from acquiring enough state-of-the-art GPUs to fill those racks. Meanwhile, Tier 1 license holders face a 7 percent limit on how much of their total compute can be deployed in any single country, creating further uncertainty for T2 data centers looking to secure large clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operators could repurpose racks for older GPUs, but these do not require the high-density cooling and power infrastructure already in place, turning specialized, high-capex facilities into underutilized white elephants. A retrofit for lower-performance workloads also undermines the original investment altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the economics are unforgiving. Modern data center projects require billions in upfront capital expenditure—from land acquisition and power infrastructure to advanced cooling systems. These investments are typically highly leveraged, with financing structures that assume rapid customer deployment to generate cash flow for debt service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even short delays awaiting NVEU approval leave these specialized facilities vulnerable. Loan payments may come due without corresponding revenue from AI workloads, but incurring the same fixed costs for maintenance, security, and staff. For operators and investors, the choice will be clear. Unfilled racks mean certain losses. They will likely lease to T1 hyperscalers who can deploy immediately under UVEU status, or risk their facilities becoming stranded assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lock-in-effects&quot;&gt;Lock-In Effects&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The framework effectively drives T2 compute capacity toward U.S. hyperscalers and T1 neoclouds, which gain preferential access to T2 markets. But the implications go beyond just access to compute. Hyperscalers and neoclouds also offer stable service-level agreements and robust developer ecosystems (e.g., CUDA libraries), with better track records for uptime, enterprise-grade support, and compliance. Over time, the cost and friction of switching to alternative providers like Huawei would become prohibitively high. Migrating datasets, restructuring technical operations, retraining staff, and rebuilding applications would impose significant costs and operational challenges, reinforcing lock-in effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;potential-response-from-china-and-allies&quot;&gt;Potential Response from China and Allies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-hardware-gap-chinas-compute-gap&quot;&gt;The Hardware Gap: China’s Compute Gap&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assumption that China can immediately compensate for U.S. controls with domestic alternatives is not supportable with current evidence. In the near term, China faces significant constraints in both the quality and quantity of chips it can produce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality Gap:&lt;/strong&gt; Huawei’s Ascend series and other Chinese GPU alternatives lag behind NVIDIA by one to two generations. According to Chris Miller, Huawei’s most advanced AI chip, the Ascend 910B, achieves only 280–400 TeraFLOPS compared to 2,250 TeraFLOPS for NVIDIA’s most advanced Blackwell chips. This performance differential of 5.6–8x is reflected in real-world adoption. According to Epoch AI, of 263 documented AI models where hardware was known, only two used Huawei Ascend chips, while 31 Chinese organizations relied on NVIDIA hardware. Even DeepSeek trained its models on NVIDIA H800s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quantity Gap:&lt;/strong&gt; SemiAnalysis projects that China will produce just 1.8 million Huawei Ascend 910B/910C GPUs by the end of 2025, while U.S. AI labs and hyperscalers are projected to deploy 14.3 million AI accelerators in the United States, which are significantly more performant, suggesting an even larger compute gap at the aggregate national level. This limited fabrication capacity means that China will likely prioritize domestic needs, limiting their ability to offer a credible alternative to U.S. technology in global markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth cautioning that this technology gap may not be permanent. In the medium to long term, forced localization and state-backed capital might narrow China’s performance gap from one generation behind to on par or slightly behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;second-tier-status-first-tier-ambitions&quot;&gt;Second-Tier Status, First-Tier Ambitions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;T2 countries will, of course, publicly acquiesce to U.S. restrictions. But diplomatic accommodation should not be mistaken for genuine alignment. India, the Gulf states, and other well-capitalized AI aspirants will bristle in private that their AI ambitions depend on Washington’s goodwill. The fact that T2 nations are being deliberately kept a generation behind the frontier will also rankle. It is a public, institutionalized reminder that no matter how much they invest, they are not allowed to be first-tier players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-false-binary-the-united-states-vs-china-vs-a-third-way&quot;&gt;The False Binary: The United States vs. China vs. a Third Way&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a tendency to view AI geopolitics through a Cold War–style binary—that nations must either align with the United States or drift into China’s orbit. But this overlooks a third possibility that T2 nations, far from being passive satellites, may seek their own path. T2 nations have no desire to be entirely captive to either the United States or China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019 is often cited as China’s “9/11 moment,” when the Huawei and ZTE sanctions forced Beijing to embark on a massive technological self-sufficiency push. The AI Diffusion Rule may trigger a similar reckoning for T2 countries. One may argue that the two are not analogous. After all, Beijing was explicitly cut off, while T2 countries still receive a permissive allocation under the new framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that misses the underlying dynamic. No country makes economic security decisions on the basis of GPUs alone. Increasingly muscular U.S. economic security measures, especially against close allies like Canada, will force capitals to rethink long-term dependencies on U.S. technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;short-term-adjustments-long-term-realignment&quot;&gt;Short-Term Adjustments, Long-Term Realignment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this will not happen overnight. In the near term, T2 nations will maximize their initial allocation of 50,000 H100-equivalent GPUs. Given that access is first come, first served, sovereign AI initiatives will ramp up—governments will ensure national priorities dictate GPU access, rather than individual firms. We may also see the rise of regional compute corridors, with nations pooling resources to overcome individual capacity limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the immediate time frame, these countries will likely procure whatever GPUs they can—via U.S.-validated entities (UVEUs) or the narrower NVEU status. As access to U.S. compute becomes increasingly conditional, however, or simply in anticipation of future friction, well-resourced nations will start to invest in their own high-performance computing infrastructure, aiming not to match the raw performance of top-end GPUs—a feat even China struggles with—but to build a functional, mid-tier alternative capable of supporting AI applications. Rather than attempting to replicate leading-edge GPUs, these collaborations could focus on specialized application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) designed for narrow but critical industrial and commercial AI workloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RISC-V-based AI accelerators, designed collaboratively and manufactured in existing T2 facilities, present another pathway. Unlike proprietary architectures like x86 or Arm—both of which are subject to U.S. restrictions—RISC-V’s open-source nature allows nations to design their own AI accelerators. That said, RISC-V is not an immediate off-ramp. While Alibaba has developed XuanTie RISC-V cores, most RISC-V AI efforts remain in their early stages, requiring significant investment and development. Claiming it as a ready solution for compute sovereignty overstates its current capabilities. But dismissing it entirely would ignore incentives to fast-track progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Washington was already concerned about China’s push for design-out, the risk now multiplies exponentially. By overplaying its hand, the United States creates a potential alternate compute stack, operating beyond American control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-open-source-escape-valve&quot;&gt;The Open-Source Escape Valve&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As highlighted earlier, the weights of any model trained using U.S.-controlled compute are subject to U.S. export restrictions if they exceed 10²⁶ FLOP—unless they are open-sourced. At first glance, this creates an incentive for T2 nations to lean into open-source frontier AI development to sidestep U.S. regulatory controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in practice, this escape valve may not be as open as it seems. T2 countries will likely lack the domestic compute capacity to train models beyond 10²⁶ FLOP, meaning they would need to rent compute. But this raises a liability risk—how can a T2 entity credibly prove, before training begins, that it will follow through on open-sourcing the model weights? Without a mechanism to verify intent pre-training, compute providers may simply deny access upfront rather than gamble on post-training compliance. As such, T2 players may find themselves effectively boxed out of both closed- and open-source frontier AI development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even if U.S. restrictions block T2 nations from training frontier open-source models, they may trigger a different kind of shift—an acceleration toward compute-efficient, open-source AI development. DeepSeek has already demonstrated that scarcity breeds optimization. What happens when the broader open-source world, united by shared limitations, begins running in the same direction? There is also a curious inversion at play. While the United States moves to lock down and consolidate global compute, China is positioning itself as the provider of last resort, offering high-quality, cost-effective open-source models that others can build on. Instead of needing access to U.S. AI infrastructure, developers could simply build atop China’s open-source stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;T2 states do not need a formal conspiracy with Beijing. But their independent hedging efforts, driven by frustration with U.S. licensing constraints, may naturally dovetail with China’s open-source push. Instead of reinforcing a U.S.-led order, Washington’s grip could weaken and lead to a world where open-source autonomy, championed by China, becomes the default escape hatch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-fragile-equilibrium-and-conditions-for-unraveling&quot;&gt;The Fragile Equilibrium and Conditions for Unraveling&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By tying advanced compute access to strict controls, Washington risks turning T2 countries into reluctant vassals who start looking for side doors at the earliest opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regulatory partitions have a half-life. The policy will only hold as long as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The compliance burden remains lower than the cost of switching;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alternate compute stacks remain too inefficient to offer mid-tier alternative U.S. incumbents; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s domestic AI stack develops more slowly than the United States anticipates.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AI Diffusion Rule assumes that lock-in will hold because switching costs are high. But if history tells us anything, it is that whenever an access-restricted market grows large enough, the incentive to develop alternatives eventually outweighs the costs of remaining dependent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Conclusion and Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is more likely than not that the AI Diffusion Rule will be embraced and further expanded by the Trump administration. It aligns with a broader escalation of the China containment playbook, fits neatly into an “America First” approach, and serves as a powerful negotiating cudgel to compel T2 nations to align more closely with Washington’s AI agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But splintering is not inevitable. There are viable policy pathways to preempt T2 strategic drift and allow the United States to maintain control over the global AI stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish Clear Graduation Requirements for T2 Countries:&lt;/strong&gt; If full T1 status is not feasible, Washington should establish a Tier 2A classification for countries with significant AI infrastructure investments at risk of being stranded, and agree to increase export control enforcement efforts. This tier would receive higher country-level TPP allocations and streamlined NVEU approval processes. There could also be an annual revision of TPP thresholds, particularly as large-scale U.S. initiatives such as Project Stargate take off, to allay T2 country anxieties that that they are being deliberately outpaced and falling further behind the compute frontier.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reassert U.S. Leadership in Open-Source AI to Counter China’s Inroads:&lt;/strong&gt; The AI Diffusion Rule unintentionally incentivizes T2 nations to embrace open-source AI. Rather than cede this space, Washington should preemptively shape the open-source landscape to prevent China from becoming its de facto steward. This could take place by incentivizing international AI research collaborations through U.S. university public compute. This would offer structured, monitored access to AI infrastructure for vetted T2 researchers—allowing the United States to maintain influence over who contributes to the global open-source AI stack. In time, the United States could also develop certification standards for “trusted” open-source models that meet security requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modernizing BIS and Export Controls Enforcement:&lt;/strong&gt; The streamlined licensing burden on BIS creates an opportunity to reallocate resources toward strengthened enforcement and tracking mechanisms that better prevent circumvention. This would dovetail with the growing digitization drive under the Trump administration. BIS could deploy automated TPP tracking systems that provide real-time visibility into GPU deployments, create standardized APIs for reporting and monitoring, and build automated early warning systems for potential diversion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some ways, the United States has crossed the Rubicon, and there is no retreat. China will continue its drive for AI self-sufficiency regardless of U.S. actions. But export controls are like self-replicating automata. They tend to expand with each iteration, creating new loopholes, countermeasures, and pressures for escalation. A more adaptive approach, however—one that balances U.S. leadership with credible pathways for allies—could allow Washington to have its cake and eat it too. If there is a better hand to play, now is the time to find it. And if there is anyone that thrives on breaking and remaking the playbook, it is President Trump.&lt;/p&gt;

However, early on the Russians found that fighting back the armed opposition would be easier than reforming the Assad regime and turning it back into a self-sustaining entity.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;Even though Russia continued trying to reform the regime and especially its armed forces, some of its initiatives turned out to be counterproductive. This was largely because Russia refused to accept the fact that the regime was uninterested in reform. As Assad sought to prevent the Russians from promoting Syrian officers, whom they deemed to be fit for the purpose of running the military more effectively, the net result was the creation of a Russian patronage system within the Syrian security establishment, which rivaled an Assad-centered one (and, incidentally, an emerging Iran-centered one).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gradually, the Russians became more and more critical of the regime and its armed forces. Their efforts to get Bashar al Assad to hand over power to a more widely accepted figure in 2017-18 also contributed to increasing distrust of Moscow within the regime. In addition, the Syrians resented increasingly obvious Russian efforts to invest all their resources in their own Syrian network, at the expense of the rest of the regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian commentary on the state of the Syrian armed forces from 2019 onward casted doubt on the regime’s ability, in the event of a significant challenge, to survive on its own. The Assad regime was aware of the risk, as well, but it seems to have identified the main threat as entanglement in the Israel-Palestine-Iran conflict. There was, however, some optimism in Damascus that diplomatic reintegration into the Arab world would go ahead and that eventually Damascus would cease being dependent on Russian (and Iranian) support. While the Russians likely had less than Iran to fear from a Syrian rapprochement with the Gulf monarchies, Moscow seems nonetheless to have resented the Assad regime’s efforts to contain Russian influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s heavy engagement in Ukraine from 2022 onward had an impact on its commitments in Syria, although initially not a very big one. It was only in late 2023-early 2024 that Russia started heavily cutting funding and support for the Syrians. Driving this were not just accumulating costs of the war in Ukraine; it is also clear that specific Russo-Syrian dynamics were at play, in particular a Syrian crackdown on prominent pro-Russian officers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever the exact weight of different factors, the Russians implemented much harsher cuts to their support, leaving the Syrian armed forces starved of funding and logistics. Yet the Assad regime did not yield to the pressure. The result was a critical situation as the end of 2024 approached. The Russo-Syrian falling-out can thus be argued to have contributed decisively to the regime’s collapse. It remained unclear at the time of this writing whether the Russians deliberately weakened the regime in order to force Assad to come to terms with Türkiye, as wished by Moscow, or whether relations between Moscow and Damascus simply went awry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researching this topic required a number of methodological compromises, given that conducting primary research in Syria was extremely difficult until 2024. There are other obvious limitations to the research methodology adopted, with research by necessity mostly limited to oral sources, with support from the literature and news reports, but no access to primary written sources: the body of data collected is inevitably incomplete; gaps abound, and following up on specific themes was often impossible. The analysis contained in the paper inevitably reflects this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the oral sources proved to be quite approachable. The risk inherent in this type of research is therefore not obtaining access. There are other risks, however: that interviewees might be affected by a social-desirability bias, resulting in overstating their achievements, capabilities and/or resources; or by reverse causation, leading sources to provide prejudiced information about rival organizations. Mitigation measures are discussed below. The research methodology was a hybrid of investigative journalism and ethnographic interviews. The questionnaires were adapted to each interviewee; there were, in fact, as many different questionnaires as there were interviews. The questions evolved as knowledge of ongoing trends and developments expanded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the researchers have a background in journalism and/or research, had participated in previous research projects with a similar typology of interviewees and have been trained to undertake research with a similar methodology. The interviews were commissioned to local researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The risk that respondents might use the interviews to influence external observers or misrepresent the facts was assumed from the start. It was mitigated by using different types of interviewees – such as government officials and military officers, Iranian and Russian officers and diplomats, members of militias – who represented contrasting points of view; by interviewing individuals separately and without their being aware of other interviews taking place; and by inserting questions to which the answer was already known, in order to verify responses. It proved particularly helpful to present interviewees with information gathered from other sources. Public-domain sources, such as media reports and analytical studies, were also used, where available, to check the credibility of interviewees. Researchers were chosen who did not know each other to avoid the risk of researcher collusion to manipulate the content of interviews, for example, by inventing content to produce whatever they might have believed the project team wanted to hear. This is always a risk when interviews are carried out by field researchers while the project is being managed remotely. The field researchers were also informed that the purpose of the effort was simply to ascertain facts and that there was no premium placed on specific findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interviewees were told that their answers would be used in an open-access publication, the type of which was not specified. The interviews were in part carried out face-to-face and in part over the phone – some interviewees were in locations that were difficult to access. All the interviews have been anonymized and all data that could lead to the identification of interviewees has been removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In total, the paper relies on 30 interviews, carried out between 2016 and 2024. Of these, 14 were with Syrian military personnel, 10 with Syrian officials, three with Russian diplomats and military advisors, two with Iranian advisors from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and one with an official translator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russia-and-the-syrian-armed-forces&quot;&gt;Russia and the Syrian armed forces&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russias-ambitions-in-2015&quot;&gt;Russia’s ambitions in 2015&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Russia intervened in Syria in 2015, Putin set out as an aim to “stabilize the legitimate authorities”. Indeed, Russian army advisers to the Syrian government lobbied the Assad regime to focus on rebuilding the Syrian army, which had been greatly weakened in 2011-15. The Russians might have been motivated by a genuine belief that the militias sponsored by Iran, of which there were plenty and which were doing the bulk of the fighting, were undermining the state. Moreover, the fragmented militias seemed to be of little use for the maneuver warfare, integrated with close air support, that Russian advisers were advocating against the rebels – although this did not rule out continuing to rely on militias for other purposes. Competition with Iran was another motivating factor for Russian policy to build up the Syrian army at the expense of the militias. This was an attempt to increase Russia’s influence at the expense of Iran, whose influence in Syria was largely channeled through militias. As an adviser to Assad noted as early as 2016, soon after their arrival in Syria, the Russians appeared to worry about the concentration of power and influence in the hands of the IRGC, at the expense of their own influence and that of the Syrian state. Indeed, the Russians were soon openly arguing that reestablishing a strong Syrian army would be the best guarantee against Iranian influence and pro-Iranian militias.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-obstacles-in-russias-way&quot;&gt;The obstacles in Russia’s way&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2024, the Russian view of the Syrian armed forces was that the Syrian top army leadership was dishonest, corrupt and “not working properly”. Corruption was regularly mentioned as a key factor in the weakness of the Syrian armed forces even by Iranian sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nepotism and patronage are other frequently mentioned issues. The Russians put a lot of pressure on the Assad regime to stop promoting “useless people” in the army, reportedly achieving some success in preventing egregiously nepotistic appointments, but without effecting the removal of the cronies who were already there. Assad never took action, despite the Russians asking for a meeting on this specific issue. The Iranians agreed on this assessment, as well. Reportedly, Qasim Sulimani attributed the problems of the Syrian army to nepotism: “he always said that strengthening the Syrian army is like feeding President Assad’s family; he said they will take all the advantage and abuse it”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even those Russians who thought the Syrian leadership was only a “minor issue” and that “not all” the army leadership was “ineffective”, acknowledged that corruption was widespread, with weapons and fuel being stolen even by senior officers, and that the Syrian government refused to promote “capable officers”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the fragmentation of the army chain of command was often raised as a major issue, again by Iranians too. A Russian advisor described the army as “not a real army, and they are all made up of militias that are not strong enough”. As one senior Syrian official put it,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Assad has a lot of senor military people who take orders from him; they listen to Assad whether to do operations or not. They do not need to take orders from the minister or the ministry. They are trusted people to Assad, and they are supporting Assad. No one can say something to them in the ministry. If anyone complains, he will lose his job. The number of such people is big, and the minister is against them; he tells them that operations need to be authorized by the ministry. Russia is also unhappy with Assad about this. Russia is telling Assad that when operations take place, it must be done under the chain of command of the Ministry of Defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Wagner Group sources, which were mentoring and training Syrian forces, described Syrian units as poorly trained and weakly motivated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russias-role-in-making-things-worse&quot;&gt;Russia’s role in making things worse&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the Russian MoD was for years a keen advocate of rebuilding a strong, unified Syrian army, in the end Russian policies might unwittingly have contributed to the further fragmentation of the chain of command. For example, Russian insistence on creating army units out of reconciled rebels in the south led to the emergence of de facto autonomous units that never took order from Damascus. This, aside from creating tension between Moscow and Damascus, also made the chain of command even more convoluted, with the 8th Brigade of the 5th Corps in particular only responding to the Russians. Although the Syrian MoD tried to assert control over the 8th Brigade after 2022, despite Russia having stopped paying their salaries, it never succeeded in earning the loyalty of the ex-rebels. Its efforts to establish control took the shape of replacing several top officers of the division, which likely weakened its combat capabilities very seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the entire 5th Corps was a Russian creation. The Russians conceived it as part of their plan to fold the disparate pro-Assad militias into the regular army in 2016. They funded, provided logistics to and trained the 5th Corps, and they retained a high degree of direct control over it. That became de facto ownership:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The 5th Corps and all its officers and soldiers are part of the Syrian Arab Army, and they got their military uniform and cards from the Syrian Arab Army, but the Russian officers and advisors have direct control and command over all activities, operations and military tasks. The Russian Command is even topping up the salaries of Syrian officers and soldiers. […] The Russian officers issue orders and even decide about the leave of Syrian officers and […]. The Ministry of Defense and the Command of the Syrian Arab Army cannot move a tank or a truck from the 5th Corps without the approval of the Russian officers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same applies to the 4th Corps, another one created at Russian instigation in 2015 and kept by the Russians on a tight leash until at least early 2024: “The 4th Corps is not allowed to carry out operations anywhere; they are just allowed in those areas that are under the control of the Russians”. In addition, the attempt to use both corps for assimilating militias was not completely successful. As a Russian diplomat acknowledged, the 4th and 5th corps never turned into “proper armies” and were never able to perform as proper armies,” mostly remaining “just men with weapons”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example of the perverse effects of Russian reform efforts is the 25th Division, once known as the Tiger Force militia. The Russians nurtured its commander, Suhail al Hasan, pushed for the militia to be transformed into an elite army unit, and directly funded it and equipped it with some of the most advanced equipment ever delivered to Syrian units by Russia. Until 2022, the Russians were de facto in control of the division. This reinforced the preexisting enmity between Suhail al Hasan and the Assad regime, especially Maher al Assad, further fracturing the chain of command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;General Maher al Assad, as all members of aal Assad family, do not like to see a strong and popular officer or leader who is not one of them. General Maher al Assad wanted and still wants to get rid of General Suhail and his 25th Special Task Division, but the Russians prevent this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately the most negative impact of Russia’s intervention on the Syrian armed forces was to make them dependent on Russian support in multiple ways. Whether this was unintended or deliberate outcome is still a matter of debate. Syrian officers were fully aware that Syria was unable to sustain even its shaky security apparatus without external support and that Russia was hard to replace in that role, and the Iranians agreed, too. The most optimistic Syrian officers argued that Syria could resist only for a short period and would need Russia to last longer. Even in the summer of 2024, the Syrian MoD needed the Russian advisors to “keep the situation stable there”. A Syrian intelligence officer noted that despite efforts to bring the 8th Brigade under Damascus’ control, Russian advisers were still needed in 2024 to make it work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another perverse effect of Russian efforts to reform the Syrian armed forces in a context of their deep dysfunctionality is the introduction of a “leading from behind” approach, intended to reduce the high level of casualties among officers. This, when combined with the growing practice of officers getting civilian jobs or running businesses alongside their military occupation, played out badly in 2024, when many tactical units were left without leadership by absentee commanders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;deteriorating-relations&quot;&gt;Deteriorating relations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russian-criticism-of-the-syrian-armed-forces&quot;&gt;Russian criticism of the Syrian armed forces&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, efforts to reform the Syrian army have been acknowledged by the Russians to have mostly failed. The Russians blamed the Syrian regime. Tensions escalated to the point that Putin in various occasions sent representatives such as his minister of defense, army chief of staff and foreign minister to meet Assad and advocate changes in the Syrian military. Within the Russian MoD there was a 2024 discussion about bailing out of all training and advising support for Syrian forces and bringing in private military companies instead. Other solutions that some Russian diplomats offered betray the total lack of faith in the ability of the regime to fix its own armed forces:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;eradicate corruption by replacing the high-ranking generals and commanders who support some of the individuals involved in it;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;seize control of the main departments within the ministry of defence, particularly the logistics division;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;replace most of the army officers and high-ranking commanders with new officers trained in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;syrian-unhappiness-with-the-russians&quot;&gt;Syrian unhappiness with the Russians&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2016, the Russians agreed in principle with Türkiye, Saudi Arabia and the UAE to a transition process in which Bashar al Assad would have to leave power and a coalition government would take over, including most opposition groups. Former Vice-President Farouk al Sharaa was Russia’s favorite to succeed Assad as president because he is a Sunni, as well as for his good relations with Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, various European countries and Russia. Al Assad, who had once had al Sharaa detained, was clearly unhappy about the proposed transition, a matter in which he was supported by the Iranians. By mid-2017, therefore, Syrian-Russian relations were already tense, among other reasons. Assad was, however, already then worried that the Russians might bail out of Syria if he completely rejected their pressure for a political settlement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another major grudge was that after 2021 the Russians were making direct contact with all army units, alleging that the regime’s corruption left them with no choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;…earlier relations with the Russians were mostly going through the Syrian Foreign Ministry, but now the Russians have changed that and have direct relations and links with security forces, corps, and armed groups. Therefore, they are not keeping strong relations with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for each further step and action. Even President Bashar al Assad himself had a conversation with the minister of foreign affairs of Russia so that [the Russians] would manage all their policies with all security and armed units through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but it was not enough and [the Russians] still have their different interlocutors in each agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The army was “not happy to be controlled by Russia and Iran”, concluded the official. He also noted how the Russians were keen to see militias incorporated in the army only when the beneficiaries were the corps they were sponsoring and de facto controlling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian-sponsored militias were also accused of serving little purpose, compared to Iran-sponsored ones, which were more aggressive and proactive. The Russians seemed to be using the Syrian militias for their own purposes. According to the account provided by Syrian officials, the regime was irked by Wagner’s efforts to assert control over the militias and Syrian private security or military companies, such as ISIS Hunters. The Syrian government ended up with no control over ISIS Hunters, which reported only to Wagner Group and the Russian armed forces. Indeed, ISIS Hunters ran into multiple problems with the Syrian armed forces, occasionally even turning their weapons against them, with significant loss of life at two main battles near the Shaer gas field in 2016 and Jazal oil field in 2017, both in Homs. The Assad regime repeatedly tried to take control of ISIS Hunters: “they arranged meetings with Syrian intelligence services, asked the defense minister for help and even requested Wagner Group and the Russian ambassador, but there was no result”. The Assad regime also objected to Redut taking over Wagner’s role in 2023 and to the continuing existence of the militias Wagner had formed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syrian disillusionment with the Russians grew gradually. A senior Baathist figure noted at the end of 2023 that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There are no love story and emotions in the political relationships between countries; there are interests and only interests. Russia sent its aircrafts, warships, troops and military advisors to Syria to support the government of President Bashar al Assad not because Russian President Vladimir Putin loves Syria and President Bashar. […] I am sure that Russia had costs, but it returned every single dollar it paid by taking big investments in Syria. […] Russia has won in Syria, not lost, and this reinforces the Syrian officials’ and people’s rage about Russian policies and strategies. […] I and big numbers of Syrians believe that Russia wants to keep the Syrian government, army and economy weak [to make it] depend completely on Russian and Iranian support and help. […] The instability and insecurity of Syria serve the Russians’ interest more than a strong, central-controlled Syrian government with a strong army.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was not an isolated view. At one point, President Assad sent a formal ultimatum to prevent the Russians from taking over some economic projects. A similar tone is found in an interview with an army officer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you look at all the wars in the world, no one supported his allies without any expectation. In the same way, when the Russians started to support President Bashar al Assad, they wanted something in return; therefore, even if President Assad tries to make any changes, the Russians […] want to take everything in their hands, but President Assad will not let it happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s efforts to reach and maintain an understanding with Turkish President Erdogan were also resented in Damascus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Putin and his government want to keep war-related good ties with Türkiye and signed agreements and truces with Türkiye to maintain the situation on the Idlib and Aleppo fronts. Putin and his ministers met with Erdogan and his ministers for long hours and express their support to each other. […] Russia and Türkiye have a secret understanding and accords to keep the front lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syrian-Russian tensions increased in 2017-18 as the threat posed by opposition groups was receding. The presence of so many former oppositionists in Dara’a, still armed, was (rightly) seen as a major liability by regime officials. The Russia-sponsored peace deals in southern Syria were another bête noire of the Assad regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Russia, due to big pressure from Israel, engaged in reconciliation deals in southern Syria to guarantee stability and security in the region for Israel’s interests, not for the Syrian government’s goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russians rejected the Syrian regime’s plans (endorsed by the Iranians) to disarm the southern opposition groups and move the hardliners to the Idlib area, as done elsewhere. Instead, Russia insisted to keep the former rebels in the south armed, with the aim of incorporating them into the armed forces. This would have given Russia a strong constituency within the Syrian armed forces and established a buffer between Israel and the Iranians. One of the results was that some 20,000-25,000 former rebels, “who can [take] control [of] the province of Dara’a and Quenitra in a few hours,” remained in the south, creating a liability for the Assad regime. Indeed, these forces turned against Assad in December 2024 and seized the south in a matter of days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way the Russians retained control over the portions of the Syrian air force that they had modernized was also resented. Along the same lines, they agreed to boost the capabilities of the air force, training crews and providing refurbished planes “by the end of 2024”, such as helicopters and Su-24s and Su-25s. Some upgrades were made, but “Russia updated and fixed around 20 jet fighters but kept them under its command, and they are only used under Russian orders” The Russians authorized their use only in support of units they cherished, such as 30th Republican Guard Division and 25th Division. The fact that they insisted on picking Syrian pilot trainees for the Russian Air Force Academy individually, bypassing the Syrian authorities, was also seen as scandalous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, the warplanes and helicopters available to the Syrian command were old models and lacked spare parts because Russia “did not reply to the Syrian Air Force Command, which keeps asking Russia to update Syrian airplanes”. The Syrians sought spare parts and technical support from Iran and China, but that hardly proved an adequate solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the Russians had committed to strengthening and upgrading Syria’s air defense on the basis of the 1980 Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between Syria and the Soviet Union and the 2015 agreement on Russian intervention, but after some early investment the efforts basically came to a halt. When Israeli air strikes intensified in 2024, in the wake of the Gaza crisis, this became a major issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-impact-of-the-gaza-crisis&quot;&gt;The impact of the Gaza crisis&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that Syrian-Russian relations were already deteriorating in 2017-18, long before the full-scale war in Ukraine and the Gaza crisis. After 2020, the sense of abandonment within the ranks of the Assad regime became more palpable:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Syrian full scale war and military operations have been stopped since early 2020, and up to now no country in the world, including Russia and China, has given the Syrian government money and funds to rebuild the electricity stations and plants, damaged and demolished government hospitals and buildings and even schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gaza crisis that started in October 2023 further compounded the crisis in Syrian-Russian relations. The fear of being dragged into a war with Israel, combined with the awareness of being completely unable to take on the Israelis, appears to have contributed to dampening morale. According to a Syrian intelligence officer, “the Syrian armed forces believe that Iran and Israel would drag Syria into a conflict in the future; they both would use Syria as a conflict field”. “We are scared of war; we are not going to trust Iranians in the south at all; we cannot take that risk”, commented a Syrian officer in December 2023. The Assad regime was very clear about the prospect that a growing presence of Iran and its allies in Syria would draw the Israelis into the conflict:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We as Syrians do not want to see others fight in our country for their own sake; we do not want to see Syria in long-term war; we do not want to see Israelis target our territory just because of an Iranian presence in our country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Assad regime responded with a flurry of diplomatic activity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of the war in Gaza, the concern was rising day by day, and even our defense minister has been talking since then with the Iranian defense minister and the leader of the Sepah-e Pasdaran regarding the situation. And besides that, President Assad was talking over the situation and possible war between Iran and Israel with President Raisi and with President Pezeshkian. […] He was arranging meetings with officers of the Syrian army, Russian advisors, and Iranians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is in this context that Russia’s unwillingness to extend the protection of its air defenses to Syrian assets further demoralized the Syrians, as regular Israeli air strikes were taking place during 2024. A journalist noted that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Israeli air strikes on the Syrian governmental and Iranian targets create a big debate among all Syrian officers, officials and pro-Assad people. I met with different Syrians, and all were very enraged with the Russian weakness in countering and facing the Israeli air strikes and missiles. […] [This] pushes many pro-Assad Syrians to distrust Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Baathist official commented that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Syrian officials asked the Russians why they did not counter the Israeli attacks […]. The Russians replied that their presence in Syria is to counter only Syrian terrorist groups, not to face Israeli attacks and air strikes. These Russian statements […] led many Syrians to consider Russia as a weak ally…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A member of parliament from Dara’a noted with anger that while the Russians would not or could not stop Israeli air strikes, the Americans were “support[ing] for the Kurdish separate militias (SDF) with everything”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russian-criticism-of-the-assad-regime-intensifies&quot;&gt;Russian criticism of the Assad regime intensifies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted above, early Russian struggles in Syria were ascribed to Iranian disruption. Iran continued being seen as a disruptive force until the very end of the Assad regime. A Russian diplomat described Iran’s diverging views as a major obstacle toward reorganizing the Syrian government. However, the Russians became increasingly critical of the Assad regime itself. A Russian diplomat identified two reasons for the worsening relations with Syria:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the changing relationship with President Assad and his family, due to their corruption and exclusiveness, as well as their attempts to reduce Russian influence in the armed forces;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Syria’s ambition to develop closer relations with Arab powers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irritation at President Assad’s poor “management” led to the Russians trying to bypass him and his government as much as possible and establish direct links with military units, essentially trying to acquire control. Tensions over the Assad regime’s efforts to seize control of some units and militias that were trained and funded by the Russians eventually pushed the Russians to threaten the suspension of all support. The problems started in early 2022, but worsened over time. The climax came when Suhail al Hasan was replaced at the top of 25th Brigade in late 2023, which coincided with another deep cut in Russian support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Russia’s declining commitment and influence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2024, it had become clear to all inside the Syrian regime and its closest allies too that Russia would be unable or unwilling to commit the same resources to Syria as in the past. As a result, Russian influence was clearly in marked decline. The Russians themselves acknowledged this trend. Russian patrols were greatly reduced in number. Russia had been providing both direct financial support to the Syrian regime, and logistical support for its armed forces. Financial support continued, but despite remaining at the rather high level of $3 billion in total in 2022-23, it had fallen. At the peak of the war, in 2016-17, Russia was spending around $2.5 billion a year to support the Syrian regime. As early as 2023 the Russians cut funding to units that were deemed disloyal to them. By 2024, financial support was 70% off the peak figures. The value of logistical support is not known, but sources say that although it suffered less, it still declined 20%. Close air support sorties were reduced, with the best pilots being sent to fly over Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the presence of Russian advisers had become much rarer by 2024, and they largely focused on advising senior officials, such as Assad, heads of intelligence and high-ranking generals (occasionally). In other words, by 2024 the Russians were no longer taking part in operations. The roughly 80 Russian advisers present in October 2024 were spread between ministries such as defense, foreign affairs and economics, as well as the presidency. The periods of deployment were also shortened. At the peak of Russian engagement in 2017, there were 671 advisors in Syria. Sources differ somewhat about the exact distribution of the advisers in 2024, but there seem to have been some with the Liwa al Quds militia, some with the 25th Division, 19 with the Syrian air force, 12 with military intelligence, 12 with air defense and two with some army brigades. Although the Syrians appear to retain a positive impression of Russian advisers, even compared to Iranian ones, and despite the shared interest with the Syrians in keeping the country out of the Gaza crisis, together with supporting secularism (which appealed especially to Christians), inevitably the influence of Russian advisers declined with their numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is not to say that Russian influence was nonexistent by late 2024, as Russians still worked closely with the 14th Special Forces Division, 25th Division, 4th Corps, Air Force Command, Chief of Staff and Ministry of Defense, with which they coordinated military operations and air strikes. In the summer of 2024, the Russians promised to stop further withdrawals and reductions except in the event of an emergency nearer home. Still, the downward trend was unmistakable. In January 2024, a Syrian general noted in amazement that “Two years ago, the Russians were talking about getting the Iranians out of Syria and controlling the country alone…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, some of the Russians’ Syrian interlocutors were thinking that the Russians still present were no longer keen to maintain close relations with the Syrian government, the members of Syrian parliament and the Syrian security council, or sought to influence them. Russian behavior hinted to their old counterparts that they had given up. This was evident in the 8th Brigade:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Three years ago, Russia’s officers were holding daily meetings with local leaders and government officials to coordinate Russian military activities and solving the locals’ problems with the governmental security and military departments. Now, the Russian officers have no plans and strategies except how to make money and get gifts and bribes to send to their families in Russia. The Russian officers and soldiers are selling their foodstuff and oil products, and even their trucks’ engine oil, to make cash dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Iranians were clearly benefiting from the Russian drawdown, but contrary to what had been the case before 2022, when Moscow had been keen to compete with Tehran for influence, the Russians did not seem bothered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Russian military policemen and officers are touring in Dara’a Province [where they were not supposed to be] and they see Iran’s militiamen, but they do nothing and avoid making problems with them. Two years ago, Iran’s militiamen were afraid of making problems with the Russians and did not appear in areas where the Russians were working and patrolling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diplomatic divergence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Syrians knew they were not in a position to quarrel with Russia over its declining commitment. However, they did try to diversify their sources of external support, even if they kept seeking Russian support as well. The Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs tried first of all to mitigate the risks by seeking to lower its international profile. It issued a letter to its officials, saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Currently, we will need to establish a cordial relationship with neighboring countries; we should try to keep good relations with the Turks and the Saudis; and we will need to keep close relations with the opposition in order to keep the situation stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some Syrian officials argued that Syria should raise taxes and increase oil and gas exports, Damascus also appealed for financial support to Iran, in the end obtaining little, and to China, achieving nothing. Assad then turned to the Gulf states, as well as other Arab capitals, “trying to convince the strong countries in the region to support the Syrian government politically and militarily”. In fact, the outreach to some Arab countries was bearing some fruit for Damascus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When Syrian officials met with the UAE a while ago, they promised to support the Syrian government and provide funding for the armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UAE also supported Syrian effort to reconnect diplomatically throughout the region and offered funding for reconstruction. A Syrian officer noted that Arab support would be conditional on getting the Iranians out of Syria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the meeting of our minister of foreign affairs with the UAE, the core request of the UAE officials was to cut off all relations with the Iranians in order for the UAE to be able to provide any kind of support for the Syrian government. In the same way, the Saudis are asking for the same thing, so if the situation gets worse in Syria once again, that will force us to do whatever we need to do for keeping peace and stability in Syria. […] Of course, the Arab countries are not happy about the Iranian presence in Syria; the Saudis, Kuwait, the UAE and even Egypt asked clearly that Syria should cut and end its relations with the Iranians. In return, they promised that they would bring pace and stability to Syria, and they even promised that they would make Syrian relations with the West and the Americans normal [again].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These Syrian efforts exacerbated the worsening relationship with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Syrian army officer confirmed that “The Russians were not happy with President Assad because of his visits to some countries in the Middle East”. A senior Baathist also stated his belief that “Russia knows that President Bashar al Assad and his regime want to establish good ties with the West, America and Gulf States as before the 2011 war”. Although both the Syrians and the Russians believed that the Iranians would block any UAE approaches to Syria, Russia likely saw Assad’s efforts as a sign of long-term disloyalty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-impact-of-the-reduced-russian-commitment-on-the-syrian-regimes-collapse&quot;&gt;The impact of the reduced Russian commitment on the Syrian regime’s collapse&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of Russia’s reduced commitment on the Syrian regime and especially its armed forces was very significant, and not only because salaries were delayed or not paid at all. One IRGC colonel acknowledged that “There has been a huge impact on the Syrian armed forces since the Russians reduced their presence in Syria. The morale of the Syrian armed forces is not the same as it was before”. Russian influence over the militias declined, as well, and they turned elsewhere for support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reduction in Russian support translated into salaries failing to keep pace with Syria’s very high inflation, serving to demoralize and encourage corrupt practices. A particularly damaging form of corruption was the practice of officers’ selling semipermanent leave to their subordinates. To save money (and probably for other reasons as well), the Syrian MoD moved many active soldiers to the reserve, demobilized many veterans, and discharged existing reservists. Many units were moved back to their barracks, which entailed more interaction with civilian life. It became easier for officers to do business, at the cost of attention to their duties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of 2024, it became common to hear from both Syrian and Russian sources that the Syrian armed forces would be unable to cope with an external war, or even with an internal crisis. An army officer noted that at the end of 2023 the Syrian government remained very weak in the south. Indeed, the 8th Brigade quickly joined the opposition in December 2024, becoming a leading actor in the collapse of regime control in the south.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I personally heard from different governmental officers and officials, and they confirmed that they are not happy at all with the Russian role in Syria in general and in Dara’a Province in particular. The Syrian government asked the Russian officers to take serious steps to empower the governmental department, security and police stations in different towns and villages in Dara’a. The key problem was that […] around 70 to 80% of Dara’a towns and villages have ex-fighters present, although the government has police and security stations in them, the real power and influence is with ex-fighters’ groups, which are sponsored and led by Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purges intended to roll back Russian influence in the armed forces suddenly appeared to backfire when the 25th Division, possibly the most effective unit in the entire army, failed to hold territory in the north in late November. Its new commander, Salah Abdullah, was replaced by his predecessor and Russian loyalist Suhail al Hasan on December 2, but by then it was too late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major consequence of corruption and declining financial support from Russia was manpower problems. A Syrian officer put the number of “active fighters” in the Syrian Arab Army at 100,000 in August 2024. Another source put its total strength at 150,000 in April 2024. These figures thus show its strength as almost equal to that recorded in July 2017, despite the incorporation of a number of militias into the army. The incorporation of the militias had contributed to the shrinking of the overall militia size from 147,000 to 55,000 over the same time span. Moreover, the remaining militias were no longer active. The NDF (National Defense Forces) had by then been demobilized and given a reserve role, with 39,000 men. Another 16,000 men were in the LDF (Local Defense Forces), at an even lower level of preparedness. The combined number of militias was down compared to 2021. In addition, in mid-2024 there were some 13,000 foreign militiamen, including 7,000 from Hizbollah, 3,000 from Fatimiyun, 1,000 from Zaynabyun and 2,000 Iraqis and Yemenis. During 2024, the IRGC and Hizbollah agreed on the latter pulling its forces out of Syria, with the Iranians mobilizing reserves from Iraqi, Afghan, Pakistani and other foreign militias. The IRGC was also planning to increase the number of militiamen, despite Syrian opposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia rescued the Syrian regime in 2015-16, but its ambitious plan to save the Syrian regime and rebuild a strong state in Syria got bogged down in the contradictions of that very regime. The Russians started losing faith in Assad and his government, but they were stuck in Syria by then. From 2017 onward, their efforts to strengthen the regime clashed with the interests of the Assad clique and ended up backfiring. As the Russians sponsored their choice of more capable commanding officers, Assad’s purges reserved their reforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the start of the war in Ukraine in 2022, Russia did reduce its commitments in Syria, pulling out forces and reducing funding. However, the trend of reducing support for the Assad regime had started earlier – no later than 2020, perhaps even earlier. Russia had also grown irritated at Assad’s rejection of its efforts to mediate a stable settlement. Assad, for his part, started worrying about what the Russians might be up to, after they had lobbied for his replacement at the head of the Syrian state. From there onward, relations between the two regimes deteriorated steadily. The Russians increasingly sought to bypass Assad and his clan to build their own network of loyalists within the Syrian armed forces. Assad tried to undermine their efforts, against which the Russians eventually retaliated by increasingly restricting support to units deemed to be loyal to them. Assad probably suspected the Russians were still plotting to replace him some day with someone more acceptable to opposition groups, the more so as the Russians had turned into de facto protectors of a number of opposition groups in the south. In late 2023-early 2024, a Syrian crackdown on Russian cronies within the security forces proved the turning point as far as Russian support to the Syrian regime was concerned, not the start of the Ukraine war in February 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russians also intensified their contacts with the Turks to reach a settlement, which seemed destined to take place over Assad’s head. Unsurprisingly, Assad sought to sabotage these efforts as well. Russia’s behavior undoubtedly resulted in a weakened regime in Syria, in part because some of the reforms were ill-conceived and in part because the regime rejected Russia’s efforts and sought to actively undermine them. It remains unclear whether the Russians expected their financial pressure could threaten the regime’s very existence. What is clear is that not just Syrians, but Russians too were aware of the regime’s growing weakness in 2024. Probably, the Russians wanted to gain leverage in their negotiations with Assad by making him and the regime feel that ignoring Russian demands has consequences. The Russians likely calculated that no foreign government would in the end step in to replace the Russian cash that was not accruing to Damascus anymore. In that calculation they proved right, but the regime, however worried it was, did not budge on key Russian demands – quite the contrary, as the purges of pro-Russian elements in the armed forces show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the collapse of the Assad regime was certainly a major image hit for Russia, in the long run what will matter is its ability to maintain military bases in Syria. There is not enough evidence to discuss the hypothesis that the collapse of December 2024 was in fact the culmination of Russian-Turkish talks. Russia might not be particularly interested in being “influential” in Syria per se, but it is certainly keen on retaining its bases there. If it could do that, likely thanks to Turkish intercession, it could claim a not-so-negative outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should Russia lose its bases, the reasons for this failure would still require assessment. Were Russian geopolitical and strategic assets dragged into the abyss because of an ill-conceived gamble to coerce the Syrian regime into reforming (an interpretation that Assad’s supporters would favor)? Or was the regime doomed anyway, and the Russians just decided to risk accelerating the collapse in a last-ditch effort to reform it (an interpretation that Russian officials would favor)? Or, perhaps, was the regime likely going to survive, but without serving Russia’s foreign policy and geostrategic aims while nevertheless draining billions of dollars from the Russian state coffers every year? Overall, the third hypothesis seems to be the most solid, even though it needs further investigation. Before the Russians started cutting their funding, it was not apparent that the Assad regime, though increasingly dysfunctional, was doomed. As important as the bases were for Russia, one might speculate that persistent recent Russian efforts to establish footholds in Libya and Sudan might have been driven by growing unease about the fate and/or safety of Tartus and Khmeimim, or even about the disproportionate overall cost of maintaining them (support for the regime plus the cost of Russian deployment). Assad’s refusal to seriously negotiate a political and geopolitical settlement was a major blow to Russia’s ambition as a regional power, an ambition that rested first and foremost on its role as a mediator between actors as different as Türkiye, Iran, Israel and the Arab states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has had an immense human cost, producing a level of physical destruction, human suffering, and displacement not seen in Europe since World War II. Since the war began, a large share of Ukraine’s workforce has emigrated or relocated within the country, enlisted in the military, or tragically become a casualty of the violence. In addition, unpredictable changes to the conscription and mobilization of men have significantly compressed the labor supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This difficult workforce situation affects business operations across Ukraine and threatens the country’s future reconstruction and growth prospects. According to an October 2024 survey by Ukraine’s Institute for Economic Research and Policy Consulting, labor shortages are the private sector’s top concern, with more than 60 percent of the companies consulted finding it difficult to hire qualified workers. At the same time, recent estimates show that the current unemployment rate in Ukraine stood at 12.7 percent in late 2024, meaning unemployment coexists with labor shortages that reflect pervasive skills mismatches across regions and sectors of the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even before the war, Ukraine was experiencing a challenging demographic scenario characterized by low birth rates, premature mortality among men, and emigration of young Ukrainians looking for better economic opportunities abroad. As a result of these negative trends, Ukraine will have a large deficit of workers in the future. The International Labor Organization (ILO) estimates the country will need an additional 8.6 million workers by 2032 (compared to 2022). The government of Ukraine, working with the international community and relevant stakeholders, will have to develop and implement a comprehensive human capital strategy to address current and future workforce needs. This will require a combination of short-term and long-term actions that seek to expand the country’s talent pool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ukraines-demographic-and-workforce-challenges&quot;&gt;Ukraine’s Demographic and Workforce Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s current workforce challenges are part of a larger demographic problem. The country’s birth rate is now the lowest in Europe: below 1 child per woman, compared to Eastern Europe’s average birthrate of approximately 1.3–1.8 children per woman. Moreover, high rates of premature deaths—especially among men—due to alcoholism, accidents, and lifestyle choices have contributed to the decline in population. Other ongoing trends such as emigration, overall poor health, and rapid aging have complicated the demographic landscape of the country (see Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/IfoiMcS.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Ukraine’s Annual Population Growth, 2015–2023.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://databank.worldbank.org/reports.aspx?source=2&amp;amp;country=UKR&quot;&gt;“World Development Indicators: Ukraine,” World Bank Group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last Ukrainian census, conducted in 2001, recorded a population of 48.5 million. Due to the war, many Ukrainians have emigrated abroad, an estimated 20,000 Ukrainian children have been forcibly deported to Russia, and thousands more are living under Russian occupation. Sadly, many Ukrainians have also perished. As of December 2024, President Volodymyr Zelensky reported that 43,000 Ukrainian troops have been killed. In addition, approximately 12,000 civilians have died and thousands of Ukrainians have been injured or disabled. According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), as of November 2024 there are around 4 million internally displaced people (IDPs) in Ukraine, 6.8 million refugees registered in other countries, and approximately 14.6 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance. As a result of these trends, Ukraine’s population has fallen to an estimated 35.8 million as of July 2024—or 31.1 million if considering only the areas where the government of Ukraine exercises full authority. If this situation is not addressed, the population of Ukraine could further shrink to 28.9 million by 2041 and to 25.2 million by 2051, according to Ukraine’s National Academy of Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Population declines and labor force contraction are producing a severe shock to Ukraine’s economy, with negative effects to be felt for years to come. Empirical studies indicate that time out of work can not only lead to the depreciation of skills, but also impacts national productivity and wages. A protracted conflict will have even more serious implications for educational attainment, which will have its own negative impacts on Ukraine’s future human capital. Due to wartime, schooling has been disrupted and children have therefore experienced learning losses. All in all, initial research by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development suggests the war in Ukraine will reduce the total factor of national productivity by 7 percent by 2035.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, poor mental health affects individuals and has ripple effects on society and the economy. Even before the latest war, an estimated 30 percent of the Ukrainian population had a mental health condition at some point in their lives. Within the first year of Russia’s invasion, an estimated 26 percent of Ukrainians met diagnostic requirements for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) alone. Although the added impact of mental health conditions and disabilities is difficult to quantify, it does lead to job absenteeism and loss of productivity. There is consensus that investments in mental health far outweigh the socioeconomic costs of leaving individuals untreated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;challenges-for-women-and-veterans&quot;&gt;Challenges for Women and Veterans&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even before the war, the Ukrainian labor market faced inefficiencies and inequities and was not reaching its full potential. In 2020, there were more than 10 million working-age Ukrainians (between 15 and 70 years) outside the labor force. Some of them were pensioners and students, but working-age women were also not actively participating in the labor market. While the labor force participation rate in Ukraine was 67 percent in 2021, the average for Central Europe and the Baltic States was approximately 73 percent (Figure 2). As discussed above, the war caused more people to exit the workforce, shrinking it by over 25 percent in 2023 compared to 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within this context, there are unique challenges that women and veterans are facing in the economy. Before Russia’s invasion, there was a prominent gender gap of 15 percentage points in workforce participation and a wage gap of 18.6 percent. The war has compounded the preexisting structural disparities in the Ukrainian economy, with the wage gap now more than 30 percent. Moreover, of the 5.4 million IDPs as of January 2023, 55 percent were women and girls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war has also altered Ukrainian women’s role in society and the economy. They are expected to care not only for their children, but also for the elderly and other family members with reduced mobility. Outside of household obligations, women are also increasingly heading family businesses. According to recent estimates, more than half of the new businesses launched during the war are led by women. However, they are often sole proprietors, while bigger companies are predominately run by men. According to a study by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Investment and Trade Facilitation Center, women entrepreneurs are most active in sectors such as services, trade, education, and creative industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Veterans are also an important demographic group for revitalizing the nation’s economy. Once the war ends and the government launches the demobilization process, veterans are expected to number more than 5 million, most of them of working age. Successfully reintegrating veterans into the economy will be an important channel through which Ukraine can address its human capital issue. Veterans bring both hard skills (for instance in mechanics, operating machinery, and telecommunications) and soft skills (such as resilience, teamwork, leadership, adaptability, and creativity) from their battlefield experience that can be applied to many sectors and occupations. Estimates from Ukraine’s Ministry for Veterans Affairs indicate that any money invested in the rehabilitation of veterans will see a sixfold return on investment for the economy. Moreover, veterans will be integral to building social cohesion and reconstructing Ukraine. As such, they are advocating for fair, transparent, and efficient programs to better support their reintegration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2021, Ukrainians’ trust in the armed forces has been at an all-time high, surging to 96 percent in September 2022. Despite the value placed on veterans and the government programs aimed at assisting them, this group still faces many reintegration challenges. According to a recent poll, among the main challenges Ukrainians believe veterans will face when integrating back to civil life include “psychoemotional instability, issues with physical health, difficulties in accessing medical assistance, the absence of inclusive spaces and adapted workplaces for individuals with disabilities, as well as challenges related to the processing of social benefits.” Of the roughly 300,000 Ukrainians who have been severely injured and disabled due to the war, the majority are veterans. Unfortunately, many spaces such as apartment buildings, private sector workspaces, educational institutions, and government facilities are not designed to be accessible—lacking, for instance, ramps or elevators. This acts as a significant barrier to both the employment and daily activities of disabled Ukrainians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to government estimates, unemployment among veterans is currently double that of the civilian population, at more than 30 percent. Organizations working with veterans point out that employers are reluctant to hire them since there is a stereotypical view that all veterans have mental health problems and are affected by PTSD. In addition, people in the workplace often do not know how to interact with veterans and lack tactful communication skills. Very few companies have good onboarding processes, especially when it comes to employing veterans. At the same time, the average pay in the armed forces is usually higher compared to other sectors. Many veterans thus prefer to start their own businesses since they can command a higher income and do not have to interact as much with coworkers who might have certain biases toward them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has a State Employment Service that helps with job matching and training. The agency has programs for women, IDPs, veterans, and other categories of unemployed workers to help them find jobs and provides micro-grants for entrepreneurs. The Ministry for Veterans Affairs also offers training, vouchers, job matching, and opportunities for veterans to help them start businesses. However, these agencies could serve these demographic groups more effectively. For example, there is a lack of interagency effort to advertise programs for veterans, especially in smaller towns and rural areas. In addition, while younger veterans can access digital platforms that promote jobs and support programs, older ones may have more difficulty with technology and getting this information. As a result, surveys find that many Ukrainians—especially those living in western regions and relatives of army members—feel the state is not fulfilling its obligations to veterans. This negative sentiment has been steadily rising; in August 2022, 69 percent believed that “the state fulfills its obligations to veterans,” but only 25 percent did by March 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, there are regulatory bottlenecks that prevent women, people with disabilities, and veterans from being more active in the workforce. The Labor Law of Ukraine, adopted during the Soviet period, is more than 50 years old. While some parts of the code have been updated, it remains largely unchanged and still contains archaic, unfair, and rigid labor regulations. For example, overtime is not allowed, there are few provisions for remote or gig work, and working women with children under three are still barred from traveling for business. Legislation and lack thereof also presents an obstacle for disabled people—such as the lack of anti-discrimination policies and requirements that they obtain employment permits that are valid only for one sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These obstacles are even more numerous for the many disabled veterans. Currently, there is a provision that if the Central Military Medical Board considers someone physically or mentally unfit to serve in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, they are likewise barred from joining the National Police Service in any capacity. Easing some of these requirements, depending on the degree of disability, would provide workers and employers more flexibility and improve the functioning of Ukraine’s labor market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;current-initiatives-and-potential-solutions&quot;&gt;Current Initiatives and Potential Solutions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a long time, Ukraine lacked a vision for comprehensive demographic development, but the government has now started taking steps to address these issues, particularly as they apply to the workforce. Under the EU Ukraine Facility, it has prepared the Ukraine Plan outlining four major areas of focused development: education and skills, healthcare access and rehabilitation services, reintegration of workers into the labor market, and increasing the economic and social capacity of the population. This plan will also play an integral role in institutional overhauls viewed as imperative to successful EU accession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, on September 30, 2024, the Cabinet of Ministers released the Strategy for the Demographic Development of Ukraine until 2040. Developed by the Ministry of Social Policy with support from a variety of national and international partners, the strategy lays out six important goals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create conditions for immigration and reducing Ukrainian emigration;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;increase the birth rate and support growing families;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;reduce the premature mortality rates;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;increase workforce participation and modernize the labor market;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;encourage IDPs to return home or relocate to areas with labor shortages; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;improve overall quality of life in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the help of international partners, in November 2024, the Ministry of Social Policy approved the action plan that details how to operationalize the strategy until 2040. The plan puts emphasis in six main areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Supporting the growth of birth rates and families;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;reducing premature mortality;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;attracting migrants and promoting the return of Ukrainians from abroad;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;promoting active longevity;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;developing infrastructure for quality living; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;increasing employment for vulnerable groups.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, the economic empowerment of Ukrainian women has been a major focus of the wartime government. In December 2022, the Cabinet of Ministers adopted the Strategy for the Implementation of Gender Equality in Education until 2030, to ensure equal rights and opportunities for women and men in education. In September 2023, the Ukrainian government also enacted the National Strategy for Reducing the Gender Pay Gap until 2030, which seeks to address wage disparities in the labor market and the unequal distribution of domestic responsibilities between men and women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the request of the government of Ukraine, the ILO modeled alternative scenarios, examining labor inputs across different economic sectors. It found that Ukraine will need 8.6 million additional workers between 2022 and 2032 to achieve the country’s GDP targets. These labor market projections indicate that around 60 percent of additional employment would be in the service sector, 27.4 percent in industry, and 12.6 percent in agriculture. Around 35.4 percent of new workers would be in high-skill jobs, 47.6 percent in medium-skill jobs, and 17 percent in low-skill ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of these projections, Ukraine has an opportunity to broaden its labor force and incorporate underserved groups into the economy: women, veterans, people with disabilities, older workers, and IDPs. Given the increasing role women and veterans have been playing due to the war, these groups should be part of the policymaking process and future reconstruction talks. Although the United Nations has found that women play big role in peacebuilding and reconstruction, for instance, they are often excluded from the labor market, formal peace processes, and overall decisionmaking. The EU accession process will provide Ukrainian women additional opportunities for more economic empowerment and inclusion. Ukraine also needs to address veterans’ reintegration, as well as the social frictions between Ukrainians who stayed in the country and those who decided to leave. Veterans are especially sensitive toward the issue of transparency—whether in recruitment, training, or workforce incentives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are numerous opportunities to integrate Ukrainians into the labor market and stem the country’s massive brain drain. This will include both short-term and long-term efforts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;short-term-measures&quot;&gt;Short-Term Measures&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design “quick” training programs to increase labor force participation.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all jobs in Ukraine require a university degree or a high level of skills. A fair amount of them demand intense physical labor, and Ukraine needs to have people who are trained and ready for these jobs. Women could be incentivized to join sectors that are traditionally male-dominated, including energy, trade, transport, construction, and information technology. In particular, there are opportunities to incorporate women, veterans, and older workers into the defense-industrial complex, renewable energy, and cybersecurity—sectors that will play an important role in strengthening Ukraine’s security. Training women for blue-collar jobs could also be beneficial. For example, one training program is targeting women to become truck drivers, of which there is currently a shortage. Similarly, women are being trained and hired to do more physically demanding jobs, such as manufacturing steel (as at ArcelorMittal’s plant) or military equipment. There are also significant immediate needs in the healthcare sector, where not all jobs require extensive medical training. Programs like Lecturio and others offer a range of online training modules that are specifically designed for healthcare workers in conflict zones.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create an integrated veterans’ platform linked to the municipalities.&lt;/strong&gt; Although there are programs to support veterans, they are not interconnected and not widely known among the target group. In this regard, building a unique platform tied to municipal governments (hromadas) would make it easier for veterans to search for information about support programs, access benefits, and receive career guidance showing how different occupations contribute to the economy and to the construction of a modern Ukraine. Financial literacy among veterans and their families is severely lacking, and although veterans receive various forms of financial support, it is important to provide them with guidance on spending and investing their money to make the best use of it. This would not only help them integrate into civilian life but assist them with long-term planning.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modernize public employment services.&lt;/strong&gt; The Kyiv School of Economics has recommended specific steps to modernize the State Employment Service (SES) to make it more valuable for jobseekers and employers. One effort would be to decentralize the agency by placing services within city administrations, which have a more accurate picture of the social challenges and the business activities within their jurisdictions. Moreover, business associations and civil society organizations that work with vulnerable groups can be better linked digitally to the employment service, for example, through Diia, a digital portal that allows citizens to access more than 100 government services. Donors such as Estonia are providing technical assistance and training to SES staff to improve the functioning of the agency and align it with EU standards.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reform the Labor Code to provide more hiring flexibility.&lt;/strong&gt; Although labor reform is by no means an easy task, there are certain provisions that could provide more leeway in hiring various employees. This includes allowing nighttime and remote work, for example, and eliminating special restrictions on categories of workers. To this end, a new code has been drafted and is currently being discussed in Ukrainian Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Launch targeted training for companies and business associations.&lt;/strong&gt; This entails developing a national program to train employers to effectively integrate and support veterans in the workforce, taking into consideration mental health and trauma-informed management. Companies and business associations could also offer courses for managers and human resources staff on how to onboard veterans and IDPs, as well as how to communicate with them in the workplace. In order not to alienate veterans, there is a need for better education and communication so that they are treated not as victims but as part of society at large.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;medium--to-long-term-measures&quot;&gt;Medium- to Long-Term Measures&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop a comprehensive skilling strategy.&lt;/strong&gt; To foster an experienced and adaptable workforce, the government of Ukraine will have to partner with businesses and universities in driving both skilling and upskilling efforts, utilizing quality online learning platforms to ensure broader accessibility for users across regions. One example of such a partnership is the recently launched ReSkillUA In addition, leveraging technology and artificial intelligence (AI) solutions will be critical in identifying skills gaps within the workforce, thereby enabling the development of tailored, individualized training programs so workers can meet the demands of the future. To support these initiatives, a diaspora fund that attracts remittances and foreign investment could provide part of the financing for innovative skilling projects.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop targeted programs for vulnerable groups.&lt;/strong&gt; To fully integrate all segments of society into the labor market, Ukraine will need more investment into assistive technologies for veterans and people with disabilities. Unfortunately, given the number of soldiers and civilians that lost limbs, the need for prosthetics is high. Ukraine could potentially become one of the major leaders in prosthetics technologies. It is equally important to provide relevant services for disabled citizens, from accessible houses to workplace accommodations. In this regard, Ukraine needs to find more creative solutions for housing, including modular construction and the repurposing of vacant offices or government buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, a “care economy” that provides childcare, elder care, and healthcare would help ease the burden on those—particularly women—who have not been able to seek work due to the need to take care of their relatives. This would also create enormous possibilities for launching small- and medium-sized enterprises and give women more opportunities to start businesses and participate in the labor force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase investment in mental health.&lt;/strong&gt; Tackling Ukraine’s human capital issue is not just about learning and skills, it will require a whole-of-person approach that addresses basic physical and mental health as well. Although Ukrainian First Lady Olena Zelenska has made mental health a priority, making headway on this front will necessitate significant investments and reforms to the current system, which still has a strong practice of institutionalizing patients. Among the priorities are to increase outpatient facilities and make mental health interventions more community based. According to some estimates, such preliminary efforts will require doubling current mental health investment over the next five to ten years.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modernize technical and vocational education and training (TVET).&lt;/strong&gt; As already mentioned, not all jobs will require a university degree, and not all future jobs will be in new fields such as tech and renewable energy. Although there is a recognition that technical and vocational education is needed, these professions have lower prestige in Ukraine, and workers encounter a range of stereotypes. Ukraine should reform its TVET system to better align it with the needs of employers and provide more avenues for workers to learn on the job through internships and apprenticeships. In this regard, it will be also important to educate youth in secondary schools about the different career opportunities that exist for them and promote vocational and technical education as a reputable career path.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop a comprehensive immigration strategy.&lt;/strong&gt; Beyond safety, pay differentials between Ukraine and neighboring countries also prompt many people to emigrate. Although wages in Ukraine have been rising, they are still much lower than in EU countries. Developing and implementing a comprehensive immigration strategy could entice Ukrainians to come back and attract other migrant populations. Elements of the strategy could include incentivizing IDPs to relocate to certain parts of the country to address skills gaps, offering income tax incentives for qualified prospective immigrants, encouraging countries with large numbers of Ukrainian refugees to help finance the Ukrainian government (such as various European nations funding Ukrainian pensions and the United States covering the salaries of first responders), or collaborating with diaspora organizations to promote opportunities and facilitate the return of Ukrainians living abroad. Developing partnerships with foreign businesses and government agencies that could second their employees to Ukraine might also be an innovative option.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important asset for Ukraine’s present and future development is its people—so the process of expanding and strengthening Ukraine’s human capital should start now, not once the war is over. In this regard, there are numerous opportunities to integrate more Ukrainians into the labor market and prevent further brain drain. This will require efforts to support demographic groups that have historically not fully participated in the labor market, including women, veterans, persons with disabilities, and older workers. Given the increasing role that women and veterans have been playing in the economy due to the war, these groups should also be part of the policymaking process and future reconstruction talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Russian and Ukrainian forces are in a process of adaptation in the pursuit of advantage. Over time, this leads to new capabilities being fielded, tactics applied and lessons relevant to Ukraine and its international partners. The purpose of this report is to survey tactical developments during 2024 that characterise the fighting at time of publication and to highlight areas where military–technical assistance to Ukraine can be improved and where NATO militaries should adapt to keep pace with the threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report is based on fieldwork conducted in Ukraine in November 2024 and January 2025, with the authors having visited two air assault brigades, a marine brigade, a mechanised brigade, a jaeger brigade and assault units along the Donetsk and Sumy fronts. This is not an academic study but a series of field notes and should be read in parallel with other analysis. The report endeavours to outline the prevailing tactical dynamics before exploring emerging aspects of various tactical functions, including ground close combat, fires, engineering, medical support, logistics and air defence operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a side does not achieve victory within the opening phases of a conflict, protracted warfare necessitates a continuous process of adaptation and counter-adaptation between the parties. The Russo–Ukrainian War has been consistent with this trend, such that the fighting in the first, second and third years of the war saw substantial changes in the composition of forces, equipment, tactics and relative competitive advantages of the combatants. The first year of the war was characterised by comparatively small groupings of well-equipped forces resulting in a mobile conflict. The second year saw the consolidation of areas of control and deliberate attempts to breach the line of contact, first by Russia and then by Ukraine. The third year was highly attritional, with the focus of both parties being the infliction of maximum damage on one another, rather than breakthrough. The available technology with which the war has been waged has also evolved over this period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors of this paper have worked in Ukraine throughout the conflict, and documented the character of the fighting at intervals, noting tactical developments and their operational implications for Ukraine, for support provided by Ukraine’s international partners, and for training and equipment programmes among NATO forces. This report builds on this work, providing an overview of tactical developments as they stand in February 2025 as the war enters its fourth year. The purpose of this paper is to describe the systems of fighting employed by Russian and Ukrainian forces and to identify where changes in how the forces fight reflect peculiarities of the current situation and where they suggest significant changes that will endure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not an academic study. This paper constitutes research notes from fieldwork conducted in November 2024 and January 2025. As this work was written in Ukraine and under conditions consistent with operational security, it does not engage with wider commentaries on the current character of the war. That does not suggest any inadequacy in other studies, and the conclusions and observations in this paper should be read in parallel with similar work carried out by a range of esteemed colleagues. Please also note that this paper provides a discussion of tactics and not an assessment as to the likely outcome of engagements by sector. It does not set out to make predictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The observations contained in this report are based on interviews by the authors with staff and personnel from air assault brigades, a marine brigade, a jaeger brigade, a mechanised brigade, an artillery brigade and assault units holding key sectors on the Donetsk and Sumy fronts. The authors also spoke to air defence troops and observed Ukrainian mobile air defence groups, as well as being briefed by personnel of the Donetsk and Sumy Operational Commands, the Joint Strategic–Operational Command, officers of the Ukrainian General Staff, representatives of the Ukrainian Special Services and members of Stavka. Finally, the authors compared these observations with officers responsible for the provision of military technical assistance from Ukraine’s international partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper is focused on tactical dynamics. The body of the report is therefore broken down into tactical functions including ground close combat, fires, engineering, reconnaissance, logistics and resupply, medical support and air defence. Some tactical functions such as aviation operations are not covered because these were not observed by the authors during the period of study. This does not mean that other tactical functions lack importance. However, developments in these areas must be understood within a wider operational context and so the paper begins with a description of the operational situation extant at the time of writing. The paper then concludes with two sections of deductions, the first relating to implications for military technical assistance to Ukraine and the second relevant for NATO forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is, of course, a wider political context unfolding, with President Donald Trump endeavouring to bring about a cessation of hostilities through economic coercion and diplomatic entreaties with Moscow. This falls beyond the scope of this paper, which is confined to military dynamics and therefore the assumption that fighting continues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;operational-context&quot;&gt;Operational Context&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategic objective of the Russian Federation remains the political subjugation of Ukraine by forcing Kyiv to capitulate through military force. In pursuit of this objective, the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (AFRF) are currently pursuing the destruction of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) through a firepower-intensive attritional fight over critical terrain in Donetsk Oblast as their main effort. Simultaneously Ukraine is holding Russian territory in Kursk Oblast, endeavouring to fix Russian forces away from Kharkiv and maintain leverage in the event of negotiations. The AFRF are endeavouring to evict the AFU from Russian territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The piecemeal capture of territory at great cost and the lack of broader or rapid movement on the frontline can give the appearance of a lack of any decisive effect. However, Russia’s ground campaign has maintained constant attritional pressure on Ukraine throughout the war, with lost personnel requiring replacement, alongside materiel and munitions which must be regenerated or replaced. As Russia’s mobilisation of its industry and population got underway, it has been able to stretch the AFU across an extended frontline, and at the time of writing, Russia has a viable but not assured pathway to achieving its main effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian Operational Group of Forces attacking Ukraine currently consists of approximately 580,000 troops. Approximately 70,000 of these are fighting in Kursk Oblast, augmented by approximately 10,000 North Korean soldiers, with more DPRK units likely to arrive in before May 2025. A further 80,000 troops are currently operating on the Kharkiv axis, endeavouring to expand a bridgehead over the Oskil River. The largest grouping of Russian forces is in Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts, comprising some 230,000 troops, advancing on a broad front with the immediate aim of isolating and then reducing Pokrovsk and attacking Konstyantynivka and Kramatorsk over the course of 2025. To the south, Russian forces have seized Velyka Novosilka and are likely to continue to slowly advance towards the border of Dnipro Oblast, bypassing the Ukrainian southern defence line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should the Ukrainian salient in Kursk be withdrawn, it is likely that the AFRF will divert capacity to expand its efforts to threaten Kharkiv Oblast. The AFRF also maintain a grouping of forces in Southern Ukraine of approximately 140,000 troops. At present, this group of forces is holding the line of contact on the southern front, with most of its efforts focused on garrisoning Crimea and fixing Ukrainian forces in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia through strikes and a latent threat against Ukrainian shipping in Kherson and Mykolaiv. There are regular strikes across the Dnipro River and intermittent attempts to cross in small groups, though the size of the force does not threaten a larger operation at this stage. The effect is to fix Ukrainian forces. The AFRF are also continuing to conduct widespread and regular long-range strikes on Ukrainian training bases, airfields and critical national infrastructure. This campaign involves a combination of daily strikes using Geran-2 and Gerbera UAVs and periodic ballistic and cruise missile salvos. The campaign inflicts persistent damage but is highly unlikely to prove decisive this winter. Its greatest military impact is fixing Ukrainian air defence across the country and depleting Ukrainian and NATO air defence interceptor stockpiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure the AFRF can continue these efforts, Russia contracted more than 400,000 additional troops in 2024, enabling the expansion of its forces despite a very high rate of casualties. Russia is anticipated to reduce its recruitment targets for 2025, but is still expected to recruit more personnel than it loses over this period. Russian forces were often suffering more than 200 personnel killed per day during 2024 with over 1,200 casualties per day towards the end of the year. A significant proportion of wounded are returned to service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia is also significantly increasing the production of ammunition and key classes of equipment, with over 70,000 unified gliding and correction modules (UMPK) glide bombs ordered for 2025. However, a large proportion of ammunition for artillery is currently procured from North Korea and is of low quality. Russia is also likely to face reduced availability of armoured vehicles over 2025 as it depletes stores of old vehicles and must depend upon newly produced platforms to replace losses. The primary tactical problems the AFRF imposes on the AFU, however, will be unaffected by these considerations, as will be discussed later in this paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AFU continue to have to defend the entire 1,200-km line of contact. Although the Ukrainian Defence Forces – including police, border guards and other security functions – comprise some 800,000 personnel, most of these are fixed on tasks separate from combat operations. The available combat power of the AFU comprises less than 25% of the force. The need to defend such a broad front means that although in aggregate the force ratio between the AFU and Russian Operational Group of Forces is favourable, the actual force ratio between combat units in any given sector is between 1:2 and 1:6. This is because the Russian Operational Group of Forces does not include the security and whole support structure for the Russian Armed Forces, so a higher proportion consists of combat troops. In many sectors, the greatest challenge for the AFU is the shortage of combat troops. Although Ukraine is suffering heavy casualties, it does have reserves of manpower that can address this challenge. The biggest problems in achieving this, aside from equipment and armaments shortages, are training, personnel management and morale among troops who have been engaged in heavy fighting for three years and perceive a deteriorating tactical situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine is endeavouring to increase the costs on the AFRF through the attrition of its forces and an expanded deep-strike campaign against Russian revenue-generating centres (such as oil refineries), operational stockpiles of ammunition and defence industrial facilities. If sustained, these attacks will have a significant effect on Russia’s ability to sustain the current scale of recruitment and military industrial mobilisation. However, this will take time. It therefore remains critical that Ukraine can hold the front for long enough to reap the rewards of its deep-strike campaign and the persistent attrition of Russian forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Ukrainian political objectives – of bringing about a lasting peace – have many non-military dependencies as regards security guarantees and economic stability, the foremost military objective is the stabilisation of the front. For this to be possible, a range of tactical problems must be addressed which are currently enabling the AFRF to maintain a steady rate of advance. It is therefore essential that Ukraine and its international partners work to resolve the extant tactical problems to create the military conditions for a successful political conclusion of the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tactical-context-and-the-russian-offensive-triangle&quot;&gt;Tactical Context and the Russian Offensive Triangle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the war is recognisable from early 2023, characterised by the artillery battle and layered defences of trenches and fortifications. Yet Russian adaptations have aggregated and become an offensive triangle of three primary combined arms that are creating competing dilemmas for Ukrainian forces. First, the AFRF continue to pin down Ukrainian ground forces on the line of contact with infantry and mechanised forces, much as in the second and third years of the conflict. Second, they prevent manoeuvre and inflict attrition with first-person view drones (FPVs), Lancet drones and artillery firing both high-explosive shells and scatterable mines. Although this was the case earlier in the conflict, the scale of wire-guided FPV employment and density of persistent ISR has further exacerbated the tactical challenges to resupply, casualty evacuation and the concealment and protection of prestige equipment. Third, the AFRF has increased its use of UMPK glide bombs against Ukrainian forces who are holding defensive positions. Although these were used in 2023, the massive expansion of this tactic in 2024, set to increase further in 2025, creates a competing dilemma: should the AFU hold and invest in static defensive positions to reduce attrition from FPVs and drone-enabled artillery, or retain mobility to avoid destruction from glide bomb strikes, which have the explosive yield to demolish or bury even well-prepared fortifications?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The return of the Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS) is the primary dynamic driving broader changes to how the AFRF is inflicting attrition of the AFU on the frontline. Prior to the introduction of the UMPK glide bomb at large scale, the VKS was a powerful but latent threat that was unable to venture too close to the frontlines due to Ukrainian air defences’ ability to inflict unacceptable losses on it. Should Ukraine’s supply of air-defence munitions run dry due to the long-running strategic air campaign targeting Ukrainian critical national infrastructure with one-way attack (OWA) UAVs and cruise missiles, Russian crewed aviation would regain the freedom to penetrate deep into Ukrainian territory and inflict much greater damage than is possible with uncrewed strike systems. This made the provision of Western air defence a priority line of effort which, along with Ukrainian adaptation and use of less technologically advanced short-range air defence to provide local defence and complement long-range systems, has been a success story. In the interim, the VKS were limited for the most part to contributing to the strategic air campaign or providing sporadic fire support with lofting munitions on the front line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glide bombs gave the VKS teeth without the need to first achieve air superiority or gain the ability to penetrate Ukrainian airspace. A simple stand-off strike capability against which Ukraine has no effective countermeasures, the UMPK glide bombs comprises a conventional low-drag bombs modified with deployable wings and a cheap GNSS guidance kit. These are predominantly the FAB-500 and FAB-1500 aerial bomb, along with limited numbers of similar munitions of different yields. While these were initially considered individually dangerous but not game-changing, or even a sign of Russian desperation, their mass-producibility rapidly proved a key advantage. Due to the strength of Russia’s integrated air defence systems, the VKS has been able to launch glide bombs across the frontline with the crewed launch aircraft remaining at a safe distance of between 30 and 90 km, depending on the size and thus the glide efficiency of the bomb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rise in UMPK glide bomb production from 40,000 units in 2024 to 70,000 units anticipated in 2025, has significantly increased the number of Ukrainian troops killed during defensive operations. This has had numerous knock-on effects for the different arms and services, as they have been pushed to completely avoid observation of their positions, to disperse or seek concealment underground, and to rely on uncrewed or autonomous systems to keep and kill the enemy at arm’s length.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AFU have imposed a different set of dilemmas on Russian forces. The AFU’s approach to defence in depth and to imposing attrition at longer range has made it very costly for Russian forces to make gains. This has limited Russia’s ability to build up tempo or to exploit breaches in defence lines. While Russia has found an effective formula for inflicting heavy casualties on Ukraine, it has not found a successful formula for breaching defences without taking massive losses in equipment and personnel. Russia can still succeed on these terms owing to its greater mass, but it is evident that despite several experimental approaches to assaults, Russia lacks an effective concept of offensive action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;evolving-ground-close-combat-tactics&quot;&gt;Evolving Ground Close-Combat Tactics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ground close-combat tactics differ considerably between Ukrainian and Russian forces. Russian forces have fixed combined-arms armies and divisions on key axes, with the regiments and battalions beneath rotated and replenished as they suffer losses. Russian units, upon entering the line, tend to conduct wide-ranging advances to contact in section strength, endeavouring to identify Ukrainian positions. First, they send sections/squads of poorly trained troops, perhaps eight personnel at a time (although some larger attacks consist of up to 30 personnel supported by one or two infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs)). These are ordered to advance towards where they assess Ukrainian positions to be, conducting reconnaissance by drawing fire. If the group encounters resistance, Russian commanders assess where they believe the best lines of approach are, and in particular, where the boundaries between defensive units lie. If Ukrainian positions are positively identified, sections are persistently sent forward to attack positions, which are further mapped and then targeted with artillery, FPVs and UMPK glide bombs. When rotation or disruption of the defence is achieved, Russian units aim to conduct more deliberate assault actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian assault actions consist of armoured vehicles or light mobility vehicles endeavouring to transport troops as close to Ukrainian positions as possible before the infantry rush the positions; battle drills, direct fire control and fire and manoeuvre are either primitive or absent. Russian troops that make it into cover will often lie low and await successive waves to follow until a critical mass of troops have entered the defensive positions, at which point they will rush to the defenders. Actions are rarely above section size, unless fog or peculiarities of the defence favour a larger attack, in which case, platoon actions are sometimes launched, followed up with attacks to clear the positions, utilising better trained and -equipped troops. The tempo of attacks tends to be high when the Russian unit initially deploys. One Ukrainian brigade outlined an average tempo of 27 section attacks per day along part of its sector. However, the tempo tends to diminish and become more deliberate as the unit suffers casualties, until it has taken 30% casualties and is rotated. The constant use of artillery, FPVs and UMPK glide bombs makes it very difficult for Ukrainian defenders to hold positions if they face an intact attack force. Ukrainian forces therefore seek to anticipate the routes to be used for attacks each day and lay anti-personnel (AP) and anti-tank (AT) mines and prepare fires to engage Russian troops before they engage the positions in direct fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian troops report that North Korean troops operated quite differently when they originally entered the conflict. North Korean troops tended to conduct attacks in company or battalion strength on a single sector. The Ukrainians were able to inflict mass casualties during these attacks, but the North Koreans often overwhelmed the Ukrainian defenders’ positions, which were sparse, optimised to counter Russian tactics. North Korean troops were reportedly fit, motivated and aggressive and had good internal unit cohesion. After losing approximately a quarter of their initial force, however, they have begun to adopt and learn Russian tactics to better conserve their manpower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian troops’ willingness to continue attacking even when they suffer heavy casualties appears to have a range of explanations. First, Russian troops are routinely threatened with being “zeroed”/“nullified” or executed if they retreat from an attack. In practice, they are often punished by being assigned to future attacks under unfavourable conditions. It is therefore often safer for Russian soldiers to go to ground – rather than retreat – and await more Russian troops to arrive. Propaganda about treatment if captured has also driven some Russian soldiers to commit suicide rather than be captured when injured, though this is not a widespread phenomenon. North Korean troops have shown a much higher tendency to commit suicide to avoid capture or if seriously wounded, either with a grenade or by “rolling onto the rifle”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Russia and Ukraine rely on extensive digging and concealment to create uncertainty about where their main defensive strongpoints are, utilising many dummy and decoy positions. Russian platoons regularly occupy defensive positions dug to the specifications of a company position according to Russian doctrine. Frontages are covered by mixed AP and AT minefields, preventing enemy forces from manoeuvring or rapidly approaching. Russian formations seed minefields systematically, whereas Ukrainian forces – partly owing to limitations on supply – tend to seed mines on axes and terrain features where they anticipate the Russians will carry out deliberate attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian tactics, are premised upon extending the depth of their fires and dispersing their force to avoid casualties. The pervasive threat from fires causes units to dig extensively, by hand in the forward positions, and to reduce force density. There is admittedly variation by brigade and across different terrain. Some units favour greater concentration, relying on their ability to hide and employ decoys and reversionary positions to which they are able to relocate, while others revert to greater dispersion. The range for an infantry section’s area of responsibility is 70–200 m, with troops often occupying fighting positions separated by approximately 50 m, in fireteams of two to three personnel. One brigade reported holding a 27 km-frontage with just four battalions. The exact design and layout of fighting positions, trenches and dug-outs vary from unit to unit and depending on available time, equipment and materials. The low density across the unit’s frontage is partly made up for in depth, with an infantry company arrayed over 3 km of depth under a battalion in approximately 7 km of depth. The range of offensive engagements by the unit is often 10–15 km depending on its capabilities. The preference is to maximise attrition beyond line of sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armoured vehicles are used for both indirect and direct fire, though the latter is currently preferred. The threat from enemy FPVs means that tanks and infantry fighting vehicles must be concealed and ideally dug in, usually within 3 km of the frontline if they are assigned to combat roles. Because of the high latency of FPV sorties, armoured fighting vehicles tend to sally forwards from these hides to engage in direct-fire missions to break up enemy assault actions. The vehicles then return to their protected hides before they can be targeted. Tank-on-tank engagements have increased in regularity because of these tactics. It is noteworthy that every Ukrainian brigade aims to field a company or battalion of tanks, with availability varying considerably between formations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian offensive tactics differ from those of the AFRF in that they tend to be very deliberate, with extensive intelligence collection and setting of conditions. For example, the offensive into Kursk involved up to a month of preparatory collection and shaping fires, even though the initial break-in comprised a two-point breach at a small scale. Ukrainian assault detachments conduct careful mission rehearsal and rarely operate in groups above 20 personnel. The assault troops trained and used for this purpose tend also be held in reserve and recovered when they have completed their combat task, to be replaced by ground-holding line infantry. All assault actions, however, must be enabled by fires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fires-attrition-in-depth&quot;&gt;Fires: Attrition in Depth&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shorter-ranged tactical fires have been shaped by Ukrainian improvements in electronic protection and the expanded use of FPVs by both Russian and Ukrainian forces. FPVs have been improved with autonomous terminal guidance and wire spools, which render them impervious to electronic disruption. While reports from Ukrainian operators indicate that this type of wired-control link comes with some downsides – including degraded flight performance, a comparatively limited range of approximately 10 km and running the risk of entanglement with obstacles – it provides a reliable means of penetrating areas of heavy jamming of GPS and radio frequencies which would otherwise make strikes impossible, and of overcoming tactical electronic countermeasures in the terminal attack phase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All Ukrainian formations field a mix of attack UAVs, ranging from light and heavy bomber drones to FPVs. Most brigades have a UAV company or battalion, and dedicated UAV units are allocated to support sections of front between 40 and 70 km wide. As Ukrainian forces do not yet widely employ wire-guided FPVs, the timing of when they can conduct strikes depends on gaps in electronic protection. These gaps can be induced through the suppression of enemy electronic warfare (EW) using artillery, or through planned pauses in friendly jamming to enable strike systems to get airborne. Generally, FPV and bomber operations are cued with intelligence and by quadcopter spotter drones, or by longer-range fixed-wing reconnaissance UAVs. FPV fire missions tend to be coordinated from battalion and brigade command posts. Different systems are optimised for different targets and times of the day. Bomber drones tend to deliver a heavier payload and so reliably do more damage to targets. However, their slow speed and need to hover above the target means they are predominantly employed at night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tactical UAVs have significant limitations. Between 60 and 80% of Ukrainian FPVs fail to reach their target, depending on the part of the front and the skill of the operators. Of those that do strike their targets, a majority fail to destroy the target system when striking armoured vehicles. The success rate in wounding infantry is high. Furthermore, there are long periods where either EW or the weather significantly degrades UAV operations. With FPVs that are remotely piloted by radio frequency, it is also difficult to concentrate multiple drones in time and space because they can interfere with one another’s guidance systems. Despite these limitations, tactical UAVs currently account for 60–70% of damaged and destroyed Russian systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above figure must be read in the appropriate context. During extended discussions with Ukrainian officers on multiple axes and from multiple brigades – two of which had an exceptionally high rates of efficiency with FPVs – the officers repeatedly reiterated that they needed artillery. They emphasised that UAVs alone were inadequate and that they were most effective when used in combination with artillery. For example, artillery was effective at suppressing or displacing EW and air defences or suppressing infantry protecting key targets from bomber UAVs. Artillery was also able to defend the front in poor weather and was generally more responsive. Combined UAV and artillery operations often maximised the destruction achieved with, for example, an FPV immobilising a vehicle and artillery killing dismounts as they emerged. To give an example of the difference, a fires officer described the hours it had taken to plan and eventually immobilise a tank using FPVs, compared with an engagement where a platoon of Russian tanks were manoeuvring and, having located them with a drone, he fired five BONUS shells at them, knocking out all three tanks within two minutes. The pervasiveness of the threat of FPVs, however, which can hunt while their crews are relatively safe, makes them a persistent cause of attrition. Ukrainian commanders would like to inflict casualties on Russian forces from approximately 15 km from their defence lines, with the persistent threat of FPVs forcing the Russians to move quickly rather than deliberately and therefore making them more susceptible to canalisation from artillery- or drone-deployed mines, and thereafter broken up with artillery. Although these combined strikes are most effective, Ukrainian officers noted that they were rarely able to bring about this layered effect because of a scarcity of artillery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main reasons for such a high proportion of kills being caused by FPVs is the relative lack of artillery in Ukrainian units. A brigade responsible for defending 18 km of front noted that it had four working howitzers. 152mm- and 122mm-howitzer rounds are in very short supply. Although 155mm shells are available in considerably greater volume than earlier in the conflict, artillery officers noted that they had few guns and limited spares. They also often had shells, but few accompanying charges. It may be that ammunition and spares are being stockpiled to hedge against the risk of disruption of supply during the forthcoming political manoeuvring over negotiations, as higher formations appeared more comfortable with their level of supply. For the brigades, while shells were available, charge bags were far scarcer, so that few guns were equipped for engaging at long range. Units also almost exclusively had access to high-explosive shells and some artillery-deployed mines, with very occasional access to dual-purpose improved conventional munitions (DPICM), and almost no availability of BONUS shells or other specialised ammunition. The ability to fire proper groupings of shells was also inhibited by the fact that units were receiving propellent charges sourced from a wide range of countries, which varied considerably in composition and quality, and thus in accuracy. While updates to the Kropyva fire control application used by the AFU can include pre-loaded adjustments to account for common national variants, the persistent challenges introduce inefficiency into the provision of fire support and exemplify the second-order effects of piecemeal and uncoordinated industrial support. Taken together, these mean that artillery is currently significantly underperforming, even when it is available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ground combat brigades generally suffer particularly acute shortages of artillery munitions, as artillery brigades have remained the priority for resupply due to their more refined ability to coordinate and conduct targeting and fire missions in their respective areas of operation. While some of this is mitigated by artillery liaison officers posted to the ground combat brigades which they support, this nevertheless results in periodic delays in fire support due to differing targeting priorities and views of where the expenditure of limited munitions supplies should be prioritised at different echelons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tactics for employing artillery have evolved considerably in response to the pervasive threat from UAVs. Both Russian and Ukrainian gunners separate guns by more than 500 m and keep ammunition caches concealed and separated from the firing position. Firing positions are dug in with protection on the sides and above, netting, and in some cases, plates mounted as a sheath around exposed components like barrels. Guns operate from hides with a cluster of prepared firing positions and associated decoy positions. The decoys are also redeployed when weather or other conditions allow. Guns tend to fire for a protracted period as the dug-in positions offer significant protection from counter-battery fire, the volume of which is itself reduced by the dispersion of guns. However, the guns move periodically to avoid being engaged by glide bombs, which are powerful enough to obviate the defences. Gunners note that the small payloads of UAVs can cause damage to their pieces, but they are usually repairable. This has led to a faster rate of barrel replacement than would arise from firing alone. Ukrainian forces have found it necessary to keep resupply vehicles much further back than pre-war doctrine suggests and to resupply ammunition when conditions are favourable, rather than in response to consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;engineering-and-fortification&quot;&gt;Engineering and Fortification&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building defensive positions is fundamental to survivability on the battlefield for both Russian and Ukrainian forces, along all sectors of the frontline. Due to the fires threat, excavation equipment is rarely brought closer than 7 km to the front, meaning that most defensive positions must be prepared by hand. For infantry soldiers manually moving large volumes of soil with picks and shovels, the work is arduous and time consuming. This has resulted in ground combat units often struggling to build adequate defensive structures. Incorporating overhead protection, whether hard cover or simply concealment from observation, has proven difficult to achieve at the correct scale, especially where there is limited foliage or other natural material to exploit. If units are rotated, they do not directly benefit from their labour, and in areas where multiple units have been rotated within a short time, this has been noted as disincentivising digging in, despite standing orders that make units responsible for making progressive improvements to the defences in any area in which they are deployed. These are of course longstanding and well understood issues, with historical precedent in most large-scale ground wars throughout the last century, but they have become particularly problematic given the overhead observation and fires threat on the current frontline. Ukrainian units often use separate troops to prepare positions back from the line of contact to avoid exhausting their infantry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the operational level, Ukraine has increasingly depended on combat engineering for force protection, digging in and concealing headquarters, logistics depots and artillery positions. Much of this must still be conducted by ground combat units, due to the high level of threat. Construction of decoy and reversionary positions and hides is a major task. While much of this is conducted by different arms – for example, artillery units are responsible for many of their decoys and hides – combat engineers remain invaluable for their ability to quickly construct such positions with heavy mechanised equipment. Artillery positions and command posts often require significant excavation work, with all command posts buried to reduce the threat of observation and effective indirect fire. Although engineers cannot often move forward, they can help to prepare cages and steel nets that are erected over defensive positions closer to the line of contact to protect from strikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combat engineers also have important functions within the ground combat units. The extensive use of mines has meant that mine clearing is an essential task for offensive action. Ukraine continues to use both hand clearing and mechanised breaching, with Vincent and line-breaching systems like UR-77, utilised where speed is required. The laying of mines is another area where engineers are widely employed, working closely with reconnaissance troops and intelligence staffs to judge the appropriate siting of mines, and then working with artillery and UAV troops to emplace them. Ukrainian forces tend to use mines to canalise attacks and slow down enemy tempo, thereby enabling them to inflict casualties on Russian units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bridging also remains a persistent if thankless task for engineering units. Because of the pervasive observation on the battlefield, bridges are routinely struck. This has meant that ferries and watercraft have a critical function. Filling in minor gaps and shorter-term bridging solutions has proven vital for assault and resupply operations. In these cases, volume of equipment is critical – as it is lost and fixed in large quantities – but sophistication of equipment is largely redundant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reconnaissance-mass-observation&quot;&gt;Reconnaissance: Mass Observation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conduct of reconnaissance for both Russian and Ukrainian forces has been almost exclusively conducted by UAVs. Ukrainian artillery brigades field ISR battalions operating long-range reconnaissance UAVs. Each ground combat brigade generally has an independent UAV company or battalion that is responsible for conducting deep reconnaissance as well as the fires engagements outlined above. In addition, each battalion is required to generate four to six orbits of UAVs to support its HQ, with four dedicated to combat management and two to conducting battlefield reconnaissance. Artillery batteries and infantry companies also field significant numbers of UAVs, both to maintain situational awareness and to search for enemy positions or observe trigger points for other activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian approaches to ISR are similar. Along with long-range reconnaissance from Orlan and Zala UAVs working at operational depth, Russian combat groups tend to endeavour to maintain five orbits of observation over an axis of advance. They also tend to keep UAVs above their own forces for combat management, in line with their top-down command structure and centrally directed approach to operations. Although FPVs and Lancet loitering munitions are not recovered, they can also be used to actively hunt for targets and confirm the position of enemy that they overfly, such that these strike systems provide a reconnaissance function. They also often prompt ground units to fire at them, revealing their positions. The aggregate consequence of this dense and overlapping network of UAVs is battlefield transparency within 3 km of the line of contact, with diminishing density of observation out to 15 km of depth. Beyond this, reconnaissance is more deliberate, with the picture depending on where commanders assign UAV orbits. However, commanders can generally task reconnaissance capabilities with reasonable fidelity and latency out to 40 km of depth. Beyond this range, satellite reconnaissance often cues areas of interest for longer ranged UAVs to be tasked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The command and control of the reconnaissance screen has centralised at the battalion and brigade/regimental level in both Russian and Ukrainian forces. Generally, each UAV orbit will maintain a satellite uplink and stream its footage to the battalion and brigade command posts, where the intelligence officer, fires officer, and the commander’s representative will assess what is observed, determine options and authorise actions to be taken in response to what is observed. Both Russian and Ukrainian forces, for reasons of doctrine and culture, do not generally use fire controllers in combat units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wider intelligence and surveillance enterprise is bolstered by the extensive use of electronic surveillance and the interception of communications by both sides. Ukrainian EW has matured and expanded over the course of the war. Tracking EW defences is an absolute requirement for successful UAV operations, as it affects the flight plan and the timing of when UAVs are launched. Direction finding is also used as a means of cueing UAV orbits. Interception of tactical communications is critical as an indicator of enemy intent and is therefore provided to most brigades staffs to assist in the conduct of operations within their sector of responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;medical-support-and-casualty-evacuation&quot;&gt;Medical Support and Casualty Evacuation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to stabilise, evacuate and treat casualties not only is critical to a force’s resilience as regards the recovery of combat troops and retention of experience within the force, but also often underpins the morale of units. The tactical problems described above have made the treatment and evacuation of casualties and recovery of the dead extremely difficult. First, with a force density of sections covering up to 200 m of front, and individual battalions distributed through 7 km of depth, it is not viable to have medics persistently present on the fighting positions. Second, the distance between fighting positions, and the extent to which the intervening space is covered by precision fires from FPVs, makes it prohibitively dangerous for medics to reach wounded personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tactical response to this problem has initially been to train personnel on medical interventions so that they can stabilise their own wounds. The medic in this context often crews a radio and talks the casualty through the necessary procedures. It has been found that this function is critical, even when it is a medic who is wounded, because while shock often gives a casualty the ability to work on themselves for a period, it also significantly impairs decision making and judgement. It has also been found that having a medic centrally track timings, especially for the application of tourniquets, has helped to reduce the number of amputations required because of tourniquets being kept on for too long. Supplies of medical equipment have thereafter been delivered to casualties in place using UAVs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recovery of casualties can be achieved more safely if it is part of a deliberate operation and carried out under favourable conditions of fog and heavy rain, and at night. The evacuation procedure must be planned carefully and often requires the use of artillery and obscurants to suppress enemy artillery or divert their attention. This is achievable but means that the commander cannot recover casualties immediately in response to their being taken. The interval between someone being wounded and recovered can therefore be from a few hours if they are wounded under favourable conditions, up to a matter of days if weather and battlefield conditions make the tactical context for evacuation unfavourable. Where soldiers are badly wounded, comrades do often take significant risk to achieve an accelerated recovery, but while this comradeship is commendable, under most tactical situations, this tends to lead to multiple casualties being suffered. Experimentation has started with the recovery of the wounded on uncrewed ground vehicles (UGVs). At present, however, the reliability of these systems is insufficient for forces to be confident in such methods, and the use of such prototypes is limite. Once casualties are recovered, medical posts must be in the rear, dispersed, and hardened, so that surgery can be carried out safely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important operation is the recovery of the dead. In some respects, although the recovery of the dead is easier – owing to it not having the same time constraints – the Russians have taken to booby-trapping bodies or keeping dead Ukrainians under observation. Thus, the mapping of the positions of the dead, confirmation through ISR of their condition, and recovery must also be a deliberate operation. The importance of this activity relates to morale. To be recorded as killed rather than missing in action, it is necessary for remains to be recovered. This difference affects eligibility for compensation to be paid to families, so soldiers see it as very important. This dynamic has increased the impact of glide bombs on morale, because they have enough explosive to entirely obliterate those caught in the blast and bury those in the vicinity, leaving no recoverable corpse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that Russian approaches to casualties differ to Ukrainian approaches, reflecting the motivation of their troops. While Ukrainian troops overwhelmingly refer to their duty to defend Ukraine and their families from Russian occupation as their reason for fighting, Russian prisoners of war largely describe their motivations as financial. Whereas Ukrainian troops often leave their families worse off – as they receive less pay in the armed forces than in civilian employment – by joining the military, Russian troops receive bonuses, making fighting a lucrative endeavour. Moreover, the compensation for being killed paid to the family is high enough to give families an altered standard of living, though payments for being wounded are reducing. Russian troops appear less motivated to recover their wounded or their dead. Medical support is prioritised for those who can self-recover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;logistics-resupply-and-rotation&quot;&gt;Logistics, Resupply and Rotation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tactical resupply has become a major challenge for the same reasons as medical evacuation. Ukrainian brigades report that approximately 50% of their casualties are taken in the rear from Russian FPVs, artillery and glide bombs. Rotation of troops, pushing supplies forward and recovering damaged equipment all lead to personnel moving in the open and are risky endeavours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first tactical adaptation driven by the threat is to minimise the number of rotations, with troops spending over a month in their positions before being rotated. If the positions are appropriately built, commanders reported that this approach was more popular than endeavouring to rotate regularly, since the risks of rotation now outweigh the benefits of rest in rear areas. When rotations are conducted, it is the same deliberate operation as described in relation to medical evacuation, and is supported by fires and EW, while being executed at night and during periods of inclement weather or reduced visibility. There is a challenge in this because periods of reduced visibility are also favoured for Russian assault actions, and when the rotation is poorly managed, it can enable Russian troops to get into fighting positions. In several cases rotations allowed the flanks of neighbouring units to be turned, forcing the withdrawal of the line. For this reason, the Russians have preferred fixing their divisions and combined arms armies to axes, with the regiments rotating their battalions, such that the commanders have a protracted exposure to and understanding of the terrain. Ukrainian commanders argue for a similar approach, with higher echelons, with long-term familiarity with the geography, managing this process, given that problems are most acute when fresh units are endeavouring to take over positions. The announcement that Ukraine will establish Army Corps is partly aimed at resolving this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once troops are on the positions, the challenge of resupply is being partly addressed through the use of UAVs to deliver ammunition and rations forwards. It has even proven possible on occasion for a unit’s chefs to prepare fresh food for units and for this to be delivered in packages via UAVs to dispersed elements of the force, thereby removing the risk of casualties during the operation. Weight is a limitation for this method – such that it is difficult to resupply heavy equipment to the forward positions – and another factor that caps the viable force density that can be sustained across a given area. UGVs may assist with the limitations on weight, but officers noted in interview that their reliability was a persistent problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For artillery and mortar ammunition and when reinforcement of a position must be carried out under critical conditions, the use of either HMMWVs (Humvees) or M113 armoured personnel carriers (APCs) is preferred by Ukrainian troops. Both are liked because of their speed and mobility on difficult terrain, reducing the period of exposure and enabling survivability. For Russian forces, there is a similar division between the use of light utility vehicles and bikes to move supplies quickly, and Tigr-M, MRAP-type vehicles, or BMP or MTLB armoured vehicles for resupply, depending on the equipment available to the unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another area of adaptation is the increasing of and changing approach to caching equipment. For artillery, Russian forces have begun to cache ammunition within a retrievable distance from their guns but separate from the firing position. Ukrainian personnel use similar methods. The advantage of this approach is that it allows heavy equipment to be brought forward by a larger vehicle when the weather permits, but for this equipment to then be accessible to the fighting units when there is a need for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;long-range-strike-air-defence-and-electronic-protection&quot;&gt;Long-Range Strike, Air Defence and Electronic Protection&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The air defence challenge must be broken down into the protection of forces and the protection of terrain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-protection-of-forces&quot;&gt;The Protection of Forces&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each day in August 2024, Ukrainian air defenders reported that Russia was flying between 1,000 and 1,500 Orlan-10 and Zala reconnaissance UAV orbits deep over Ukrainian positions. By 2025, Ukraine had managed to reduce, though not eliminate, the density of these systems through the employment of networked radar and electro-optical guidance of interceptor UAVs that have inflicted steady losses on Russian ISR. Nevertheless, the density of observation has prevented Ukraine from pushing air defences forward. When this has been attempted, Russia has successfully found and engaged these targets, usually with 9M723 ballistic missiles. The short-ranged air defence that remain survivable offer some deterrent value against the VKS pushing further into Ukrainian air space. As detailed above, however, this does not prevent the VKS from delivering glide bombs from outside the engagement envelope of Ukrainian defensive surface-to-air missiles (SAMs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electronic protection of troops has become indispensable for both sides to reduce the exposure of units to strikes by UAVs. The Russian transfer to fibre-optical cable for guidance of FPVs may disrupt the approach to EW, but at present, navigational jamming is ubiquitous throughout the combat area. Jamming of command frequences is also widespread. Most vehicles entering the combat zone also carry jammers, primarily aimed at disrupting command links or video feeds to reduce the terminal accuracy of FPVs. EW is effective in significantly reducing the reliability of UAVs and disrupting the accurate fixing of targets to cue strikes. However, it is also causing widespread issues with deconfliction and fratricide causes friendly UAV operations to be periodic rather than continuous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-protection-of-territory&quot;&gt;The Protection of Territory&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a different matter. Russia has adopted a two-track approach to strikes. The first involves continuous harassment with Geran-2 and Gerbera UAVs. Some fly low, but mostly, the Russians fly high to make the means of interception as expensive as possible. These UAVs tend to be routed to strike airfields, training areas, transformer sub-stations and industrial facilities. The UAVs are usually sent in waves, with data pushed back from the first UAVs to inform the path taken by subsequent UAVs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine now has a dense network of EW effectors and passive sensors that can track the progress of air threats across the country. The most efficient means of shooting down Geran-2 and Gerbera UAVs flying at a higher altitude include helicopters and combat air patrols. Generally, Ukraine endeavours to wear down the waves of UAVs over a significant distance using a distributed defence, so that the point defences at the eventual target – ranging from self-propelled anti-aircraft guns and mobile fire teams with heavy machine guns, to man-portable air-defence systems (MANPADS) teams and SAM systems – have to engage as few targets as possible. These methods have proven successful, with the vast majority of OWA-UAVs intercepted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The value Russia gains in conducting the OWA strikes is less about the damage inflicted than it is about the data gathered in mapping EW and air defence systems and forcing Ukraine to expend stocks. Russia is currently set to produce in 2025 more than 750 9M723 ballistic missiles and more than 560 Kh-101 cruise missiles, according to plans drawn up by the Russian Ministry of Defence. It will therefore continue to deliver salvos at intervals. When the authors reviewed the tracks of these engagements, it is evident that they are carefully planned. Russian cruise missiles are often routed to avoid EW defences before their terminal phase. They also move to avoid air defence positions and are often synchronised so that they approach the target in a short period of time from several directions. Russia has also made substantial improvements to the construction of systems. As well as adding a wider variety of warheads – including cluster warheads – to Kh-101, they have upgraded the camera and processing units such that it can perform much better visual terrain tracking, and thereby avoid disruption from EW during its terminal phase. The missile is also now dispensing countermeasures, which can be used to protect it when crossing the positions of MANPADS teams. The result is that although Ukraine does achieve many intercepts, Russia usually damages or destroys what it targets during these strikes. Nevertheless, Russia has not been able to strike frequently enough or exercise sufficient discipline in the target sets it engages to inflict critical damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s long-range strike campaign against Russia has been constrained by having far fewer strike systems than Russia, but has been at least as sophisticated, if not more so, in its route planning and integration. Ukraine has become highly efficient at routing UAVs to bypass much of Russia’s air defences. Russia has responded by placing SA-22 Pantsir SAM systems on towers around most critical targets. Nevertheless, Ukrainian planners have found that by firing a sufficiently large salvo of UAVs at a target, it is often possible to saturate the available air defence and – when available – sequence the use of cruise missiles or larger payload UAVs for later in the engagement, such that by the time more destructive munitions arrive, the air defences are depleted. This has led to a remarkably high success rate for Ukraine in damaging targets, though with a very high expenditure of UAVs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-for-support-to-ukraine&quot;&gt;Recommendations for Support to Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Ukrainian forces are successfully delaying Russian advances and inflicting significant casualties, this is being achieved at a high price in personnel, while Ukrainian force generation is failing to meet the requirements of the force. This is the foremost problem that must be addressed if Ukraine’s defence is to be sustainable. There is no “silver bullet” solution. Some international partners are currently emphasising the extension of conscription to 18-year-olds, but this will not address the key problems. The recommendations that follow, therefore, constitute a package of measures aimed at addressing this issue, which requires work from both the Ukrainian government and its international partners to resolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The greatest risk to the AFU in the short term is a collapse in morale among the veterans of the core brigades. Currently, morale is low. There are four primary contributing factors to this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, many experienced troops are extremely tired and feel that they have sacrificed disproportionately compared with wider society. Recent increases in desertion have not been confined to mobilised troops, although many deserters have returned to the ranks in time, sometimes having transferred unit, but often simply having rested. The lack of rotation is a major issue. Rotating brigades off the line for rest and training would significantly improve morale and fighting power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Ukrainian troops feel increasingly powerless owing to the threat from glide bombs, against which no fortification offers adequate protection, and the AFU has limited means available at tactical echelons for shooting down either the bombs or the fighters launching them. This sense of being unable to improve the situation and lacking any tactical tools to ensure safety is corrosive to morale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, low pay and the lack of compensation for unrecovered dead means that many soldiers see their families becoming poorer as a result of their service. For those contemplating joining the armed forces, volunteering is to not only accept significant personal risk, but also sacrifice the financial security of their family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, because experienced commanders and units are rarely rotated off the line, there is a tendency to have new units formed and then attached to existing brigades. This leads to experienced battalions being depleted, while new battalions lack the skills to fight effectively. Moreover, equipment often goes to the new units even though these units lacked the experienced officers and junior leaders to employ that equipment effectively, while veteran units often make do with sub-standard equipment. It is notable that cohered brigades where the battalions are organic to the unit consistently perform better on the frontline than composite units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recommendations to Ukraine to address this multifaceted problem are as follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s international partners should work with the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence to improve the pay offer to troops and ensure there is the finance to cover this.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The legislation on compensation to families should be altered so that if a body can be photographed and geo-located, this is sufficient for compensation to be released, rather than there being a need to recover the body.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ukraine should stop forming new combat units and instead prioritise bringing existing units up to strength, with the priority being experienced units. This change is already being implemented but it must be accompanied with the rotation of units off the line so that veterans can help to train replacements while also resting and carry out collective training away from the front.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s international partners should shift to delivering training and advice in Ukraine on Ukrainian training areas, rather than trying to train Ukrainian troops outside of Ukraine. It is not realistic to move experienced units, with their equipment, to France or Germany, regardless of the theoretical advantages, so endeavouring to deliver collective training outside Ukraine will drive attempts to create new units who lack experienced troops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International partners should also prioritise exploring solutions to the threat from glide bombs. The most likely means of achieving effects in this area are to resource Ukraine’s long-range strike programme to target fuelling and rearming points and air bases of the VKS. International partners should also consider reducing the serviceability of Russian strike aircraft by further degrading Russia’s aviation sector. Reducing the sortie rate of the VKS should be the priority. As this will take time to have an impact, improving the ability of units to detect and react to UMPK glide bomb releases would give personnel some capacity to adopt countermeasures. Options for intercepting glide bombs may be explored but are unlikely to be fieldable at large scale within a short space of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morale is also underpinned by having competitive equipment. Although equipment levels – especially relating to 155 mm artillery ammunition – have improved over recent months, there are serious shortcomings in the equipment available to Ukrainian brigades, which should be prioritised for those providing military technical assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the need to expand production of explosive energetics and shells remains. Ukrainian officials report that they received approximately 1.6 million 155 mm shells in 2023 and 1.5 million in 2024. As the availability and quality of shells on the international market decreases, more will need to come from production lines. Investment must be sustained in Europe to expand industrial capacity in this area. But Ukraine’s ammunition availability is not relevant if it does not have serviceable artillery pieces. It is therefore also critical that industrial efforts in Europe are rationalised to ensure a supply of replacement barrels and other spare parts for donated fleets, and that the number of howitzers provided to the AFU is increased. In regards to fires, this should be done alongside the financing and increased scaling of UAV production, as the two capabilities are complementary. Both areas will be critical to European defence, so investing in this industrial capacity is a win-win for European security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mechanisation is also critical to battlefield survivability. Infantry fighting vehicles and lighter tanks are disproportionately valuable for the mobile reinforcement of sectors under pressure in the defence. APCs, meanwhile, are indispensable for logistics, medical support, troop rotation and offensive action. The number of vehicles required means that while modern infantry fighting vehicles are a significant combat multiplier, they are also overly expensive and complex for a large proportion of the tasks for which APCs are equally capable and much more affordable. Ukraine’s international partners should therefore prioritise the continued mechanisation of Ukrainian units with both IFVs and APCs. The priority for both is serviceability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several areas which are currently personnel-intensive but which could be significantly improved through automation. One is air defence and counter-UAS pickets. Ukrainian experimentation has demonstrated that automated turrets are able to reliably engage UAS using very little ammunition, whereas humans have approximately 25% efficiency when defending the targeted position. Human capabilities in this area may be improved with better sights and more appropriate small arms, but automated turrets offer a very high level of interception and can be produced at a reasonable cost. The automation of weapons currently given to mobile fire teams also offers a means of improving point defence of targets against longer-range UAVs. International partners should also support expanding the capacity of automated resupply of the fighting positions through UAS, and the development of UGVs for casualty evacuation, with the added benefit that these capabilities will also have utility for Ukraine’s partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, as the fighting is currently progressing, Russia is slowly working its way through the Donetsk defence lines. The terrain behind these positions is largely flat, open and much less defensible. While it should be hoped that Ukraine can hold Russian forces in Donetsk, international partners should help with contingency planning on the erection of new defence lines, their proper siting, and planning for when Ukrainian forces move to these positions. Current efforts in this area by non-combat troops are inadequate, due to fragmented initiatives lacking coordination and often without the relevant military engineering expertise to inform contractors where and how to position fortifications and trenches. The best opportunity is to build pre-emptively, while the absence of high-density tactical observation and massed fires makes mechanised engineering possible. Digging major subterranean defences with overhead protection serves multiple purposes. It obfuscates precise Ukrainian force dispositions and creates uncertainty about where they are concentrated. It enables covered movement between forward positions and rear areas, and with sufficient structural reinforcement and multiple entries and exits can prevent troops being entombed by glide bombs if hardened fortifications are unfortunate enough to suffer close hits during combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-for-nato&quot;&gt;Recommendations for NATO&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be emphasised that although Russia is putting increasing pressure on Ukraine, it is also becoming more economically vulnerable domestically and is running low across several armoured vehicle fleets. The quality of Russian infantry also continues to decline. Continuing to support Ukraine to bring about a sustainable peace should therefore be the foremost priority of European NATO as a means of reducing the threat to Europe and thereby reducing the likelihood that Europe will have to fight in the future. A sustainable peace requires that Russia is deterred from recommencing hostilities and that Ukraine has a viable economy that cannot be coercively supressed by Russian threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this, if the situation in Ukraine deteriorates, Europe must depend upon its conventional deterrence capabilities. Learning lessons from the Russo–Ukrainian War, therefore, is important. In the current phase of the war, several deductions can be drawn relevant to NATO militaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The disproportionate impact of the VKS, despite the generally poor performance of Russian airpower, validates the importance placed on air power across NATO, and this area of competitive advantage should be sustained. Increasing stockpiles and the capacity to produce long-range air-to-air munitions and stand-off strike weapons at as low a cost as possible should be critical priorities for the force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to expand the duration and complexity of long-range strike capabilities is also highly desirable. This means that investing in the production of jet engines, rocket motors and guidance and navigation units in Europe to initially provide to Ukraine’s long-range strike programme would subsequently leave Europe with the industrial capabilities to sustain large-scale strike operations against Russian logistics and infrastructure in the event of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also evident that counter-UAS capabilities are an all-arms requirement for survivability, and appropriate equipment and doctrine must be issued throughout NATO forces. The priority must be economical and sustainable engagements, with the reprogramming of Remote Weapon Stations (RWS) the easiest immediate means of improving protection. Without counter-UAS capabilities, NATO militaries risk seeing high quality troops and equipment rapidly suffering losses for want of protection, when such effective protection is eminently achievable. This must be considered an all-arms concern. For infantry, for example, counter-drone nets and other simple stocks should be available alongside traditional stores like corrugated-iron or timber that can be used for augmentations to fortifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scale of IFV and APC production is severely limited by an over-emphasis on quality over quantity. Although IFV optics and other sensors are valuable, there is a need to improve the level of mechanisation and the sustainability of mechanised units. For this reason, European defence industry should be incentivised to expand the capacity to build drive trains and armoured hulls. In the UK, the maintenance of the Ajax production facility and a replacement for Bulldog should be industrial, as much as military, priorities. Training of close-support logistics units with armoured vehicles should be a priority, alongside tactics like containerisation, caching and UAV resupply for logistics troops organic to combat units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maximising the stand-off firepower of tactical formations should be a priority. In the first instance, scaling the use of wire-guided strike UAS within formations is sensible, but this should not be done at the expense of conventional artillery. European militaries should also carefully consider their commitments against the production and use of cluster munitions and should regenerate the ability to deploy AT and AP mines. Without these, they risk lacking both the required lethality to fight effectively, and the ability to reduce enemy mobility sufficiently to allow that lethality to be brought to bear. Explosive counter mobility capabilities may be achievable in a manner that is consistent with existing treaty obligations, due to technological advances, though some alterations to treaties to reflect technological advances may also be worth exploring. Stockpiling specialist munitions like BONUS shells is also a priority. Nevertheless, artillery will be damaged in war, and ensuring the industrial capacity to sustain an artillery capability is vital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tactically, one of the areas of greatest importance for NATO militaries is the update of medical doctrine. Put simply, existing medical doctrine is not executable under modern combat conditions. Military medics are not equipped or prepared either for the scale of casualties involved in high intensity combat or the challenges of evacuating casualties and treating them in a rear area that is under persistent observation and the threat of strike. This is an area that could seriously degrade morale, even among highly professional troops, without preparing personnel with realistic expectations and appropriate drills, and should be prioritised for experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the character of the threat continues to evolve, it is important that NATO militaries ensure that they are adapting to meet the challenges of tomorrow, rather than perfecting the execution of past doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;

The policy collisions to come will be transformative for transatlantic relations and will reshape the transatlantic alliance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report is Part 1 in a two-part series titled “The Transatlantic Alliance in the Age of Trump.” Part 1 previews the coming collisions in transatlantic relations and whether a “grand bargain” between the United States and Europe to avoid conflict is plausible. It will examine the various policy areas where clashes are likely, examining NATO, Ukraine, technology, trade, climate, international organizations, and China policy. It will look at why collisions in each policy area are possible, how a dispute could escalate, and potential risks facing both sides. Part 2 will explore how the European political project may evolve as a result of the collisions discussed in Part 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and Europe are on a collision course that will fundamentally alter and transform transatlantic relations. It is not just one issue that will trigger a clash but seemingly every issue. From NATO to Ukraine, climate to trade, tech regulations to China, the United States and Europe will likely clash, repeatedly and continuously. The impact of these collisions will be transformative for transatlantic relations and will reshape the transatlantic alliance. Europe is now staring at the beginning of a new post-American age. Since the end of World War II, Europe has been inextricably tied to the United States. While there have occasionally been rifts in the transatlantic fabric, these were always mendable. But the clashes that are coming may not be, and they may forever change the nature of transatlantic relations. Europe is now reckoning with a potential future where it may have to chart its own course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the core of the tension is that Europe and the United States under Donald Trump now have very different views of the transatlantic alliance and of the world. For Europe, relations with the United States have served as Europe’s North Star and the foundation of Europe’s foreign policy, and were treated with the utmost importance. Europe, today, desperately wants to preserve the alliance as it currently exists and ensure the United States’ continued place as the guarantor of European security. For the United States, Europe is seen as being of lesser importance. Even before President Trump’s return to office, Europe had become an afterthought to Washington. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine—the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the full-scale invasion in 2022—refocused U.S. attention on Europe, but only temporarily. NATO may have returned to its Cold War focus on deterring Russian power, but the United States has not. Nevertheless, there had still been a clear bipartisan consensus across administrations on the importance of the United States’ continued leadership in Europe as being core to U.S. global strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That bipartisan consensus had been weakening and now appears fully broken. President Donald Trump has a very different perspective toward Europe and NATO—one that sees less value in alliances. There appears to be very little interest in preserving the transatlantic status quo. Instead, the Trump administration has made clear that it wants to fundamentally change the present alliance dynamics. There is a sense in Trump’s Washington that Europe matters less in the world, and yet Europe is taking advantage of the U.S. security guarantee to ignore its defense responsibilities, all the while targeting U.S. companies with burdensome regulations. In the same week, JD Vance took the stage in Paris to denounce European technology regulations, while Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth clearly outlined that the United States would prioritize Asia and create a “division of labor” where Europe takes “responsibility for its own security.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The president and his administration also appear to have little interest in Europe. In Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s initial call list, only Poland and NATO made the first fifteen calls (and neither were among the first ten). The United Kingdom was not included, despite the special relationship, and neither were France, Germany, or the European Union. Furthermore, there are few, if any, traditional transatlanticists in the second Trump administration to speak in favor of the alliance, as there were in the first Trump administration. There is also a reaction to Europe’s both real and perceived condescension toward Trump’s MAGA-inspired nationalism. Statements from European leaders and governments that criticized Trump or praised President Biden have accelerated an underlying angst toward Europe. This has led to a mood in Washington that resembles 2002 and 2003, around the Iraq War, which led to an explosion of anti-(Western) European sentiment, especially toward France and Germany for objecting to the U.S. invasion of Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mix of apathy and angst toward Europe means it is likely that the Trump administration is willing to be extremely assertive and confrontational, including taking steps that may significantly weaken or undermine the transatlantic alliance. Trump’s remarks at Davos on January 23, 2025, and in other brief comments to the press made clear that a confrontation is coming, especially with the European Union. European appeals to being loyal NATO allies will likely have little resonance. Instead, the Trump administration is likely to demand concessions from Europe on all sorts of policy areas, all the while also seeking to fundamentally transform NATO by reducing its security presence and commitment to European security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, though, the United States and Europe now have fundamentally different outlooks toward the world. Not since the U.S. invasion of Iraq have the United States and Europe been so far apart in outlook. In Of Paradise and Power from 2003, Robert Kagan described the United States and Europe as being from different planets; the martial Americans were from Mars, while the pacifist Europeans were from Venus. Now both sides appear to be from different centuries, with the Trump administration adopting an outlook of the predatory and imperialist 1890s, with the Europeans still rooted in the liberal triumphalism of the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report looks ahead at the coming collisions in transatlantic relations. It first examines whether a “grand bargain” between the United States and Europe to avoid conflict is plausible. Unfortunately, both due to political, policy, and structural reasons, reaching a grand deal across policy areas looks highly implausible. Next, the report analyzes and breaks down the various policy areas where clashes are likely, examining NATO, Ukraine, technology, trade, climate, international organizations, and China policy. It will look at why a collision is possible, how that could escalate, and potential risks to both sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What will make the coming collisions incredibly dynamic from a policy perspective is that they will interact with each other, facilitating either an escalatory or de-escalatory dynamic. This means that an escalating fight in one policy area could cause an even more bitter and aggressive fight in another policy area. Alternatively, should agreement or détente be achieved, such as in a tit-for-tat tariff war, that could create momentum for de-escalation in other areas. In short, the policy dynamic in the transatlantic relationship will be characterized by brinksmanship and tension. This will put the alliance on edge and could create an atmosphere of profound distrust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How Europe navigates the coming collisions will have significant repercussions for its future and the future of the transatlantic alliance and the global order. Despite U.S. conceptions that Europe is stagnant and in decline, Europe is in fact constantly evolving. The European Union looks very different today than it did 5, 10, and 20 years ago, and it will likely look very different at the end of the Trump administration. How Europe and its project may evolve will be the focus of the second report in this series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-coming-transatlantic-collisions&quot;&gt;The Coming Transatlantic Collisions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Grand Bargain Is Unlikely&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To stave off a transatlantic rupture, it has been asserted that perhaps the United States and Europe could cut a deal or strike some sort of grand bargain. Europe, for instance, could make some concessions, perhaps agree to purchase more liquified natural gas from the United States, spend more on defense, buy more U.S. weapons, or make some trade concessions, in exchange for a relatively placid relationship and the continuation of the U.S. security commitment. But a transatlantic grand bargain is highly unlikely for the simple reason that the Trump administration looks determined to remake the partnership in a way that Europe will find unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reaching a grand bargain will require compromises on both sides, including the Trump administration. The crux of the issue is that any bargain will be rooted in a continued U.S. security presence in Europe. Thus, the question is whether the Trump administration will be willing to leave the U.S. security presence in Europe, and therefore, NATO, untouched as part of any deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many incoming Trump administration officials, as well as U.S. companies squeezed by EU regulations, want to use the U.S. security guarantee as a tool to extract concessions from Europe on economic, trade, and tech policy. During the presidential campaign, Vice President JD Vance linked U.S. security commitments through NATO to looser European tech regulation of Elon Musk’s social media platform, X. Yet the Trump administration has made clear that it is determined to fundamentally shift the burden of European security from the United States to Europe. This will likely mean a significant reduction in U.S. forces in Europe. The U.S. security guarantee will only serve as bargaining leverage over Europe if it is not materially weakened. Instead of making compromises, the Trump administration will likely, and in many ways understandably, not want to choose or prioritize. Instead, it will insist on Europe making major policy concessions, all the while also shifting the defense burden to Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, once the United States treats Europe’s security as a hostage to be negotiated over, there is no reason why the United States cannot keep taking it hostage. For instance, should the European Union alter its technology regulations, effectively passing a new law to appease the Trump administration and to keep U.S. forces in place, what is there to prevent the United States from seeking ever more concessions on other issues, such as trade or carbon tariffs? The hostage—Europe’s security, in this case—is never actually released, as the United States can always threaten European security by pulling back in every follow-on policy clash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What may also trigger tension is that there is lack of trust. The Trump administration sees Europeans as feckless and willing to say the right things, such as about defense spending, but then failing to follow through. Europeans, meanwhile, are unlikely to trust the president to stick to any deal. The mere fact that President Trump has threatened to impose tariffs against Canada and Mexico, despite having negotiated the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) a few years ago, will likely raise concerns about entering any deal with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, even if both sides wanted a grand bargain, there are major structural obstacles. For the United States, making difficult policy trade-offs across sectors, especially between defense and economic areas, would be difficult for any administration. For Europe, the structural problems are even more profound, as economic and regulatory issues are completely disconnected from defense policy. The power to negotiate and retaliate on economic, regulatory, climate, and trade issues resides with the European Union, and more specifically with the European Commission, not with European member states. Yet when it comes to defense and security issues, the power lies not with the European Union but with member states and NATO. Member states can push the European Commission and pressure its president, Ursula von der Leyen, which could shape how the European Union responds or retaliates. But they cannot force the European Commission to not implement EU law or to change EU laws and policy. Moreover, member states are a diverse group and are unlikely to universally agree to cave to U.S. pressure. Thus, changing EU law and policy to satisfy Trump and to ensure continued U.S. security commitment would be structurally very difficult for the European Union to pull off, even if many, if not most member states, wanted to strike such a deal. France in particular will seize on efforts to hold European security hostage for policy concessions as unacceptable, and it will likely push back against the efforts of other member states to pressure the European Commission to soften its approach or change policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, Europe’s perceived weakness will likely lead the Trump administration to underestimate Europe. On the one hand, the clash with the United States comes at a terrible time for Europe. There is political disarray in France and Germany. European unity is plagued by internal Trojan horse states, like Hungary and Slovakia, that block European unity. Europe is plagued by economic frailty and stagnation. The continent is at its most insecure since the Cold War, and it is as dependent as ever on the United States both for its security and its energy supply. And yet, Europe’s weakness is also vastly overstated, especially by Europeans. Europe has shown again and again its strength in unity when facing direct challenges to its union, exemplified by its response to Brexit. Brussels is largely empowered to act, and Europeans have shown a willingness to do whatever it takes to protect themselves in crises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, it is hard to see a grand bargain happening in the immediate term. Instead, it looks likely that there will be major policy collisions in many different sectors. These collisions may be bruising. Some may become all-encompassing fights, while others may simmer but never fully come to a boil. Instead of a grand bargain, a more hopeful path may be that a détente is eventually reached in which both sides essentially agree to tolerate each other. The challenge for transatlantic relations is to navigate these coming collisions without truly upending the alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;clashes-everywhere-all-at-once&quot;&gt;Clashes Everywhere, All at Once&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;NATO and European Defense: Burden-Shifting, For Real This Time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe will try desperately to maintain the status quo on defense with the United States, ensuring European security and staying engaged in NATO. The problem for Europe is that the Trump administration appears intent on shifting responsibility for European security to Europeans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Trump’s talk of annexing Greenland from Denmark also raised fundamental concerns about the U.S. commitment to NATO. If the United States is seeking to take an ally’s territory, it is hard to see it coming to defend an ally’s territory. At his first NATO Defense Ministerial, Secretary of Defense Hegseth said, “the United States will no longer tolerate an imbalanced relationship which encourages dependency. Rather, our relationship will prioritize empowering Europe to own responsibility for its own security.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This represents a radical shift in the United States’ foreign policy toward Europe. Since the 1950s, the United States has sought to play an indispensable role in European security. As much as U.S. administrations have complained about the lack of European defense spending and Europe’s limited defense capabilities, the United States has not supported Europe working to organize itself militarily without the United States (this has particularly been the case since the end of the Cold War, when the United States aggressively opposed such self-organization). The United States, across administrations, has been strongly opposed to the European Union’s involvement in defense. European dependence on the United States has been seen as a feature, not a bug, of the current structure of NATO, giving the United States a set of ready-made partners and unparalleled influence in a large, wealthy, and technologically advanced region. Yet President Trump has shown little affinity toward NATO and has repeatedly questioned its value. A new generation of defense and foreign policy thinkers in Republican foreign policy see the United States as overstretched and emphasize the need to ruthlessly prioritize Asia over Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump has recently demanded that European countries spend 5 percent of GDP on defense, which is much more than what the United States spends and a significant increase from what anyone has been calling for; it is also almost certainly unachievable for almost all NATO countries. Trump, in short, is laying out a demand that he knows will not be met and that lays the groundwork for the United States to pull back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question now is whether and in which form that transition comes about. It is highly likely that the Trump administration will reduce U.S. force presence in Europe, with some reports of 20,000 forces being withdrawn. In a report titled the The Prioritization Imperative, Heritage Foundation Research Fellow Robert Peters and former Heritage Foundation scholar and current Acting Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Alex Velez-Green wrote that the items to be transferred “will likely include submarines and surface combatants; heavy bombers; fighter, electronic attack, maritime patrol, and airborne early warning and control (AEW&amp;amp;C) aircraft; air and missile defenses; certain ground-based long-range fires; critical munitions for air, naval, and ground platforms; and critical enablers, such as airlift, sealift, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) assets.” Such a shift will create enormous gaps in European defense. A U.S. pullback and a move toward making the U.S. position in NATO essentially “dormant,” as conservative scholar Sumantra Maitra notably called for, looks quite possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should the United States pull back, Europe will have to take urgent and ambitious steps. It will require not just significant fiscal outlays but massive internal reforms to ensure that Europeans can fight together. However, should Europe take these steps and effectively “get their act together,” the result will not be a more supplicant European Commission looking to make concessions but exactly the opposite. A U.S. pullback from European security will make clashes in other policy areas more intense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ukraine-as-europes-problem&quot;&gt;Ukraine as Europe’s Problem?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Trump has called for a negotiated end to the war in Ukraine. Yet there is significant uncertainty not only about whether such a deal can be reached, but also about the U.S. commitment to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes a comprehensive peace settlement somewhat unlikely is that Russia presently has the military advantage, as the future of U.S. military support is now uncertain and as the Biden administration allocated almost all of the funding from the April 2024 supplemental appropriation. While the Trump administration has the leverage to push Ukraine to the negotiating table, it is not clear by any means that it can bring Russia to the table without making concessions that either Ukraine finds unacceptable or that fundamentally alter European security. It seems likely that whether talks succeed or fail, the financial costs of both rebuilding and, vitally, rearming Ukraine are likely to be seen as a European responsibility by the Trump administration. The problem for Ukraine is that Europe simply lacks the military materiel and the defense industrial capacity to match U.S. aid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may force Europe to effectively procure U.S. military equipment, such as 155 mm ammunition from the United States, for Ukraine. Europe may do whatever it takes to ensure Ukraine doesn’t lose. Yet it will certainly resent having to buy U.S. aid, adding to the sense of abandonment and angst toward the United States. Thus, there is a distinct prospect for Europe that it will not only have to scramble to support Ukraine, but that it will also need to scramble to deal with a potential withdrawal of U.S. forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even more problematic for Europe (and Ukraine) is the potential for the United States to enter direct negotiations with Russia about the future of European security over their heads. There are fears in Europe of a “Yalta II” scenario, echoing the 1945 conference in which the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union carved up the future of post–World War II Eastern Europe. This will add to a deep sense of distrust toward Washington, all of which will likely lead to more tension in other policy areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;us-eu-trade-war-20-pain-both-ways&quot;&gt;U.S.-EU Trade War 2.0: Pain Both Ways&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S.-EU trade relationship is one of the most important in the history of the world. The European economy is massive—with 450 million mostly wealthy consumers, its economy is roughly equivalent in size to the economies of the United States and China. Trump’s proposed trade agenda, with upward of 20 percent tariffs, will hurt the European economy, which is even more dependent on the U.S. market for exports as China is squeezing out European products. Almost 20 percent of EU exports went to the United States in 2023. Thus, the European Union fears getting squeezed by both of its export markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On February 7, President Trump announced plans to impose reciprocal tariffs on U.S. imports equal to the rates that trading partners impose on U.S. exports. While details of the proposal remain unclear, the announcement will surely raise concerns in Europe about an imminent trade war with the United States. The February 7 announcement follows late January comments in which Trump said that he would “absolutely” levy tariffs on the European Union, citing Brussels’ action against U.S. tech companies and its large trade deficit in goods. On February 9, President Trump announced that he would impose 25 percent tariffs on all imports of steel and aluminum on February 10, with reciprocal tariffs on all products to follow on February 11. While European steel and aluminum exports to the United States are relatively limited, the tariffs will likely trigger a forceful response from Brussels, with the European Commission already labeling them as them as “unlawful” and “counterproductive.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union would prefer to avoid a trade war, and it has offered certain concessions. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has suggested that the European Union could buy more U.S. LNG as part of a broader trade deal with Washington. The head of the European Parliament’s trade committee suggested that the European Union could reduce its 10 percent import tax on cars, aligning it more closely with the 2.5 percent charged by the United States. Yet it is unclear what to offer, since it is unclear what President Trump is after besides a general rebalancing of trade. In addition, the euro has depreciated roughly 5 percent since November 5, which makes EU exports to the United States 5 percent more competitive and may soften the short-term blow of any aggressive U.S. measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, trade is a policy area where the European Union has the power and the ability to act. The European Union does not need unanimous support from member states to act, and the European Commission is largely empowered to retaliate. A dedicated task force within the European Commission has spent the past year preparing for potential trade spats with the United States. Brussels will already have a list of U.S. products that could be targeted for retaliation, likely predominantly goods produced in Republican states, as well as symbolic goods like bourbon and Harley Davidson motorcycles. The European Union could thus reimpose tariffs on U.S. imports that were suspended under the deal that ended the 2018 dispute with the first Trump administration. Without action, these suspended tariffs are already scheduled to enter into force in March 2025, and they will target products such as orange juice, peanut butter, Harley Davidsons, and bourbon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union can also survive a bruising trade war with the United States, as it is much less exposed to the U.S. market than Canada or Mexico. Martin Sandbu of the Financial Times assessed that for Germany and Italy, “if all their exports to the US were halted in a trade war, about 3 per cent of GDP would disappear directly . . . comparable to a bad recession and milder than the Covid-19 shock. And that is a worst-case scenario.” In short, a trade war to the death with the United States would be more costly for the European Union than the United States, but both would experience negative economic effects. Meanwhile, Europe’s politicians would be bolstered politically because it was the United States that started the fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union also has a new tool, the Anti-Coercion-Instrument (ACI), described as the union’s retaliatory “bazooka.” This is a new tool that the European Union has never used. The idea for the instrument emerged during the Trump administration but was only fully developed in response to China’s targeting of the Lithuanian economy following its increased diplomatic recognition of Taiwan. The tool is intended to enable the European Union to respond to a country that is targeting a member state and therefore seeking to undermine the single market. The instrument enables the European Union to apply a wide range of retaliatory measures, including revoking intellectual property rights that could be particularly harmful to U.S. tech companies in Europe. It also enables the European Union to block foreign direct investment and restrict access to banking, insurance, and other financial services. With regard to timing, the instrument was partly designed to allow for a swift response to economic coercion and will likely be applied expeditiously. However, it may take many months for an investigation to be concluded and for the European Council to determine the existence of economic coercion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an escalating trade war, the European Union will also try to counter the United States by forging a common front with other U.S. allies and G-7 members. On February 12, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was in Brussels to meet with the European Union, where trade tensions with the United States were no doubt discussed. The European Union will also seek to coordinate with other U.S. allies, such as Australia, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, and the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The potential for a transatlantic trade war to cause major economic fallout, as well as the European Union’s reasonably strong ability to fight such a war and link it to other policy areas, such as technology companies through the ACI, will likely create incentives on both sides not to let a trade war spiral out of hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;technology-regulations-the-coming-us-eu-techpocalypse&quot;&gt;Technology Regulations: The Coming U.S.-EU Techpocalypse?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology regulations may well be the policy area where collision becomes most politically intense. U.S. technology companies have long opposed European technology regulations. Yet the depth of hostility and concern on both sides of the Atlantic since Trump’s election has been revealing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the election of Donald Trump, U.S. tech companies see a huge opportunity for the United States to assert maximum pressure on the European Union to drop its approach toward tech regulation. They, much like U.S. companies in other sectors, see Europe’s military dependence as potential leverage vis-à-vis the European Union. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg asserted that EU competition rules were “almost like a tariff” and that “If some other country was screwing with another industry that we cared about, the U.S. government would probably find some way to put pressure on them.” Marc Andreessen, cofounder of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and an influential Trump donor, told Ross Douthat in a New York Times podcast that “we face enormous challenges in Europe. Enormous challenges even in the U.K. There’s just these extremely draconian anti-tech, anti-business, anti-American policies . . . what they’re also doing is damaging our companies. And so we would like to work with the administration to help global markets open up and for American companies to win.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many respects, U.S. tech companies are fighting so hard not because they can walk away from their second-largest market—a market roughly the size of the United States—but because they can’t. What they are extremely nervous about is the so-called Brussels effect—whereby EU regulations in fact set global market standards due to the European Union’s market size and pave the way for others around the world (Brazil, India, etc.) to emulate the EU rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet U.S. pressure may backfire and in fact put U.S. tech companies more in the firing line. A Financial Times report, for instance, highlighted the ability of the European Union to suspend intellectual property rights in the European Union for U.S. tech companies as part of the ACI to respond to U.S. tariffs or threats against Greenland. The maximum pressure campaign on tech regulations, coupled with ignoring EU laws (essentially daring the European Union to respond, as X seems to be doing), is unlikely to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union has initially responded gingerly to statements from the Trump administration. The union, for instance, dropped it AI liability proposal, following Vice President Vance’s speech in Paris, which attacked EU technology regulation. Yet the clashes in the above areas will likely stiffen the commission’s spine. There are also several reasons why the European Union will find it incredibly difficult to compromise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, by elevating the publicity around the clash, U.S. tech companies are threatening the very credibility of the European Union, which the union will likely doggedly defend. The European Union is almost certainly not going to back down and may accelerate its enforcement of its tech laws. Furthermore, should the European Union fail to implement its laws, EU citizens can take the union to the European Court of Justice, the EU supreme court, potentially forcing greater enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Europe may have little to lose economically (and perhaps more to gain) by vigorous enforcement of its regulations vis-à-vis U.S. companies, particularly relating to social media. There are many reasons why U.S. technology companies have been successful in Europe and have gained dominant market positions. But the European Union may also see economic advantages in disrupting those positions and creating space for EU, or at least EU-compliant, companies to gain market share. It is not as if entrepreneurs in the European Union are technologically incapable of building rival platforms, but they struggle to dislodge the existing companies and gain scale. When China and Russia banned U.S. platforms, they created their own equivalent technology companies. While there are many things the European Union needs to do facilitate innovation, such as improving access to capital, pushing U.S. companies out of the European market could create a vacuum for European tech companies to gain European scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, and perhaps most importantly, Europeans believe that the health of their democracy is at stake. The critical question for the European Union is whether it wants its tech, and particularly its social media sector, to look like that of the United States. A clash over Elon Musk’s X seems imminent. Since the election, Musk has bluntly inserted himself into European politics. He is publicly backing the far-right AfD in the German elections and gave the AfD’s lead candidate a high-profile interview. He has also gone after UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and promised to invest significantly to support the far-right reform party. Mark Zuckerberg has also changed Meta’s and Facebook’s content moderation policies in the United States, which may impact the European Union as well. Meanwhile, the European Union’s Digital Services Act is law and all but requires the union to act against X, given the utter lack of content moderation and other failings by X to meet the regulatory standards. Now former EU Commissioner Thierry Bretton has published a letter warning of X’s “due diligence obligations set out in the Digital Services Act.” The transition to a new EU Commission has temporarily put the issue on ice, but once the new EU Commission is in place, the European Union will have to respond to X’s flagrant disregard for EU law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, the U.S. banning of TikTok, as well as the emergence of rivals to X following Elon Musk’s purchase of Twitter, may reduce the fears of EU decisionmakers about disrupting the social media marketplace. Furthermore, while U.S. officials and executives decry Europe’s lack of innovation, Europeans may similarly see the United States’ virtually unregulated online media environment as politically and socially corrosive. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, for instance, said that social media companies “were poisoning society.” He continued: “Let’s take back control. Let’s make social media great again.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe is thus unlikely to back down to U.S. pressure on tech regulations and it may very well take stronger action as a result, as this is an area where it has considerable leverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;energy-and-climate-on-different-planets&quot;&gt;Energy and Climate: On Different Planets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transatlantic clashes over climate policy and regulations will also be tumultuous. The European Union, having passed the Green Deal under the previous European Commission, is now set to implement various regulations and provisions that will likely provoke strong reactions from the Trump administration and U.S. companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union will begin implementing a carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM), which is essentially a carbon tariff, in 2026. Navigating this would have been challenging under a Harris administration, since the United States lacks any carbon pricing mechanism. But because the United States was taking climate action through the Inflation Reduction Act and other regulatory means, the prevailing mood was that the United States and the European Union could come to an understanding. However, the Trump administration’s rollback of renewable energy incentives and environmental regulations means that carbon-intensive industries that export to the European Union will likely be affected by the tariff. Thus, even if there is a tariff détente reached in 2025 on other issues, CBAM implementation could trigger another conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, other provisions of the Green Deal, such as REPowerEU, the Green Deal Industrial Plan, the Regulation on Deforestation-free Products, and the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), which targets oil and gas companies and essentially enables EU citizens to engage in lawfare against fossil fuel companies, will spur clashes. Green policies have spurred backlash within Europe, and perhaps there would be openness to compromise or watering down some of these regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, the United States turning away from climate action, such as by pulling out of the Paris Climate Accords, will stoke intense anti-Americanism within Europe, especially among younger post–Cold War Europeans. European attitudes toward China may also soften given the bold steps China is taking on climate, creating a major opportunity for China to wedge European public opinion in its favor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-familiar-fight-the-rules-based-liberal-international-order&quot;&gt;The Familiar Fight: The “Rules-Based Liberal International Order”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe and the United States under Trump have different outlooks toward the world and different approaches to international affairs, which will serve to exacerbate tensions. For instance, the concept of a rules-based liberal international order is largely dismissed by many in the Trump administration yet remains foundational to Europe’s geopolitical outlook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Trump’s rhetoric about annexing Gaza for the United States and preventing Palestinians from returning was met with condemnation in Europe. Moreover, the president’s efforts to bring Greenland and the Panama Canal under U.S. control have similarly led to concerns in Europe about the United States undermining the post–World War II international consensus against the forceful or coercive changing of borders. Should the Trump administration pursue these efforts, it will inevitably lead to a diplomatic clash with Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration’s decision to sanction the International Criminal Court (ICC) has also been condemned by many EU countries. The European Union and European states are seeking to protect the ICC and maintain its international standing. European Commissioner for Democracy, Justice, the Rule of Law and Consumer Protection Michael McGrath pledged that the European Union will continue “to use the tools at . . . [its] disposal to protect the ICC.” This will likely be an area where there is a continuously simmering opposition to the Trump administration. The United States may make Europe a potential target of future secondary sanctions, similar to during Trump’s first term, when the United States pulled out of a nuclear agreement with Iran while Europe remained a party to it and became the target of secondary sanctions from the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the administration’s withdrawal from the World Health Organization and the Paris Climate Accords marks a stark contrast with Europe. These withdrawals sets up a familiar clash between Europe and U.S. Republican administrations, where the United States slams UN and other multilateral structures, while the European Union seeks to uphold and protect them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the abrupt shutdown of USAID, as well as the pullback of the United States from climate financing agreements with countries like South Africa and Indonesia, will put more of an onus on Europe. The European Union and its member states are already the largest foreign aid donors in the world. Yet there are fears that the ending of U.S. aid to places like the Horn of Africa could create instability and refugee flows. Thus, with the United States’ retreat there is more financial burden placed on Europe to support development, civil society, and democracy initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;china-renewed-transatlantic-divergence&quot;&gt;China: Renewed Transatlantic Divergence?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the first Trump administration, there was a growing schism between the United States and Europe over China. The Trump administration, understandably concerned about the increasing presence of the Chinese company Huawei in the digital infrastructure of its European allies, insisted that Europe stop incorporating Huawei into Europe’s networks. In December 2020, the European Union, led by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, negotiated a trade and investment agreement with China that was designed to bring Europe and China closer together economically. Yet the Biden administration made a concerted effort to increasingly align transatlantic approaches toward China. This led to a significant narrowing of the differences between the United States and Europe regarding China, with Europe largely adopting a much more hawkish tone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of this was due to China’s actions, such as its support of Russia’s war machine in Ukraine, and there are clear economic reasons for the Europeans to adopt a firm approach toward China. Yet the tensions that emerge in transatlantic relations in the aforementioned policy areas may also weaken transatlantic unity with regard to China policy. Europe has often seen the United States as unnecessarily hawkish on China, provoking tensions, such as with Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s 2022 visit to Taiwan. Thus, Europe may resist hawkish approaches toward China from the Trump administration. They may also see opportunities to cooperate with Beijing on global climate action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economically, Europe and China, both export-focused economies, are in firm competition with each other. Both China and Europe strive to be global leaders in the clean technology sector, for instance, and Chinese overproduction is threatening European industrial champions, particularly in the auto sector. Nevertheless, China may offer market access opportunities that may entice Europe to soften its approach toward Beijing. Europe’s instinct may become more skeptical of alignment with the United States on China policy, which in turn may lead to more tension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the policy areas examined in this report could become a major source of tension. They each could spiral out of control and cause deep, perhaps irrevocable risks to the future of the transatlantic alliance. Policymakers on both sides will need to be cognizant of the risks and the potential harm that such clashes can cause. As such, the United States should not assume European weakness, and Brussels should not assume the worst from Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration’s efforts to fundamentally alter the transatlantic relationship and shift the burden of European security to Europe should not have to mean the end of the alliance. Europe will need to act. But the Trump administration should also realize that upending the alliance while also escalating fights in other policy areas such as trade, tech, and climate, or imposing secondary sanctions on Europeans, may cause major blowback in each of those policy areas and, most importantly, irrevocably rupture the alliance. Collisions are inevitably coming, but both sides should proceed with care.&lt;/p&gt;

As China pushes forward with its latest LLM, Europe faces tough questions on innovation, competition, and digital sovereignty.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On January 20, 2025, Chinese AI company DeepSeek released its R1 reasoning model, causing U.S. policymakers and technologists to dramatically reevaluate their assumptions about the state of the Chinese AI ecosystem. President Donald Trump noted, “The release . . . should be a wake-up call for our industries that we need to be laser-focused on competing to win, because we have the greatest scientists in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;R1, and the DeepSeek V3 model it was based on, demonstrates an innovative approach to AI model development in several important ways, primarily in cost and compute efficiency. This did not come without controversies. White House AI Czar David Sacks said there is “substantial evidence” that DeepSeek distilled knowledge out of OpenAI’s models. Meanwhile, OpenAI alleged that DeepSeek’s use of data distilled from OpenAI’s models in training R1 broke OpenAI’s terms of service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The controversy was not limited to the United States, however. European regulators have greeted DeepSeek’s rise with concern, even as leading European AI companies have expressed excitement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;positive-news-for-european-startups---&quot;&gt;Positive News for European Startups . . .&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European startups have hailed R1 as a major advancement and opportunity, as it hints at the possibility for EU startups to successfully compete despite disadvantages (compared with U.S. firms), such as the lack of capital and limited access to large-scale compute infrastructure. French AI champion Mistral AI has been particularly enthusiastic about R1’s release, claiming that it proves the viability of an emerging wave of mini-language models (using far fewer parameters and running on far less compute).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On January 30, Mistral announced its latest AI model, praising R1 in the press release as a “a great and complementary piece of open-source technology!” Mistral’s CEO Arthur Mensch went even further in an interview on February 10, calling DeepSeek “a player that is very similar to us” and saying it is “China’s Mistral.” Companies do not normally compliment their ostensible competitors when announcing new products. That Mistral chose to do so highlights just how much they believe DeepSeek has changed the game, even though in the same interview Mensch also stated that DeepSeek “made extensive use of the technologies we made available in 2023.” The German AI champion, Aleph Alpha, already dropped out of the model-developing race a while ago, but it quickly began offering DeepSeek models as part of its portfolio of business-focused AI services. Whereas Mistral evidently sought to ride the DeepSeek hype wave, even claiming its innovations originate from Mistral’s ones, Aleph Alpha saw DeepSeek as a technology enabler. Even as recently as a month ago, few would have expected EU firms to talk about Chinese AI model developers in such terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;---but-cause-for-concern-among-european-regulators&quot;&gt;. . . But Cause for Concern Among European Regulators&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European regulators disagree. DeepSeek made itself freely available both to download and to use as an online app in the European marketplace. For an AI model, this is not inherently problematic, but there are specific features of DeepSeek’s models that likely run afoul of EU regulations, in particular with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the key law covering privacy in Europe, and the EU AI Act, which covers AI safety and security issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;privacy-concerns&quot;&gt;Privacy Concerns&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;R1’s privacy policy is clearly not compliant with GDPR. It is not by chance that several national data protection authorities (like those of Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, and the Netherlands) immediately sent official requests for information to DeepSeek. Italy went even further, blocking access to the app only days after it came out. Italian privacy authorities judged the information DeepSeek submitted to be “totally insufficient.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, DeepSeek’s privacy policy openly states that users’ data will be stored in the People’s Republic of China (PRC), fails to even mention GDPR, and states that the jurisdiction for personal data processing is the PRC. Each of these elements can be construed as in breach of the European Union’s strict data protection rules, given the model is made widely accessible in the European Union. Humorously, when prompted to assess its own privacy policy for GDPR compliance, the R1 model stated flatly that it had several gaps (see Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/IqWDpu5.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: DeepSeek’s Response to a User Question About GDPR Compliance.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/michael-van-den-poel_talk-of-the-brussels-town-today-deepseek-activity-7290006543016558593-A-bK?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&quot;&gt;Michaël Van den Poel, LinkedIn post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These gaps, if not addressed, could very well lead to a broader restriction of DeepSeek across Europe in the near future. Such a restriction would presumably apply regardless of who is providing access to DeepSeek’s model. For example, Microsoft, which has begun offering access to DeepSeek in its Azure cloud environment, will likely be affected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;safety-and-security-concerns&quot;&gt;Safety and Security Concerns&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GDPR is already having an impact on DeepSeek, but whether the EU AI Act will do the same remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early red-teaming tests performed on R1 by Enkrypt AI, an American AI firm focused on AI security and compliance, suggest that the model lacks even basic safety and security measures and is prone to generate biased, violent, and abusive content, as well as insecure code. In particular, Enkrypt found that DeepSeek R1 is 11 times more vulnerable to producing harmful content and 4.5 times more vulnerable to generating insecure code than OpenAI’s o1. Similar results were confirmed by other testers, including Adversa and Cisco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this background, European officials told CSIS that regulators are concerned that the success of DeepSeek could create a race to the bottom by incentivizing companies to cut corners on basic safety and security guardrails in order to release similar “mini-models” as fast as possible. An additional source of concern is the possibility that the Chinese government might leverage R1 for surveillance or military applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU AI Act will apply to general-purpose AI (GPAI) models beginning in August 2025. By that time, all GPAI models placed on the EU market will have to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;draw up detailed technical documentation,&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;put in place a copyright policy, and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;publish a sufficiently detailed summary of copyrighted content used to train the model.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Models released under an open-source license will escape the technical documentation obligations, but not the copyright ones. Whether or not R1 would legally qualify as an open-source model will be discussed later in this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, models reaching the threshold of 10&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; floating point operations (FLOPs) (whether open source or not) will have to comply with further obligations, namely:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;model evaluation,&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;risk assessment and mitigation,&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;incident reporting, and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;cybersecurity measures.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether or not these rules will apply to models such as R1 remains to be seen and is likely to become one of the first key interpretative decisions of the European Union’s AI Office regarding the act’s implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-deepseek-r1-considered-open-source-under-the-eu-ai-act&quot;&gt;Is DeepSeek R1 Considered Open Source Under the EU AI Act?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the EU AI Act exempts open-source model providers from transparency obligations, it is important to assess whether or not DeepSeek R1 can be considered open source within the meaning of the regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The text of the act does not contain a definition of open source. It merely states that providers will enjoy different and reduced regulatory obligations if their AI models “are released under a free and open-source licence that allows for the access, usage, modification, and distribution of the model, and whose parameters, including the weights, the information on the model architecture, and the information on model usage, are made publicly available.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judging from the license and the information DeepSeek has made available, these criteria all seem to be met. However, while the above is the formal law statement on what constitutes open-source AI, the AI Act includes additional text, called recitals, which do not have the same legal standing as the law’s articles but are critical clarifying statements of how the law will be implemented. The relevant recital on what qualifies as open source states that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this Regulation, AI components that are provided against a price or otherwise monetised, including through the provision of technical support . . . or the use of personal data for reasons other than exclusively for improving the security, compatibility or interoperability of the software . . . should not benefit from the exceptions provided to free and open-source AI components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The non-monetization element is the one that appears to be missing in the case of DeepSeek, in particular because of the use of personal data. As explained above, DeepSeek’s privacy policy is problematic under GDPR. In DeepSeek’s policy, in the section “How We Use Your Information,” the last point states that DeepSeek will use the personal data to “comply with our legal obligations, or as necessary to perform tasks in the public interest, or to protect the vital interests of our users and other people.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without even going into details on what complying with legal obligations or performing tasks in the public interest could mean for a Chinese company, this point alone seems to go beyond using personal data exclusively for improving the security, compatibility, or interoperability of the software. Therefore, depending on how much weight the AI Office will give to elements written in the explanatory recitals of the regulation (that are not directly enforceable), it is also possible that DeepSeek will not be considered as meeting the open-source criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;does-r1s-use-of-distillation-techniques-fall-under-the-eu-ai-acts-measures-around-fine-tuning&quot;&gt;Does R1’s Use of Distillation Techniques Fall Under the EU AI Act’s Measures Around “Fine-Tuning?”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crux of the whole question revolves around the problem of defining what R1, which DeepSeek serves through its app and other channels, actually is. As mentioned above, OpenAI and prominent White House representatives have alleged that DeepSeek likely employed distillation of OpenAI models to help achieve R1’s impressive results. In the words of Microsoft engineers Vishal Yadav and Nikhil Pandey, distillation is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;a technique designed to transfer knowledge of a large pre-trained model (the “teacher”) into a smaller model (the “student”), enabling the student model to achieve comparable performance to the teacher model. This technique allows users to leverage the high quality of larger LLMs, while reducing inference costs in a production environment, thanks to the smaller student model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, researchers analyzing R1 seem to indicate that the concept of distillation does not exactly apply in this case, or applies only in part. Indeed, R1 is the result of pure reinforcement learning applied to an already capable model (in this case, DeepSeek’s V3) combined with further training stages using different methods to refine the model and make it more readable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AI Office is working on guidelines around the issue of fine-tuning to clarify how the AI Act’s provisions can apply to downstream model providers. The direction of these guidelines will determine the different scenarios that are further explored in this article and depicted in Figure 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/SWr9Nrm.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: Key Legal Questions for DeepSeek’s R1 Under the EU AI Act.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Author’s analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European Parliament and European Council sources told CSIS that when writing the AI Act, their intention was that fine-tuning a model would not immediately trigger regulatory obligations. Indeed, the rules for GPAI models are intended to ideally apply only to the upstream model, the baseline one from which all the different applications in the AI value chain originate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the AI Act would trigger for fine-tuning are mere “value-chain” provisions. That is, the fine-tuner just needs to augment the information already provided by the upstream model provider with any changes made. As an example, if a law firm fine-tunes GPT-4 by training it with thousands of case laws and legal briefs to build its own specialized “lawyer-friendly” application, it would not need to draw up a whole set of detailed technical documentation, its own copyright policy, and a summary of copyrighted data. Instead, the law firm in question would only need to indicate on the existing documentation the process it used to fine-tune GPT-4 and the datasets it used (in this example, the one containing the thousands of case laws and legal briefs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;step-1-does-r1-amount-to-fine-tuning&quot;&gt;Step 1: Does R1 Amount to Fine-Tuning?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the AI Office confirms that distillation is a form of fine-tuning, especially if the AI Office concludes that R1’s other various training techniques all fall within the realm of “fine-tuning,” then DeepSeek would only have to complete the information to pass along the value chain, just as the law firm did. The information and research papers that DeepSeek released already seem to comply with this measure (though the data would be incomplete if OpenAI’s claims are true).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, if the guidelines indicate that the combination of distillation and the other refining techniques used for R1 are so sophisticated that they created a new model in its own right, then the provisions of the AI Act for GPAI models will apply to it starting August 2, 2025. To be more precise, the AI Act states that GPAI models already placed on the market before that date must “take the necessary steps in order to comply with the obligations by 2 August 2027,” or in two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;step-2-if-r1-is-a-new-model-can-it-be-designated-as-a-gpai-model-with-systemic-risk&quot;&gt;Step 2: If R1 Is a New Model, Can It Be Designated as a GPAI Model with Systemic Risk?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, EU regulators will have to take another step to decide exactly what provisions R1 should comply with. Since R1’s size is well below the EU AI Act threshold of 10&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; FLOPs, they could conclude that DeepSeek need only comply with baseline provisions for all GPAI models, that is, technical documentation and copyright provisions (see above). If DeepSeek’s models are considered open source through the interpretation described above, the regulators could conclude that it would largely be exempted from most of these measures, except for the copyright ones. As explained above, this remains to be clarified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, there is still a possibility that the AI Office designates R1 as a GPAI model with systemic risk even though it sits well below the 10&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; FLOPs threshold that would normally trigger the designation. The AI Act indeed foresees the possibility of a GPAI model below that compute threshold to be designated as a model with systemic risk anyway, in presence of a combination of other criteria (e.g., number of parameters, size of the data set, and number of registered business users).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this designation occurs, then DeepSeek would have to put in place adequate model evaluation, risk assessment, and mitigation measures, as well as cybersecurity measures. It could not escape these through the open-source exemption, as this does not apply to models with systemic risk. Failure to comply would likely result in fines up to 3 percent of DeepSeek’s annual turnover (a figure that is usually similar to annual revenue) or being restricted from the EU single market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The operationalization of the rules on GPAI models is currently being drafted within the so-called Code of Practice. Because DeepSeek is not a participant to the drafting of the code, U.S. AI companies have a great opportunity to continue to constructively engage in the drafting process, as doing so will allow them to shape the rules that DeepSeek will have to follow a few months from now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;deepseek-new-concern-or-opportunity-for-europe-the-different-scenarios&quot;&gt;DeepSeek: New Concern or Opportunity for Europe? The Different Scenarios&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AI Office will have to tread very carefully with the fine-tuning guidelines and the possible designation of DeepSeek R1 as a GPAI model with systemic risk. On the one hand, DeepSeek and its further replications or similar mini-models have shown European companies that it is entirely possible to compete with, and possibly outperform, the most advanced large-scale models using much less compute and at a fraction of the cost. This could open a whole new array of attractive opportunities. The AI Office will need to navigate the trade-off between securing robust guardrails and the need to boost the lagging European AI ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scenario-1-r1-is-considered-mere-fine-tuning&quot;&gt;Scenario 1: R1 Is Considered Mere Fine-Tuning.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If, as described above, R1 is considered fine-tuning, European companies reproducing similar models with similar techniques will virtually escape almost all AI Act provisions. This could potentially open the way to hundreds of startups quickly becoming competitive with U.S. giants such as OpenAI, Meta, and Anthropic, which will instead have to comply with the highest tier of GPAI obligations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, DeepSeek’s R1 and similar models across the world will themselves escape the rules, with only GDPR left to protect EU citizens from harmful practices. Nevertheless, GDPR might by itself result in an EU-wide restriction of access to R1. This would provide EU companies with even more space to compete, as they are better suited to navigate the bloc’s privacy and security rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This overall scenario could sit well with the clear shift in focus toward competitiveness under the new EU legislative term, which runs from 2024 to 2029. The European Commission released a Competitiveness Compass on January 29, a roadmap detailing its approach to innovation. The document foresees a key role for AI in boosting the European Union’s industry, and it lists several upcoming policy and legislative initiatives in this regard. In the words of EU Commissioner for Tech Sovereignty Henna Virkkunen, “the EU must become a true AI continent.” This scenario is therefore possibly the most desirable for EU companies, though perhaps the least desirable for U.S. ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scenario-2-r1-is-considered-to-be-a-gpai-model&quot;&gt;Scenario 2: R1 Is Considered to Be a GPAI Model.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If R1 is considered to be a GPAI model in its own right (triggering the basic tier of obligations), and possibly a GPAI model with systemic risk, it will have to comply with the highest set of requirements of the AI Act for GPAI models. Similar models can still flourish in Europe, but they will also have to follow the AI Act’s rules, at the very least on transparency and copyright. Furthermore, if R1 is designated as a model with systemic risk, the possibility to replicate similar results in multiple new models in Europe could result in a flourishing of models with systemic risk. This scenario was not foreseen by the European co-legislators when the AI Act was negotiated, as the assumption always was that the top-tier would only be represented by a handful of providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, this scenario would possibly be the most beneficial for U.S. companies, which would still be competitive and be on a level-playing field with both DeepSeek’s R1 and EU companies. They would also have the additional advantage of participating in the ongoing drafting of the Code of Practice detailing how to comply with the AI Act’s requirements for models. The European Union’s Mistral AI would similarly benefit from a first-mover advantage, but not the many EU startups that could further build on these innovations, as they are mainly not directly part to the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The novelty introduced by R1 creates both new concerns and incredible opportunities for Europe in the AI space. While it is unclear yet whether and to what extent the EU AI Act will apply to it, it still poses a lot of privacy, safety, and security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To mitigate the safety and security issues, Europe’s best option is to designate R1 as a GPAI model in its own right, as described above in Scenario 2. This would ensure that similar mini-models that employ different refining techniques could also fall within the AI Act’s rules, at the very least on transparency and copyright. European companies already have to comply with the GDPR and usually integrate responsible AI governance practices and safety measures in their AI products. Complying with transparency and copyright rules should not pose too big of an additional hurdle for them. The cost and compute efficiencies that R1 has shown present opportunities for European AI companies to be much more competitive than seemed possible a year ago, perhaps even more competitive than R1 itself in the EU market. EU models might indeed be not only as efficient and accurate as R1, but also more trusted by consumers on issues of privacy, safety, and security. This might be the best of both worlds, but European officials and companies will have to navigate a complex road ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, Morocco has emerged as a key player in supporting stability in the Sahel, leveraging its strategic position, deep historical ties, and economic and infrastructure development partnerships to promote cross-border security cooperation. In December 2024, RUSI convened a roundtable discussion to explore “The Geopolitics of the Sahel: Transnational Threats, Security and Stability”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sahel has emerged as a critical geopolitical region where the UK and its allies face consequential policy decisions related to security, stability, cross-border organised crime, terrorism, illegal migration and illicit finance. Similarly, Morocco’s policy priorities and national security are deeply connected to, and influenced by, developments in the Sahel. As a historical bridge between North and West Africa, Morocco is uniquely positioned to act as a stabilising force, using a mix of diplomatic, economic and security tools to support sustainable development and security in the Sahel. Rabat has taken a number of strategic steps to emerge as a key security partner to the UK and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most ambitious steps taken by Rabat is the recent Morocco Atlantic Initiative, which aims to provide landlocked Sahel countries with access to vital maritime trade routes via Morocco’s Atlantic port infrastructure. The plan aims to foster economic regional integration to reduce dependence on unstable transit routes, while fostering Morocco’s ties with its southern neighbours to counter instability, terrorism and illicit trafficking in the region in the long term. Economic integration and stability would align with the UK’s interest in promoting stability and security for the region’s peoples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morocco’s engagement with the Sahel is also deeply embedded in broader geo-economic partnerships to strengthen regional integration, such as the Nigeria-Morocco Gas Pipeline, which aims to connect West African energy resources to North Africa and Europe. While there are many security, political and diplomatic challenges facing the region, Morocco’s investments in infrastructure, banking and telecommunications illustrate its commitment to economic interdependence to counter extremism and promote sustainable partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;beatriz-de-león-cobo&quot;&gt;Beatriz de León Cobo&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sahel region of Africa continues to face urgent security challenges, with far-reaching consequences for both the continent and its international partners. Stretching across the expanse of West Africa from Senegal to Sudan, the Sahel has long been susceptible to threats such as terrorism, insurgency, illicit trafficking, and governance crises. Over the past decade, the region has experienced a significant surge in jihadist violence, mostly carried out by groups affiliated with al-Qa’ida and Islamic State. These armed actors take advantage of porous borders, fragile states, and local grievances to extend their operational reach. This article will focus on the central Sahel region and its bordering areas in the Maghreb and West Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2025, a year on from the initial announcement of their intention to do so, Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger officially withdrew from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). These three countries, all members of the Alliance of Sahel States (AES), continued to deepen their integration while leaving the West African community. Originally formed to address common security threats, the AES soon evolved into a platform for these governments to assert a new vision of sovereignty and partnership. This departure marks a major upheaval in the regional architecture, affecting trade, freedom of movement, and collective security frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During an ECOWAS summit in Abuja, the three AES states formally rejected a proposal to delay their departure by six months, opting instead for a more immediate exit, despite intense diplomatic efforts by President Bassirou Diomaye Faye of Senegal and President Faure Gnassingbé of Togo. In response to the withdrawal, ECOWAS indicated it would maintain a “status quo” while organising exit talks with the AES. A statement released on 29 January 2025 confirmed that AES citizens holding ECOWAS-issued documents would retain recognition of their passports and identification cards until further notice. Goods and services originating from Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger would also remain subject to ECOWAS trade policies for the time being. According to ECOWAS officials, these steps aim to prevent abrupt disruptions, mitigate economic fallout, and keep dialogue channels open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Access to Morocco’s ports for Sahel countries offers a critical corridor to global markets, reducing their reliance on other neighbours&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the long-term outcome remains uncertain. Negotiators suggest transitional arrangements may include a grace period, followed by bilateral accords to address specific security and trade issues. Whether these interim measures will be sufficient to avert further instability remains to be seen. What is evident, however, is that the AES’s departure represents a watershed moment that could reshaping economic, security, social, migratory and diplomatic relations in West Africa. Given that Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger occupy strategic areas of the Sahel, this separation has sparked concerns about the future of regional security and border cooperation. Observers fear a split in ECOWAS unity could undermine the region’s collective ability to combat transnational threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost in tandem with their ECOWAS withdrawal, the AES governments unveiled plans for a unified military force of 5,000 soldiers. Each of the three AES armies are expected to contribute troops, tasked with conducting joint operations in areas of intense jihadist activity. In their view, establishing a self-sufficient military partnership is the most dependable way to safeguard sovereignty. However, logistical coordination and consistent funding will be critical; previous initiatives, such as the G5 Sahel Joint Force, struggled with both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although 5,000 soldiers is a starting point, it will not be enough to secure a vast, geographically challenging territory spanning nearly three million square kilometres. Sustained success will require ongoing intelligence sharing, air support, and potentially selective partnerships for air capabilities. Partners for the latter may include non-Western powers such as Russia, Turkey or China, which have already been providing bilateral military assistance and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a time when AES countries are seeking to diversify their partnerships – as evidenced by the continued closure of Western military bases, including the US base in Niger in August 2024 and France’s base in Chad in December 2024 – other actors such as regional states are assuming more prominent roles. For instance, North African countries have heightened their involvement. Algeria, given its borders and historical ties to Mali, has always played a pivotal role in the region. Since the renewal of hostilities in northern Mali at the end of 2023, Algeria has once again been drawn into security and diplomatic tensions in the border area, particularly following clashes between armed groups and government forces in Tinzawaten, which lies right on the Algerian border. Another Maghreb country that has been intensifying its diplomatic and economic efforts to extend its influence across the Sahel is Morrocco, which has been providing development aid and infrastructure investments while positioning itself as a reliable partner to the military governments in the Central Sahel – particularly after ECOWAS sanctions led to border closures, preventing access to crucial harbours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Morocco is championing the “Atlantic Initiative”, a strategy designed to offer Sahel countries another means of accessing the Atlantic Ocean via Moroccan ports, introducing an alternative trade route and strengthening road infrastructure. Because these countries are landlocked, access to Morocco’s ports offers a critical corridor to global markets, reducing their reliance on other neighbours. Another example of Morocco’s infrastructure and development partnership with the Central Sahel is its investment in a power plant in Niamey, inaugurated in December 2024. Niger had suffered electricity shortages due to sanctions imposed after its coup, and Morocco’s support helped reinforce Niger’s energy sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the changing landscape, Western partners have not fully disengaged from the Sahel. Many donor-funded programmes continue in sectors such as health, education and agriculture, recognising that security challenges often emerge from socio-economic disparities. The effectiveness of these programmes depends on strong collaboration with local authorities, who remain cautious of foreign interference. However, President Donald Trump’s decision in January 2025 to pause US foreign aid is having and will continue to have disruptive repercussions and has fuelled mistrust towards Western donors. This is therefore a critical moment for international donors to reinforce their support for Sahelian and West African populations during this period, recognising the importance of cross-border dynamics and collaborating with regional powers as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Success in achieving peace and prosperity in the Sahel and the West African region depends on cohesive, collective efforts that transcend national boundaries&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the clearest lessons to emerge from the escalating violence in the Sahel is that jihadist insurgencies are not confined by national borders. Armed groups exploit weak governance and local grievances in border regions to establish cross-border supply lines, recruitment networks, and safe havens. Understanding this dynamic is crucial for any analysis of how security vacuums in the Sahel can spill over into neighbouring states. Jihadist organisations in the Sahel are far from monolithic. They adapt to military pressure, political changes, and shifting alliances, posing a formidable challenge for regional governments and their international allies. For nearly a decade, Bamako, the capital of Mali, had been spared high-profile jihadist attacks. That changed in September 2024, when Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin targeted both the École de Gendarmerie and the airport, resulting in multiple casualties and reviving memories of attacks on hotels and restaurants in the mid-2010s. In January 2025, two high-profile kidnappings involving Western nationals – in southern Algeria and in Niger’s Agadez region – demonstrated the fluid collaboration between various criminal, bandit and jihadist networks. These groups often cooperate along the so-called “kidnapping supply chain”, from identifying targets to ransom negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extremist violence once primarily localised in Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso is gradually expanding into northern areas of coastal states such as Benin, Togo and, to a lesser degree, Ghana. Coastal states have therefore also become increasingly vocal about the southward spillover. Should cooperation between AES and these ECOWAS members weaken, their shared ability to conduct joint security operations and implement coordinated border controls would diminish, thereby increasing the risk of terrorist infiltration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the West African security environment remains precarious, shaped by changing alliances, rising terrorist activity, and shifting international partnerships. The decision by Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger to leave ECOWAS and form the AES reflects a drive for self-reliance and diversified alliances. However, it also highlights the fragility of regional cooperation at a time when cross-border threats are intensifying. Sustained security responses will require robust intelligence sharing, joint operations, and socio-economic investments that address the root causes of conflict. Above all, the imperative of cross-border collaboration cannot be overstated. Whether through partnerships or coordination with regional and international actors, success in achieving peace and prosperity in the Sahel and the West African region depends on cohesive, collective efforts that transcend national boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;國安法後刊文章談及制裁林鄭 控方質疑不可能屬「不小心」 黎智英否認高層有共識發布&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，今（12日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第133日審訊，黎智英第41日作供，控方就《蘋果》英文版盤問黎。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;《國安法》生效之後，《蘋果》刊登旅美作家「一劍飄塵」專欄文章〈美國會制裁林鄭月娥嗎？〉，並翻譯成英文、刊登在英文版。控方質疑文章遍及實體報紙、網上中文版和英文版，須經過羅偉光、楊清奇和馮偉光等高層，乃非常不可能屬「不小心」。黎則否認高層之間有共識發布該文章。此外，控方展示一連串訊息，顯示黎籲應該集中於中國新聞，又要求員工將某些中文新聞翻譯成英文，質疑屬編採指示。黎稱當時英文版正處於被建立及形塑的階段，故直至2020年8月，他仍有挑選文章、叫同事納入英文版，但是後來逐漸淡出。控方質疑黎更改說法，而較早前的證供是不真實。黎解釋：「我忘記了這個建立的時期。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法官甫開庭再度重申法庭審案只視乎證據和法律&quot;&gt;法官甫開庭再度重申法庭審案只視乎證據和法律&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;甫開庭，法官杜麗冰隨即表示，黎在庭上兩度稱自己為「政治犯」，因此有需要向黎說清楚，法庭審理案件只會視乎證據和相關法律，任何人抱持政治觀點，都要將政見「留在法庭之外」。杜官續指，法律面前人人平等，所有人在法庭面前都得到平等對待，他們都有權得到公平審訊，以上是她想提醒黎的說話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行其後問：「黎先生，你明白嗎？」黎未有正面回答，僅說：「請繼續。（Continue please.）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎早前供稱曾推薦桑普替《蘋果》撰寫時評，惟時任《蘋果》社長張劍虹告訴他，桑普提倡港獨，因此最終打消念頭。控方今問黎從何時開始留意到桑普？黎稱不記得。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另問，黎還有找什麼人協助尋找時評作家？黎稱只記得有 Mark Simon 和 Mark Clifford，其他人則不記得。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊清奇替蘋果撰社評談及制裁人權惡棍-黎稱甚少閱讀楊文章&quot;&gt;楊清奇替《蘋果》撰社評談及「制裁人權惡棍」 黎稱甚少閱讀楊文章&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著就另一名「從犯證人」、《蘋果》前主筆兼論壇版主管楊清奇（筆名李平）提問，並展示楊的社評文章〈制裁人權惡棍是釜底抽薪〉。控方指文章在2020年6月13日，即《國安法》生效之後發布。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎有否閱讀上述文章？黎則稱甚少閱讀《蘋果》社評，但有時會閱讀，因為喜歡顏純鈎（筆名方圓）撰寫的社評。至於副刊的專欄文章，黎稱每日都會看，但只會看部份專欄，因該些作者寫得非常好，例如馮睎乾。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問，楊清奇撰寫的社評談及「制裁」，不會引起黎的興趣嗎？黎稱沒有，因為楊是論壇版主管，在《蘋果》工作多年，他熟知楊的寫作，對他而言不是新鮮事，所以對他的文章不感興趣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方則指，黎不閱讀楊清奇的社評，是因為黎認為楊與他想法一致。黎則稱他起初有閱讀楊的社評，但是後來甚少閱讀。杜官問是否因為楊所寫的與黎所相信的一致？黎否認，提到楊來自中國，對他本人不熟悉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎是否知道楊與《蘋果》立場一致？黎同意。控方遂問，所以黎並沒有閱讀楊的文章？黎表示不是這個原因，只是因為黎不再對他感興趣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，楊在文章中要求外國實施制裁。黎稱未曾閱讀該文章，也可能未曾「瞥一眼」。控方又問黎是否知道楊的文章被翻譯成英文？黎稱不知道。控方遂展示英文版文章〈Editorial: Bring the impact of Magnitsky Human Rights Act into full play〉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示2020年7月14日的《蘋果》社評〈中共的打壓與制裁不足畏〉，同樣由楊清奇所撰寫。黎稱未曾閱讀，也不知道它被翻譯成英文及被納入英文版。控方展示文章的英文版本〈Editorial: Who is Afraid of CCP Sanctions and Oppressions?〉，問黎社評是否理應反映一份報紙的立場？黎認同應該是。控方追問，所以這篇社評不會引起黎的興趣去看看？黎稱沒有興趣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;一劍飄塵文章指香港人權法案是對香港的幫助-黎承認與其立場一致&quot;&gt;「一劍飄塵」文章指香港人權法案是對香港的幫助 黎承認與其立場一致&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提及，黎曾推薦旅美作家「一劍飄塵」撰寫時評，並展示2020年6月24日的訊息紀錄，黎向楊清奇說：「李平，這一篇（一劍飄塵文章）是全版寫得最好的文章。謝謝。」楊回覆：「這個作者是新找到的。謝謝鼓勵」；黎表示：「很好（的）作者，對事件有認識及理論基礎。謝謝。」在控方盤問下，黎同意當時楊乃在黎的要求下，邀請「一劍飄塵」撰寫文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎供稱只看過「一劍飄塵」第一篇刊登的文章，便不記得他往後有否繼續替《蘋果》撰文。控方遂向黎出示「一劍飄塵」第一篇文章〈不要把 BLM 和反送中混為一談〉，文章提及：「香港人權法案在國會通過以後，有許多人擔心他（特朗普）會拒絕簽署。最終他沒簽嗎？也是他的團隊宣佈要開放對香港的移民簽證。這不都是對香港實實在在的幫助？」控方問上述字句是否與黎的立場一致？黎稱這是很多人的立場，控方追問當中是否包括黎，黎回答包括他自己。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;一劍飄塵文章問美國會制裁林鄭月娥嗎-黎非提倡制裁&quot;&gt;「一劍飄塵」文章問「美國會制裁林鄭月娥嗎？」 黎：非提倡制裁&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示「一劍飄塵」另一篇文章〈美國會制裁林鄭月娥嗎？〉，於2020年7月18日刊登於《蘋果》。黎稱沒有看過這篇文章。惟控方質疑，黎聲稱希望「一劍飄塵」撰寫更多文章，因此不會有興趣閱讀他的文章嗎？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，當黎「瞥一眼」報紙的時候，不會留意到「林鄭月娥」一字嗎？黎稱沒有。控方又問，文中所提及的制裁，不是黎一直以來尋求的嗎？黎重申他沒有閱讀該文章，無論控方問多少次，他都會這樣回答。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰提到，黎早前供稱一直籲下屬在《國安法》之下謹慎行事，避免觸犯國安法，那麼為何容許下屬發布談及制裁的文章？黎回答李平是「把關者（Goalkeeper）」，對他予以信任。李官問黎會否認為李平不跟從他的指示？黎稱「一劍飄塵」可能在文章表示不認同制裁林鄭，但是得悉文章談及制裁之後，他估計可能作者一時疏忽，又或者其時制裁已經獲通過，而他並非正在提倡制裁。法官杜麗冰質疑，文章標題是「美國會制裁林鄭月娥嗎？」，乃未來式而非過去式。黎僅稱他只是猜測。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/yFx55cB.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 前《蘋果》總編輯羅偉光&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎同意非常不可能屬疏忽-惟否認有共識發布談及制裁文章&quot;&gt;黎同意非常不可能屬疏忽 惟否認有共識發布談及制裁文章&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示文章網上中文版本，《蘋果》網上版是由時任總編輯羅偉光負責，問黎是否想說羅偉光有疏忽？黎回答：「某程度上，是。」他指羅可能認為「一劍飄塵」在談論已經通過的法案，而不是在提倡制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官指文章作者似乎認為，若果美國政府制裁打壓新疆的中國官員的話，「他們會放過林鄭嗎？」，問黎是否同意作者？黎重申沒有閱讀過文章，但是認為作者只是提出問題而非提倡制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示文章網上英文版本，問黎是否允許時任英文版主筆馮偉光（筆名盧峯）發布相關文章？黎僅稱，馮發布之前未有徵求他的允許。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，發布〈美國會制裁林鄭月娥嗎？〉一事中，遍及實體報紙、網上中文版和網上英文版，並涉及五名高層，包括張劍虹、陳沛敏、羅偉光、楊清奇和馮偉光，是否非常不可能屬「不小心」？黎同意，但否認高層之間有共識發布該文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎籲英文版只報導中國新聞-否認下編採指示-反稱是營商指示&quot;&gt;黎籲英文版只報導中國新聞 否認下編採指示 反稱是「營商指示」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示「English news」群組訊息，黎傳送《蘋果》英文新聞連結〈Republicans say Biden ‘Good for Iran and ISIS. Great for China’（共和黨指拜登對伊朗和伊斯蘭國而言是好、對中國而言是棒）〉，並說：「我不認為這類新聞有需要，因為當地的媒體理應已有報導。我反而認為我們應該集中於中國新聞，以及使別人知道我們集中於中國新聞。（“I don’t think this kind of news is needed since wherever they come their local news media should have covered it. I rather think that we should focus on Chinese news and be known for it without dilution.”）」馮回覆：「好吧，由今天起停止做國際新聞。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問這是否黎的編採指示。黎否認，強調只是經營一門生意應有的方式，即是集中在應該做的事上，避免被沖淡。控方則指黎是在掌舵《蘋果》的運作方向。黎堅稱這是營商原則，使《蘋果》集中在中國新聞，以免主旨被沖淡。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰質疑這是一個編採指示，黎想集中在中國新聞，而不是國際新聞，因為其後馮偉光回覆訊息表示：「好吧，由今天起停止做國際新聞。」黎堅稱：「這是營商指示（business direction），這是我們應該怎樣經營的方式。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在盤問下，黎同意當時持續監督《蘋果》英文版。控方續指，黎就應該發布什麼新聞方面給予職員指示。黎則稱，當時是提出「營商焦點（business focus）」，因為英文版仍然很新，所以持續監督。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎訊息叫盧峯盡快將新聞加入英文版-惟否認給予指示&quot;&gt;黎訊息叫盧峯「盡快」將新聞加入英文版 惟否認給予指示&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示2020年6月15日的訊息，黎向馮偉光傳送一則連結〈新编高中教材“毛泽东思想”回归！透露重大信号？〉，並問：「以上新聞是否已在英文版？謝謝。」馮回覆：「還沒有」，黎表示：「請盡快，謝謝。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎否認向馮給予指示，僅傳送一些有趣的東西給馮。控方質疑，但是黎叫馮「請盡快」？黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又質疑，當黎在網上看到有趣的文章，不會叫職員去翻譯成英文，然後在英文版發布嗎？黎則稱沒有，因這不是他的職責。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎改認要求職員將新聞翻譯成英文-因英文版正處於被建立及形塑的階段&quot;&gt;黎改認要求職員將新聞翻譯成英文 因英文版正處於被建立及形塑的階段&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示群組訊息，黎於6月28日向群組傳送兩張報紙報導的相片，分別為〈條文後日通過 駐港公署7.1運作 違國安惡法可囚終身〉和〈鍾國斌：《自治法》嚴重威脅商界〉。黎稱：「Lo Fung, Hope these two items of news have English edition later. Thanks, Jimmy（盧峯，希望這兩則新聞稍後有英文版本，謝謝。）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，從訊息可見黎的確有叫員工將某些新聞翻譯成英文。黎稱當時英文版正處於被建立及形塑的階段，形容「產品尚未成形」，需要「反覆試驗（trial and error）」，所以會叫職員要做什麼新聞，但之後便沒有再作出要求，因為知道職員會自動去做。控方質疑黎更改早前說法，並追問黎在哪時開始不再要求，黎稱不記得。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訊息顯示黎多次要求馮偉光將新聞翻譯成英文-讓他發布在twitter&quot;&gt;訊息顯示黎多次要求馮偉光將新聞翻譯成英文 讓他發布在Twitter&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方遂展示訊息，顯示黎在2020年6月28日至7月1日期間，多次向馮偉光傳送報紙照片，要求翻譯成英文，分別為〈03年以來7.1遊行首被禁 民陣指全世界見證港人權倒退〉、〈醫護或須宣誓 醫生協會：不能違背良知〉、〈777向聯合國死撐司法仍獨立〉。黎並向馮偉光說：「Lo Fung, I hope the above would have English editions later. Thanks, Jimmy（盧峯，我希望以上可以稍後有英文版本，謝謝。）」馮回覆：「Yes, some of these already on line.（是的，部份已經在網上。）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰一度問：「什麼是777？」黎指是前特首林鄭月娥。法官李素蘭以中文說出「777」，問是否這個「777」？黎回答是。控方問，這是否帶貶意的稱呼？黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示2020年7月14日的訊息，黎向馮傳送數張報紙的照片〈立會初選電子投票結果：本土派素人大勝〉、〈警曾搜查香港民研 接觸所有電器系統 結果外洩 掀國安監控恐慌〉、〈狀告政府瞞疫 法院拒立案 武肺難屬抗爭 官《國安法》恐嚇〉。黎並向馮說：「Lo Fung, When above news have English edition please forward for me for my Twitter posting. Thanks, Jimmy（盧峯，當以上新聞有英文版本時，請轉發給我讓我發布在 Twitter。謝謝。）」馮回覆：「Sure（一定會。）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎在2020年8月26日向英文版群組「English news」傳送兩張報紙相片，標題為〈中共威權炮製惜食鬧劇 專家：政策半年玩完〉，副標題為〈每年進口糧食一億噸 難自給自足〉。黎在群組中詢問：「這些新聞很重要，我們有翻譯嗎？謝謝。」同年6月12日，黎亦傳送訊息：「今日評論版潘小濤李平，甚至抗爭者的文章都可翻譯，我估我們一定知道，只不過順便一提，謝謝。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;針對黎早上稱沒有閱讀論壇版，控方指從訊息可見他其實有閱讀。黎確認有時會閱讀。法官李素蘭問到，黎有否每日翻開整份報紙來看？黎稱有，但是當他不在香港的時候，便無法看報紙。控方問，當黎身處外地時，會否看《蘋果》網上版新聞？黎稱只有看中文版，但是沒有看英文版。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎認英文版面世後三個月持續挑選文章-惟隨時間淡出&quot;&gt;黎認英文版面世後三個月持續挑選文章 惟隨時間淡出&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎其後傳送訊息：「對不起，起初沒看清楚，這有權鬥內容應該是好的花絮。謝謝。」黎在庭上確認訊息是指關於中共的權鬥，希望同事能將有關新聞納入英文版。控方問這是否符合黎想要中國負面新聞的想法？黎則稱，他認為中共權鬥內容對於讀者而言是有趣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年7月26日，黎向群組傳送訊息：「劍虹，盧峯，我認為 English Edition 的新聞太少，雖然評論算不錯，但新聞是重點，要想法子增加。謝謝。」控方質疑，所以黎其實有閱讀英文版的評論文章。法官李素蘭問，黎剛才早上又說他只閱讀英文版的新聞？黎則回應，當時英文版尚在建立階段，所以曾經瀏覽英文版網站，去查看新聞數量。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑，黎在早上所供稱的說法是錯誤的。黎回應：「我忽略了這個建立的階段。」控方質疑，或者證供是不真實的？黎重申：「我忘記了這個建立的時期。」控方再度追問這個建立時段有多長；黎稱不知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，這是一個持續建立的過程，所以黎持續參與在建立的過程之中？黎同意。控方指從訊息紀錄可見，直至2020年8月，黎仍有挑選文章、叫同事納入英文版。黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李素蘭問，直至2020年8月，即英文版面世三個月之後，黎仍然持續關注英文版？黎同意，但同時稱他隨著時間而淡出。控方指，因為當時同事已經知道黎的想法，並且知道應在英文版發布什麼文章。黎則回應，其他同事亦有在群組中傳送文章，但是當英文版運作逐漸成熟之後，他愈來愈少傳送文章，其後更沒有傳送。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下周二（2月18日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，今（11日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第132日審訊，黎智英第40日作供，控方就《蘋果》運作盤問黎。《蘋果》在2020年5月發起「一人一信救香港」，黎安排員工替袁弓夷拍攝影片，向特朗普作公開呼籲。控方展示訊息，顯示袁弓夷的女兒袁彌明曾傳送講稿給黎當中提及制裁中共，而黎讚寫得好。控方質疑，黎同意袁弓夷的公開信內容，並提供《蘋果》作為發布平台。黎則否認。此外，黎曾叫管理層推動英文版時，只需集中「黃營觀點」；黎在庭上同意只需要不平衡的觀點（imbalanced view），但是否認這是偏頗的觀點（biased view），重申是想要反映香港情況的觀點。在控方盤問期間，黎稱自己作為一個政治犯，沒有理由為求脫罪而在庭上說謊，法官杜麗冰隨即打斷，嚴正地向黎說：「你不是一個政治犯，你在這裡是面對刑事控罪。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行繼續盤問，圍繞黎與《蘋果》高層之間的溝通。控方向黎展示訊息紀錄，黎於2019年4月27日分別向時任《蘋果》社長張劍虹及副社長陳沛敏稱：「請想想有什麼我們還可做催谷市民明天上街？現在情況實在太靜，好驚。謝謝。」控方問，黎傳送訊息目的是想催谷更多人上街遊行？黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著指2019年6月3日，即6月9日「反送中」大遊行前數天，黎向陳沛敏傳送訊息：「沛敏，我們應該找些聯署學生訪問，激發其他學生6.9出來。謝謝。」陳回覆：「有的，會再找，謝謝。」黎續指：「主要是訪問他們不是針對『師兄』『師姐』而是激發其他學生出來。謝謝。」陳回覆：「收到。」控方指，黎再次叫陳催谷更多人上街，而這一次是鼓勵年輕人出來。黎亦同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰提到，他記得當時有一群中學生呼籲罷課，問黎是否有印象。黎則稱他們不是聯署的學生，聯署的是大學生，而罷課則是黃之鋒。法官杜麗冰表示，她記得當時從報章中讀到林鄭母校嘉諾撒聖方濟各書院有學生進行聯署。黎則堅稱參與聯署的是大學生。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎籲陳沛敏考慮以不撤不散作為頭版標題-惟否認屬編採指示&quot;&gt;黎籲陳沛敏考慮以「不撤不散」作為頭版標題 惟否認屬編採指示&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎於2019年6月15日向陳傳送訊息：「我們只好行動日漸加劇，迎接詭計來臨！」、「不撤不散！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在庭上否認向陳提議頭版報導標題，但同意使用《蘋果日報》來催谷更多人上街。法官杜麗冰指黎的訊息籲陳考慮以「不撤不散」作為標題，質疑屬編採指示。黎否認，強調只是叫陳予以「考慮」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎同意使用蘋果日報協助袁弓夷製作影片籲特朗普救香港&quot;&gt;黎同意使用《蘋果日報》協助袁弓夷製作影片籲特朗普救香港&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續提到，《蘋果》在2020年5月發起「一人一信救香港」，籲時任美國總統特朗普幫助香港阻止國安法通過，現被國安處通緝的袁弓夷曾拍片響應，而黎當時提供平台發布影片。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方遂展示訊息，2020年5月28日黎向袁說，可以安排《蘋果》同事替袁拍攝影片，並指時任動新聞平台總監張志偉稍後會聯絡袁。至5月31日，黎向袁弓夷說：「剛從 Erica（袁彌明）收到它，真的很棒！」、「請繼續發聲！」至6月3日，袁弓夷向黎說：「感謝你提供平台去開展我摧毀中共的目標。我會在星期日到華盛頓，向白宮請求援助香港。（Jimmy, thank you for providing me the platform to start my mission to destroy CCP. I will go to Washington Sunday to plead for help for HK from the White House.）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎是否同意袁弓夷的發言內容？黎供稱，當時僅提供一個平台去播出袁弓夷的發言，堅稱並不知道影片內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，黎是否使用《蘋果日報》來協助袁製作公開信影片，包括提供拍攝場地及製作人員？黎同意，但強調袁只是一個人讀出公開信，拍攝過程不需很多人手，他自己也沒有參與。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰質疑，黎不僅僅提供平台播放袁的影片，事後黎向張志偉提議再一次替袁製作影片，而張隨即回覆「收到」及表示會安排，顯示黎所作的超出了僅僅提供平台。黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎堅稱拍攝之前不知道袁弓夷將會說什麼&quot;&gt;黎堅稱拍攝之前不知道袁弓夷將會說什麼&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在盤問下，黎堅稱拍攝之前不知道袁將會作出什麼發言內容，也沒有問袁。控方質疑，即使不知道袁會說什麼，黎也會允許《蘋果》替袁拍片？黎說是。控方亦質疑，當時《蘋果》正發動「一人一信救香港」，不擔心袁的說話會與行動理念相違背嗎？黎則表示對此並不擔心，又指他們通常不會在發布之前審查言論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過法官杜麗冰問，如果袁在拍片時說：「特朗普遠離香港和中國，不要管我們的事！」呢？黎則回應，知道袁的為人，「我知道這不會發生。」杜官和控方分別追問，所以黎是知道袁將會說什麼嗎？黎稱只知道大概，並且知道他支持運動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提議，黎其實在拍攝之前知道袁將會說什麼。黎不同意。控方亦提議，黎也觀看過袁的影片。黎稱可能有觀看過。控方則反駁，在影片發布之前，黎是知道影片內容。黎否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官質疑黎早前供稱袁信件含不實指控-為何會讚寫得好&quot;&gt;官質疑黎早前供稱袁信件含不實指控 為何會讚寫得好&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方遂展示黎與袁弓夷女兒袁彌明之間的對話。2020年5月29日，袁彌明告訴黎：「早安，Jimmy。我父親正在前往你的總部，他給特朗普的信很出色和感動。（Morning Jimmy. My dad is heading to your headquarter now. His letter to Trump is exceptional and emotional.）」袁彌明並傳送袁弓夷的信件全文給黎，當中提到：「你應該制裁這些中共個體，不讓他們得到任何更多美國資本。（You should sanction these Communist entities from getting any more US capital.）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指黎其後回覆：「Erica，感謝你。這是一封很好的信。希望特朗普總統會看到它及作出回應。（Erica, Thanks. This is a very good letter. Hope President Trump will see it and react.）」控方問黎是否同意信件內容？黎則稱，他說信件寫得好不代表他同意當中內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰提及，黎早前主問時指袁在影片中作出不實指控，包括指稱有示威者被謀殺及有警察強姦女子，那黎為什麼會向袁彌明說其父親的信寫得好？黎則稱當時未有留意相關內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著問，黎早前供稱不同意袁指控警察強姦女子及有示威者被謀殺，然而黎直至在庭上才首次供出這個說法，訊息紀錄從不見黎說該些指控不實。黎同意，但是強調後來與袁弓夷數次交流之後，便開始感到不安，並嘗試疏遠他。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎認為袁做過什麼行為而使他感到不安？黎多次表示不記得，又強調是感覺積累而來。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;袁彌明稱父親準備在下一段影片談及制裁-黎允張志偉協助製作&quot;&gt;袁彌明稱父親準備在下一段影片談及制裁 黎允張志偉協助製作&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示訊息，2020年5月31日袁彌明告訴黎，袁弓夷正準備拍攝另一段影片，要求蓬佩奧讓年輕示威者在美國最好的學校接受教育，並提供經濟援助，又會談及幾種「較聰明的方法」制裁，以對中共造成影響，但同時對香港人帶來較低附帶傷害。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;袁彌明問黎：「我們可以叫張志偉協助嗎？上一次的後期製作非常棒，正正是我們想要的。」黎回覆稱會告訴張，籲袁彌明聯絡張。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;袁彌明其後指上一段影片「有60萬人view，多謝你們大力推。」、「最緊要幫到件事。」黎之後告訴袁，已經替袁約好拍攝時間。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎，袁彌明所提及的「較聰明的方法」是指哪些制裁？黎則稱不知道，袁彌明未有詳細說。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎同意提供蘋果的網站facebook和twitter發布袁弓夷影片&quot;&gt;黎同意提供《蘋果》的網站、Facebook和Twitter發布袁弓夷影片&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示黎與張志偉之間的訊息，張在5月31日向黎傳送《蘋果》Facebook 截圖，顯示帖文〈【港版國安法】袁彌明父親打Twitter戰線 公開拍片望特朗普拯救香港青年〉，並以箭咀指出「讚好」次數。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同日，黎將袁彌明的訊息轉發給張，告知張他們準備拍攝下一段影片。張回覆：「收到！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至6月3日，張向黎傳送《蘋果》Facebook 截圖，顯示帖文〈【六四31】袁彌明父Twitter續發炮 促美國務卿懲中共罪犯解放香港〉。張另傳送一張《蘋果》Twitter 截圖，顯示轉載了袁弓夷的影片。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎不但提供《蘋果》網站，還提供了《蘋果》的 Facebook 和 Twitter 來發布袁的影片。黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問到黎當時知道標題上「解放香港」的意思嗎？在追問下，黎同意知道，但稱當時「瞥一眼」時未有留意到。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭問黎不會關注《蘋果》發布的內容嗎？黎稱：「我不會關注那些內容，張志偉會負責。」控方追問，當時《蘋果》發起「一人一信救香港」，黎不會關注相關內容嗎？黎重申他不關注，所以未有想過，並堅稱只是對相關內容「瞥一眼」，因為不感興趣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指出，黎的確閱讀過及知道袁的信件，亦同意當中內容，因此黎才會同意在《蘋果》上發布，而這與「一人一信救香港」行動一致。黎一概否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎同意帶領蘋果-但否認作出指示&quot;&gt;黎同意帶領《蘋果》 但否認作出指示&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎是壹傳媒集團的大股東，持有大約71%的股份，而三間被告公司「蘋果日報有限公司」、「蘋果日報印刷有限公司」及「蘋果互聯網有限公司」屬於壹傳媒集團旗下，因此黎控制著三間公司。控方又指，黎在2018年至2020年12月期間，是壹傳媒集團的主席，向集團提供數以萬計的資金援助。黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎是否同意自己是公司中「作出指示的人士（directing mind）」和「掌控者（controlling mind）」。黎表示：「我沒有指示他們的思想。」他又稱自己是制訂藍圖的人，但是並非作出指示的人士。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎是否帶領《蘋果》？黎同意。控方繼而問黎是否《蘋果》的掌舵手？黎不同意，僅稱自己是主席。他承認在發起「一人一信救香港」一事上，當員工意見與他不一致時，他的意見佔上風，但那只是一次例外，不代表旗下員工要時刻跟從他意見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認設下鳥籠-稱員工共同抱持價值&quot;&gt;黎否認設下「鳥籠」 稱員工共同抱持價值&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎曾經叫《蘋果》其他管理層報導「黃營」的觀點，問黎是否同意每當《蘋果》作新聞報導的時候，高層之間均存在共識。黎則稱他與管理層並沒有共識，形容「所有事都是自動發生的」，因《蘋果》與香港人擁抱一致的價值。法官李素蘭則指：「黎先生，香港人不一定與《蘋果》抱持一致的價值」，籲黎只需要直接回答問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方引述黎在台灣節目「鄉民來衝康」的受訪言論「這麼多年來我們是反共的」，指《蘋果》一直以來都是「反共」及反對派報紙，而這是「從犯證人」楊清奇所形容的「鳥籠」。黎回應：「鳥籠是我們在《蘋果》共同抱持的價值。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方向黎提議，這是黎所設下的「鳥籠」。黎否認有設下鳥籠，又指《蘋果》的價值不只是他自己的價值，也是員工共同抱持的價值。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又提議，黎的確有叫管理層使用《蘋果》作為平台來反對政府，包括要求管理層多報導反修例運動及催谷市民上街遊行。黎稱不是「反對政府」，而是反對《引渡條例》修訂。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，黎指示管理層使用《蘋果》作為平台來爭取國際社會及西方的支持，希望外國會針對中央和特區政府實施制裁。黎否認，並強調只是引起國際關注香港當時狀況，而非對抗中央和特區政府。控方指黎在「飯盒會」上向高層給予編採指示。黎否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎向高層稱只集中黃營觀點-同意不平衡觀點但否認屬偏頗&quot;&gt;黎向高層稱只集中「黃營」觀點 同意不平衡觀點但否認屬偏頗&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著就《蘋果》英文版提問，指美國國務院前資深顧問 Christian Whiton 以電郵提議《蘋果》應創辦英文版報紙。2020年5月10日，作家馮睎乾專欄文章〈不撐蘋果的100萬人〉提到《蘋果》增值的方法包括「八卦式公義」和「國際文宣線」。控方問黎，是否同意英文版的工作與國際文宣相似？黎僅稱，只是引起國際社會關注香港情況。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎於5月10日創立 WhatsApp 群組「English news」，群組成員有張劍虹、陳沛敏、羅偉光、張志偉等人。黎在群組中說：「今日馮睎乾提議出英譯新聞電子版諗得過，反正現在翻譯網站翻譯成本低而快。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同日，黎訊息稱：「我們揀選寫手時，我們不需要向外國人提供平衡觀點，我們只需要集中在《蘋果》的香港觀點和黃營的一般觀點。」（“When we choose writers we don’t have to think about giving foreigners a balanced view of what happens here of every different colors, we only concentrate in our Apple Daily HK view, a general view of the yellow side.”）黎又指：「我們不是要嘗試平衡報導，而是要報導保護香港一方的觀點。這是世界需要知道的聲音。」（“We are not trying to strike a balance but the point of view of the people on the side of protecting HK. This is the voice the world wants to know.”）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎只要員工報導中國的負面新聞，不需要正面的報導？黎同意。此外，黎同意只需要不平衡的觀點（imbalanced view），但是否認這是偏頗的觀點（biased view），重申是想要反映香港情況的觀點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在法官杜麗冰追問下，黎指不平衡的觀點不代表是偏頗。黎指當時香港被中國的政策淹沒（overwhelmed），這對香港而言不是好事，而「黃營」是要反抗中國對自由的侵蝕，這就是他們的觀點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎是否想根據他的個人角度來展示香港面貌。黎表示，是從報導的角度出發，不只在情緒層面打動讀者，更想引起他們心中共鳴。黎又指，所有報紙都是作不平衡報導，例如《星島日報》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎自稱政治犯沒有理由在庭上說謊-官打斷稱你不是一個政治犯&quot;&gt;黎自稱政治犯沒有理由在庭上說謊 官打斷稱：「你不是一個政治犯」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎早前供稱，從沒有叫同事替專欄「成敗樂一笑」的文章翻譯成英文，他亦不知道同事曾翻譯；但是5月11日的訊息紀錄顯示，張劍虹向群組傳送訊息，其中第一點提及會翻譯「成敗樂一笑」文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎則稱當時未有留意，並看漏了第一點。在控方追問下，黎反問：「我為何要說謊？」，指在法庭說謊是罪行，作為一個政治犯，他沒有理由為求脫罪而在庭上說謊，使自己被定罪，又反問控方是否認為他會如此做，顯示自己不單是一名政治犯，而且還是一個傻子（mentally retarded）？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰隨即打斷，嚴正地向黎說：「你不是一個政治犯，你在這裡是面對刑事控罪。」黎則稱：「你可以這樣提議，但是你不能以此加諸於我身上。」杜官稱只是想提醒黎他並非政治犯，黎稱：「但是我與你的想法不同。」杜官說黎可以有不同的想法，然而事實是：「你不是一名政治犯」。黎回應：「這是據你所說。（According to you.）」杜官再度打斷，並嚴正表示：「黎先生！⋯⋯你想將政治帶進這個法庭，我不會容許你這樣做。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎當時政治環境對蘋果不友善-英文版能成為龐大的支持&quot;&gt;黎：當時政治環境對《蘋果》不友善 英文版能成為龐大的支持&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎在2020年5月10日向 Mark Simon 傳送訊息，談及《蘋果》英文版可以有一個機會讓美國人或外國人支持香港，而這將會是龐大的經濟上及政治上的支持，形容是「一件現在就要做的事，尤其是作為政治保護」，籲 Mark Simon 安排對外宣傳工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問訊息中的「龐大的經濟上及政治上的支持」是否包括對中國制裁和敵對行動？黎指不是。控方又問「政治保護」即是什麼保護？黎稱保護《蘋果》免受任何政府的干預。控方追問黎想要哪一種「政治保護」？黎稱未有詳細想過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭問《蘋果》為何需要保護？黎稱：「當時的政治環境對《蘋果》不友善」，因《蘋果》是反對派報紙。控方質疑這是黎的揣測；黎則稱這是他對當時形勢的解讀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎曾叫mark-simon找彭斯蓬佩奧訂閱-最終未成事&quot;&gt;黎曾叫Mark Simon找彭斯、蓬佩奧訂閱 最終未成事&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指同日，黎叫 Mark Simon 嘗試令時任美國副總統彭斯及時任國務卿蓬佩奧訂閱《蘋果》英文版。至5月12日，Mark Simon 告訴黎，他已聯絡蓬佩奧助手 Mary Kissel，會研究怎樣使蓬佩奧或美國國務院訂閱，他亦聯絡了時任共和黨參議員盧比奧（Marco Rubio）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎只叫 Mark Simon 如此做，而不是叫《蘋果》管理層，是因為黎知道 Mark Simon 與美國政府有緊密聯繫。黎則表示，因為他知道 Mark Simon 找到方法去做，但是後來因為美國官員相關規定而未有成事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

There is an urgent need to strengthen user literacy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generative AI tools based on Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming embedded in many aspects of daily life, from assisting professionals with legal research to helping shoppers with their weekly groceries and enabling learning about Socrates through chatbots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent events have highlighted emerging risks to security and democratic stability. The use of ChatGPT to assist in planning an attack on President Donald Trump’s Las Vegas hotel demonstrates the grey areas in which AI can be exploited to catalyse real-world harm. Similarly, concerns over DeepSeek, a Chinese AI system that self-censors in real time and stores user data beyond democratic oversight, underscore wider implications for national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hallmark of this technology is its low user cost and its ability to rapidly converse fluently and confidently like a human. For instance, it can persuasively argue that AI poses no threat to humanity. As well as answering questions, these systems can interrogate documents, write code, generate video, and carry out basic online tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allowing the technology’s creative applications to develop freely and making it widely available has been key to attracting staggering levels of investment in the sector. Today, AI-powered tools have hundreds of millions of weekly users. However, this widespread adoption is also where the risks lie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside cyber security vulnerabilities intrinsic to LLM technology, concerns have been raised about its potential to flood democracies with disinformation and propaganda, as well as providing a sophisticated aid to extremist recruitment. From the standpoint of communications practice, the risks are more complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When data is stored in foreign jurisdictions, this raises the possibility of hostile actors extracting valuable population insights from users’ interactions with AI, as individuals often unwittingly reveal their attitudes and behaviours in relation to their preferences. In this sense, AI users everywhere are unknowingly training an unsleeping, ever-evolving algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-double-edged-nature-of-generative-ai&quot;&gt;The Double-Edged Nature of Generative AI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While much attention is being paid to the technological and economic race, the long-term societal impact of AI’s persuasive power remains largely overlooked. Recent research studies demonstrate that generative AI excels at moral reasoning, narrative creativity and psychological profiling and even anticipates emotional states – all achieved automatically. The potential impact of these superhuman qualities is not widely understood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AI-driven chatbots and their API-integrated systems can seamlessly analyse audiences, generate targeted content, and distribute it efficiently&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;National security concerns have focused on scenarios like AI exposing sensitive chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear information or spiralling out of control. Europol has warned that LLMs could scale up and accelerate cyber attacks. However, the erosion of trust and the potential for large-scale behavioural manipulation may be equally disruptive. Leaked documents revealed that AI researchers highlighted how their technology could lower the cost of disinformation campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strength of AI lies in its adaptability to user demands and its capacity to adopt their preferred personae. Generative AI companies make their application programming interfaces (APIs) widely available so that AI can be incorporated into all sorts of software, search engines and social media services, allowing these systems to be fine-tuned for specific purposes. With few restrictions and trained on historical data going back thousands of years, AI can synthesise – or distort – a startling array of ideas, facts and narratives at an unprecedented speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI is constantly improving. Almost a decade ago, DeepMind’s AlphaGo shocked the world by defeating human champions and demonstrating inexplicable strategic creativity. Today’s generative AI matches or outperforms humans in many creative disciplines. Its ability to recreate reality, without the biases of conscience or ego, presents both a remarkable capability and a potential threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When disinformation watchdog Newsguard presented ChatGPT with narratives already proven to be false, the AI doubled down and eloquently defended 80% of debunked claims. Though there were examples of effective moderation, researchers indicate that the results were similar to those advanced by the worst conspiracy influencers or Chinese and Russian government bots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-rise-of-mass-personalised-influence&quot;&gt;The Rise of Mass, Personalised Influence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most profound changes brought by generative AI is its ability to anticipate user intentions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Cambridge University have found that, with just a small number of chatbot interactions, AI can accurately predict a user’s future intentions. This shift from an “attention economy”, in which algorithms sought to capture users’ engagement, to what they call an “intention economy”, where AI can anticipate and exploit desires and decisions before they are even consciously formed, represents a fundamental transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does this mean for disinformation? A series of experimental studies demonstrated the potential of LLMs to automate, and therefore scale up, personalised persuasion. Personalised messages generated by ChatGPT in the areas of marketing, political ideology, and personality traits proved more influential that non-personalised messages. AI-generated content has been found to be particularly persuasive, as it can read and respond to individual psychological traits. The application of the technology, in which consumers and citizens will have their decisions second-guessed and nudged, has the alarming potential to increase distrust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generative AI is far from perfect, but the risk of automated, mass manipulation is real. AI-driven chatbots and their API-integrated systems can seamlessly analyse audiences, generate targeted content, and distribute it efficiently – collapsing a series of tasks previously shared out between communications firms and marketing professionals. With the right expertise and application to social media, for instance, these capabilities could be exploited for radicalisation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI developers are building in safeguards so that obviously harmful prompts go unanswered. However, one recent study demonstrated that chatbots remain vulnerable to manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a technique known as “jailbreaking”, researchers were able to bypass moderation controls in half of the cases tested, allowing chatbots to help the researchers play out scenarios mirroring likely violent extremist activities, including creating divisive content or misinformation, and even providing guidance on recruitment and attack strategies. Even a chatbot’s moderation control preventing it from analysing individual social media feeds can be overcome with a little persistence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Militant groups, such as Islamic State, have reportedly explored AI’s potential for their own purposes. However, the true disruptive power of AI may not come from state actors or extremist groups, but rather from the sheer volume of artificially generated narratives, amplifying confusion and further eroding trust in reliable sources of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The popularity of companion chatbots illustrates another dimension of AI’s persuasive power: its apparent ability to empathise with human users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a study comparing human emotional awareness to that of ChatGPT, the AI system outperformed human participants. Because generative AI can adapt to an individual’s emotional and psychological state, researchers found a “dangerous potential to further enmesh people in their own idiosyncratic worlds”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has implications for recruitment into violence. Following an inquiry into the Stockport attack, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer recently warned that “loners and misfits” face growing risks of radicalisation through an array of content encountered online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While today’s AI does not yet possess general reasoning capabilities, the pace of its evolution indicates that societies must adapt now&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, LLMs outperform humans in instances of moral reasoning. AI-generated messages can appear virtuous and trustworthy, provided users are unaware that the source is artificial. Consequently, in a democracy, those with malign intent are vulnerable to exposure if their use of such technology can be demonstrated, though this will be difficult in practice. Certainly, there was ideological pushback among supporters of an Islamic State affiliate when a sympathetic media channel adopted AI-generated newsreaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why the marketing and communications industry is not simply promoting itself in talking down generative AI; in many cases, technology needs a human face to be believed. Many AI companies are looking to strengthen user empowerment and autonomy through technical design. But responses need to go further to maintain human control of the technology, requiring a focus on educating the user so they can harness the benefits while avoiding the pitfalls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strengthening-democratic-resilience&quot;&gt;Strengthening Democratic Resilience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lessons from the rise and misuse of social media suggest that societies must act swiftly. While today’s AI does not yet possess general reasoning capabilities, the pace of its evolution indicates that societies must adapt now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussions often focus on existential threats posed by AI, but the more immediate, practical challenges of generative AI are frequently overlooked. The safeguards and guardrails being designed into LLMs are decisive, but they are little understood and barely discussed outside a limited circle of experts. Without more democratic discussion, generative AI’s emerging role in shaping public discourse will remain opaque. Few people understand how these systems operate, and this must change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best aspects of social media lie in its ability to redistribute democratic power. Generative AI is more complex and necessitates sustained discussion and attention to defend democracies. Some governments have started to do this. In an era of disruption, societies and individuals equipped with knowledge and resources will be better positioned to navigate the coming waves of informational and economic transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply exposing disinformation or identifying dangerous influencers will not be enough. To maintain democratic control, users must be empowered as citizens. AI literacy must extend beyond technical proficiency to equipping individuals, as part of society, to navigate the complexities of AI-generated influence and uphold democratic values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back, regulating social media could have been handled far better. Failing to address AI’s influence today could be a far graver mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;黎智英受訪稱「倘修例傳媒冇得做」 控方質疑修例與新聞自由沒有關係&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/DrLsxnm.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，今（10日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第131日審訊，黎智英第39日作供，控方就《蘋果日報》盤問黎。訊息紀錄顯示7.1佔領立法會事件之後，黎籲時任《蘋果》副社長陳沛敏：「盡量大做特做令年輕人獲得同情，令指責他們的市民反省。」黎早前供稱只是「提議」而非編採指示，今則改稱屬於編採指示。另外，2019年4月黎在「反送中」遊行期間受訪稱，若果《引渡條例》修訂通過的話「傳媒冇得做」，控方質疑修例與傳媒生意和新聞自由無關。黎則重申，如果傳媒報導中國內地新聞會被視為「揭露國家機密」；又如果傳媒批評政府會被視為「顛覆國家安全」，這便會與傳媒非常有關係。控方指出，黎意圖藉言論引起市民憎恨政府。黎則回應：「一派胡言。（Totally rubbish.）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指黎曾轉發ipac帖文-質疑黎聲稱不知道是為了撇清關係&quot;&gt;控方指黎曾轉發IPAC帖文 質疑黎聲稱不知道是為了撇清關係&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行繼續盤問，圍繞黎對「對華政策跨國議會聯盟」（Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China，簡稱 IPAC）的理解。控方展示2020年7月22日的 Twitter 帖文，顯示黎轉發 IPAC 的帖文，而 IPAC 帖文提及英國政府宣布暫緩與香港之間的引渡協議，IPAC 成員兼英國議員 Alyn Smith 在英國下議院發言時表示歡迎。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎則稱，帖文是由「徒弟」李兆富（Simon Lee）發布。控方則提議，黎當時知悉 IPAC 支持英政府暫緩與香港之間的引渡協議，而且非常在意 IPAC 的成立，也非常在意 IPAC 的成立目標，即是一致應對中國崛起的挑戰。黎一概否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，黎透過將 IPAC 報導放在《蘋果》顯眼版面，以及不同的 Twitter 帖文，以顯示支持 IPAC。黎亦否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎知悉「重光團隊」（Fight for Freedom, Stand with Hong Kong，簡稱 SWHK）與 IPAC 有關。黎否認。控方指，黎聲稱不知道 IPAC，是因為想嘗試與 IPAC 撇清關係。黎則稱，他與 IPAC 從沒接近過，並堅稱從沒留意 IPAC。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在法官李運騰提問下，黎確認當時李兆富已經不在香港，因此更加「安全」。控方問，黎的意思是否指，因為李不在香港，所以他可以發布任何他想發布的內容，即使有關內容觸犯《國安法》？黎則表示：「我沒有這樣說，是你說的。」但黎同意正如他早前所供稱，他會為所有 Twitter 帖文負責。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方警方檢取黎手機時-其-twitter-帳戶呈登入狀態-代表黎經常查看&quot;&gt;控方：警方檢取黎手機時 其 Twitter 帳戶呈登入狀態 代表黎「經常查看」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，沒有爭議的是，黎的 Twitter 追蹤 IPAC、聯盟創辦人裴倫德（Luke de Pulford）及 SWHK 的帳號。控方指出，在《國安法》生效之後，黎渴望知道外國組織會怎樣回應《國安法》；黎則稱：「我沒有思考過。」控方又指，黎有興趣知道外國政治人物會怎樣作出回應；黎則稱：「我沒有這樣的渴望」，又稱沒有思考過這方面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑，當時黎竭力去阻止《國安法》通過，即使《國安法》生效之後，黎繼續竭力去減弱《國安法》的效力，因此黎有興趣知道外國政治人物怎樣作出回應，理應是合乎邏輯的事。黎重申沒有思考過這方面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑，黎從沒閱讀任何他所追蹤的帳號的帖文？黎則稱其 Twitter 帳戶由李兆富管理，他不知道，也沒有興趣知道。控方指，黎被拘捕的時候，當警方檢取他的手機時，其 Twitter 帳戶呈登入狀態，代表黎「經常查看 Twitter」。黎否認，並稱不常使用 Twitter，忘記了是否每日都使用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方向黎提議，他對於外國政治人物如何回應《國安法》是非常感興趣。黎回應稱：「我沒有想過。」控方續指，黎持續追蹤外國政治人物發布的 Twitter 帖文。黎再度稱：「我沒有想過。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎堅稱不知道-hashtag-是什麼&quot;&gt;黎堅稱不知道 hashtag 是什麼&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另問及 hashtag，黎早前供稱他從不知 hashtag 是什麼，帖文上的 hashtag 乃由李兆富添加。黎稱一般而言不會留意帖文上的 hashtag。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方遂展示一系列黎的 Twitter 帖文，並指「#FightForFreedom」、「#StandWithHongKong」反覆出現了數次，問黎當時是否留意到？黎稱沒有。黎其後稱，當時留意到帖文上有一些「藍色字形（blue figures）」，但是他並未有注意或閱讀它們。在法官追問下，黎稱理解那些「藍色字」只是名字，而他一向對名字不感興趣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎一直以來都知道李兆富將那些名字加在帖文中，並且非常清楚該些名字代表什麼。黎不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方黎知悉香港避風港法案和香港人自由和選擇法&quot;&gt;控方：黎知悉《香港避風港法案》和《香港人自由和選擇法》&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示黎於2020年7月17日的推文：「#HongKong #SafeHarborAct and #PeoplesFreedomandChoiceAct are good wherewithals to our resistance movement. Salute all former CGs and State Dept staff for caring about this place we call home.」（《香港避風港法案》和《香港人自由和選擇法》是我們反抗運動很好的本錢。向所有前總領事和美國國務院職員致敬，因他們在乎這個我們稱之為家的地方。）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又展示同日黎與李兆富之間的 WhatsApp 對話，在推文發布之前，黎向李傳送《蘋果》英文版報導〈Former US top envoys call for Washington to grant Hongkongers political asylum〉，並提議字句：「This move is good wherewithal to our resistance movement. Thank you former counsel generals!（這舉動是我們反抗運動很好的本錢。感謝前總領事們！）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎早前主問時供稱不知道《香港避風港法案》（Hong Kong Safe Harbor Act）和《香港人自由和選擇法》（Hong Kong People’s Freedom and Choice Act）。控方今指，黎傳送給李的英文報導內文提及上述兩項法案，加上黎向李提議帖文字句。控方遂向黎提議，他當時其實知道法案，以及知悉法案內容。黎一概不同意，堅稱沒有仔細閱讀報導內文，也沒有留意兩項法案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認與攬炒巴劉祖廸和李宇軒等人協議請求外國實施制裁&quot;&gt;黎否認與「攬炒巴」劉祖廸和李宇軒等人協議請求外國實施制裁&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指出案情，黎在案發期間與 Mark Simon、陳梓華、「攬炒巴」劉祖廸和李宇軒達成協議請求外國實施制裁。直至《國安法》生效之後，該協議仍然持續，直至陳梓華在2021年2月15日被拘捕。黎否認，並稱據他所知，他與陳梓華之間並沒有協議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，SWHK 參與國際游說工作，包括請求外國針對中港實施制裁和敵對行動，為了促進上述協議。黎聲稱從不知協議存在，因此不同意。控方指，黎知道劉祖廸和李宇軒是 SWHK 的成員，也知道 SWHK 在2020年6月加入 IPAC 的中央秘書處。黎否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，IPAC 自2020年6月成立起，持續參與游說針對中國實施制裁和敵對行動，而黎曾表達過支持陳梓華加入 IPAC。黎否認，又指陳編造證供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，黎與陳梓華在2020年6月16日親身見面，在《國安法》生效之後，黎未有要陳不要再聯絡 Mark Simon，並停止國際游說。黎則反問：「我不知道他（陳）參與國際游說，我怎樣叫他停止？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳方安生晤美國副總統-黎吩咐張劍虹做到最大效果-同意屬編採指示&quot;&gt;陳方安生晤美國副總統 黎吩咐張劍虹「做到最大效果」 同意屬編採指示&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著就《蘋果日報》提問。黎早前供稱，除了指示員工「做大」前政務司司長陳方安生會見時任美國副總統彭斯的新聞，以及指示發動「一人一信救香港」之外，便沒有下達任何編採指示。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年3月特區政府推動《逃犯條例》修訂草案。同月23日，黎將前政務司司長陳方安生會見時任美國副總統彭斯的新聞，傳送給李永達、何俊仁、李卓人、時任《蘋果》社長張劍虹和時任《蘋果》副社長陳沛敏等人。黎並吩咐張劍虹：「大新聞，用它做到最大效果，謝謝。（Big news. Use it to maximum effect. Thanks, Jimmy）」張之後回覆「老闆，早安，收到。謝謝」。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 前《蘋果日報》社長 張劍虹&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在控方盤問下，黎同意傳送給張劍虹和陳沛敏的訊息屬於編採指示。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;71佔立會後-黎向陳沛敏稱盡量大做特做令年輕人獲得同情改稱屬編採指示&quot;&gt;7.1佔立會後 黎向陳沛敏稱「盡量大做特做令年輕人獲得同情」改稱屬編採指示&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年7月1日反修例示威者闖入立法會大樓。翌日，黎智英向前動新聞總監張志偉傳送訊息：「Nick，很好。年輕人衝（擊）立法會事（件）令我心情沈（沉）重，你們認為泛民善後工作有什麼該做令運動可以持續？好彩市民對年輕人闖立法院會是多少有些體諒，損害可能不太大。你們認為呢？謝謝。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎其後將上述訊息轉發給陳沛敏。陳回覆：「收到」，又表示已經發布了相關報導，「但無論如何明天再做。」黎回覆：「是，要再做。明天是否集中做年輕人的心聲，盡量為他們在這件事上爭取市民諒解和支持，得以平反？謝謝。」陳表示：「當然一定有些人不認同衝立會，但這些人也不會因此變成認同林鄭，我們明天會再做。謝謝。」黎接著稱：「盡量大做特做令年輕人獲得同情，令指責他們的市民反省」等。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 前《蘋果日報》執行總編輯 林文宗（左）、副社長 陳沛敏（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎訊息中的「平反」是指平反什麼？黎指那些示威者做了「可怕的事」，所以嘗試替他們平反。控方問，是否縱使出現暴力也好，黎也希望市民同情激進的示威者？黎則稱是想市民「理解」，因不想事件破壞當時的運動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎早前主問時供稱，上述訊息是向陳沛敏「提議」而非給予編採指示。控方今再度問黎，這是否屬於下達給陳的編採指示？黎表示同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎籲陳報導大陸做生意的香港商人面對的危險-否認屬編採指示&quot;&gt;黎籲陳報導「大陸做生意的香港商人面對的危險」 否認屬編採指示&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2019年3月30日的訊息，黎向陳稱：「沛敏，今日頭條做得很好，只是沒有說做大陸新聞分分鐘被視為揭露國家機密，和批評中國政府文章會被標籤顛覆國家安全等罪名。但很好了。請繼續做在大陸做生意的香港商人面對的危險，嚇壞那些生意佬讓建制派不敢造次。謝謝。」陳回覆：「收到。商界有票，所以政府才稍微讓步，如果他們反對，政府就沒戲唱了」，黎回覆：「對，對付這些怕死鬼可能是我們絕招。謝謝。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏早前供稱，理解上述訊息屬黎的指示。黎今否認：「我只是給予評語，不是編採指示。」控方又指，黎嘗試在香港市民間引起恐懼。惟黎否認，「我只是嘗試告知他們（修例的）危險性。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提及2019年3月27日，Mark Simon 向黎傳送訊息，引述郭明瀚指在「反送中」上扣連商界和法律界是很重要。控方指該訊息是在黎給予陳沛敏指示之前3天，質疑黎因為郭明瀚意見而指示陳沛敏報導商界面對的危險。黎則否認因為受到郭明瀚言論的影響而向陳沛敏給予指示。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎受訪稱倘修例傳媒冇得做-控方質疑修例與新聞自由沒有關係&quot;&gt;黎受訪稱「倘修例傳媒冇得做」 控方質疑修例與新聞自由沒有關係&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2019年4月1日的《蘋果》報導〈黎智英：倘修例傳媒冇得做〉，當中提及：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;壹傳媒集團創辦人黎智英昨日有參加民陣反修訂《逃犯條例》遊行，被問到上街原因時，黎說：「呢單嘢好緊要㗎大佬，呢單嘢過咗，我哋冇得做㗎！傳媒冇得做㗎！你話報道大陸新聞，佢（大陸政府）話你揭露國家機密；你批評佢，佢又話你顛覆國家安全，咁就冇㗎嘞，新聞自由依家少少都冇埋㗎喇」，呼籲香港人一定要盡量反對今次修例，「過咗死㗎呢單嘢，慘過23條啊！」&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑，修訂《引渡條例》與傳媒生意沒有任何關係。黎則重申，如果傳媒報導中國內地新聞會被視為「揭露國家機密」；又如果傳媒批評政府會被視為「顛覆國家安全」，這便會與傳媒非常有關係，又指修例後可能會被送往內地受審，並叫控方看看報導中浸大新聞系前助理教授杜耀明的說法。報導引述杜稱：「今次修例將嚴重打擊香港傳媒報道及評論新聞的自由，擔心不少新聞工作者都會不自覺地隨時跌入陷阱。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指，修訂《引渡條例》與新聞自由完全無關。黎回應，表面上看是沒有關係，但是如果再看深一層，所衍生的後果（ramification）是會影響新聞自由。控方質疑這只是黎的感覺（perception）和揣測（speculation）。黎否認。控方繼續追問，這與揭露國家機密沒有關係。黎重申會影響新聞自由。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方向黎提議，他針對中央政府作出沒有根據的指控，故意地蒙蔽事實及誤導公眾。黎否認。控方續指，黎意圖藉言論引起市民憎恨政府。黎則回應：「一派胡言。（Totally rubbish.）」控方追問，黎是同意還是不同意？黎回答不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方說：「黎先生，如果你能夠直接回答同意或不同意的話，可以節省到法庭時間。」黎則回應：「但是我需要說出同意或不同意的理由。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑黎藉文章談政府監控-與反修例無關-目的引起市民恐懼&quot;&gt;控方質疑黎藉文章談政府監控 與反修例無關 目的引起市民恐懼&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示「成敗樂一笑」專欄文章〈請站出來保住最後防線〉，內容提到：「『引渡惡法』的作用，就像恐怖分子襲擊產生『可用性級聯』的效果，讓香港市民都被籠罩在恐慌的順民意識下，讓大陸無法無天的法律凌駕香港的司法制度⋯⋯現在大陸對人民的嚴苛監控，也會在我們膽怯噤如寒蟬下慢慢在香港推行。將來我們的身份證規定要儲存在手機裏，好讓政府利用附帶的軟件偵察我們的行蹤和行為，和手機內的通訊和通話。我們到處都會被臉部識別系統監控，甚至會像現時大陸人一樣，使用 WhatsApp、Facebook 和 Google 等也會被監管。匪夷所思？是，看似匪夷所思，但是這正是中央要推行『引渡惡法』的最終目標。修訂《逃犯條例》就是要摧毀『一國兩制』這個習帝的眼中釘，將香港與大陸看齊變成一國一制。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文章提到：「修訂《逃犯條例》就是要摧毀『一國兩制』這個習帝的眼中釘⋯⋯是的，『引渡惡法』就是要讓中央的魔爪撕破《基本法》和一國兩制的最後防線，直搗香港社會核心價值的心臟。到時法治變成人治，權力變成了理據，貪贓枉法的大陸腐敗，將湧至成為香港正常的現象。人治就是純粹權力的統治，不僅巿民要在官字兩個口下委曲求全，在沒有法律保障下，所有巿場活動都會被權力支配，官員可以隨便扼殺任何一門生意，或放生任其自由發揮。做生意的人只好買官員的怕，尋求得到官員的保護而付出保護費，因此貪污違法將會成為香港無可避免的現象。」他於文末呼籲：「勇敢地站出來吧！請你們相信群眾的力量，加入今天反惡法的示威遊行吧！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指文章談及政府監控，然而修例與政府監控無關，質疑黎透過文章引起恐懼。黎否認，強調只是引述諾貝爾經濟學獎得主、心理學家 Daniel Kahneman 的說法，恐懼會導致人們做出不理性的行為，又指文章裡提及的嚴苛監控正在中國內地發生。控方質疑這只是黎的揣測。黎則回應這是他的合理推測，而且是基於諾貝爾經濟學獎得主的說法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提議，文章所述的是黎編造出來，目的只是引起恐懼。黎否認，稱：「我只是提醒讀者可能會發生什麼事。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，黎想文章在讀者間產生「心理反應」，使他們會反對《引渡條例》修訂，又指黎有意引起讀者對政府的憎恨。黎否認，「我心裡從來沒有憎恨。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎向李柱銘稱我們應處處點火引發市民留意逃犯條例嚴重性&quot;&gt;黎向李柱銘稱「我們應處處點火引發市民留意逃犯條例嚴重性」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指2019年5月29日，黎向李柱銘傳送訊息：「是否可以考慮包圍禮賓府，要求林鄭與市民或泛民對話。這不會廹（迫）得到她出來對話，但製造她縮龜不敢對話的大炮輿論。我們應處處點火引發市民留意逃犯條例嚴重性。有百多間學校師生抗議逃犯條例，社會關注很大。是否可動員各行各業都發表抗議聲明，例如醫學界，建築物界，運輸界，會計師界，甚至飲食界等。今晚談談。謝謝。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎是否想動員各行各業抗議引渡條例，因此向李柱銘傳送上述訊息的目的是集合泛民引起市民留意及反對引渡條例？黎同意。控方又指根據，黎將相同訊息傳送給何俊仁、李卓人和李永達。法官李運騰一度問，訊息中的「點火」，應該不是按字面去理解？黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎向陳提議修改區選海報使殘暴效果更大-否認屬編採指示&quot;&gt;黎向陳提議修改區選海報使「殘暴效果更大」 否認屬編採指示&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指2019年11月16日，黎向陳沛敏傳送訊息：「沛敏，是否可以海報做長形些，看到警察身體較多，因而殘暴效果更大，請再給我看。謝謝。」陳傳送數張圖片給黎，標題均為「請投票止警暴」。黎評論：「對，感覺不是很暴力。」、「應該可以，我給他們看看再回覆你。同時請同事做一張他們認為暴力夠震撼的來看看。謝謝。」控方另展示黎與李卓人之間的對話，黎向李說：「好，我明天看了印製出來的真本再給你們意見後決定。謝謝。晚安！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎供稱不知道訊息中的海報是什麼、屬於誰人，當時陳徵詢他的意見，所以他作出評論，強調不是編採指示。法官李運騰問海報是否與新聞報導有關？黎稱不知道。控方問黎，以上訊息是否與區議會選舉有關？黎起初稱不知道，後來同意可能有關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方向黎指出，黎的訊息是向陳下達編採指示。黎否認，並指編採指示是關於「做什麼」，然而訊息是關於「怎樣提高質素」，因此不屬於編採指示。黎又提到自己曾經做過時裝生意。法官李素蘭問，與時裝生意有什麼關係？黎稱因為時裝牽涉審美，所以陳徵詢他的意見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰則反駁，黎的訊息並非關於「提高質素」，而是提升「殘暴效果」。黎堅稱這是為了想要的目標，屬於提高質素，使陳的圖片有更佳效果。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The programme included high-level speakers from more than 20 countries and covered topics including international law and norms, responsible use and development of tools and technologies – including AI – and the responsibility of states in conducting and responding to cyber operations and incidents. The event was part of RUSI’s ongoing Global Partnership for Responsible Cyber Behaviour (GP-RCB) work. This initiative is dedicated to mapping practical understandings of responsible cyber behaviour (RCB) by conducting evidence-based research and connecting experts from different sectors and regions to reflect the diversity of views on the topic. Except for keynote speakers and the final discussion, we have not attributed panel speakers’ remarks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction-a-global-perspective-on-rcb&quot;&gt;Introduction: A Global Perspective on RCB&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an increasingly volatile and interconnected global landscape, malicious activities within cyberspace present an ever-growing threat to international stability and security. From cybercrime and the misuse of emerging technologies to the proliferation of commercial hacking tools and state-sanctioned cyber operations, the challenge is multifaceted. Over the past two decades, governments worldwide have engaged in multilateral negotiations to develop norms that guide RCB. While progress has been made – as reflected in the 11 non-binding norms on responsible state behaviour in cyberspace reaffirmed by UN members in 2021 – difficulties remain in achieving international consensus on how responsibility is understood and operationalised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an environment where influence and control lie beyond the sole purview of government authorities, a comprehensive, whole-of-society approach to RCB is necessary. This entails fostering cross-regional dialogue and multistakeholder collaboration to advance diverse, transparent and inclusive understandings of responsibility. This includes the need to widen global conversations on RCB to stakeholders beyond the state, in ways that reflect the many nuances of how and where responsibility is enacted. Key dimensions of this relate to how responsibility is understood internationally, domestically and operationally across different cultural, political and geographical contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To promote debate and help foster a collective understanding of responsibility in cyberspace, the GP-RCB is focused on mapping practical understandings of RCB by conducting and delivering evidence-based research. It does this by connecting experts from different sectors and regions to reflect upon the diversity of views on the topic, providing an international platform that brings together more than 80 scholars, experts, think tanks and other academic institutions for dialogue, debate and research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inaugural Securing Cyberspace Conference, organised by RUSI and the GP-RCB, took place on 9 October 2024 at 61 Whitehall in London, convening global experts from academia, industry, government and civil society to explore challenges under the theme “Responsible Cyber Behaviour in Practice: A Global View”. Marking the first anniversary of the GP-RCB, the conference underscored the importance of diverse, inclusive dialogue in shaping the future of cyberspace governance. It aimed to bridge regional perspectives by connecting the research community, showcasing ongoing research, and facilitating insight on what RCB looks like across different operational contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-special-message-from-izumi-nakamitsu&quot;&gt;A Special Message from Izumi Nakamitsu&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ahead of the conference, RUSI received a “special message” from UN Under-Secretary-General and High Representative for Disarmament Affairs Izumi Nakamitsu that underscored the urgency of advancing global dialogues on RCB. In her message, Nakamitsu emphasised the importance of perseverance in face of geopolitical challenges, remarking that “Some may be tempted to conclude that the circumstances of the moment are not conducive to progress, but, in fact, it is precisely in moments like these that we must redouble our efforts in support of the framework for responsible state behaviour in the use of ICTs [Information and Communication Technologies].” The statement resonated with the overarching theme of SC2024, which saw experts address the complexities of advancing RCB in a world where political tensions and culturally divergent understandings of responsibility persist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-conference-programme&quot;&gt;The Conference Programme&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conference was made up of a mix of session formats. Following a ministerial opening, SC2024 began with two panels: one reflecting on the viability of multilateralism in advancing international cyber security commitments in an increasingly tense geopolitical context; and the other on state responsibility in the development of capabilities and conduct of cyber operations. Panel discussions were followed by workshops covering three dimensions of responsibility: international, domestic and operational. During the workshops, participants engaged with thought leadership, diverse perspectives and cross-sectoral collaboration to map diverse and practice-based understandings of RCB. The conference closed with a panel on innovative research and critical perspectives on ensuring RCB, which highlighted evolving work by GP-RCB researchers, and a “fireside chat” reflection on how to connect the discussion on responsible AI with cyber security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-uk-view-of-rcb&quot;&gt;A UK View of RCB&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stephen Doughty MP, minister of state for Europe, North America and Overseas Territories in the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, delivered the new government’s first speech on cyber security at SC2024. Doughty emphasised the critical importance of enhancing cyber security and fostering collaborative partnerships across UK sectors. He noted that “there is no national security, no economic security without cyber security”, underscoring the essential links between robust cyber measures and national stability. Acknowledging the increasing reliance on digital infrastructure in areas such as banking, healthcare and defence, the minister emphasised that, as “the stakes are higher than ever”, a unified response from all stakeholders is imperative, to counteract the escalating threats posed by state actors and criminal organisations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his address, the minister identified three key themes guiding the government’s approach to RCB: the necessity of partnerships; a commitment to RCB, including principles of transparency, inclusion and accountability; and the importance of a whole-of-society approach. He drew parallels with the successful collaboration that resulted in the cracking of the Enigma code during the Second World War, stating that “it’s only through solid, respectful, mutual, beneficial partnerships that we can fight back”, and emphasising how today’s cyber threats require unity. The minister underscored the need for transparency to build trust and facilitate cooperation, reflecting the UK’s aim of advancing responsibility through a holistic approach, fostering innovation, supporting underrepresented groups in technology, and engaging with global partners to combat cybercrime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;panel-1-fragmentation-or-like-mindedness-rethinking-rcb-in-the-age-of-minilateralism&quot;&gt;Panel 1: Fragmentation or Like-mindedness? Rethinking RCB in the Age of Minilateralism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UN negotiations on responsible state behaviour have provided an important framework for thinking about the applicability of international law in cyberspace, as well as creating a corpus of non-binding norms that can inform customary state practice. Notwithstanding such developments, current geopolitical divides and the elevation of cyber security within national security agendas have created a tense and protracted environment for the future of UN dialogues on this matter. In contrast to these larger forums, initiatives such as the Hiroshima Dialogue, the International Counter Ransomware Initiative and others have focused instead on promoting space for discussions of specific themes, and offering platforms for dialogue of the like-minded. In view of this, SC2024 invited government representatives and international experts to critically reflect on fragmentation and like-mindedness in global cyber security governance, specifically addressing the question of whether concrete discussions on RCB remain viable in an age of minilateralism – that is, in an age in which governments have sought to tackle international problems and pursue mutual goals in smaller groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-new-diplomatic-strategy&quot;&gt;A New Diplomatic Strategy?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panel opened with a keynote address by James Lewis, Senior Vice President at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, which focused on the evolving diplomatic cyber landscape, particularly in the context of great power competition. Lewis argued that the era of international cooperation on cyber norms, which “peaked” in 2015, has ended, with global relations now driven by rivalry among major powers such as the US, China and Russia. This shift, according to Lewis, means that “responsible state behaviour must be balanced against the realities of competition”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lewis emphasised that the fragmentation of the international system, driven by geopolitical realignments, has heightened tensions and disrupted progress on collaborative frameworks for cyberspace. He pointed to the absence of structured dialogues between major powers as a critical factor exacerbating this fragmentation. “There are no regular negotiations or agreed framework for talks between the United States and China, much less with Russia, as was the case in the Cold War,” he remarked, underscoring the challenges this poses for fostering stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A critical takeaway from Lewis’s keynote was the importance of governments creating new engagement strategies to manage the growing risks in cyberspace and its governance. Lewis advocated for a new democratic diplomatic strategy that accepts fragmentation but focuses on creating accountability and engagement strategies with both neutral and adversarial states. As he noted, “fragmentation, while unavoidable, can be managed to reduce the chance of conflict and to lay the foundation for a more secure future”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;panel-discussion&quot;&gt;Panel Discussion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subsequent panellists focused on providing insights into the different elements that shape governments’ decisions and incentives to engage in discussions on RCB. While panellists recognised the importance of multilateralism in fostering an inclusive platform where global voices can be heard – a sentiment embodied by institutions like the UN’s Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) – such frameworks also faced the criticism that they were slow and at risk of creating echo chambers. Specifically, one panellist raised the issue of there being a “bloc mentality” in multilateral fora, an issue that had prompted countries such as Brazil to not only call for confidence-building measures across political divides in the OEWG, but also support the establishment of a permanent mechanism for regular institutional dialogue on cyber security in the UN. This view echoed broader concerns that, without a unified approach, disparate initiatives between great powers could fracture global cyber governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minilateralism, on the other hand, was highlighted as indispensable for operationalising cyber security initiatives in diverse cultural and geographic regions. A panellist drew on Switzerland’s participation in the Pall Mall Process to counter the proliferation of commercially available cyber intrusion tools as an example of how smaller, focused coalitions can complement broader multilateral discussions. Panellists recognised that these coalitions allow for quicker action and sharper focus, especially in contexts where geopolitical divides slow down multilateral efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The African context added further nuance to the global conversation, with one participant highlighting how, despite African states recognising the value of multilateral platforms, there is growing sentiment that these forums often overlook regional priorities. The panellist specifically identified the need for a “Common African Position” on cyber norms, as a reflection of the continent’s desire for its priorities to be acknowledged, something that the rigid voting structures of international organisations often undermine. Similar conclusions were drawn by a panellist focused on RCB in the Indo-Pacific, which has seen India – in the absence of a pan-regional organisation in its vicinity – participate in various minilateral engagements including the Quad and the I2U2 Group. The panellist specifically identified geopolitical polarisation as a factor driving India’s foreign policy towards minilateral engagements, where a lack of understanding or sense of cooperation between major powers inhibits efforts towards global consensus building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than seeing these frameworks as being in competition, the panel recognised that they are mutually reinforcing: multilateralism provides the foundation for discussion and consensus building, while minilateralism drives practical outcomes. The added difficulty in this process, noted in the panel discussion, is the reconciliation of domestic responsibility with discussions at the international level. Emerging from the panel discussion was a reflection about the different levers of control and accountability that states have been trying to employ in attempting to enact responsibility amid growing fragmentation. This includes questions of how and when governments employ dual-use surveillance capabilities – such as the Intellexa Alliance capabilities proliferated across the EU – to legitimately address organised crime and other national security threats. An example of good practice, as highlighted by one participant, is the Swiss Act on Private Security Services Provided Abroad, adopted in 2013, which requires that companies intending to provide such services from Switzerland notify the relevant domestic authorities in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the panellists noted, the global cyber diplomatic landscape is marked by both multilateralism and minilateralism, with increasing geopolitical tensions amplifying the relevance of both global and regional frameworks to shaping RCB. The discussion concluded that the key will be in harmonising these frameworks to create a resilient and adaptable global cyber governance architecture, ensuring that wider conversations remain inclusive and effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;panel-2-responsible-use-of-cyber-capabilities&quot;&gt;Panel 2: Responsible Use of Cyber Capabilities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development and use of cyber capabilities have become an integral part of cyber statecraft. Countries have devised specific organisations (cyber forces and cyber commands), sought to pass legislation to enhance the reach of cyber operations, and allocated more government funding to acquiring cyber tools to support a suite of strategic/operational objectives. The second panel of the day therefore brought together a group of researchers and experts to discuss how states have sought to reconcile state responsibility with the development of capabilities for conducting offensive cyber operations, as well as the core elements that should guide states’ use, acquisition and development of such tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;keynote-address-the-dilemmas-of-responsible-cyber-partnerships&quot;&gt;Keynote Address: The Dilemmas of Responsible Cyber Partnerships&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This second panel was opened by investigative journalist Kim Zetter, whose keynote focused on the ethical and strategic dilemmas faced by liberal democracies in building and maintaining responsible cyber partnerships. Reflecting on the nearly 15 years since the discovery of the US-Israeli computer worm Stuxnet, Zetter highlighted the essential role of cyber capabilities in national security and foreign policy, while underscoring the lack of transparency involved. This relates to not only how states decide to deploy cyber tools to achieve their own objectives, but also what safeguards are in place to prevent their misuse by partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zetter raised critical questions about the international push for “responsibility” in cyber operations, questioning whose definition of responsibility prevails in a fragmented global landscape. She pointed out that while the US and its allies often condemn as irresponsible acts such as economic espionage, other states – notably China – see no distinction “between espionage for national security purposes and espionage to support the communist party’s socio-economic goals”. This divergence complicates efforts to establish shared norms, because – as Zetter noted – “nations that argue about the need for cyber norms are often reluctant to sign into agreements that would hamper their options for deploying capabilities”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another central theme in Zetter’s address was the challenge of shared responsibility when liberal democracies assist partners in developing cyber capabilities. She pointed out that while the US and its allies frequently provide training and resources to other states, they often lack control over how these partners deploy their newfound capabilities. In challenging the audience to consider the ethical implications of providing capabilities to allies who may employ them in ways that diverge from democratic norms, Zetter asked whether “democratic states that design offensive cyber tools – and develop the skills and techniques for using them – have the right to dictate how other nations that they give them to use them”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zetter highlighted how wider national political interests can indirectly lead democracies to endorse surveillance practices that they would deem unacceptable at home. In her view, Israel’s granting of an export licence for the NSO Group’s Pegasus software to the UAE in the 2010s – a transaction that is widely viewed as having contributed to the UAE’s recognition of Israel’s sovereignty in 2020 – is an example of this. Zetter concluded:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Today, when we talk about what kinds of operations we engage in that go too far, we also have to talk about what concessions we are willing to make that support the cyber operations of other nations. Where do we draw the limits of acceptable cyber behaviour for ourselves, and for those whose activities we enable and therefore tacitly endorse?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;panel-discussion-1&quot;&gt;Panel Discussion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panel brought together experts to discuss how governments reconcile the use of offensive cyber capabilities with international norms and legal obligations. Central to discussions were the tensions between transparency, oversight and operational security, highlighting the growing complexity of defining “responsibility” in the development and use of cyber capabilities. The following themes were raised by panellists as they reflected upon how to define responsible use of cyber capabilities, and addressed the key elements that should guide states’ development of cyber tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Transparency as a Cornerstone of Responsible Cyber Operations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Panellists agreed that transparency is essential to the responsible use of offensive capabilities. One participant noted how a significant shift has occurred in recent years. The use of such capabilities used often to be veiled in secrecy. The declassification in 2019 of the US cyber operation “Glowing Symphony” against Islamic State was cited as a pivotal moment of change, where a transparency initiative gave the international community a granular, detailed account of a state-conducted cyber operation for the first time. Marking a departure from the hyperbolic discourse surrounding the destructive potential of cyber actions, this type of openness – while challenging, owing to the need for operational security – was viewed by participants as crucial to building international confidence in states’ cyber behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Measuring the Effects of Cyber Operations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panellists also addressed the difficulties of measuring the effects of cyber operations, particularly in assessing unintended consequences. The complexity of cyber operations, combined with the often-blurred lines between state and non-state actors, complicates the evaluation of their impact. One panellist emphasised the importance of clearly defining “effects” of cyber actions in both operational and legal contexts to ensure accountability and adherence to international norms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Role of International Law and Due Diligence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panel acknowledged the importance of international law in governing state behaviour in cyberspace, while also recognising its limitations. There was consensus that while international law provides a foundational framework, its application remains more rhetorical than practical. A critical challenge highlighted was the lack of harmonised principles for accountability and attribution across the international community. The panel called for states to engage in the development of rigorous due diligence, both legally and operationally, to ensure that cyber actions remain within the bounds of international legal standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsibility to Act&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Panellists also discussed how government inaction in cyberspace – as distinct from widespread worries relating to government action and offensiveness – can constitute a form of irresponsibility. The most capable states, some panellists argued, have an obligation to take initiative, to be persistently engaged, and to contest malicious cyber activity. By doing so, states help shape the norms and rules that govern cyberspace over time. This approach challenges the traditional defensive postures that many states have adopted, where responsibility is seen as primarily reactive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-workshops-a-three-layered-approach-to-unpacking-rcb&quot;&gt;The Workshops: A Three-layered Approach to Unpacking RCB&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reflect upon responsibility through different conceptual lenses and contexts, participants in SC2024 were given the opportunity to deep dive into their respective fields of expertise across three separate workshops. These workshops aimed to provide participants with a platform to inform the future GP-RCB international research agenda by engaging with thought leadership, diverse perspectives and cross-sectoral collaboration. Based on the core themes and reflections that the GP-RCB had identified in its first year of unpacking framings of responsibility, the workshops were divided into a three-layered approach to responsibility: the international, domestic and operational levels of governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;track-1-international--the-road-ahead-for-un-cyber-negotiations-post-2025&quot;&gt;Track 1: International – The Road Ahead for UN Cyber Negotiations Post 2025&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the second OEWG mandate concludes in 2025, the future of UN cyber negotiations faces considerable uncertainty. This workshop invited participants to reflect on challenges and opportunities for sustaining international dialogue on responsible state behaviour in cyberspace. Discussions explored geopolitical divides, proposals for post-2025 frameworks, and the role of multistakeholder collaboration in shaping effective governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;OEWG Challenges and Limitations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussions began by reflecting on the OEWG’s role as a platform for state dialogue on responsible behaviour in cyberspace. While participants acknowledged its contributions to maintaining discussions, they also identified a heavy focus on procedural aspects, rather than on achieving tangible outcomes. A recurring critique was the insufficient attention given to integrating international humanitarian law into discussions; participants argued that this gap limits the OEWG’s effectiveness in addressing pressing cyber-governance challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proposals for Post-2025 Mechanisms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The uncertain future after the expiry of the OEWG’s mandate in 2025 prompted discussions on potential solutions to sustain international dialogue. A permanent Programme of Action (PoA) emerged as a prominent proposal, offering the prospect of merging existing parallel mechanisms, such as the OEWG and the Group of Governmental Experts (GGE), into a streamlined and cohesive structure. Proponents argued that a PoA could reduce the inefficiencies of recurring negotiations, while fostering institutional stability and continuity in cyber governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Navigating Geopolitical Silos&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants emphasised the difficulty of sustaining multilateral negotiations amid the increasing fragmentation of international relations. Geopolitical silos, marked by growing distrust and regional divisions, were seen as significant threats to progress on global cyber norms. Despite these challenges, there was consensus on the necessity of maintaining regular institutional dialogues to preserve minimal levels of trust and prevent the erosion of cooperative frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Multistakeholder Approaches&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key theme was the importance of broadening participation in cyber negotiations to include non-state actors. The inclusion of private sector representatives, civil society, and technical communities was highlighted as essential to capturing diverse expertise and perspectives. Such multistakeholder engagement was seen as a way to enhance the legitimacy of outcomes while addressing concerns that state-centric processes often overlook operational realities and broader societal impacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trust Building and Accountability&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Confidence-building measures and other approaches to building trust were identified as critical to fostering confidence among states. However, participants noted that the absence of robust verification mechanisms in cyberspace governance undermines the effectiveness of such measures. Breaches of international law were seen as particularly damaging to long-term cooperation. Greater accountability – through clearer enforcement mechanisms and a focus on transparency – was presented as essential for establishing a stable and reliable framework for cyber norms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;track-2-domestic--an-incident-responder-perspective-on-rcb&quot;&gt;Track 2: Domestic – An Incident Responder Perspective on RCB&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This workshop shifted the focus from international norms to the critical domestic responsibilities of technical operators such as computer emergency response teams (CERTs) and national cyber security agencies. Participants examined how these responders contribute to whole-of-government efforts to counter irresponsible cyber activities, and reflected on the unique perspectives they bring to defining and implementing responsible behaviour in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Evolving Role of Incident Responders&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop opened by highlighting how the field of cyber security has grown from addressing isolated vulnerabilities to dealing with challenges of broader societal significance. Participants observed that cyber attacks increasingly impact entire countries, with economic, political and national security implications. This shift underscores the need for incident responders to balance technical expertise with an understanding of larger strategic and legal frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Legal Boundaries and Normative Principles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussions emphasised the importance of ensuring that incident responders operate within defined legal and normative boundaries. CERTs, in particular, were seen as pivotal to upholding principles such as respect for national sovereignty while mitigating cyber threats. Participants highlighted that deeper training on international legal frameworks could enhance their ability to act responsibly and effectively, especially when managing cross-border incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Attribution as a Collaborative Endeavour&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attribution was identified as a complex task that requires a blend of technical analysis, intelligence sharing and diplomatic coordination. Participants shared lessons from past cases where attribution errors were corrected through collaboration among CERTs, intelligence agencies and other stakeholders. These examples demonstrated the value of multistakeholder partnerships in ensuring accurate and credible attributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Addressing Domestic and Cultural Nuances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop explored how domestic values and circumstances shape approaches to RCB. In developing countries, motivations for adhering to international norms often align with economic development goals and digital transformation. In contrast, more developed nations may prioritise global influence and power dynamics. Participants noted that African countries often feel marginalised in global discussions, calling for greater inclusion and support in public–private partnerships. The need to balance cyber security with privacy rights was also highlighted as a key consideration in diverse domestic contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bridging Policy and Technical Spaces&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants identified the gap between high-level policy discussions and technical operations as a persistent challenge. A recommendation emerged for governments to facilitate regular meetings between senior authorities and technical responders, enabling alignment of cyber security operations with legal frameworks. Such initiatives could foster stronger collaboration, ensuring that policy decisions translate effectively into operational practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diverse Challenges in Operationalising Responsibility&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion concluded with an acknowledgment of the significant variability in national capacities and resources. While some countries have made progress in fostering collaboration among CERTs, private companies and governmental entities, others struggle to operationalise norms due to economic and infrastructural limitations. This disparity underscores the need for tailored approaches to implementing responsible cyber practices across different domestic contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;track-3-operational--designing-principles-for-responsible-cyber-operations&quot;&gt;Track 3: Operational – Designing Principles for Responsible Cyber Operations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This session explored the guiding principles and doctrines for responsible cyber operations, moving beyond the growing institutional and technological capabilities states have developed for cyber competition. Participants focused on what operational norms and frameworks should inform states’ cyber activities, particularly in sub-threshold strategic contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beyond Legal Framing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the central tensions identified in the workshop was around the legal framing of responsibility. Participants noted that the conversation on responsibility often veers into overly legalistic discussions, focused primarily on adherence to international laws and norms, rather than on the intentions evident in operational behaviour. While adherence to international law is essential, an operational perspective on responsibility should also address recklessness and irresponsibility in cyber activities. This broader approach, according to its proponents, emphasises strategic oversight and the need to calibrate operations to avoid unintended consequences, tying actions to broader statecraft objectives, rather than to isolated missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proportionality and Necessity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The principles of proportionality and necessity were underscored as cornerstones of responsible cyber operations. While these principles are derived from international law, their real-world application remains challenging, especially when operations risk affecting civilian infrastructure or infringing human rights. Participants stressed the need to differentiate between counter-force targeting and counter-value strategies, citing cases such as SolarWinds and NotPetya as examples of disproportionate and poorly calibrated operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Transparency, Accountability and Oversight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance of transparency and multilayered oversight was a recurring theme. Democratic states such as Canada and India were highlighted as examples of countries working to ensure that cyber operations align with principles of civilian control and oversight. Participants agreed that the key to achieving this balance lies in governments’ ability to manage multiple layers of authorisations for cyber campaigns. In the case of Canada, such a process involves the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Intelligence Commissioner working together to ensure a principled approach to the authorisation and oversight of cyber operations. However, participants noted that existing transparency mechanisms often fall short of addressing the strategic and campaign-level dimensions of cyber operations. Effective frameworks should integrate cyber operations into broader political and strategic contexts, rather than treating them as standalone actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corporate Responsibility&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role of private companies in cyber operations was another critical discussion point. Technology and telecommunications firms often act as enablers or agents of state-sponsored operations, yet their accountability remains ambiguous. Participants emphasised the need for international principles that define the responsibilities of these actors and establish mechanisms to ensure they do not engage in reckless or irresponsible behaviour under the guise of state contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;responsible-ai-and-cyber-security&quot;&gt;Responsible AI and Cyber Security&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rapid expansion of generative AI models has heightened global interest in the disruptive implications of this technology to our societies, particularly regarding responsible and secure use. While AI has become integral to scaling cyber security solutions, discussions about responsible AI and RCB have often been siloed in separate communities. SC2024’s concluding fireside chat bridged this divide, featuring insights from Ollie Whitehouse, Chief Technology Officer at the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre, and Ciaran Martin, Professor of Practice in the Management of Public Organisations at the University of Oxford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avoiding Alarmism and Maintaining Perspective&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A central theme of the discussion was the need for a balanced approach to AI. Martin urged against sensationalist narratives, emphasising that responsible discourse requires avoiding exaggerated fears about AI’s potential for harm. He also highlighted that, unlike other industries, “the cyber security industry, for once – and very counter culturally given its history – has reacted to AI threats relatively calmly”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whitehouse echoed this sentiment, noting that while adversaries are leveraging AI to enhance traditional techniques such as vulnerability scanning and social engineering, these developments do not represent a fundamental shift in cyber threat dynamics. The industry’s challenge lies in monitoring and preparing for the scaling of AI threats without succumbing to hype. As Whitehouse explained, “there is something for us to be mindful about, and something to be prepared for as that scales, but the punchline is: AI for cyber good is the thing that we should fixate on, not AI for doom”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proliferation and Preparing for the Future&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inevitability of AI’s proliferation was another key focus. Basic AI capabilities are expected to become widely accessible, including to malicious actors. According to Whitehouse, this reality requires the cyber security community to adopt proactive strategies to mitigate risks, while continuing to evolve defences. He noted that governments and private entities must collaborate to develop norms and regulations that promote responsible AI use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside institutional measures, cyber security professionals must adapt to adversaries’ evolving tactics. Both speakers highlighted the importance of fostering a culture of scepticism in relation to AI systems, teaching professionals and the public to critically evaluate AI outputs, rather than placing undue trust in them. In cyber security, this translates to ensuring that critical decisions remain under human oversight. AI can automate tasks and provide insights, but ultimate accountability must lie with humans, especially when national security is at stake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Integrating AI into Cyber Security Frameworks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Martin emphasised the need to view AI and cyber security as interconnected parts of the same challenge, rather than as separate phenomena. Integrating AI into cyber security frameworks responsibly requires balancing the technology’s potential benefits against ethical considerations and the risks it poses. This approach includes retaining human judgement in decision-making processes, and ensuring that AI systems are tools rather than autonomous agents in critical security contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-future-of-gp-rcb-research&quot;&gt;The Future of GP-RCB Research&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SC2024 explored RCB in its international, domestic and operational dimensions, identifying key challenges and future directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the international level, discussions highlighted the persistent gap between the development of UN norms and their practical implementation, particularly in resource-constrained nations. Inclusive engagement, capacity building, and equitable partnerships were emphasised as essential for fostering global adherence to responsible principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domestically, the role of technical actors such as CERTs was highlighted as central. Participants emphasised the need for robust legal understanding among responders, and stronger collaboration between policymakers and technical communities. Bridging the gap between policy and technical spaces was seen as critical to operationalising responsibility within national contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operationally, principles such as proportionality, necessity and accountability were identified as essential for responsible cyber operations. Participants called for greater transparency, strategic oversight, and accountability mechanisms, particularly in the involvement of private sector actors in state-directed cyber activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across all tracks, the importance of three major themes emerged: bridging silos between disciplines; addressing the unique challenges of different national contexts; and strengthening collaboration between state and non-state actors. Discussions underscored the need for a holistic, integrated approach to RCB, encompassing legal, technical and operational considerations. The conference reflected a collective recognition that RCB requires a coordinated global effort, underpinned by consistent dialogue, inclusive governance and a strategic approach to tackling the evolving cyber threat landscape. These reflections will inform future research and engagement as part of the GP-RCB and wider research community, highlighting the necessity of a forward-thinking, collaborative framework to navigate the complexities of cyber security in the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;

This edited volume offers comprehensive analysis and recommendations to create resilient supply chains for national, economic, and energy security.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Safeguarding the minerals supply chains for advanced technologies in strategic industries is an economic and national security imperative. Yet significant vulnerabilities continue to exist in the supply chain, despite the ongoing efforts by government and businesses to address them. Policymakers now face the immense task of fortifying supplies of everything from lithium and graphite for advanced battery chemistries to tungsten and rare earth elements for the next generation of warfighting technologies. The United States will need to strengthen both its mission clarity and its execution with a comprehensive strategy focused on domestic resource development, advanced processing and recycling technologies, international partnerships, and sustainable practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This edited volume brings together the analysis and policy recommendations of 15 experts, led by editors Dr. Gracelin Baskaran and Dr. Duncan Wood, to bolster U.S. competitiveness and leadership in these areas. It is intended to be a resource for policymakers in the new U.S. administration and Congress. The volume shows that resilient mineral chains have never been more important for U.S. security than at this critical juncture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chapter-1&quot;&gt;CHAPTER 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;gracelin-baskaran&quot;&gt;Gracelin Baskaran&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mining is an inextricable part of the American story. What starts as rock in the ground goes on to become the inputs that build America’s homes and buildings, transportation systems, energy generation and transmission, defense systems, and technological capabilities. Mining is the foundation that allowed the United States to be a military leader, providing the minerals needed to manufacture tanks, missiles, fighter jets and warships. It is the reason computers, phones, and iPads exist. Mining is the reason we have energy and can turn on lights every morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the United States is 100 percent import reliant for 12 of the 50 minerals identified as critical by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and over 50 percent import reliant for another 29. China is the top producer for 29 of these critical minerals. This dominance is the result of decades of minerals-centered domestic industrial strategy and foreign policy. China has repeatedly shown its willingness to weaponize these minerals. Over the last two years, China has rolled out export restrictions, including complete bans, on antimony, gallium, germanium. Furthermore, China has a stranglehold on minerals processing, refining between 40 and 90 percent of the world’s supply of rare earth elements, graphite, lithium, cobalt, and copper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reducing reliance on China and creating resilient mineral supply chains is one of the most bipartisan priorities in Washington, D.C. This is demonstrated by the efforts of the last two administrations. In 2017, President Donald Trump issued Executive Order 13817, intending to improve the management of critical minerals needed for economic prosperity and energy security. In 2021, President Joe Biden issued Executive Order 14017, which led to a review of U.S. critical minerals and material supply chain vulnerabilities. The assessment released by the Biden administration discovered that the overreliance on adversarial countries posed a threat to national and economic security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geopolitical tension and war have motivated the advancement of critical minerals policies for nearly a century. At the start of World War II, the United States adopted the Strategic and Critical Materials Stockpiling Act of 1939. In his letter to Congress, President Franklin D. Roosevelt noted both that commercial stocks of vital raw resources in the United States were low and that “In the event of unlimited warfare on sea and in the air, possession of a reserve of these essential supplies might prove of vital importance.” By 1942, non-essential gold mining was restricted by the U.S. government so that it could free up mining companies’ capacity to focus on more critical minerals needed for the war effort. Less than a decade later, the Defense Production Act of 1950 was passed in response to the Korean War and provided authority for allocations to source strategic minerals needed to manufacture defense technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

The derived work is not endorsed by the IEA in any manner.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While conflict and uncertainty have been the biggest drivers of advancing policies to build secure minerals supply chains, demand for minerals has largely been driven by industrialization, technological advancements, decarbonization, and economic growth. For example, in 1975, the United States required that catalytical convertors be installed into automobiles to reduce emissions. These catalytic convertors drove the long-term demand of platinum group metals and have single-handedly made American air cleaner and more breathable, reducing harmful exhaust gases from automobiles by over 90 percent. Copper is another example. It is a necessary material for many of the advanced technologies that are essential to the modern global economy, including in infrastructure, clean energy, electronics, and automotives, and copper wires connect electrical grids, integrated circuits, and telecommunications systems. In order to meet net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, annual copper supply would need to double by 2035. The artificial intelligence (AI) industry is putting additional pressure on copper demand. The data centers that process AI applications could demand up to 200,000 metric tons of copper per year between 2025 and 2028, adding another 2.6 million metric tons to the copper deficit in 2030. Copper reached its highest ever price—$11,000 per metric ton—on the London Stock Exchange in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As technologies advance and become cleaner, and as demand for them grows, the mineral needs of the U.S. economy intensify. The competitiveness of the U.S. domestic automotive, energy, technology, and defense industries will be key to determining the United States’ standing as an economic powerhouse and global superpower in the decades ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States will need to strengthen both its mission clarity and its execution. At present, the U.S. government has yet to agree on a single critical minerals list. Because copper is not on the USGS list, it has been ineligible for investment incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Additionally, there is no centralized agency or department to coordinate mining activities or execute a strategy. There are 15 government departments and agencies working on critical minerals, including the Departments of the Interior, Commerce, Energy, Defense, State, Labor, Homeland Security, Treasury, Agriculture, and Education; the Export-Import Bank; the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation; the U.S. Agency for International Development; the Environmental Protection Agency; and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The Bureau of Mines, which was initially opened in 1910 to coordinate all mining activities, was closed in 1996 and never reopened. Most of these departments and agencies are working on their own critical minerals efforts, with little interagency collaboration. Ultimately, strengthening coordination within the U.S. government must be a priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book has three sections. Section 1 provides an evaluation of the critical minerals needs of four vital industries—semiconductors, defense, electric vehicles, and renewable energy—and provides recommendations for strengthening the resilience of these supply chains. Section 2 evaluates key Biden-era initiatives related to minerals supply chains—the IRA, CHIPS and Science Act, Defense Production Act, and the Minerals Security Partnership—and provides recommendations for reforming. The final section provides an analysis of key issues—domestic permitting, building midstream processing capacity, commercial diplomacy for minerals, deep sea mining, responsible mining, and government coordination—and provides concrete recommendations for how the United States can strengthen its performance in these areas to be a competitive and credible global leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;crucial-industries-rely-on-critical-minerals-to-remain-competitive&quot;&gt;CRUCIAL INDUSTRIES RELY ON CRITICAL MINERALS TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Safeguarding the supply chains for advanced technologies in strategic industries is an economic and national security imperative. Policymakers now face the immense task of fortifying supplies of everything from lithium and graphite for advanced battery chemistries to tungsten and rare earth elements for the next generation of warfighting technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, the first part of this book delves into the mineral needs of four key industries to U.S. economic competitiveness: semiconductors, defense, automobiles, and renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;semiconductors&quot;&gt;Semiconductors&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semiconductors are foundational to virtually every part of modern life, powering technologies that drive innovation, connectivity, and efficiency. They are used in smartphones, computers, military applications, medical devices, and automotives. Semiconductors are mineral intensive—small but essential quantities of gallium, germanium, palladium, silicon, arsenic, titanium, and other elements are needed to produce the array of semiconductors required for such diverse applications. The production of these resources is largely concentrated in foreign adversaries, exposing a severe national security risk. USGS has estimated that just a 30 percent supply disruption of gallium could cause a $602 billion decline in U.S. economic output, amounting to a 2.1 percent loss of gross domestic product (GDP)—a significant economic impact. Semiconductor supply chains will not be secure until the necessary mineral supply chains are secured. In Chapter 2, Gracelin Baskaran and Meredith Schwartz assess the minerals needs of the semiconductor industry and provide recommendations on developing appropriate incentives and leveraging research and development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;defense-industry&quot;&gt;Defense Industry&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minerals are the bedrock of the defense industry. They are used in a wide array of defense applications, including military weapons systems, ammunition, and aerospace technologies. China is rapidly investing in munitions and advanced weapons systems, acquiring new systems roughly five to six times more quickly than the United States. While China is operating with a wartime mindset to enhance military readiness, the United States has maintained a peacetime approach. Even before new restrictions, the U.S. defense industrial base struggled with insufficient capacity and surge capability to meet production demands for defense technologies, many of which are highly minerals intensive. Restrictions on critical mineral supplies will further widen the gap, enabling China to advance its capabilities more effectively than the United States. In Chapter 3, Matt Zolnowski describes Department of Defense (DOD) actions to mitigate critical minerals vulnerabilities and advises how the department can update war-planning assumptions and stockpiling programs to prepare for a future crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3: U.S. Import Reliance on China by Mineral Type (as Percent of Consumption).&lt;/strong&gt; Source: USGS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;electric-vehicles&quot;&gt;Electric Vehicles&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electric vehicles (EVs) are a major driver of innovation in the auto industry and are shaping the future of mobility. While the EV industry is important for the clean energy transition, it is also of vital importance to the U.S. economy. Domestic automakers began the commercial production of hybrid EVs in 1997. They have spent decades investing in the development of the EV industry. EV investments in the United States over the last nine years reached $199 billion and created 201,900 EV-related jobs. By June 2024, automotive manufacturing jobs reached their highest levels since 1990. EVs require significant quantities of minerals. While a traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) requires an average of 32 kg of critical minerals, an EV needs an average of 210 kg—over a six-fold increase. Therefore, the domestic auto industry now faces the daunting task of sourcing minerals from reliable and responsible partners amid a shifting policy landscape and swiftly evolving battery technologies. In Chapter 4, Duncan Wood and Alexandra Helfgott look at EV trends in the United States, assess the battery landscape, and examine how the United States should provide support to sustain an innovative and competitive domestic EV industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;renewable-energy&quot;&gt;Renewable Energy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Renewable energy technologies will be key to unlocking new, cleaner sources of energy. In the United States, wind and solar together provide 15 percent of electricity generation, with both sectors poised for substantial growth. In 2023, there was $248 billion in clean energy investments. This is over a three-fold increase from 2018. Today, the renewable energy industry employs 8 million people in the United States. Southern states have been the biggest beneficiaries of clean energy investments, receiving $428 billion between the first quarter of 2018 and second quarter of 2024, followed by Western states ($327 billion), Midwestern states ($149 billion), and Northeastern states ($90 billion). While this renewable energy buildout promises greater energy security, lower costs, and reduced emissions, it will depend heavily on secure mineral supplies. Wind farms and utility-scale solar facilities require far more mineral inputs than conventional power plants. Both technologies rely on critical minerals for their advanced electronics and components. In Chapter 5, Joseph Majkut highlights two materials especially imperiled due to rising demand and a lack of supply chain diversification—rare earth elements and polysilicon—which are essential for wind and solar power, respectively. China currently dominates the supply chains for both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;section-2&quot;&gt;SECTION 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;progress-under-the-biden-administration&quot;&gt;PROGRESS UNDER THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Important but Incomplete&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, Washington has come to the realization that crucial U.S. industries and technologies are reliant on supply chains that are heavily concentrated in foreign adversaries, namely China. Advanced semiconductors designed in the United States are being manufactured and packaged in Taiwan. American automakers are producing EVs using Chinese battery chemistries. Domestically produced solar panels are made with Chinese solar cells and polysilicon. Over the course of decades and with the assistance of state-led industrial policies and billions of dollars in subsidies, China has grown to dominate the manufacturing sector for the cutting-edge technologies that the modern economy relies on. The risk this poses to U.S. national and economic security is untenable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To that end, diversifying supply chains and boosting American manufacturing and ingenuity was a central objective of the Biden administration. To achieve these goals, President Biden enacted major pieces of legislation like the IRA and the CHIPS and Science Act, invoked the DOD’s Defense Production Act to boost the industrial base, and initiated the Department of State’s Mineral Security Partnership to further international cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These policy measures have been impactful in stimulating private sector investment as well as changing the narrative in policy circles around what qualifies as a strategic industry and what the role of government should be in securing supply chains. But these policy measures also have some significant gaps when it comes to the upstream mining and minerals industries. The new administration will be tasked with determining how these initiatives under the Biden administration can be modified, improved, and strengthened to better fit the mining industry’s needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;inflation-reduction-act&quot;&gt;Inflation Reduction Act&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IRA is the Biden administration’s flagship climate initiative, providing unprecedented levels of government incentives in the form of tax credits, grants, and loan guarantees for the clean energy industry. The bill includes provisions designed to address the entire circular clean energy supply chain, from the production of lithium and graphite to the manufacturing of EV batteries and wind turbines to the recycling and recovery of materials from end-use technologies. While the IRA has driven unprecedented investment in clean energy supply chains, sourcing critical minerals remains a critical limitation. In Chapter 6, Gracelin Baskaran and Meredith Schwartz score the IRA on how well it has achieved its objectives thus far and give recommendations as to how the minerals-related provisions may be altered and expanded upon to better meet the needs of industry and national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chips-and-science-act&quot;&gt;CHIPS and Science Act&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CHIPS Act, signed into law in August 2022, was an amalgamation of a number of legislative efforts to address both a rising China and the United States’ desire to firm up access to semiconductors following the pandemic supply chain shock that froze consumer access to a wide range of products. Although this bill addressed a wide range of science and technology areas relevant to U.S. competitiveness, it did not prioritize securing American access to critical minerals. As a result, the CHIPS Act’s focus on critical minerals access is minor, with the majority of funding going toward research and development for chip innovation, workforce development programs, and, above all, attracting investment in semiconductor fabrication, assembly, testing, and advanced packaging. Congress needs to act to explicitly address minerals relevant to semiconductor production, as they have for minerals used for EVs and clean tech. In Chapter 7, Kellee Wicker analyzes the impacts and shortcomings of the CHIPS Act and provides recommendations for strengthening the legislation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;defense-production-act&quot;&gt;Defense Production Act&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration also invoked the Defense Production Act (DPA) of 1950 to secure critical minerals for the defense industrial base. The DPA authorizes the president to ensure the availability of U.S. and Canadian industry for U.S. defense, essential civilian, and homeland security requirements. DPA Title III, Expansion of Productive Capacity and Supply, includes incentives for the DOD to develop, maintain, modernize, and expand production capacity or critical technologies. DPA Title III funds cannot be used if other funding (e.g., private investment or funding from other agencies) can be secured. Given the private sector’s reluctance to make investments in critical minerals projects due to market price volatility for these materials, the DPA has proven to be a vital financing mechanism. In Chapter 8, Christine Michienzi details how the DPA has been used so far to support the critical minerals industry in the United States and Canada and gives recommendations as to how the new administration can best leverage the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;minerals-security-partnership&quot;&gt;Minerals Security Partnership&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Minerals Security Partnership (MSP) is a multilateral State Department initiative uniquely focused on minerals security. Since its inception in 2022, the MSP has mobilized a coalition of market-led democracies, primarily Western developed nations, with India as the only developing nation with membership. By 2024, the MSP supported nearly 30 minerals projects around the world and has brought additional mineral-rich countries to the table in the MSP Forum. But many unknowns and questions still remain as to how efficacious the MSP is and how it endures in a new administration. In Chapter 9, Jane Nakano suggests several modifications to the MSP that could accord more dynamism and long-term durability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;addressing-challenges-and-outstanding-questions-in-the-critical-minerals-industry&quot;&gt;ADDRESSING CHALLENGES AND OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS IN THE CRITICAL MINERALS INDUSTRY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minerals industry faces a number of unique challenges that policymakers must address in the coming years if they wish to substantially shift mineral supply chains and improve U.S. industry’s access to non-Chinese mineral sources. The third part of this volume delves into some of the biggest issues and questions facing the industry, from how to expedite the domestic mine permitting process to whether deep sea mining is the future of minerals extraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;domestic-permitting&quot;&gt;Domestic Permitting&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mining is the first step in the critical minerals supply chain, yet permitting a mine is a major hurdle in domestic critical mineral production that has yet to be overcome. On average, it takes 29 years to build a mine in the United States, the second-longest time in the world. Obtaining permission to operate a mine in the United States today involves securing federal, state, and local permits. A project can require up to 30 permits, many of which are duplicative. Policymakers on both sides of the aisle are calling for a modernized permitting system that facilitates the development of domestic mining projects. In Chapter 10, Morgan Bazilian and Gregory Wischer review the history of permitting policy in the United States and provide actionable policy solutions to streamline the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;building-processing-and-refining-capacity&quot;&gt;Building Processing and Refining Capacity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next stage of mineral production, also known as the midstream, mined mineral ore must be processed and refined into the high-purity metals and materials used in end products. This stage of the supply chain is where China truly dominates. The dependence on Chinese processing creates strategic vulnerabilities, exposing the United States to potential supply disruptions due to geopolitical tensions, export restrictions, and price manipulations. To reduce these risks and bolster national security, it is essential to enhance U.S. midstream processing capabilities. In Chapter 11, Adam Johnson explains the importance of building domestic mineral processing capacity and provides recommendations on developing the workforce, leveraging strategic reserves, and streamlining permitting to accelerate the development of midstream capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;international-engagement&quot;&gt;International Engagement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past 30 years, China has emerged as a key player in mineral supply chains through strategic international engagement. Although it produces only 10 percent of the world’s lithium, cobalt, nickel, and copper, China imports sufficient quantities to process 65 to 90 percent of the global supply of these metals. This dominance is the result of years of industrial planning and foreign policy initiatives from Beijing. Given the United States’ limited domestic reserves—including less than 1 percent of the world’s reserves of commodities such as cobalt, nickel, and graphite, and less than 2 percent of manganese and rare earth elements—it must develop a strategy to reduce its dependence and enhance its mineral supply security. In Chapter 12, Gracelin Baskaran provides a novel framework for determining which international partners to prioritize and gives recommendations for how policymakers should engage in commercial diplomacy. These efforts should prioritize financing minerals security needs, leveraging soft power through infrastructure development and geological mapping, and developing carrots and sticks to drive market-based activity aligned to U.S. government interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;deep-sea-mining&quot;&gt;Deep Sea Mining&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While today’s EVs and semiconductors are manufactured with minerals from land-based mines, this may not always be the case. Minerals that are found in nodules at the depths of the ocean, including manganese, nickel, copper, and cobalt, offer immense untapped resource potential. However, the environmental impacts of extraction from these sources remain largely unknown, and a set of international regulations has yet to be finalized. Still, China continues to make strides in developing the necessary technologies and exploration licenses to capture deep sea resources first. In Chapter 13, Seaver Wang provides insight into the status of the deep sea mining industry and the opportunity to change the calculus around mineral supply chains by expanding tax incentives to cover minerals mined from the sea, strengthening support to seafloor minerals research to improve environmental management approaches, and providing financing to strategic demonstration projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;responsible-mining&quot;&gt;Responsible Mining&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mining is an industry with a complicated, and often negative, reputation due to all-too-frequent incidents of environmental degradation, human rights violations, social unrest, and devastating workplace accidents. Therefore, responsible mining standards are a nonnegotiable to ensure that U.S. and allied mines operate under best practices. As a major consumer and increasingly important producer of mined materials, the United States has a critical role in promoting responsible mining practices. In Chapter 14, Rohitesh Dhawan offers insight into how permitting reform can be done in a way that promotes responsible mining practices and advantages projects that follow high standards, how responsible mining standards can be used as a criterion for public procurement of metals or metal-based products, and how green premiums can be leveraged to financially incentivize responsible mining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-comprehensive-us-strategy-for-minerals-security&quot;&gt;A Comprehensive U.S. Strategy for Minerals Security&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minerals policy has shifted quite significantly since 2010. The Obama, Trump, and Biden administrations all approached the critical minerals challenge based on their respective times and the policy tools at their disposal. America has learned much from these experiences. Reflecting on those experiences, Frank Fannon provides a suite of recommendations in Chapter 15 for the new administration to retake the commanding heights of the new economy: developing a single point of accountability to oversee and coordinate the administration’s multiple lines of minerals policy efforts, reforming financing tools such as the DFC and Export-Import Bank (EXIM), undertaking permitting reform, and eliminating provisions that allow firms with any Chinese ownership from receiving taxpayer subsidies. Successful action will require an “all-of-the-above” approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;looking-ahead&quot;&gt;Looking Ahead&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mission we undertook in compiling this book was to provide a comprehensive analysis of the indispensable role critical minerals play in the modern economy’s most strategic industries, and to more fully understand and address the vulnerabilities the United States faces in securing the minerals upon which it so clearly depends. Furthermore, this volume is rich in policy proposals for the new administration, laying out a path forward for the most pressing challenges facing the critical minerals supply chain, from extraction to processing and refining to end use. These challenges are real and profound and require urgent attention—but as the chapters in this book demonstrate, they are not insurmountable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The success of the Western semiconductor industry depends on reliable access to the critical minerals that are responsible for continuous advancements in the industry.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semiconductors are the fundamental building blocks of modern technology, necessary for everything from smartphones and laptops to communications and energy-storage systems to military and aerospace applications. These integrated circuits are called “semiconductors” due to being partial conductors, a unique property that enables them to control the flow of electrons by acting as both conductors and insulators. Therefore, semiconductors rely on small but essential quantities of specific minerals with these properties to function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Silicon, gallium, and germanium are the most common semiconductor materials used to form wafers, with different chip applications calling for different materials. However, a myriad of other critical minerals come into play during the manufacturing stages and doping process—in which additional metals are introduced to slightly alter the chip’s conductivity—to create just one integrated circuit. Palladium, arsenic, iridium, titanium, copper, and cobalt are just some of the additional minerals that are necessary for semiconductor plating, wiring, doping, and packaging during production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The critical minerals most central to semiconductor production have high-risk supply chains largely concentrated in China. China produces 98 percent of the world’s refined gallium and controls 68 percent of refined germanium production, 79 percent of the world’s silicon, 40 percent of its arsenic trioxide, and 67 percent of its titanium. The United States, meanwhile, is reliant on imports to access the materials needed for high-performance semiconductors. In 2022, the United States produced no arsenic, no gallium, less than 2 percent of the world’s refined germanium, 3 percent of its silicon, and less than 1 percent of its titanium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concentration of global critical minerals supply chains in the hands of adversaries presents a major security challenge for Western chipmakers. The chance of prolonged and widespread supply disruptions for semiconductor minerals is high, as China has already demonstrated its ability to restrict the flow of key minerals in the global economy. In July 2023, China announced export restrictions on gallium and germanium. A year and a half later, China cut off the United States from Chinese gallium and germanium entirely through complete export bans on these materials targeted specifically at the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The semiconductor industry is too central to U.S. economic and national security to allow such an evident vulnerability in its supply chain. To truly secure the Western semiconductor industry, policymakers should address mineral supply chain vulnerabilities, not just vulnerabilities in downstream chip manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-importance-of-minerals-to-advance-semiconductor-technology&quot;&gt;THE IMPORTANCE OF MINERALS TO ADVANCE SEMICONDUCTOR TECHNOLOGY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The critical minerals necessary for semiconductor production hold the key to furthering innovation in the industry. A concept commonly known as Moore’s Law stipulates that the density of a semiconductor (i.e., the number of transistors that can fit on a 1-square-inch microchip) will continue to rise every year, equating to more computing power, higher speed, and more complex applications. For decades, silicon has been the wafer material of choice for most semiconductors due to its abundance in nature and thermal stability, making it a cheaper choice well suited to the early electronics industry. However, silicon alone may be close to reaching the physical limits of Moore’s Law. Rather, gallium and germanium are essential additions and alternatives to unlocking more advanced chipmaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gallium and germanium have certain advantages over silicon that make them ideal materials for increasingly advanced semiconductors. Germanium’s high electron mobility allows it to conduct electrons nearly three times faster than silicon, translating into faster device performance. Semiconductors with germanium channels, known as complementary metal–oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuits, are used today for quantum computers. Gallium similarly offers greater conductive potential for higher power density and energy efficiency. High-performance chips made with gallium nitride (GaN) and gallium arsenide (GaAs) are used in advanced defense applications from satellite communications to missile detection systems. Production of GaN chips is expected to grow more than 25 percent annually through 2030, with defense applications driving this increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gallium and germanium are indispensable materials for the future of the semiconductor industry. But with current supply chain challenges and no U.S. sourcing alternatives, these materials are increasingly difficult to obtain. The next generation of chipmaking requires policymakers to devise and execute a critical minerals strategy that ensures the industry will have a reliable supply of needed materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mineral-sourcing-challenges&quot;&gt;MINERAL SOURCING CHALLENGES&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gallium and germanium are especially rare in the Earth’s crust, at only 19.0 and 1.6 parts per million (ppm), respectively. Copper, in comparison, is estimated at 60 parts per million. These concentrations of minerals are too widely dispersed to be recovered directly from the Earth. Rather, the only economically viable way to source gallium and germanium is to recover them as byproducts from the mining and processing of other minerals. Gallium is sourced from bauxite ores through aluminum smelting, and germanium is primarily recovered from zinc smelting. Even so, less than 10 percent of the gallium in bauxite and 5 percent of the germanium in zinc can be recovered. These materials must then go through a complex refining process to produce gallium and germanium at the needed purity levels of over 99.99 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has several advantages in gallium and germanium sourcing. The country has rich zinc deposits and imports 75 percent of the world’s bauxite due to its leading aluminum industry. This access to feedstock has also positioned China well to lead in germanium and gallium recovery. Aided by government subsidies, Chinese firms were able to flood the market with mineral oversupply in the 2010s. As prices dropped, Western competitors could not remain economically viable, allowing China to emerge as the world leader in semiconductor minerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the United States has small bauxite reserves of 20 million tons (less than 1 percent of global totals) and limited zinc reserves of 76.6 million tons (3 percent of global totals). The country currently has limited mining activity and produces only small amounts of germanium from zinc deposits in Alaska and smelting operations in Tennessee. Some new domestic projects may be in the works: In 2023, Dutch company Nyrstar announced a $150 million investment to expand its existing zinc operations in Tennessee to add a gallium and germanium processing facility. However, the project has yet to secure investor funding, and the company has faced market challenges that led it to temporarily suspend zinc mining operations in October 2023. In the near term, domestic investments will evidently not be enough to secure gallium and germanium supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. allies and strategic partners will be key to sourcing bauxite and zinc and producing gallium and germanium. For example, although Australia is the top producer of bauxite and home to the largest zinc reserves in the world, it lacks midstream processing capacity, leading it to send over 50 percent of its zinc exports and 97 percent of its bauxite exports to China. And Peru, a U.S. free trade partner with the largest zinc smelting plant in Latin America, currently produces no germanium or gallium. Australia and Peru hold vast potential for alternative gallium and germanium sourcing for the semiconductor industry, but without investment by Western firms into midstream processing and refining, these resources will remain untapped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-chips-and-science-act&quot;&gt;THE CHIPS AND SCIENCE ACT&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;But What About the Critical Minerals?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the spring of 2020, at the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic, the United States experienced firsthand how debilitating semiconductor shortages can be. An estimated 169 sectors and consumer lines were impacted by semiconductor supply disruptions, including the electronic, automotive, communications, and healthcare industries. As a result, Western firms faced lower production volumes, the cancellation of new product lines, and delayed breakthroughs in technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT). Policymakers realized just how fragile current semiconductor supply chains are, due to a highly complex and specialized production process largely concentrated in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August 2022, President Joe Biden signed the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) and Science Act into law, with the goal of strengthening U.S. semiconductor manufacturing and supply chains. This act included over $280 billion in support for advanced chip manufacturing, packaging, and workforce development. To address the supply chain vulnerabilities experienced during the pandemic, the bill focused on onshoring downstream capabilities, including by developing fabrication facilities for legacy chips used in communications and defense applications. The legislation also introduced significant government grant funding, which has been awarded to companies such as Intel and Micron to enable them to build and expand their chip-manufacturing capacity. However, the CHIPS Act overlooked a major national security vulnerability in semiconductor supply chains: critical minerals. The bill did not include any provisions to incentivize the diversification of critical minerals supply chains for semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;export-restrictions-highlight-supply-chain-vulnerabilities&quot;&gt;EXPORT RESTRICTIONS HIGHLIGHT SUPPLY CHAIN VULNERABILITIES&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States quickly realized just how big an oversight the exclusion of critical minerals from the CHIPS Act was. On August 1, 2023, Chinese export restrictions on gallium and germanium went into effect in retaliation for Washington banning exports of advanced semiconductor technologies to China. Due to the restrictions, gallium and germanium exporters in China are now required to apply for an export license for each shipment of material, providing the government with details on the overseas buyer and end use. Beijing justified the escalation of the tech war by claiming that such measures were necessary for national security. Meanwhile, the Western semiconductor industry was paying the price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August and September 2023, China exported no refined gallium and only 1 kg of refined germanium, compared to nearly 8,000 kg and 6,900 kg, respectively, in the preceding July. In total, China’s gallium exports for 2023 were over 50 percent lower than exports for 2022; as of February 2024, gallium exports had yet to return to pre-restriction levels, and it remains unclear when China’s exports will return to their previous peaks. Continued restrictions and the implementation of gallium and germanium export bans in January 2025 will have a significant effect on the U.S. economy. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has estimated that a disruption to just 30 percent of gallium supply could cause a $602 billion drop in U.S. economic output, equivalent to 2.1 percent of gross domestic product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prices for these materials have risen markedly over the past year. In April 2024, gallium prices were at their highest level since 2011. Assessed prices for gallium have nearly doubled since the restrictions were imposed, and germanium prices have also climbed over 70 percent, to $2,280 per kilogram. China has demonstrated its ability to control the materials market for semiconductors and has only tightened U.S. access to these materials with newly implemented exported bans. Continued and additional bottlenecks in critical minerals supply present an ongoing threat to the resilience of the U.S. semiconductor industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;RECOMMENDATIONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Creating Better Policy for Semiconductor Mineral Supply Chains&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CHIPS and Science Act, as well as the current policy focus on downstream chip manufacturing, will not be enough to secure semiconductor supply chains. As long as China controls critical minerals supply chains, the U.S. semiconductor industry will be vulnerable to export restrictions, bottlenecks, and price volatility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One policy recommendation that is frequently cited as a solution to shortages of base metals is to revamp government stockpiling efforts through the National Defense Stockpile under the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act of 1939. The United States currently stockpiles no gallium and only about 14,000 kg of germanium, or half of the country’s annual consumption. However, stockpiling semiconductor metals to address critical minerals supply chain vulnerabilities will be challenging due to their price volatility and the small quantities needed for the industry (relative to the electric vehicle industry, for example, which requires significant quantities of base metals). In addition, gallium has a shelf life of only around one year due to its low melting point. Stockpiling efforts are therefore not the best solution to addressing supply chain concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, the United States should consider the following actions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Invest in building the technological know-how for gallium and germanium refining.&lt;/strong&gt; Refining these minerals to needed purity levels of over 99.99 percent for the semiconductor industry requires specific technology, infrastructure, and expertise, all of which are currently lacking. The United States has only one company that refines high-purity gallium and one operation for germanium. A research and development laboratory could boost innovation to increase processing capacity and produce minerals in a more cost-effective way.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Department of Energy already funds laboratories focused on critical minerals for electric vehicles (EVs) and clean energy, but there is less focus on semiconductor minerals such as gallium and germanium. For example, the Critical Minerals Innovation Hub at the Ames National Laboratory in Iowa and the Minerals to Materials Supply Chain Research Facility (METALLIC) network bring together the expertise of several leading national laboratories to find solutions to critical minerals supply challenges for clean energy industries. The Department of Commerce should fund similar initiatives focused on minerals for the semiconductor industry. National laboratories can help develop the capabilities, technologies, and skills needed to produce refined semiconductor minerals at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Put together a comprehensive incentives package that addresses upstream critical minerals mining and midstream processing and refining.&lt;/strong&gt; Just as the CHIPS and Science Act focused on incentives to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) incentivized investments in EV and clean energy technologies, an upstream and midstream critical minerals incentives package would ensure that U.S. fabs manufacturing the next generation of semiconductor technologies have reliable access to the critical minerals they need. With billions of dollars being invested in chips foundry facilities, their success hinges on access to needed input materials. Ensuring the security of the critical minerals supply chain is common-sense policy that supports the ambitious industrial goals of the CHIPS and Science Act and IRA.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This package should include investment and production tax credits such as those covered in Sections 48C and 45X of the IRA. Such incentives programs would encourage companies to make the necessary investments in critical minerals recovery and refining facilities amid uncertain and volatile market conditions. Midstream projects like Nyrstar’s gallium and germanium recovery plant are struggling to secure financing in the face of steep competition from Chinese firms that have a history of pricing out Western competitors. Federal tax credit programs signal to the private sector that the government is supportive of the industry and offer an additional cash incentive boost to projects that may otherwise stall. These incentives should apply to both domestic projects as well as ones in strategic allied countries that have high potential for gallium and germanium production, such as Australia and Peru.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;An incentives package should also include grant funding similar to the large dollar amounts currently being awarded by the CHIPS Program Office within the Department of Commerce for onshoring semiconductor fabs. The U.S. government can incentivize mining companies to make significant investments in gallium and germanium recovery and refining facilities and infrastructure by alleviating some of the capital burden. Just as semiconductor manufacturing facilities require an immense amount of capital, standing up domestic gallium and germanium mining, processing, and refining infrastructure will require massive investment. These projects are not only essential to boosting supply chain security for the high-tech industries downstream that depend on critical minerals, but they will also create jobs, onshore manufacturing capacity and niche skills, and help revitalize mining communities that have been economically left behind.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The success of the Western semiconductor industry depends on reliable access to the critical minerals that are responsible for continuous advancements in the industry. The CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 sought to build a domestic ecosystem for a thriving semiconductor industry that is invulnerable to the supply chain risks of the past. But this strategy was incomplete, as there has been no U.S. policy to date addressing the mineral needs of chips manufacturers. As China imposes mineral export restrictions and squeezes supply, policymakers can no longer afford to overlook mineral security. A comprehensive incentives package is needed to build research and development institutions and boost the upstream and midstream capacity needed to onshore and friend-shore gallium and germanium production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mineral Needs for the Defense Industrial Base&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;matthew-d-zolnowski&quot;&gt;Matthew D. Zolnowski&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The defense industrial base is at risk of critical minerals shortages in an emergency, with industrial mobilization doctrine and program execution mired in a peace dividend posture.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the furthest upstream tier of defense supply chains, critical minerals support virtually all Department of Defense (DOD) activities and platforms, whether through indirect consumption, such as a rare earth catalyst for petroleum refining, or direct consumption, such as aluminum and titanium parts in an aircraft. In some cases, the critical minerals supporting a defense system are indistinguishable from those used in civilian products; in others, critical minerals are converted into military-unique formulations that enable a weapon system’s cutting-edge performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this critical minerals consumption pattern is a constant for all military organizations throughout human history—whether using bombs and bullets, shot and pike, or sling and stone. Therefore, incorporation into a weapon system is not, by itself, sufficient reason for critical minerals to be deemed essential to national defense. This type of usage certainly would not justify the DOD’s deployment of over $1 billion since 2019 under the Defense Production Act (DPA) of 1950 and other authorities to expand domestic and allied production of critical minerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this contradiction in mind, this chapter aims to describe the process by which the DOD determines whether a critical mineral rises to the level of a national defense requirement, as well as how the DOD and industry are addressing such needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its simplest form, the DOD’s assessment of the “criticality” of a critical mineral is directly connected to the National Defense Strategy and its policy assumptions about the conflicts in which the DOD may be called to fight. Though defense planners historically focused on protracted conflict, the DOD has drifted toward a more optimistic policy baseline: a single-year conflict followed by a multiyear reconstitution period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even under this more optimistic baseline, the DOD has identified significant supply deficits to defense requirements during a national emergency scenario, covering 69 materials and valued at $2.41 billion. In addition to the large-scale industry investments previously noted, these findings have prompted the DOD to embark on wide-ranging reforms to its critical minerals stockpiling law, as well as to tighten procurement restrictions to reduce reliance on adversarial nations for critical minerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the DOD has made significant strides in modernizing statutory authorities and deploying an array of programs to address its critical minerals needs, many of its planning processes related to requirements generation and industrial mobilization remain rooted in the immediate post–Cold War period. Maintaining the positive progress to date, while reviewing and updating those policies and programs that have not kept pace, should be the DOD’s next area of focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-spectrum-of-military-activities-requirements-generation&quot;&gt;THE SPECTRUM OF MILITARY ACTIVITIES REQUIREMENTS GENERATION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spectrum of activities undertaken by the U.S. Armed Forces is vast. They conduct military-to-military diplomacy, peacekeeping operations, and potential combat operations, ranging from raids by special operations forces to the deployment of a multinational force for large-scale conventional war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid this extreme variability, the DOD has developed a structured process to collect critical minerals data and evaluate which minerals are necessary for both essential civilian and defense industries across a range of scenarios. The DOD has made no public report of its critical minerals needs since 2015, but the results of its assessments are disseminated across the U.S. government every two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a high level, this process begins with the collection of economic and technical data related to critical minerals markets. This data is integrated by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Strategic Materials, the administrator of the National Defense Stockpile (NDS), for analysis through a series of economic models. These models project the anticipated supply and demand of critical minerals over a given period, after which supply and demand are perturbed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These perturbations are driven by policy judgments related to the execution of a military conflict scenario used for DOD budgetary and planning purposes—underpinned by the National Defense Strategy. The elements described in this scenario include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the duration of the conflict&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the military force deployed&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;combat losses&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;military, industrial, and essential civilian demand&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;shipping losses&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the availability of foreign supply&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;domestic industrial mobilization&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;civilian austerity measures&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these elements is highly subjective, and historically these parameters have been hotly debated between defense planners concerned about a protracted war and those who expect conventional wars involving the U.S. Armed Forces to end quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its Cold War iteration, advocates of a “short war” planning construct argued that a potential conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union would be extraordinarily violent in its initial phases or might rapidly escalate to the nuclear level. In its contemporary iteration, advocates note the overwhelming conventional advantage of the U.S. Armed Forces over most threats—ably demonstrated in the First Gulf War—suggesting conflicts involving U.S. conventional forces are likely to be very short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In either case, industrial preparedness and stockpiling of any kind would be unnecessary, as the conflict may end before these efforts could impact its outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the legacy “long war” proponents argue that an asymmetry of conventional military power is an unreliable indicator of conflict duration—ably demonstrated by multi-decade counterinsurgency campaigns—and that an industrial base specialized toward a small, highly sophisticated fighting force will struggle to grow in a protracted conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the “long war” argument, important factors such as where and how U.S. Armed Forces may fight remain highly uncertain. Ultimately, this uncertainty drives hedging behavior, using stockpiles to mitigate demand for conflict surge items or minerals until new wartime production can come online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the initial promulgation of the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act, the combination of World War II and Korean War experiences led U.S. government planners to favor a “long war” planning construct. A five-year war scenario drove the creation of large NDS inventories and broad industrial mobilization activities under the DPA. As the Cold War progressed, subsequent administrations embraced more optimistic war-planning and economic policy judgments, each driving the U.S. government toward smaller critical minerals stockpiles and industrial preparedness efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “short war” planning construct adopted at the end of the Cold War remains the DOD’s baseline for critical minerals requirements generation today—a one-year conflict, followed by three years to reconstitute the U.S. Armed Forces. Based on these results, the DOD has implemented an array of critical minerals mitigation programs, principally focused on aerospace, operational energy, and armor needs (see Table 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notwithstanding the breadth of critical minerals mitigation programs underway, the unclassified summary of the “base case” results from the Strategic and Critical Materials 2023 Report on Stockpile Requirements identifies ongoing critical minerals requirements in a national emergency. This recent DOD study identified shortfalls to defense requirements for 69 materials, valued at $2.41 billion, and shortfalls to essential civilian demand for 24 materials, valued at approximately $12.21 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More simply, these results suggest that substantial portions of the DOD’s “short war” critical minerals needs remain unaddressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;government-and-industry-mitigation-tools&quot;&gt;GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY MITIGATION TOOLS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the massive gap between current industrial base capabilities and postulated DOD requirements, the DOD pulls multiple levers to address day-to-day and future planning for critical minerals supply chain risk mitigation. Many of these levers are described in Joint Publication 4-05: Joint Mobilization Planning (JP 4-05), and in its most recent iteration, the principal industrial mobilization tools listed by the DOD include the following lines of effort:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;actively employ DPA Title I to prioritize DOD contracts or allocate scarce materials to defense contracts&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;expand military production and supporting sectors (e.g., workforce development)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;draw upon Canadian industrial capacity to supplement U.S. production&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;obtain other allied weapons production support&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;obtain waivers or exemptions from U.S. environmental laws to facilitate the above&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, just as planning assumptions for NDS functions have remained on autopilot since the end of the Cold War, the industrial base mitigation tool kit—and the DOD doctrine governing it—has remained largely unchanged. More specifically, JP 4-05 is almost word-for-word identical from 1995 to the present, and shortcomings in doctrine and practice have yet to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;contracting&quot;&gt;Contracting&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DPA Title I requires a U.S. company, and any of its suppliers, to prioritize fulfilling a DOD order over any commercial one. The DOD estimates that it issues approximately 300,000 DPA Title I-rated contracts annually. The DOD can also request that DPA Title I ratings be applied to foreign sources, contingent upon local laws and the execution of a “Security of Supply Agreement” with the host government. Theoretically, the flowdown of DPA Title I ratings throughout the supply chain should provide the DOD with both traceability and the first “call” on any critical minerals necessary for defense procurement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the “paper” strength of DPA Title I, this authority has significant limitations in practice, all of which would hamper the DOD’s ability to direct critical minerals supplies to national needs in an emergency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, DPA Title I ratings only apply to U.S. companies and, by request, select U.S. allies. Any nation outside this circle—an adversary or otherwise—is under no obligation to support the DOD’s needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As indicated by the volume of DPA Title I ratings, contracting and the incorporation of critical minerals sourcing requirements into such contracts is the most common tool for managing supply chain risk. Two of the most well-known critical minerals sourcing regulations are (1) the “specialty metals clause,” the colloquialism for a 1973 rule requiring the purchase of aerospace alloys and steel from U.S. or allied sources, and (2) the “sensitive materials rule,” a 2019 rule that prohibits the purchase of refractory metals and rare earth permanent magnets from China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, defense contractors have been at odds with the metals and mining sector over these procurement rules. Broadly, the domestic metals and mining sector tends to favor rules that may drive defense spending toward their facilities, which may be more costly than foreign ones. Defense contractors, on the other hand, tend to oppose rules that may complicate subcontract management and compliance costs. Particularly when a subcontractor principally serves the commercial market, DOD-unique critical minerals sourcing rules may deter participation in defense contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever Congress has required the DOD to implement a new critical minerals sourcing rule, the timeline for implementation has been lengthy and subject to intense advocacy campaigns. For example, reaching a final rule on the “specialty metals clause” was the subject of ongoing regulatory and legislative advocacy for almost a decade. A similar battle is currently underway over the “sensitive materials rule.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two rules—the “specialty metals clause” and the “sensitive materials rule”—also highlight the well-intentioned but often inefficient promulgation of new critical minerals sourcing mandates. For example, samarium-cobalt permanent magnets are covered under both the “specialty metals clause” and the “sensitive materials rule,” but since the DOD’s implementation of the newer “sensitive materials rule” is executed on a contract-by-contract basis, ensuring contract compliance is highly complex and costly. Similarly, recycling is an important source of domestic production of critical minerals, but under the “sensitive materials rule,” only one of the four covered critical minerals may utilize domestic recycled feedstock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;stockpiling&quot;&gt;Stockpiling&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, stockpiling is hardly mentioned in JP 4-05. The limited references include one-off statements that (1) DPA Title I can compel delivery to stockpile contracts; (2) stockpiles should exist; (3) stockpiles should be released once mobilization begins; and (4) stockpiles should be rebuilt once the mobilization period ends. No other analysis or discussion of stockpile planning or management appears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though this brevity is refreshing, it also highlights a significant gap between DOD doctrine and NDS planning. As previously noted, NDS planning is driven by a short-war requirement, plus a long-term reconstitution phase. However, DOD doctrine calls for rapid in-crisis stockpile releases, with an indeterminate reconstitution phase. Put another way, the NDS stockpile sizing construct focuses on replacement once the fight is over, while Joint Staff doctrine wants to buy time during the emergency until other industrial base expansion programs come online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the requirements generation process for stockpiling and overall doctrine have remained static, the underlying Stockpiling Act has not. The DOD requested significant reforms to this law for the FY 2023 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), and Congress has proceeded to implement these changes across the FY 2023 and FY 2024 NDAAs. Among other elements, this reform aims to infuse private sector best practices into stockpile management while removing statutory barriers to more efficient government operations by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;consolidating multiple DOD critical minerals policy oversight boards into a new “Strategic and Critical Materials Board of Directors”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;authorizing multiyear procurements and general acquisition of shortfall materials&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;authorizing off-take agreements from DPA Title III industrial base investment projects&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;supporting feasibility studies for new critical minerals projects&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;expanding the scope of potential NDS research project applicants to include U.S. allies&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to these changes, the Stockpiling Act had remained largely untouched since 1979, and the DOD is only beginning to implement many of these reforms. On the other hand, though the NDS is authorized to carry out these new functions, new funding has slowed to a trickle. After a significant one-time appropriation of $125.0 million in FY 2022 and $93.5 million in FY 2023, FY 2024 funding collapsed to only $7.6 million. These funding increments are wholly insufficient to meet the shortfall requirements for defense ($2.41 billion) and essential civilian needs ($12.21 billion) in a national emergency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;industrial-base-investment-programs&quot;&gt;Industrial Base Investment Programs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pivoting to industrial base investment, the DOD offers an array of programs to foster the development of new critical minerals production technologies, sources of supply, and end use items for the military services. Among these are Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) programs, basic research and qualification projects funded by the NDS, pilot or prototype demonstration projects funded by the Industrial Base Fund (i.e., the Innovation Capability and Modernization (ICAM) program), feasibility or commercial scaling projects funded by the Defense Production Act Fund, and various military service–specific organic industrial base funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, industry has expressed its frustration with the DOD’s inability to bridge the “Valley of Death,” where the DOD supports early-stage development of an innovative technology or product but cannot transition it to procurement by a program of record. This frustration has also been directed toward the aforementioned industrial base investment programs. However, the DOD has several recent case studies in the critical minerals sector that provide reason for optimism, with multiple companies successfully transitioning from early-stage research to commercial-scale production with or through the DOD (see Table 2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In alignment with JP 4-05, the DOD also has awarded defense industrial base investment funds to Canadian companies, who have been considered a “domestic source” since 1992. Additionally, Congress amended the DPA to expand the scope of eligible foreign allies to include the United Kingdom and Australia. Though a handful of Canadian firms have received DPA Title III awards, the legislative change for the United Kingdom and Australia is sufficiently recent that no such companies have received a DPA Title III award to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Whs2z2V.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 2: Critical Minerals Transition Programs.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Author’s analysis of awards posted at FPDS-NG and USASpending.gov and press releases by the DOD and company awardees.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notwithstanding this apparent success in supporting critical minerals development through the Trump and Biden administrations, 70 percent of DOD funding for critical minerals projects—$778 million of $1.1 billion—has been derived from supplemental appropriations. In other words, Congress is the principal driver behind the DOD’s investments in critical minerals, not the DOD’s bottom-up requirements generation and budgetary process. To that end, recent DOD budget requests suggest that critical minerals investment funding will fall to approximately $30 million per year. Based on recent DPA Title III awards for critical minerals, this level of funding is sufficient to execute perhaps one or two “feasibility study” projects per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;waivers-or-expediency-under-other-domestic-laws&quot;&gt;Waivers or Expediency Under Other Domestic Laws&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With respect to other authorities to waive domestic laws or otherwise expedite critical minerals projects, the DOD does not appear to have pursued or received authorization under extant pathways for regulatory relief in U.S. environmental laws. These include, for example, national security or paramount interest pathways under the Endangered Species Act and the Clean Air Act. However, additional information on DOD recommendations regarding U.S. environmental laws may be forthcoming through the FY 2025 NDAA. Namely, the U.S. House of Representatives included a requirement for the DOD to report on the impact of the National Environmental Policy Act on the largest defense industrial base projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Environmental regulation aside, the DOD also does not appear to have actively pursued or promoted other nonregulatory pathways to streamline permitting activities for its projects—critical minerals or otherwise. Of note, only two DOD industrial base investment projects are included on the FAST-41 Covered Projects Dashboard: Perpetua Resources’ antimony project in Idaho and South32’s zinc-manganese project in Arizona. Given the limited dataset, it is not possible to determine whether inclusion on the FAST-41 dashboard provides a meaningful benefit to project development or whether other factors—such as a U.S. government award from the DOD or another agency—are more decisive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-1&quot;&gt;RECOMMENDATIONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, the Joint Staff and DOD critical minerals programs need to update their war planning assumptions.&lt;/strong&gt; Senior DOD leadership, civilian and military, has clearly stated that the DOD must begin to prepare for a protracted conflict, but this view has not been reflected in the warfighting scenarios that the NDS uses for requirements generation. Without needed updates to war planning, DOD base budget requests will continue to grossly underestimate critical minerals needs. Therefore, the Joint Staff should develop a war-planning scenario suitable for NDS planning to reflect DOD policy and generate more realistic estimates of defense requirements for critical minerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second, the Joint Staff and DOD industrial investment and stockpiling programs should realign doctrine and program execution.&lt;/strong&gt; The industrial base management sections of the mobilization doctrine generated by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, JP 4-05, have not changed since 1995. The document does not reflect lessons learned from (a) industrial base expansion efforts to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic or provide military assistance to Ukraine, (b) related medical or war reserve inventory distribution challenges, or (c) the management of DPA Title I allocations of scarce materials to the domestic market. Moreover, the objectives established in the current doctrine (i.e., provide in-crisis response) are not matched by the NDS requirements generation process (i.e., provide for reconstitution of forces). Therefore, the Joint Staff and civilian components of the DOD responsible for industrial mobilization should update JP 4-05 or develop new doctrine to reflect how the department is likely to respond to a mobilization event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third, the DOD should stabilize funding for critical minerals in the base budget.&lt;/strong&gt; The DOD has made significant progress in supporting the upstream supply chain across numerous minerals. Though these efforts only began in earnest in 2019, DOD prime contractors and major subcontractors are already integrating new domestic sources into DOD programs of record. However, most of this success is being carried by one-off supplemental appropriations acts, which do not provide predictability to industry or the DOD for investment planning. Therefore, the congressional defense committees should continue to provide discrete program increases or “functional transfers” for critical minerals projects within industrial mobilization programs, such as the Defense Production Act Fund, the Industrial Base Fund, and the National Defense Stockpile Transaction Fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fourth, the DOD should streamline critical minerals sourcing rules.&lt;/strong&gt; Given rising concerns related to the United States’ reliance on adversarial sources, Congress continues to legislate mandates for the DOD to restrict sources of supply for critical minerals and end-use items containing critical minerals. In some cases, the same mineral is covered under multiple sourcing rules simultaneously, with nonsensical exception structures. This constantly shifting regulatory regime places a significant cost burden on all tiers of the defense industrial base, with the compliance burden especially acute at the prime contract level, given that noncompliance occurs many tiers removed from the prime contractor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the DOD’s Office of Defense Pricing, Contracting, and Acquisition Policy should undertake an acquisition reform study focused on critical minerals sourcing. At a minimum, this study should identify the extant Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement rules and their underlying legislation for critical minerals products, describe these rules’ use and exception structures, and then develop a streamlining legislative proposal for Congress. As appropriate, this proposal also should include requests for funding to support the development of military specifications, standards, or other industry-led initiatives to validate sub-tier supplier compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-1&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As explored in this chapter, the central question regarding the “criticality” of a critical mineral to national defense is whether the DOD finds a classified shortfall in defense or essential civilian industry needs in a postulated wartime scenario. However simple that question may be, the answer is highly susceptible to subjective policy judgments, which flow directly from the DOD’s National Defense Strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past seven decades, U.S. defense policy has trended toward a more optimistic appraisal of the availability of foreign sources and the severity of a conflict involving the U.S. Armed Forces. This pendulum is now swinging in the opposite direction, with a greater focus on protracted conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DOD planning and posture are beginning to change for the better, particularly for rare earth elements and battery minerals. However, the preponderance of the DOD’s efforts is funded by out-of-cycle supplemental appropriations acts. Critical minerals have not yet become a mainstay of the department’s base budget, nor has DOD doctrine and program execution materially evolved from its immediate post–Cold War posture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On balance, the DOD and defense industry have notched major accomplishments to secure their supply chain for critical minerals. Fully addressing this challenge, though, is a marathon, not a sprint, and the work of the DOD, Congress, and industry in this realm has only just begun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The single biggest determinant for key minerals such as lithium, graphite, cobalt, nickel, and manganese is consumer demand for EVs themselves.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development of the electric vehicle (EV) industry has been the single biggest driver of critical minerals demand growth—a trend that is expected to continue for years to come. This demand growth has been fueled by government incentives at both the national and subnational levels globally. However, given the inherently international nature of the EV supply chain, U.S. EV manufacturers are concerned about disruptions stemming from rising geopolitical tensions. The EV industry—which has mobilized significant investment and created nearly 100,000 jobs in recent years—will require uninterrupted access to the materials needed to produce batteries and motors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Trump administration takes office, the future of the EV industry is clouded by uncertainty, with serious questions regarding the outlook for existing consumer and production incentives. The proximity of Tesla CEO Elon Musk to U.S. president Donald Trump may influence this decision, but more important will be the rationale for continued support in the context of economic security, strategic competition with China, and U.S. jobs. It is clear that U.S. automakers are already committed to the transition to EVs and hybrid vehicles, having invested billions of dollars over the past four years in building gigafactories across the United States and the rest of North America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uncertainty for the sector also stems from shifts in consumer preferences and interest rates, technological advancements in battery chemistries, and a slower-than-expected expansion of the charging network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the uncertainty currently affecting the EV industry in the United States has a knock-on effect on the global market for critical minerals, particularly regarding U.S. and allied countries’ investments in the critical minerals supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter will examine the drivers of growing demand for EVs, the knock-on effects on demand for critical minerals, and the challenges facing the supply chain. It will also highlight the importance of innovation in the EV battery sector to reduce the industry’s vulnerability to interruptions and shortcomings in the critical minerals supply chain. A combined approach of reducing demand for critical minerals through innovation, boosting domestic supply of those minerals, and working closely with allies to secure U.S. supply chains will provide certainty and stability for the market, protecting U.S. investments, jobs, and competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-importance-of-the-automotive-market-in-the-united-states-and-north-america&quot;&gt;THE IMPORTANCE OF THE AUTOMOTIVE MARKET IN THE UNITED STATES AND NORTH AMERICA&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The auto industry is a cornerstone of North American trade, accounting for 22 percent of total trade under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). It supports a staggering 42.2 million jobs across the region, both directly and indirectly. In the United States, the industry directly employs 9.7 million people and supports an additional 11 million indirect jobs, highlighting its critical role in the nation’s economy. In Mexico, the sector provides 1 million direct jobs and contributes to 20 million indirect positions, underscoring its importance in driving economic development. Canada, while smaller in scale, still benefits significantly, with 500,000 jobs tied to the industry. This interconnected workforce demonstrates the auto sector’s immense economic impact and its role as a vital driver of prosperity across North America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, North America produced approximately 3.6 million EVs, and the industry created over 200,000 direct EV-related jobs across manufacturing, battery production, and infrastructure development. It is important to note that much of this production relies on cross-border, tariff-free trade under the USMCA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;growing-demand&quot;&gt;Growing Demand&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The single biggest determinant of demand for key minerals such as lithium, graphite, cobalt, nickel, and manganese is consumer demand for EVs themselves. This demand has grown substantially in recent years, with EV sales reaching nearly 14 million cars globally in 2023. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that global demand for critical minerals driven by EV production was under 2 million metric tons in 2020 but is projected to exceed 30 million metric tons by 2030, representing approximately 75 percent of the minerals required for clean technology (cleantech). By 2050, EV demand alone is expected to account for over 130 million metric tons, or roughly 90 percent of the total mineral demand for cleantech. However, this growth is mostly concentrated in the United States, Europe, and China—countries where the use of personal vehicles is more common—though EV sales in Southeast Asia and Brazil are picking up speed, largely due to government subsidies and the availability of low-priced Chinese EVs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the United States, major decisions by auto companies to produce more EVs, or even shift to 100 percent EV production, have begun to fundamentally alter the market. General Motors’ 2021 announcement of plans to transition to 100 percent EV production by 2035 marked a watershed moment for the domestic industry. President Joe Biden’s goal of having 50 percent of auto sales be electric by 2030 was another signal to the market that demand will grow significantly. However, the major factor driving the EV market in recent years has been the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IRA, which is discussed in detail in Chapter 6, provided important tax credits for new EV sales. Section 30D of the IRA includes a $7,500 tax credit specifically for light-duty EVs for individuals earning less than $150,000 or families earning less than $300,000. Half of the tax credit is allocated for batteries manufactured with materials mined in the United States or countries with which the United States has a free trade agreement. Notably, materials recycled within North America are also eligible. The percentage of the value of critical minerals mined or processed in these countries will increase from 40 percent in 2023 to 80 percent by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting in 2025, batteries utilizing critical minerals mined or processed by foreign entities of concern (primarily referring to Chinese-owned firms) will not be eligible for the tax credit. The other portion of the EV credit applies to vehicles with batteries manufactured or assembled in North America, with the percentage of components manufactured in the region set to increase over time—from 50 percent in 2023 to 100 percent by 2029. The inclusion of this requirement in the IRA underscores the region’s importance in the auto industry and emphasizes the critical role of regional integration in strengthening the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recent-trends&quot;&gt;Recent Trends&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the passage of the IRA, the United States has seen considerable growth in EV sales, reaching 7.9 percent of total sales in 2023. Driven largely by these incentives, sales of EVs have risen significantly in recent years in the United States. Despite a slow year in 2023, sales of EVs in the United States have rebounded rapidly in 2024. In the third quarter of 2024, EV sales increased by 11 percent year-on-year, while EVs as a share of all automotive sales in Q3 reached 8.9 percent. The EV industry will soon account for a tenth of all auto sales in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, progress has been far from linear. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, sales of hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and battery electric vehicles (BEVs) grew to over 16 percent of total new light-duty vehicle sales in the United States in 2023. In the first part of 2024, however, EV sales declined, with nearly a 1 percent decrease in hybrids, plug-in hybrids, and BEVs sold in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of the previous year. This decrease in demand for EVs in 2023 and 2024 has pushed automakers to rethink their strategies, particularly as hybrid vehicles gain more traction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that sales of EVs have risen significantly in the United States, these figures are disappointing compared to global numbers. In China, BEVs are projected to account for 50 percent of all light vehicle sales by the end of 2024—an impressive total with far-reaching implications for the global oil and critical minerals markets. According to the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, Chinese EV manufacturing is comparable to the entire output of the U.S. auto industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/xev7Yh4.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of EV sales in Europe is less straightforward. After rapid growth in 2021 and 2022, 2023 saw a slowdown in global EV sales due to rising inflation and the end of government subsidies, particularly in Europe. This was most notable in Germany, where sales dropped by 37 percent in July 2024 following the government’s termination of EV subsidies. Registrations for hybrid vehicles in Europe reached 24 percent in July 2024, while EV registrations were just 13.6 percent—nearly a full percentage point lower than during the same time period the previous year. The slowdown in Europe continued throughout the first half of 2024, but EV sales saw an increase in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What these statistics show is that linear development of the EV industry is not guaranteed. Although numbers continue to rise, much work remains to drive consumer demand and ensure the industry’s sustainability in the United States. While long-term growth is expected, it is important for investors and policymakers to understand that progress will involve leaps forward and some steps back before a more widespread shift to EVs occurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-ev-supply-chain&quot;&gt;THE EV SUPPLY CHAIN&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first phase of the EV battery supply chain, often referred to as the upstream portion of the supply chain, is raw mineral extraction. This phase is arguably one of the most important, as it forms the fundamental basis of the EV battery. The list of critical minerals essential for EV battery manufacturing is extensive and includes manganese, graphite (and graphene), lithium, nickel, and cobalt, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The midstream phase of the EV battery supply chain entails the processing and refining of raw materials. This typically requires high-heat or chemical-based treatments to transform the raw materials into what will eventually be cathode and anode active battery materials. Rare earth metals—a group of 17 elements—are used in various clean energy technologies for their “permanent magnetic properties.” In the specific case of EVs, they are primarily used in magnets for EV motors and as catalysts for battery fuel cells. Critical minerals processing tends to be regionally concentrated, and it is more common than not for extraction and refining to occur at separate facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third stage in the EV battery supply chain, the downstream phase, involves assembling battery cells into modules, which include battery management systems, electronics, and sensors. These modules are then packaged and sold to automakers, although some manufacturers produce and install their own battery packs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final process in the EV battery supply chain is reuse and recycling. Reuse entails “disassembly of the pack, testing module/cells, and repackaging.” Pyrometallurgy, hydrometallurgy, and direct recycling are currently the three most viable options for lithium-ion battery recycling, though new technological advances are emerging. Both reuse and recycling are logistically challenging—not only from an economic and regulatory standpoint but also in terms of the basic logistics of transporting the batteries. Moreover, the manufacturer-specific nature of the batteries adds to the cost of recycling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ev-demand-and-the-critical-minerals-supply-chain&quot;&gt;EV DEMAND AND THE CRITICAL MINERALS SUPPLY CHAIN&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is abundantly clear that the shift from traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to EVs will require significantly increased quantities of critical minerals for EV production. Whereas a traditional ICE vehicle uses an estimated 34 kg of critical minerals, an EV uses approximately 200 kg, primarily for the electric motor and battery. However, this is likely to change over time as battery size, battery chemistry, modularity, and consumer preferences continue to change. While larger battery sizes may increase mineral demand, shifts in battery chemistry will impact the mix and proportions of metals required in those batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IEA makes the important point that the percentage of electric sport utility vehicles (SUVs) being sold has a significant impact on the critical minerals supply chain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Larger electric car models have a significant impact on battery supply chains and critical mineral demand. In 2023, the sales-weighted average battery electric SUV in Europe had a battery almost twice as large as the one in the average small electric car, with a proportionate impact on critical mineral needs. . . . If all electric SUVs sold in 2023 had instead been medium-sized cars, around 60 GWh of battery equivalent could have been avoided globally, with limited impact on range. Accounting for the different chemistries used in China, Europe, and the United States, this would be equivalent to almost 6,000 tonnes of lithium, 30,000 tonnes of nickel, almost 7,000 tonnes of cobalt, and over 8,000 tonnes of manganese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the IEA, copper, cobalt, nickel, lithium, rare earth elements, and aluminum are the minerals in highest demand. Demand for these critical minerals is projected to grow fourfold under the IEA’s Sustainable Development Scenario by 2040. However, this projection is subject to three key external factors: evolving technology, the development and implementation of governments’ clean energy policies, and the demand for EVs. All three factors are currently experiencing a high degree of uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two-way connection between the EV market and critical minerals prices is exemplified by the recent collapse in lithium prices, which has impacted the competitiveness of EVs in automotive markets. After peaking at over $79,637 per ton in December 2022—driven by soaring demand for EVs—lithium prices fell to less than $11,000 per ton by September 2024. This decline was caused by several factors, including high interest rates, a weak Chinese economy, and market manipulation. Additionally, new resources coming into production globally and lower-than-expected EV sales following the initial surge in the United States, China, and Europe were significant contributors. Stagnating EV sales in 2023 had a profound and rapid impact on the lithium market. For instance, earlier in 2024, Ganfeng Lithium Group reported a net loss of $107 million and announced plans to limit capacity expansions as a “glut of supply overwhelmed slower-than-expected demand growth from electric-vehicle makers, driving spot carbonate prices to a three-year low.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some experts predict that the current oversupply of lithium will last until 2027. In the interim, there is hope that new extraction—and, more importantly, processing—projects will come into operation around the world, particularly in the United States and U.S.-friendly countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difficulty in estimating demand projections is further exacerbated by governments’ evolving approaches to clean energy policy development and implementation. For example, changes in administrations in the United States and a potential move away from the incentives outlined in the IRA will play a significant role in determining short-term demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other factors influencing future EV demand include local- and state-level incentives and regulations. Just as the IRA’s clean vehicle tax credits boosted demand for EVs after 2022, California’s rapid shift toward an EV-friendly regulatory framework and higher gasoline prices had a similar effect. While California has the best-known incentives, many other states have followed suit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumer financing innovations also have the potential to incentivize higher EV sales and end-of-life recycling. In the United States, the IRA succeeded in driving new financing from auto firms such as Hyundai, whose vehicles were not eligible for IRA tax credits. In response, Hyundai implemented its own financing mechanisms to match the value of these credits. At the industry level, there is room for even greater innovation. For example, a recent paper on the cobalt supply chain proposed a “lease-to-recycle” model for batteries to drive EV adoption and enhance the potential for recycling battery metals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private sector funding for EVs and battery facilities has significantly shaped the industry’s development in the United States. Between 2018 and 2024, the private sector has announced investments of $90 billion in battery facilities and $33 billion in EV facilities. Notably, states with Republican governors have been more successful in securing this funding, with the southern region of the United States receiving over $68 billion in regional investments. In comparison, the Northeast received just $300 million, while the West Coast garnered $13.3 billion—well below the South’s total.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One additional factor influencing the demand for critical minerals for EVs is the buildout of the charging network. Persistent consumer concerns about locating charging stations, charging speeds, and the maintenance and distribution of these stations are often grouped under the term “range anxiety.” However, as EV ranges improve with advances in battery technologies, it may be more accurate to discuss charging convenience. Potential EV buyers in urban areas face unique challenges regarding access to charging infrastructure. For example, availability in their neighborhoods—or, more specifically, in apartment buildings—may be limited. Drivers who lack garages and rely on street parking face even greater concerns about convenience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration’s National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program allocated $7.5 billion to the construction of 30,000 charging ports across the United States, with a particular focus on Alternative Fuel Corridors. These funds are intended to be distributed through state governments. However, as of November 12, 2024, only 102 charging ports at 25 charging stations in nine states had been opened. Several factors have contributed to this slow rollout, but a significant portion of the total funding—around $4 billion—has already been committed to the states. Consequently, the buildout will accelerate over the next few years, as these funds cannot easily be rescinded by the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-role-of-technological-innovation&quot;&gt;THE ROLE OF TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Innovation in battery chemistry and design is likely to play a crucial role in shaping the demand for critical minerals in the EV industry. While the internal combustion engine evolved slowly over the past 150 years, the EV industry is seeing rapid, profound, and unparalleled advances in battery chemistry, design, and efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mineral demand for EV batteries depends on the cathode and anode chemistries of the batteries but is ultimately influenced by evolving technologies that have the potential to alter the mineral composition of EV batteries. For example, an NMC (nickel manganese cobalt oxide) battery uses half as much nickel as an NCA (nickel cobalt aluminum oxide) battery but requires eight times more cobalt. LFP (lithium iron phosphate) batteries, by contrast, require 50 percent more copper than NMC batteries but do not use nickel, cobalt, or manganese. NMC batteries typically last around 2,000 cycles—a battery cycle is the process of a battery being fully charged and then discharged—though their capacity declines significantly after 1,000 cycles. By comparison, LFP batteries are more durable, retaining 80 percent of their capacity after 3,000 cycles. This longer lifespan and more consistent performance over time help to explain the rise of LFP batteries in China, where they now dominate the market, accounting for over 60 percent of current vehicle sales. A similar trend is emerging in the United States and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reduced emphasis on nickel and cobalt not only decreases U.S. exposure to Chinese-controlled extraction and processing. It could also transform the debate over deep sea mining, removing a key justification for the extraction of polymetallic nodules rich in cobalt and nickel from the seafloor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Existing and emerging battery chemistries and technologies that will play a major role in the near future include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Existing Technologies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a. &lt;strong&gt;Lithium-Ion Batteries (Li-ion):&lt;/strong&gt; The current industry standard, Li-ion batteries, offers a balance of energy density, lifespan, and cost. These batteries encompass multiple chemistries, including lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxides (NMC) and lithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxides (NCA). While Li-ion batteries continue to power most EVs on the road today, they are rapidly losing ground to LFP batteries. The continued use of Li-ion batteries sustains high demand for lithium, nickel, and cobalt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b. &lt;strong&gt;Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) Batteries:&lt;/strong&gt; Safer and cheaper than traditional Li-ion chemistries but with lower energy density, LFP batteries are rapidly challenging the status quo in EV sales. A shift to LFP means lower demand for cobalt and nickel, with increased use of more abundant iron and phosphate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Emerging Technologies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a. &lt;strong&gt;Solid-State Batteries:&lt;/strong&gt; These batteries, though still in development, promise higher energy density and improved safety by replacing liquid electrolytes with solid materials. The development of solid-state technology will reduce the need for cobalt and nickel but continue reliance on lithium and possibly new solid electrolytes, like lithium metal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b. &lt;strong&gt;Graphene-Based Batteries:&lt;/strong&gt; A technology still in development, graphene batteries involve the integration of graphene into the cathode and anode to significantly improve energy density, charging speeds, and battery life. Often considered a “wonder material” due to its lightweight nature and superior performance in various applications, graphene’s high conductivity allows for faster charge transfer, and its durability supports longer-lasting batteries, making it a promising material for future EV battery advancements. A shift to this technology would increase demand for graphite and graphene, the latter being essentially the building block for graphite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;c. &lt;strong&gt;Sodium-Ion (Na+) Batteries:&lt;/strong&gt; An emerging alternative to Li-ion batteries, Na+ batteries use sodium instead of lithium as the primary charge carrier. They can be cheaper and more sustainable than lithium (due to the natural abundance of sodium), but they have lower energy density. Na+ batteries have potential applications in stationary energy storage and some EVs. Growth in their use would reduce dependence on lithium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;d. &lt;strong&gt;Lithium-Sulfur (Li-S) Batteries:&lt;/strong&gt; This emerging subset of lithium-ion chemistries has the potential for very high energy density but faces issues with durability and lifespan. Li-S batteries have a higher energy density than traditional Li-ion batteries and rely on sulfur, which is abundant and inexpensive, instead of nickel and cobalt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Battery design is also an important factor. Currently, EV batteries are relatively standardized across the industry. However, experts anticipate that future developments will introduce modular designs, enabling customers to tailor their batteries to meet specific needs, such as prioritizing extended range or enhanced performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-recommendations&quot;&gt;POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The return of the Trump administration is expected to bring major changes to U.S. EV policies, potentially undoing or slowing down key Biden-era efforts. Trump has expressed skepticism toward EVs and may push to roll back regulations and eliminate the $7,500 federal tax credit for EV buyers. Such moves could create hurdles for automakers and dampen consumer interest in EVs, raising concerns across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funding for EV infrastructure, including nationwide charging stations, may also face cuts or redirection, while emissions standards could be relaxed. Despite these federal policy shifts, states like California are expected to continue pursuing aggressive climate and EV initiatives. This may lead to legal battles reminiscent of previous conflicts over state versus federal authority on environmental regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three key recommendations are proposed to address the challenges posed by potential policy shifts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize investing in innovation.&lt;/strong&gt; This can be done through two avenues. First, the Department of Energy should fund research into battery technologies that use smaller quantities of critical materials, explore applications for more abundant resources (such as sodium and graphene), and reduce both costs and dependency on foreign suppliers. If U.S. innovation can be harnessed effectively to reduce the vulnerabilities of the EV battery supply chain, jobs, investments, and U.S. competitiveness can be protected and promoted. Second, the government should fund innovation to strengthen the circular economy. The United States needs to advance recycling technologies and policies to maximize resource efficiency and minimize waste in battery production and use. Battery metals that have already been processed to the point where they can be used in batteries require less processing when recycled than newly extracted metals. The Department of Energy must continue to fund research into battery design to enhance the potential for recycling battery metals.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use tariffs judiciously and promote stable tariff policies.&lt;/strong&gt; In November 2024, Trump announced that his administration would impose a 25 percent tariff on all goods entering the United States from Mexico and Canada (and an additional 10 percent on goods entering from China). This would be highly disruptive for the auto industry, which has a deeply integrated mine-to-market supply chain in North America, given that mining, processing, and manufacturing occur across the continent. For example, Canada is the biggest supplier of nickel alloys that are vital for EVs. The United States has only one operating nickel mine—Lundin’s Eagle Mine in Northern Michigan. However, since the United States does not have a single completed nickel refinery, the entirety of nickel output from Lundin’s Eagle Mine is exported to a refinery in Sudbury, Canada, and the refined ore is then sold back to U.S. firms for manufacturing. Given the importance of the automotive sector to the United States, the Trump administration should minimize tariffs with allied nations. Importantly, policies also need to be stable—when mining, processing, and manufacturing firms lack certainty, they are more likely to withhold investment in the supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expand production tax credits for all domestically manufactured vehicles.&lt;/strong&gt; The IRA has shown that industrial policy can drive huge levels of investment and meaningful job growth. It is time for the U.S. government to provide such support for the entire U.S. auto industry, privileging U.S. and North American content in ways that help the industry compete against Chinese competition, both domestically and abroad. IRA credits for EV production have driven hundreds of billions of dollars in investment in the United States—across traditionally red and blue states. Providing similar support for the entire auto industry would likely drive investment from U.S. and foreign auto manufacturers and bring manufacturing job growth to the United States. However, it is important to note that the EV industry warrants larger production tax credits due to its more nascent technology, as well as that Chinese EVs have become dominant in many overseas markets. Production tax credits will allow the U.S. EV industry to develop and achieve a larger global footprint.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-2&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s EV critical minerals supply chains are based on yesterday’s estimated demand for existing battery chemistries, and as this chapter has shown, there is a rapid evolution in battery technologies underway. Whereas the internal combustion engine remained largely unchanged throughout most of its existence, battery technology is progressing at a breakneck pace. Impressive innovation already underway in the EV battery industry will continue to shift critical minerals demand, and that necessitates a more liberal approach to the U.S. supply chain strategy. The United States must take advantage of its incentive-based system that prioritizes public-private cooperation to foster innovation and not only match Chinese advances but actually surpass them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Role of Critical Minerals in Renewable Energy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The renewable energy sector is increasingly central to both economic growth and national security, making [such] supply chain vulnerabilities untenable.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a niche source of electricity generation, renewables are rapidly increasing their share in the global power system. Led by solar, investments in renewable energy compromise more than 90 percent of power sector investment. Renewable sources accounted for 30 percent of total global power generation in 2023 and have been growing faster than the power sector overall. This has been driven in part by a decline in costs: Between 2009 and 2019, the price of wind power dropped by 70 percent and solar by 89 percent, making both technologies competitive with other new sources of electricity and an attractive economic option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the United States, renewables are already a significant contributor to the grid and have a promising outlook. With the exception of hydropower, renewable sources contributed 15.7 percent of U.S. power generation in 2023, with wind providing 10.2 percent and solar 3.9 percent. The tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) are further improving the outlook for both deployment and domestic manufacturing of renewables components. Projections suggest that by 2050, wind and solar could supply anywhere from 44 to 85 percent of U.S. power generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such rapid growth in renewables, however, brings its own set of challenges. Building renewable energy infrastructure, especially wind turbines and solar photovoltaic (PV) panels, requires substantial inputs of both common materials such as concrete, steel, and aluminum and specialized minerals such as cobalt, tellurium, and rare earth elements (REEs). Wind projects incorporate 18 of the 50 critical minerals identified by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in its 2022 Critical Minerals Assessment, while solar projects require 15 of them. As demand for renewables grows, so too will demand for those critical inputs. And as manufacturing of solar PV and wind turbine components is reshored, the economic stakes of supply disruptions to critical minerals will increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The renewable energy sector is increasingly central to both economic growth and national security, making such supply chain vulnerabilities untenable. To secure the future of renewable energy and meet ambitious climate targets, U.S. policymakers should address these vulnerabilities as part of a comprehensive approach to building a larger and more diversified supply chain for clean energy. This chapter focuses on two materials that already have the attention of policymakers and are key to deploying the most used technologies: REEs for wind turbines and polysilicon for solar PV. As such, they are also key to U.S. goals related to derisking supply chains, ensuring economic security, and furnishing the energy transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;material-needs&quot;&gt;MATERIAL NEEDS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that global demand for minerals used in wind and solar PV could increase by a factor of about three in scenarios involving rapid emissions reductions by 2040. As a challenge for markets and policymakers to meet, this one appears “manageable.” By comparison, the demand for battery minerals is expected to grow more dramatically, with EVs and grid-scale batteries driving up demand for lithium by over 40 times today’s production levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is in line with other global assessments from academic literature, which suggests that achieving ambitious climate targets through renewables deployment will require significant increases in key minerals. Stringent climate policies could triple the demand for certain REEs used in wind turbines, while the demand for polysilicon in solar PV could more than double. Though such rapid growth would surpass historical trends, global reserves are expected to be sufficient to meet cumulative demand, especially as recycling of older turbines and solar PV cells becomes economical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China holds a dominant role as a producer, refiner, and processor of both REEs and polysilicon. These materials have already faced export controls and tariffs, as well as prohibitions on imports into the United States under the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. These disruptions—and their economic and social consequences—are motivating U.S. efforts to secure stronger supply chains of these materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;wind&quot;&gt;Wind&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past 10 years, the United States has installed an average of 10 gigawatts (GW) of wind capacity per year, resulting in nearly 150 GW of total installed wind capacity by the end of 2024. Energy modeling suggests that with the renewable tax credits from the IRA, wind capacity deployments could increase to 15 or 20 GW per year, which would double mineral demand over the next decade. However, in its assessment of the material requirements for renewables, the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) projected that achieving ambitious climate targets could require wind capacity deployment of up to 90 GW per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As wind energy deployment grows, the demand for minerals increases proportionally for each input—with REEs standing out as a particular area of vulnerability. These elements are key to the efficient and lightweight permanent magnets that allow for large wind turbines. The U.S. wind industry already consumes a small fraction of global production (see Table 1), and further expansion would require a substantial portion of today’s global output. The huge relative share of global production that will be required to serve U.S. demand alone indicates there is significant transition risk associated with REE supply, a judgment echoed in the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)’s 2023 Critical Minerals Assessment. Expanded wind deployment globally will require much higher production of REEs, with the IEA estimating that ambitious climate targets would require REE production to increase by up to a factor of 7 by 2040.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to future availability, supply concentration is a particular concern for REEs. China accounts for about 60 percent of REE extraction, 85 percent of processing, and over 90 percent of permanent magnet production. Its dominant role in refining and processing is particularly important. The United States is the second-largest producer of REEs globally, behind China, but U.S.-produced rare earths have historically been sent to China for processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The critical mineral supply chain for wind power, particularly when it comes to REEs, is vulnerable and potentially problematic. Given the importance of REEs and permanent magnets throughout the economy, they are already being addressed by policymakers. The United States is home to one major rare earth mine, the Mountain Pass Rare Earth Mine and Processing Facility in California. In 2023, its operator, MP Materials, announced plans to recommission processing facilities at the site to separate and refine high-purity neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr) oxide, essential in permanent magnets. The DOE is also supporting an MP Materials facility in Texas that will produce rare earth magnets. Additional investments are being made to establish REE processing in the United States. Australian company Lynas Rare Earths, with support from the U.S. Department of Defense, is constructing a facility in Hondo, Texas, that will process both light and heavy REEs supplied by mines in Australia. These efforts are designed to create a full supply chain for REEs that can meet some of U.S. demand and diversify away from China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1: Availability of Vulnerable Wind Materials Needed to Satisfy Annual U.S. Wind Deployment.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/82830.pdf&quot;&gt;Aubryn Cooperman et al., Renewable Energy Materials Properties Database: Summary (Golden, CO: National Renewable Energy Laboratory, 2023), 20–21&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;solar&quot;&gt;Solar&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, the United States has added over 100 GW of solar PV capacity, culminating in 131 GW of installed capacity by the end of 2024. Unlike the relatively steady growth of wind power, solar deployment has been accelerating. Projects planned and under construction are expected to increase solar capacity by 38 percent between 2023 and 2024 alone. Looking ahead, forecast models suggest IRA incentives could help grow solar capacity by 30 to 60 GW per year by 2035. Similarly, the DOE has projected high-end deployment rates of nearly 70 GW per year through 2035, tapering to 50 GW per year by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In high-deployment scenarios for solar, the DOE found that while demand would increase for materials such as silver, silicon, and aluminum, these increases would be moderate compared to today’s production and rising global demand. In the case of silicon, the maximum consumption estimate for 2030 is 157,000 tons per year, which remains small compared to today’s annual production of 8 million tons. Overall, by 2030, rapid solar deployment in the United States is projected to account for about 0.6 percent of current global demand for aluminum, 2.0 percent for silicon, and 3.7 percent for silver. Despite the diverse material requirements, the quantities needed for U.S. solar power make it relatively safe from supply limitations even in high-use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although silicon is abundant, solar PV systems require silicon products that are purified and refined. Most solar PV modules currently being deployed use crystalline silicon (c-Si) cells, which use polysilicon as a key input. Polysilicon is essential for the semiconducting properties that convert sunlight into energy and is less costly than monocrystalline silicon. Solar-grade polysilicon must be of very high purity and thus requires refining and processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China dominates solar-grade polysilicon production, accounting for 85 percent of global manufacturing capacity. A significant portion of that capacity is located in Xinjiang Province, raising concerns about the potential use of forced labor in the solar supply chain. Additionally, the environmental impact of Chinese solar manufacturing is notable, as reliance on a coal-heavy grid results in Chinese polysilicon having higher emissions. More broadly, the high concentration of supply in China raises concerns about supply chain dependence for U.S. manufacturers of downstream products, including solar cells and modules. A recent study found that reshoring PV manufacturing to the United States would decrease the sector’s emissions intensity by 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In pursuit of supply diversification, tax credits and trade restrictions on Chinese products could incentivize the relocation of polysilicon manufacturing to the United States. The DOE is tracking 69,000 tons per year of U.S. polysilicon production capacity, which compares favorably to the 157,000 tons per year by 2030 in a high-solar-deployment scenario. This capacity currently stems from three facilities that have been reopened or expanded in recent years: Hemlock Semiconductor, REC Silicon, and Wacker Polysilicon North America. Michigan-based Hemlock Semiconductor, for example, announced an expansion in 2022, and REC Silicon is reopening a formerly shuttered manufacturing facility in Moses Lake, Washington. In addition, the DOE allocated funds in April 2024 to support Tennessee-based Highland Materials for a manufacturing plant that will produce 16,000 tons of solar-grade polysilicon. These projects are being enabled by the IRA’s 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit, under which companies can claim $3 per kilogram for manufacturing solar-grade polysilicon, as well as additional credits for manufacturing PV wafers, cells, and modules, as well as other solar-related components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-2&quot;&gt;RECOMMENDATIONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specific policy interventions have enabled the progress that U.S. industry has made in securing supply chains for REEs and polysilicon. But the job is not yet complete, and projects are still coming online. Looking forward, these programs will have to be evaluated on their ability to foster commercially viable projects that participate meaningfully in the supply chain for an expanding renewables industry. Commercial competition, especially from Chinese firms, will be intense. Policy interventions will be successful when they help build a resilient supply chain for the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The DOE and other agencies should seek opportunities to coordinate different policy tools to develop integrated supply chains.&lt;/strong&gt; For REEs, the key will be to develop expertise and technology that can refine and process these minerals for multiple uses and incorporate them into permanent magnets. This will help the United States take advantage of its domestic production and bring part of the supply chain out of China. Additional projects can take advantage of the IRA’s 48C tax credits and support from the DOE’s Loan Program Office, which can fund critical mineral projects at all stages of production: extraction, processing, manufacturing, and recycling.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Policymakers should cooperate with allies such as Australia and Canada in securing REEs.&lt;/strong&gt; Expanding collaboration through the Minerals Security Partnership or bilateral trade agreements could help source additional REEs for processing or manufacturing in the United States. In particular, expanding the Defense Productions Act’s definition of “domestic source” to include Australia would grant mining and processing facilities in that mineral-rich country access to direct support and procurement authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polysilicon projects under development should be fostered and linked to higher levels of the solar supply chain.&lt;/strong&gt; This will likely happen with support from the 45X tax credit, which applies to various stages of the solar manufacturing chain, including production of wafers, cells, and modules. Polysilicon projects at these stages can be encouraged to take advantage of domestic resources; wafer and cell manufacturing facilities in particular should be supported via the clean manufacturing tax credits and other programs to encourage local demand. Revising domestic content requirements for solar tax credits to reflect the upstream portions of the supply chain would further incentivize domestic polysilicon. Such integrated industry is key to building ecosystems of innovation that reduce cost and build resilient supplies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The new administration should address the role that tariffs and trade restrictions on Chinese products and firms will play in its strategy for securing supply chains.&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to enforcing trade restrictions on Chinese polysilicon, the Biden administration is increasing tariffs on rare earth magnets and Chinese-produced solar cells to defend domestic producers. In addition, there are multiple congressional proposals to exclude Chinese-sourced technology and minerals from U.S. tax credits.173 Such restrictions should be designed to address unfair trade practices, the high carbon intensity of Chinese production, and human rights but should not contribute to trade tensions through unfair protectionism. Moreover, fully excluding Chinese firms or technology—which could still be brought into the United States through joint ventures or licensing—would hamper efforts to establish resilient supply chains in a cost-effective way.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-3&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States is experiencing significant growth in renewables deployment, supported by climate policy and increasingly good economic outlooks for wind and solar power. While concerns over mineral supply constraints are warranted, they appear manageable in the case of the increased demand expected from renewables (though certain REEs will need attention). By contrast, concerns over China’s dominance in the production and processing of REEs, other critical minerals, and polysilicon are well founded. Investments in domestic production, refining, and recycling should help mitigate the risks of supply disruptions and reduce dependence on foreign sources, setting the stage for long-term energy security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Supply chain shifts and industrial transitions take time, but with the right adjustments, IRA incentives have the potential to catalyze shifts in mineral supply chains that may change the entire security landscape.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, the Biden administration’s flagship piece of legislation, aims to address climate change by boosting U.S. manufacturing of clean energy technologies such as electric vehicles (EVs), solar panels, and wind turbines, as well as their components—including critical minerals. The Biden administration has set ambitious targets of cutting all carbon emissions from the transportation sector and achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. To help meet these goals, the IRA was enacted to rapidly accelerate the development and uptake of EVs, as well as renewable energy projects, to decarbonize the electrical grid. All of these technologies are highly minerals intensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IRA was a politically contentious piece of legislation at the time of its passage, garnering exclusively Democratic support—not a single Republican in the House or Senate voted for the bill. However, that has not stopped Republican-led states from benefitting from the incoming investment, jobs, and technical skills spurred by the legislation. As of August 2024, nearly 85 percent of the total $126 billion in investments and 68 percent of the 150,000 newly created jobs have flowed to Republican districts. Ohio, North Carolina, and Georgia have been major recipients of IRA-induced projects, which may signal the beginning of a manufacturing renaissance accompanying the clean energy transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bill’s provisions of tax credits, grants, and loan guarantees have led to a boom in domestic clean energy projects, catalyzing investment from abroad into U.S. manufacturing of EV batteries and solar cells. As these projects take off, the demand for critical minerals such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel is projected to rise. Securing supply chains for minerals like lithium, nickel, cobalt, graphite, and rare earth elements (REEs) is not only a goal of the IRA but also vital to the success of the law’s broader decarbonization objectives. The Biden administration has repeatedly emphasized the importance of securing critical minerals through the IRA. However, the implementation of the IRA’s provisions has been insufficient to fully address the needs of critical minerals supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand the IRA’s impact on critical minerals security, this chapter describes each relevant provision and assesses its strengths and weaknesses. The IRA is then evaluated on its success in achieving its intended goals: accelerating decarbonization, boosting domestic manufacturing, and ensuring the security of critical minerals supply chains independent of adversaries. Analyzing the IRA provides valuable insights that can be applied to the mineral supply chains of other industries, including energy technologies, semiconductors, defense applications, and the industries that drive the modern economy. Landmark legislation like the IRA has the potential to make or break U.S. critical minerals security goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-portions-of-the-inflation-reduction-act-address-critical-minerals&quot;&gt;WHAT PORTIONS OF THE INFLATION REDUCTION ACT ADDRESS CRITICAL MINERALS?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IRA creates or expands the following incentives that apply to the critical minerals industry: Section 30D New Clean Vehicle Credit, Section 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit, Section 48C Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Credit, additional capital for the Defense Production Act Title III, and the programs of the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;section-30d-new-clean-vehicle-credit&quot;&gt;Section 30D New Clean Vehicle Credit&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Section 30D of the IRA incentivizes the procurement of minerals for battery manufacturing from allied sources by providing up to $7,500 in tax credits for qualifying EV purchases. This provision is key to increasing affordability and deploying EVs at scale. To be eligible, vehicle manufacturers must meet several criteria, including sourcing requirements for critical minerals and components. The Department of the Treasury ruled that EVs will only be eligible for $3,750 of the credit if they meet specific thresholds for the critical mineral content of their batteries. As of 2024, 50 percent of the minerals in an eligible vehicle must be extracted and processed in the United States, a country with which the United States has a free trade agreement (FTA), or Japan, which is the sole beneficiary of a critical minerals agreement (CMA). This threshold increases annually, reaching 80 percent by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/q3Fz8mS.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Free Trade Agreement Countries.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To receive the tax credit, vehicles must also comply with the foreign entity of concern (FEOC) rules. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law defines an FEOC as any entity “owned by, controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of a government of a foreign country that is a covered nation.” There are four FEOCs: China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea. The Department of Energy further clarified the definition in December 2023, determining that an entity is considered an FEOC if 25 percent or more of its voting rights, board seats, or equity interest are held by the government of a covered nation, or if the entity is effectively controlled by an FEOC through a license or contract. To qualify for Section 30D benefits, vehicles must not contain any minerals mined or processed by an FEOC, as defined. If any supplier to a vehicle manufacturer is in violation, the vehicle will not qualify for the Section 30D tax credit. This FEOC requirement goes into effect on January 1, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These sourcing requirements were intended to catalyze investments in critical minerals production in both the United States and its free trade partners, as well as to incentivize auto manufacturers to shift away from foreign adversaries in favor of domestic mineral suppliers. However, an unintended consequence of the Section 30D tax credit has been the disqualification of many EVs manufactured in North America. At the start of 2024, only 10 vehicles qualified for the credit—a number likely to decrease once the FEOC rules go into effect in January 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FEOC threshold has come under rightful scrutiny. On the one hand, critics argue that the provision is too permissive and should not allow firms with any Chinese ownership to receive taxpayer-subsidized benefits from the IRA. On the other hand, the FTA threshold is viewed as too restrictive, as most FTA countries lack the minerals needed for EV battery manufacturing. There is broad consensus that legislative loopholes need to be closed, given that Chinese firms are reportedly using parent or shell companies to benefit from the tax incentives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congressional leaders from both sides of the aisle have expressed concerns about the implementation of Section 30D, particularly regarding FEOC guidance. Senator Joe Manchin (I-WV), at the time a Democrat and one of the original sponsors and key architects of the IRA, led a bipartisan group of senators to introduce a Congressional Review Act resolution of disapproval aimed at overturning the Department of the Treasury’s final rule implementing the Section 30D Clean Vehicle Credit. Manchin objected to the Biden administration’s interpretation of the Section 30D sourcing requirements, describing it as inconsistent with the intent of Congress. The senator stated that the Department of the Treasury’s determination “allows China to gain control of our nation’s auto industry.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graphite is the greatest sourcing hurdle for most battery and EV manufacturers. It is the largest mineral component of a battery by weight, comprising over 145 pounds of the total 456 pounds of minerals in an EV battery. In comparison, an internal combustion engine requires no graphite and uses only 75 pounds of minerals in total. China accounts for 77 percent of natural graphite production, over 95 percent of synthetic graphite production, and nearly 100 percent of graphite refining. The United States, meanwhile, contains less than 1 percent of the world’s graphite reserves and is 100 percent import reliant, as it has yet to develop a domestic graphite mine despite significant government support for Graphite One’s project in Nome, Alaska. To keep U.S. EV manufacturing on track, the Department of the Treasury exempted graphite from FEOC requirements for two years, declaring it “impracticable-to-trace” until 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nascent North American graphite industry has raised concerns that the exemption could impede the development of a domestic graphite industry which cannot compete with Chinese prices. While the graphite exemption is necessary for the U.S. auto industry to remain competitive in EV manufacturing, alternative sources of graphite outside China are developing rapidly and are expected to come online in the coming years. Therefore, the exemption should remain in place until 2027 but should not be extended further. This will incentivize automakers to source graphite from Western suppliers and eliminate reliance on FEOC graphite by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the disapproval surrounding Section 30D’s implementation from both Congress and industry, the provision’s longevity under a new administration remains politically precarious. For Section 30D to remain politically viable for future administrations, it must be implemented in a manner that better protects the domestic industry, includes more strategic international partners, and prevents Chinese firms from benefitting, as Congress intended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;section-45x-advanced-manufacturing-production-credit&quot;&gt;Section 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Section 45X of the IRA provides a 10 percent credit for the costs incurred during the production of critical minerals to specified levels of purity. The credit was intended to expand domestic production of critical mineral components for clean energy technologies. Notably, the credit phases out for all industries by 2032, except for critical minerals projects. This means that, if properly executed, the Section 45X credit could provide perennial financial support to capital-intensive critical minerals projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in December 2023, the Department of the Treasury proposed a rule that “direct and indirect material costs . . . and any costs related to the extraction or acquisition of raw materials would not be taken into account as production costs.” This would mean the tax credit could only be applied to mineral processing, not mining. The credit was not optimally designed for mineral processors either. According to the proposed rule, the costs of attaining raw minerals would not be covered under the Section 45X credit, but these raw material costs are often the primary expenses for mineral processors and recyclers. Therefore, even eligible mineral processors were not gaining much financial support from the Section 45X credit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed Treasury Department rule met with intense opposition from private industry and congressional leaders. Nine Democratic senators wrote a letter to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in direct response to the department’s Section 45X rulemaking, expressing their displeasure and contending that the rule does not align with congressional intent. The National Mining Association, representing members including General Motors, MP Materials, Perpetua Resources, Rio Tinto, South32, and a host of other mining and automotive companies, submitted public comments that, without the inclusion of material and extraction costs in the calculation of Section 45X credits, “the impact of the 45X credit is significantly reduced.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October 2024, the Department of the Treasury released its final rule on Section 45X. In a stunning reversal, the final ruling recognized that previous guidance did not incentivize proportional investments in the minerals sector due to restrictions on what counted as production costs. The final rule clarified that material and extraction costs may now be included in calculating credits for projects producing eligible processed and refined critical minerals. This significantly changes the scale of benefits that critical minerals projects can derive from the Section 45X credit. Projects that are vertically integrating supply chains by feeding extracted ore from Western mining operations to U.S. refineries can now apply the 10 percent credit to the vast majority of their production costs in perpetuity. This will help offset the immense costs mineral projects face in a market highly vulnerable to Chinese manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;section-48c-qualifying-advanced-energy-project-credit&quot;&gt;Section 48C Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Credit&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Section 48C investment tax credit provides $10 billion in credits for qualifying projects that fall into one of three categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clean Energy Manufacturing and Recycling:&lt;/strong&gt; Reequips, expands, or establishes an industrial or manufacturing facility for advanced energy properties (e.g., EVs, solar panels, or energy storage systems)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Industrial Decarbonization:&lt;/strong&gt; Retrofits a manufacturing facility in an energy-intensive sector to reduce greenhouse gas emissions&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critical Materials:&lt;/strong&gt; Reequips, expands, or establishes an industrial facility for the processing, refining, or recycling of critical materials&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manufacturers can seek a credit worth up to 30 percent of the total amount invested in facilities that produce critical minerals. Unlike the Section 45X credit, the Section 48C program is competitive—not all projects that apply for the credit will be granted benefits. In the first round of Section 48C awards, of the 250 full applications requesting $13.5 billion in credits, 35 projects totaling $4 billion in awards were selected. This is only a 14 percent acceptance rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the projects selected for the credit, two-thirds fell under the clean energy manufacturing and recycling category, meaning that critical materials projects were deprioritized in the first tranche of funding. So far, it seems the Section 48C tax credit has been meaningful in incentivizing companies to make investments in domestic production of critical materials, although funding remains more concentrated in downstream applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applications for the second and final tranche of 48C funding were due in October 2024, and awards were announced in January 2025 to allocate the remaining $6 billion of funding. The distribution of funds for the second tranche was similar to the first, with only 25 percent of awards going to critical materials. Unless further funding is appropriated by Congress, the Section 48C program will end, rendering future projects ineligible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minerals projects are at a disadvantage in meeting Section 48C timelines due to the condition that a project is only eligible if it has received all federal, state, and local permits within two years of receiving an award. This timeline is challenging for minerals projects to meet, considering it can take decades to obtain all the necessary permits. By the time many minerals projects would be able to receive all needed permits, mobilize capital, and put together an application, Section 48C will have no remaining funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;defense-production-act-title-iii&quot;&gt;Defense Production Act Title III&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Defense Production Act (DPA) of 1950 was first enacted in response to the Korean War to expand the authorities of the president to ensure U.S. industry has the capability and capacity to meet national security needs. Title III of the act gives the president the authority to leverage incentives for private industry, such as loan guarantees, purchase commitments, and grants, to expand production capacity and supply of critical technologies. Since 1950, the DPA has been routinely invoked by presidents to respond to a number of crises, including the Cold War, the energy crisis of the 1970s, and the Covid-19 pandemic. The DPA is set to expire in 2025 unless reauthorized by Congress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IRA provided an additional $500 million toward the DPA Title III grants, which provide financial support to critical minerals projects that protect, expand, or restore industrial base capabilities critical to national security. Under the Biden administration, DPA Title III has been particularly important for building domestic midstream capabilities. To address this large vulnerability, DPA Title III has funded cobalt refining in Canada, titanium processing in North Carolina, and REE separation in Texas, along with several other critical minerals projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;expansion-of-the-department-of-energys-loan-programs-office&quot;&gt;Expansion of the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the Department of Energy received an additional $11.7 billion in funding and was granted an additional $100 billion in loan authority for its Loan Programs Office (LPO). The office was first established in 2005 by the Energy Policy Act to fill the gaps in affordable private debt and bring promising energy technologies to market that would otherwise be unable to access private financing. In this way, the LPO acts as a “bridge to bankability” to kickstart projects that might otherwise take a long time to reach commercial scale. This is especially important for critical minerals projects that are struggling to attract financing during periods of depressed commodity prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IRA expanded the scope of the LPO to create new programs and increased the loan authority by $100 billion. Critical minerals projects can qualify for funding under the LPO’s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program (ATVM) as a qualifying vehicle component. If selected, companies can receive a direct loan or loan guarantee of up to 80 percent of the project’s eligible costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some loans have been granted for mining and mineral processing projects. In 2022, Syrah Resources, an Australian company, received the first ATVM loan in over a decade and the first of its kind for the critical materials industry. The $102 million loan from the Department of Energy will support its graphite processing facility in Vidalia, Louisiana. When Syrah’s facility is complete, it will create the first vertically integrated graphite supply chain outside of China, sourcing graphite from its mining operations in Mozambique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syrah Resources’ graphite production, supported by the LPO, was once thought to be an exemplary use of IRA funds. With the government’s support, the project was projected to boost U.S. manufacturing, create jobs, establish a new graphite supply chain independent of China, and create a graphite source that the U.S. EV industry can rely on to qualify for Section 30D benefits in 2027. However, in December 2024, Syrah Resources declared force majeure and suspended operations for its graphite mine in Mozambique, as unrest and violence plague the nation following a disputed election result. Now, Syrah’s Louisiana processing project is at risk as well, unable to source graphite feedstock from its partner project in Mozambique. The company’s stock plummeted as Syrah defaulted on its U.S. government–backed loans. This recent development highlights the inherent risk with LPO investments in projects with supply chains vulnerable to political disruption. The incident also shows the importance of diversifying mineral supply to decrease dependencies on a singular feedstock source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional loans in the critical materials sector have been extended to Ioneer’s Rhyolite Ridge project ($700 million) and Lithium Americas ($2.26 billion) for lithium production, as well as Li-Cycle ($375 million) for battery minerals recycling and recovery. But LPO grant funding for critical materials projects remains limited, with far greater amounts going toward battery manufacturing projects. Critical minerals projects seeking LPO funding still face many challenges—the LPO process is lengthy, challenging to navigate, and prone to delays, as upstream projects can take decades to obtain the permits and offtake agreements needed. While LPO funds would be meaningful for capital-intensive midstream projects, few currently exist in a market where achieving economic viability is so challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scoring-the-iras-critical-minerals-efficacy&quot;&gt;SCORING THE IRA’S CRITICAL MINERALS EFFICACY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IRA has three primary objectives as they relate to critical minerals security: (1) accelerate the deployment of mineral-intensive clean energy technologies, (2) support domestic manufacturing, and (3) secure supply chains by eliminating dependence on foreign adversaries. The law’s provisions described above were created with these objectives in mind. In practice, however, the IRA has yielded mixed results, and critical minerals supply chains have a long way to go before the United States and its allies have sufficient production to support the many clean energy projects underway downstream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the IRA’s largest shortcomings is in “friendshoring” critical minerals production. Section 30D was intended to incentivize U.S. EV and battery manufacturers to source critical minerals from the United States or its FTA partners. However, limiting the benefit to FTA partners excluded crucial allies and major minerals producers such as Argentina, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Namibia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Vietnam, Zambia, and the European Union. Meanwhile, the primary mineral production of FTA partners, such as Chile, Mexico, and Peru, is copper—a critical material for energy that is not even eligible for Section 30D benefits, given that it is not on the Department of the Interior’s Critical Minerals List. Therefore, Section 30D is largely ineffective for sourcing from partners abroad: most FTA partners are not substantially benefiting from the IRA due to their limited resource reserves, and mineral-rich countries that could benefit are excluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/FnJASaA.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1: Inflation Reduction Act Report Card.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One proposed workaround for granting more countries FTA status is through the use of CMAs, which are FTA-equivalent, minerals-specific agreements that could be negotiated on a shorter time frame than an entire FTA. The U.S.-Japan CMA was signed by the Biden administration in March 2023. However, the agreement was met with intense backlash from Congress, with Democrats as well as Republicans lamenting that the rushed agreement bypassed the role of Congress in ratifying FTAs. Since then, no additional CMAs have been signed, and the list of FTA-equivalent countries sits at just 21. As the critical minerals domestic sourcing requirement rises in the coming years, U.S. downstream manufacturers will need more diverse sourcing options to continue to qualify for benefits, but no framework to expeditiously incorporate more partners currently exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without widening the beneficiary list, there is no incentive for Western producers to invest in projects in resource-rich countries, nor any incentive for these countries to seek Western offtake of their mineral production, as China remains a willing buyer. This is adversely impacting the United States. As the Pentagon invests in REE separating and refining capacity for permanent magnet technologies through its DPA Title III program, these projects will depend on a steady supply of ore feedstock. With less than 2 percent of the world’s REE reserves inside U.S. borders, midstream refiners will need to work with global partners, like Brazil, to secure feedstock. Brazil holds nearly a fifth of the world’s known REE deposits. Brazil’s first REE mine, Serra Verde, started commercial production in 2024, but without the qualifications for Section 30D benefits, Brazil has no incentive to sign a long-term supply contract with a U.S. firm. Under the current IRA framework, the United States will lose offtake of key mineral deposits to Chinese refiners, and EV manufacturers will be unable to eliminate FEOC suppliers from their supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-recommendations-1&quot;&gt;POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make the IRA work better for mineral security, the U.S. government should pursue the following actions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The United States needs to build on the FTA partner list to include mineral-rich strategic partners currently excluded and left behind.&lt;/strong&gt; Section 30D’s FTA requirements are arbitrary and were not created with mineral reserve locations in mind. The IRA cannot change geology, and global supply will remain reliant on Indonesia’s nickel, Madagascar’s graphite, and Argentina’s lithium for the foreseeable future. To be less discriminatory, the U.S. government should, in consultation with Congress, come up with a list of approved countries for Section 30D credits that align with U.S. mineral security goals and human rights standards. This will incentivize a greater number of strategically important countries to work with Western partners over Chinese buyers.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This task may seem daunting, but there are a number of bilateral and multilateral cooperative forums and trade agreements that could be expanded. For example, the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity, and Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity could become more useful if they included binding terms, such as investment incentives, eligibility for subsidies and concessional financing, and preferential market access. Trade agreements can also be revised. For example, the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) is up for reauthorization in 2025, and several of the beneficiaries—such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, and Zambia—are rich in minerals. Most of these mineral exports currently go to China. By including an investment incentive—similar to Section 30D—in AGOA, the United States can both incentivize investment in these countries by Western companies and encourage routing supply to the United States instead of China.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FEOC rules should be amended to phase out taxpayer-subsidized benefits for projects with any Chinese ownership.&lt;/strong&gt; At present, to qualify for IRA tax credits, mineral projects must be less than 25 percent owned by an FEOC. This means that a mine that is 24 percent owned by a Chinese firm in Peru would still receive IRA benefits, given that the United States has an FTA with Peru. As the United States and allied nations build their capabilities, the United States should steadily reduce the FEOC ownership threshold to zero percent. This does not mean that Chinese firms cannot export to the United States; it simply means they will not be eligible for the tax credits that give them a competitive edge.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional subsidies, such as a price floor, are needed for mining projects both at home and abroad that feed U.S. processors and refineries.&lt;/strong&gt; Western mining and processing operations will not be able to compete against Chinese and Russian prices without additional government support. The cost of producing nickel at Chinese-owned Weda Bay in Indonesia is just $4.23 per pound, compared to the U.S. Eagle Mine’s costs of $5.32 per pound. China produces minerals using dirtier energy sources, cheaper labor, and government subsidies designed to price out Western competition. U.S. critical minerals producers need all the support they can get to compete as prices for key energy minerals reach two-year lows. A price floor would give mining companies and their investors assurance that their capital-intensive projects will not become economically unviable due to commodity price volatility.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Another example of how price floors could be crucial for mineral producers is palladium production. Palladium is key to hydrogen fuel cells, but its production is primarily concentrated in Russia (43 percent of global production) and South Africa (36 percent). The United States produced only 3.5 percent of the world’s palladium in 2023. Russian palladium operations are substantially cheaper than those in South Africa and the United States due to low safety standards. The total cash cost for mining one ounce of palladium at Norilsk in Russia is just $402 per ounce, compared to $590 at South Africa’s Mogalakwena operation. Sibanye-Stillwater, a South African company, owns the only major palladium operation in the United States. Its operating costs for 2024 reached over $1,000 per ounce—greater than the selling price of palladium. At times, the company was losing as much as $600 per ounce produced. As a result, the company announced nearly 800 layoffs for its palladium mining operations in Montana and paused production. A price floor could ensure that commodity prices do not fall below mining production costs, helping strategic mining operations remain operational and saving U.S. jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-4&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IRA is the most significant piece of legislation to date that addresses the component supply chain needed to secure clean energy technologies. It created a host of incentives designed to reroute mineral supply chains by stimulating investment in the United States and select partner nations. By some measures, the IRA has seen marked success; by others, there is still much work to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supply chain shifts and industrial transitions take time, but with the right adjustments, IRA incentives have the potential to catalyze shifts in mineral supply chains that may change the entire security landscape for the energy technologies of the future. To make the IRA work better for mineral supply chains, policymakers should expand the list of countries benefitting from mineral production and processing incentives; steadily tighten the FEOC ownership requirements to reduce the competitive advantage that firms with fractional Chinese ownership gain through the IRA; and leverage new financing tools, like price floors, to accelerate the development of mining and processing capabilities in the United States and allied nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IRA serves as an important template for how incentives could be structured to secure critical minerals supply chains for a variety of industries beyond just energy. Just as the IRA targets the lithium, graphite, and REEs needed for EVs and wind turbines, similar legislative initiatives could target gallium and germanium for semiconductors or antimony and tungsten for defense technologies. Securing mineral supply chains for the modern economy is one of the great challenges of our time. To succeed, policymakers will need the right set of incentives to push the private sector to innovate and expand to its full potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;kellee-wicker&quot;&gt;Kellee Wicker&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;As legislative and executive branch action on critical minerals has largely focused on minerals associated with clean energy and electric vehicles, Congress should specifically address the supply of semiconductor inputs.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semiconductor design and production were once major sources of economic power for the United States. In 1994, U.S. semiconductor companies commanded 50 percent of the European market, 40 percent of the Asia-Pacific market, and 17 percent of the Japanese market. The electronics industry in 1995 was one of only seven manufacturing industries in the United States that employed more than one million workers, with 40 percent of those workers focused specifically on chips, and that percentage was rising. At the time, Japan was the United States’ primary rival for dominance in the global semiconductor industry, with the United States holding the largest share of the global market and Japan close behind, while South Korea and Taiwan were beginning to establish their footholds. Amid this competition, governments in the United States, Japan, and Europe invested strategically in public-private partnerships for research and development (R&amp;amp;D) and in maintaining domestic production, aiming to secure an edge in a highly competitive market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the global semiconductor market is more valuable than ever, but the global supply chain has become concentrated. Furthermore, the U.S. share of fabrication has fallen to about 10 percent in 2020, although U.S. firms’ market share remains robust due to their dominance in design and other key parts of the supply chain. As noted in Chapter 2, this dependence on other nations for fabrication raised major alarms during the Covid-19 pandemic, when chip shortages rendered many consumer products unavailable or far more costly than usual. For possibly the first time, consumers became aware of the prevalence of chips in products from automobiles to refrigerators. U.S. policymakers also awakened to U.S. semiconductor dependence, particularly on Taiwan, which supplies over 60 percent of global chips and more than 90 percent of advanced chips. Taiwan’s position is precarious: while it gains some protection from its “silicon shield” as a major chips supplier, Taiwan remains a geopolitical thorn in China’s side. Taiwan’s connection to the world—and semiconductor consumers—could be severed at any time by China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors Act of 2022 (also known as the CHIPS and Science Act, but hereafter referred to in this chapter as the CHIPS Act) is the United States’ effort to invest in supply chain resilience. It aims to strengthen domestic production to guard against future chip shocks and—hopefully—limit China’s ability to threaten U.S. access to semiconductors by addressing reliance on Taiwan and other suppliers, while also boosting investments in U.S. innovation and research. However, the act did not include any provisions addressing mineral access, leaving access to key minerals such as gallium and germanium highly vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-path-to-the-chips-acts-passage&quot;&gt;THE PATH TO THE CHIPS ACT’S PASSAGE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the pandemic supply chain shock, a number of semiconductor bills were introduced, many of which contained provisions that would eventually be passed in the CHIPS Act. The key bill was the CHIPS for America Act, introduced in the U.S. Senate on June 10, 2020, by Senators John Cornyn (R-TX) and Mark Warner (D-VA), along with a companion bill in the U.S. House of Representatives from Reps. Doris Matsui (D-CA) and Michael McCaul (R-TX).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the CHIPS for America Act was not the only legislative vehicle proposed to counter China by strengthening domestic industries. Senators Charles Schumer (D-NY) and Todd Young’s (R-IN) Endless Frontiers Act, introduced on May 21, 2020, aimed to strengthen U.S. competitiveness in emerging technologies through investment in research and regional technology hubs. The Endless Frontiers Act was subsequently replaced by the United States Innovation and Competition Act (USICA), sponsored by Schumer and introduced on April 20, 2021. USICA quickly ballooned from a bill targeting research investment to a massive $250 billion bill intended to tackle China’s rising power in emerging technologies across all of government. Cornyn and Warner’s CHIPS for America components were rolled into USICA, along with several other competitiveness bills and programs authorized by the FY 2020 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). USICA passed the Senate in June 2021 with bipartisan support, but House counterpart bills, which included more progressive provisions, only passed along party lines. Differences between the versions passed by each chamber made reconciliation difficult, but eventually both chambers passed a House bill introduced by then Rep. Tim Ryan (D-OH) that had been amended to include significant portions of USICA along with key House demands on semiconductors, climate, and competitiveness. The CHIPS Act of 2022 was signed into law on August 9, 2022, retaining a focus on both science and research capacity and securing semiconductor supply chain resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, despite the extensive list of provisions and goals included in earlier versions, critical minerals for semiconductors were not prioritized in the CHIPS Act, nor mentioned in media coverage or press releases as a priority for action. Securing U.S. access to critical minerals had been a key objective for the U.S. government, as seen in the Biden administration’s February 2021 Executive Order on America’s Supply Chains, which built on a September 2020 executive order from the Trump administration. This called for the secretary of defense to produce a report that would identify risks in the critical minerals supply chain and make specific policy recommendations. Other bills passed in 2021, as outlined in other chapters of this volume, prioritized access to critical minerals for electric vehicles and renewable energy goals. The CHIPS Act did not address this interesting gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-chips-act-funds-and-activities-for-semiconductors&quot;&gt;KEY CHIPS ACT FUNDS AND ACTIVITIES FOR SEMICONDUCTORS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CHIPS Act appropriated $52.7 billion in funding for semiconductor-related activities through FY 2027, distributed across four distinct funds targeting different parts of the supply chain: the CHIPS for America Fund, the CHIPS for America Defense Fund, the CHIPS for America International Technology Security and Innovation Fund, and the CHIPS for America Workforce and Education Fund. These funds are appropriations for a number of programs and activities authorized by the FY 2021 NDAA, which had also been passed amid congressional concerns around U.S. semiconductor supply instability, as well as other activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CHIPS for America Fund, through which the majority of the appropriated funds will flow, provides the Department of Commerce with $50 billion to incentivize domestic manufacturing capabilities, R&amp;amp;D, and workforce development. Of this total, $39 billion is earmarked for a program to promote investment in semiconductor fabrication, assembly, testing, advanced packaging, and R&amp;amp;D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remaining $11 billion of the CHIPS for America Fund is marked for R&amp;amp;D and workforce development programs. Chief among these is the National Semiconductor Technology Center (NSTC), which focuses on the research and prototyping of advanced semiconductor technology, including work on next-generation materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another program, the National Advanced Packaging Manufacturing Program, is designed to enhance test, assembly, and packaging capabilities in the United States in coordination with the NSTC and the Manufacturing USA institutes. Lastly, funding is allocated for a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) R&amp;amp;D program, which focuses on next-generation microelectronics, including materials characterization or the study of the structure and properties of materials, an essential component in understanding materials before exploring their potential uses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CHIPS for America Defense Fund appropriates $2 billion for the Department of Defense to stand up the National Network for Microelectronics Research and Development, also known as the Microelectronics Commons. The commons was created to support the “lab-to-fab” transition of chip innovation from academic development to commercial production and to expand the United States’ edge on next-generation semiconductor development, including innovation in artificial intelligence, quantum technology, and telecommunications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CHIPS for America International Technology Security and Innovation Fund (ITSI) appropriates $100 million annually for five years to the Department of State for coordination with foreign governments on telecommunications, semiconductors, and other emerging technologies. In a briefing following the CHIPS Act’s passage, the State Department unveiled its strategy for the ITSI fund, identifying “reliable access to critical minerals such as cobalt, aluminum, arsenic, copper, and rare earth elements” as one of its four priorities. The State Department would work to “secure and diversify” sources of these minerals across the entire processing chain, from mining to recycling. However, with limited funds and three other priorities to balance across vast industries, the fund’s impact on critical minerals projects is unlikely to be significant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CHIPS for America Workforce and Education Fund appropriates a total of $200 million for workforce development activities administered by the National Science Foundation (NSF). One part of that fund, National Science Foundation for the Future, does not explicitly focus on semiconductors but does touch on critical mineral dependence. The NSF director is tasked with supporting basic research “to advance critical minerals mining strategies and technologies for the purpose of making better use of domestic resources and eliminating national reliance on minerals and mineral materials that are subject to supply disruptions.” Documentation on this fund also highlights the role of the NSTC’s Critical Minerals Subcommittee in strategizing and coordinating federal efforts on critical minerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-chips-acts-impact-on-us-critical-minerals-supply-chains&quot;&gt;THE CHIPS ACT’S IMPACT ON U.S. CRITICAL MINERALS SUPPLY CHAINS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although minerals are referenced in various sections of the law, it is always as part of a list of desired outcomes and activities. As such, the CHIPS Act has had limited impact on critical minerals supply and access. However, future funding requests from fund beneficiaries could include projects that will either change domestic capacity for mining, processing, or recycling critical minerals or alter material needs for semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most identifiable direct impact comes as a result of ITSI funding for the Minerals Security Partnership, which convenes traditional allies such as the European Union as well as mineral-rich nations in Latin America and Africa. This group has committed to environmental and social standards for mining projects in countries willing to work with the partnership, seeking to create less exploitative arrangements than those offered by China. Ideally, this will lead to future resource agreements, reducing reliance on Chinese minerals, though timelines are long. As of March 2024, there are 23 confirmed projects across various critical minerals and rare earth elements, including gallium and germanium, but only two have reached key implementation milestones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another program with a clear intention to address critical minerals supply is the CHIPS for America incentives for semiconductor materials and manufacturing equipment facilities. The “Vision for Success” document for this program explicitly identifies reliance on China for upstream inputs like gallium as a supply chain resilience issue it seeks to address. However, minerals are not the only inputs targeted, and the program’s focus on companies looking to establish or expand their U.S. footprint may make it difficult for minerals companies to compete for funds. It remains to be seen whether minerals companies could—or would—successfully compete for this opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other impacts on critical minerals seem largely theoretical to date, although tracking funding disbursed through numerous organizations and mechanisms is challenging. The CHIPS for America Vision for Success document on incentives for commercial fabrication facilities stipulates that CHIPS funding applicants must also attract associated suppliers, including “reliable” material suppliers “committed to operating and innovating in the United States.” The document also highlights fabrication companies’ use of new materials with unique performance properties as a focus of the theme of reducing costs. This focus has facilitated the expansion and modernization of facilities like GlobalFoundries’ 200 mm fab in Vermont, which enables the production of next-generation gallium nitride (GaN) chips—a win for domestic production of cutting-edge semiconductors. However, these chips still rely on critical minerals, and it is unclear whether CHIPS Act funding has spurred companies like GlobalFoundries to identify or invest in new partnerships to source minerals such as gallium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, it is difficult to tell what impact funding for the Microelectronics Commons network could have on minerals. The network recently issued its first round of project awards but has released few details on what these “lab-to-fab” projects are. Information from the Midwest Microelectronics Consortium, one of the regional hubs receiving project awards, suggests the projects are focused on prototypes that advance packaging, processing, or other functionalities rather than new materials, architectures, or techniques that impact mineral reliance. However, the Northeast Microelectronics Coalition, another network hub, announced having won an award for the transfer of “High AlAl GaN from Lab to Fab,” indicating a potential new development in aluminum gallium nitride use. Otherwise, the network seems focused on other areas of work, such as AI, quantum technology, and electromagnetic warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-for-a-stronger-future&quot;&gt;RECOMMENDATIONS FOR A STRONGER FUTURE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As legislative and executive branch action on critical minerals has largely focused on minerals associated with clean energy and electric vehicles, Congress should specifically address the supply of semiconductor inputs. Finding or creating domestic supply is no easy task, and any impactful investment in mineral access will require support for R&amp;amp;D to discover new refining methods, new sources, and other creative solutions. China had decades to subsidize and incentivize its domestic metals industry to dominate gallium production; the United States has much less time and faces greater limitations in terms of what its people are willing to accept in terms of economic and environmental costs. To address this challenge, the United States needs to focus on two fronts: developing new methods for mineral production, refinement, and recycling, and developing new approaches for semiconductor fabrication. Both, however, will take time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These exigencies may serve as a necessary push for the semiconductor industry to step into a new phase of fabrication. Chipmakers are already concerned about reaching the maximum transistor density allowable by current two-dimensional production methods. Potential three-dimensional methods, such as carbon nanotubes, are seen by some as less viable due to higher costs and manufacturing difficulties compared to easier 2-D architectures. While carbon nanotubes also depend on another critical mineral, graphite, they have already shown promise in various applications and could see wider deployment if cheaper alternatives become less viable—or there could be another production method yet to gain attention and investment. Whether through a known but novel production method or a yet-to-be-industrialized one, the cost and time burden of adopting next-generation chip architectures, materials, or processes will only make business sense if current methods or materials become more expensive or unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recycling&quot;&gt;Recycling&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Congress to effectively invest in identifying or expanding sources of gallium and germanium, it should prioritize incentivizing recycling and investing in research to improve recycling processes in the United States. The Department of Commerce’s incentives program should be expanded to encourage private sector investment in building recycling facilities, using recycled materials, and exploring new methods of recycling gallium and germanium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current research on gallium and germanium processing from solid waste shows promise, with many researchers searching for more efficient recycling methods. One analysis of the field in early 2024 revealed several underused sources: gallium can be sourced from waste LEDs and dust from LED production, while germanium is recoverable from the significant waste generated by continuous technological upgrades, as well as wastewater from processes like fiber-optic cable production. Researchers are testing and evaluating various recycling and extraction methods, some with lower environmental impact, others with improved efficiency, and some that enhance the ability to extract multiple types of critical minerals from polymetallic resources (resources containing more than one critical mineral). Notably, much of this research appears to be conducted by Chinese scientists and research teams, funded by government and higher education grants. It is vital that the United States directs research funding toward this work, with an emphasis on environmental standards and worker safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cleaner-safer-extraction&quot;&gt;Cleaner, Safer Extraction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, funds should be appropriated for the NSTC and NIST to explicitly support research into cleaner mining and processing methods for gallium and germanium. For the Minerals Security Partnership or other initiatives to scale up nonexploitative and environmentally friendly mining to succeed, the United States must lead in finding economically practical methods that fulfill these objectives. While incentivizing private companies to conduct this research is possible, enabling higher-education institutions and other tech research hubs to make these discoveries increases the likelihood of broader benefits beyond a single corporation. Currently, private companies typically use proprietary practices for mineral processing, making it difficult to understand the factors controlling recovery and how processes could be improved. If funding is appropriated for a private sector intervention, building in incentives for companies to not only enhance these practices but also share knowledge could be impactful. As with the current CHIPS Act funding, receiving these funds should be contingent on applicants’ plans to base their operations in the United States or a friendly country and their commitment to positive environmental and labor practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;building-chips-with-next-generation-materials&quot;&gt;Building Chips with Next-Generation Materials&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identifying the materials or combinations that will facilitate the next breakthrough in chip technology is a long-term project. Several types of investments will support the research needed to achieve this, but these discoveries can often come from unexpected fields. Beyond specific investments, the United States should broadly invest in basic R&amp;amp;D, focusing on areas the market may not fund but that, over time, could lead to paradigm-shifting discoveries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the CHIPS Act’s “family” of agencies and projects, additional funding explicitly aimed at identifying new materials or architectures using more common materials would be impactful. CHIPS for America’s Metrology Program is already funding research on measurements—a key part of materials characterization—but it received limited funding under the CHIPS Act. Introducing an explicit research area for materials or architectures to the Microelectronics Commons would automatically encourage higher education and commercial institutions across multiple states to focus on this field while also emphasizing the commercialization of any new discoveries. The Microelectronics Commons offers the added benefit of allowing institutions to contribute their expert insights, replacing incomplete government guidance with field-specific expertise. Additionally, allocating specific funding for advanced materials research to NIST’s CHIPS Act funding would provide fresh resources for the U.S. government’s ongoing materials science efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the future, CHIPS Act–style funding should incentivize companies to adopt new processes and architectures that utilize novel materials. While market pressures likely will drive the adoption of discoveries that improve the efficiency of critical minerals use, advancing the next generation of semiconductor manufacturing will require government investment. This includes funding research to discover new materials, processes, or architectures and supporting the lab-to-fab transition for these technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-5&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, U.S. legislative action on critical minerals has been tentative in addressing minerals relevant to semiconductor production. The process of identifying alternative sources for gallium and germanium will be expensive, likely slow, and possibly painful, but it is necessary to reduce the United States’ 100 percent dependence on imports, particularly from China. The United States must prioritize recycling of technological waste and mining byproducts, invest in research for more efficient extraction and recycling processes, and work with companies already active in these industries. Basic R&amp;amp;D investment will also be key to transitioning from this period of uncertain and costly mineral access to a leap forward into the next generation of semiconductor fabrication and architecture—if such advancements are indeed possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Critical minerals are used ubiquitously in commercial and defense systems and are therefore vitally important to national and economic security.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critical minerals are used ubiquitously in commercial and defense systems and are therefore vitally important to national and economic security. On February 24, 2021, President Joe Biden issued Executive Order (EO) 14017, which called for a comprehensive review of critical supply chains in key sectors—one being critical minerals and other identified strategic materials, including rare earth elements (REEs). The first deliverable of the EO required four government agencies to submit 100-day reports on four different sectors. The Department of Defense (DOD) wrote and published the report on critical minerals and strategic materials, with input from multiple other agencies, on June 8, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second deliverable of the EO called for the DOD and other agencies to write a one-year report on their supply chains. The DOD’s report, Securing Defense-Critical Supply Chains, was published in February 2022. It identified five key focus areas that were at high risk for the DOD, mostly due to adversarial foreign dependence within those supply chains. Critical minerals and strategic materials comprised one of the five areas, and the one-year report provided an update on the implementation of the recommendations from the 100-day report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD’s Industrial Base Policy (IBP) office authored both reports. That office also manages two investment programs designed to mitigate shortfalls in the defense industrial base: the Defense Production Act (DPA) Title III program and the Industrial Base Analysis and Sustainment (IBAS) program. Since the publication of the EO 14017 one-year report, IBP has used the report’s recommendations as a framework for making investments with both programs. Many of those investments are for onshoring capabilities that the United States has lost or for leveraging the capabilities of allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD’s IBP office also authored the report in response to EO 13806, Assessing and Strengthening the Manufacturing and Defense Industrial Base and Supply Chain Resiliency of the United States, published in September 2018, and the Annual Industrial Capabilities Report to Congress, submitted yearly. Both reports also detailed the fragility of the critical minerals supply chain; however, it was not until the EO 14017 report that the IBP office purposely aligned its investment programs for critical minerals with that report’s recommendations. Additionally, the DPA Title III base budget significantly increased starting in FY 2021, allowing for increased investments to be made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Defense Production Act of 1950 authorizes the president to ensure the availability of U.S. and Canadian industry for U.S. defense, essential civilian, and homeland security requirements. The DPA is required to be reauthorized every few years, allowing Congress to make changes, such as expanding it to include space activity in 1975 and designating energy as an essential material good in 1980. Emergency preparedness during natural disasters or emergencies was added in 1994, and in 2003, the definition of national defense was expanded to include “critical infrastructure protection and restoration.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the DPA only has three active authorities (although it has had more in the past): Title I, Title III, and Title VII.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Title I&lt;/strong&gt; is for defense priorities and allocations, and includes provisions for the DOD to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;prioritize federal contracts over all other orders;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;control distribution of scarce materials within the civilian economy;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;allocate scarce materials against federal or private contracts; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;prevent hoarding of scarce materials.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Title III&lt;/strong&gt; is for expansion of productive capacity and supply, which includes incentives for the DOD to develop, maintain, modernize, and expand production capacity for critical technologies via&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;grants and subsidies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Title VII&lt;/strong&gt; is titled “General Provisions” and includes authorities for the DOD to facilitate and participate in&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;antitrust immunity for industry, to develop and implement national emergency preparedness plans; and&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;defense-production-act-title-iii-1&quot;&gt;DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT TITLE III&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section focuses exclusively on DPA Title III. Grants and subsidies are the most common use of this title. The three priority areas for DPA Title III investment are (1) sustaining critical production, (2) commercializing research and development efforts, and (3) scaling emerging technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DPA Title III has made investments in the United States and Canada, which is considered a “domestic source” for the purposes of the DPA. Canada has significant mining and material processing capability and exports a variety of strategic and critical materials to the United States. The FY 2024 National Defense Authorization Act gave DPA Title III the ability to consider Australia and the United Kingdom as domestic sources as well. This consideration could be critically important, as Australia is rich in mineral resources and has vast deposits of a large variety of critical minerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any investment made by DPA Title III requires the president, on a nondelegable basis, to identify a domestic industrial base shortfall as meeting three specific criteria:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The industrial resource, material, or critical technology item is essential to national defense.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without presidential action under 50 U.S.C. §4533, U.S. industry cannot reasonably be expected to provide the capability for the needed industrial resource, material, or critical technology item in a timely manner.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Purchases, purchase commitments, or other action pursuant to 50 U.S.C. §4533 are the most cost-effective, expedient, and practical alternative methods for meeting the need.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If these criteria are met, the DOD assembles a package with justifying information and sends it to the White House for approval. Once signed by the president, it is known as a presidential determination (PD). PDs are non-expiring, can be leveraged for different projects addressing the same shortfalls, and vary in breadth and scope depending upon the shortfall or challenge addressed. PDs are not an appropriation or funding mechanism, nor a mandate to address a specific shortfall or pursue a specific course of action. Examples of existing PDs related to critical minerals include the “Defense Production Act Title III Presidential Determination for Critical Materials in Large-Capacity Batteries,” signed by President Biden on March 31, 2022, and five PDs for REEs, signed on July 22, 2019—two for separation and processing capability (light and heavy), one for metal and alloy processing capability, and two for rare earth permanent magnets production (samarium cobalt and neodymium iron boron).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the same criteria necessary to obtain a PD explain why DPA Title III is an important mechanism for investing in critical minerals supply chains. DPA Title III funds are not to be used if other funding, for example, private investment or funding from other agencies, can be secured. The private sector is reluctant to make investments in critical minerals projects due to market price volatility for these materials. With China controlling most of the market and market pricing, many domestic and allied sources have been driven out of business—not exactly an attractive business case for private investors. While the Department of Energy (DOE) has been making significant investments in this sector, it has been focusing on areas that align with its mission, as outlined in their vision statement: supporting “clean energy transition and decarbonization of the energy, manufacturing, and transportation economies, while promoting safe, sustainable, economic, and environmentally just solutions.” This leads to investments in projects for alternate designs that require no critical materials, more efficient and environmentally friendly mining, and reclaiming minerals through recycling. While the DOD is in favor of and has also been investing in these types of projects, many of the critical minerals necessary for national security applications must still be mined and processed using traditional methods, so the DOD is making those investments using DPA Title III.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, funding is appropriated into the DPA Title III account annually, without specification on how it is to be spent, although Congress must be notified of planned expenditures. However, in the past few years, there has been an increased interest in the DPA from the executive and legislative branches and other government agencies, who are increasingly viewing DPA authorities as valuable tools to be leveraged against urgent, critical issues. For instance, in FY 2022, the DPA was appropriated $600 million by the Additional Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act, part of which included expanded domestic capacity for strategic and critical minerals. Additionally, in FY 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act appropriated $500 million for enhanced use of the DPA. The funds were split equally between the DOE and DOD, with $250 million provided to the DOD to be applied to expanding capabilities for domestic mining, mineral processing, and related industrial sectors for large-capacity batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DPA Title III typically has a requirement for cost sharing from the companies receiving an award. The expectation is 50 percent of the total investment, but can be less depending on various factors, such as a company’s ability to fund the total cost-share amount. Some smaller companies, such as small businesses and startups, do not have the cash flow available to fund a 50 percent cost share, and in those cases, DPA Title III may absorb a larger percentage of the total cost of the project. However, such instances may result in less DPA Title III funding available to make other investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The program also seeks to ensure that any investment it makes will lead to a sustainable capability not requiring further DPA Title III funding. One way to do this is with the seldom-used authority of purchases and purchase commitments. This allows the DOD to purchase or commit to purchasing a certain amount of a company’s output over a set time period to ensure it can sustain the capability until market demand is sufficient to do so. This guaranteed demand also gives industry the confidence it needs to make its own investments. Purchases and purchase commitments were more easily executed previously because DPA Title III funds were appropriated as “no-year money,” meaning the funds never expired; however, during the past three years, Congress has appropriated those funds as standard procurement, which expire in two years, making these longer-term commitments nearly impossible. This change was due to some members’ concerns over timely execution rates; however, these concerns were unfounded, as the DPA Title III program executed $850 million of its $968 million budget in FY 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to offset some of the additional costs to the DPA Title III program and to help increase the demand for the newly developed capabilities, the program has recently developed its Pathfinders program, which “takes a revolutionary approach, focused on harnessing private capital and market forces to serve as a massive force multiplier to government investment.” The Defense Business Accelerator (DBX) program rapidly scales emerging technologies from the defense industry as well as DOD labs by leveraging the commercial market to accelerate production at scale. According to the DOD, “Since it was announced last fall, companies that received DBX awards are reporting they have received an additional $46.6 million in private capital, largely due to the spark provided by the initial $9.6 million DBX investment.” The Defense Market Catalyst (DMC) program is a public-private partnership (PPP) that stimulates trusted private capital for defense-oriented small businesses seeking to rapidly scale their operations to meet defense market needs. This capital infusion may also help those companies meet their cost-share obligations. And the Scaling Capacity &amp;amp; Accelerating Local Enterprises (SCALE) project looks at emerging technology through the lens of supply chain gaps, generating market pull and building PPPs to grow resilient domestic businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;industrial-base-analysis-and-sustainment-program&quot;&gt;INDUSTRIAL BASE ANALYSIS AND SUSTAINMENT PROGRAM&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Industrial Base Analysis and Sustainment (IBAS) program (10 U.S. Code §4817 established the Industrial Base Fund) was established in 2011 and has the following authorities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;to support the monitoring and assessment of the industrial base&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;to address critical issues in the industrial base relating to urgent operational needs&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;to support efforts to expand the industrial base&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;to address supply chain vulnerabilities&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only changes to the authority have been administrative in nature, such as amending the language to reflect the change from the “undersecretary of defense for acquisition, technology, and logistics” to the “undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment.” Congress does not prescribe how the base funding for the IBAS program (roughly $11 million in FY 2024) is to be spent; however, in the past several years, Congress has added a large amount of funding (around $1 billion in FY 2024) for specific industrial investment areas, for example, $175,692 for critical minerals in FY 2024. The IBAS program has always had the ability to and has made investments in all of the National Technology Industrial Base countries—Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the DPA Title III and IBAS programs have been making multiple investments in the critical minerals sector and have been investing in upstream and downstream capabilities to build and secure domestic critical minerals supply chains. Table 1 shows all the critical minerals investments that have been made during the Biden administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investments have been made in a multitude of different critical minerals, including both light and heavy REEs, aluminum, cobalt, nickel, lithium, graphite, titanium, manganese, and terbium oxide. Projects range from mining (cobalt, manganese ore, and lithium) to REE separation and magnet making (NdFeB). They also include production of titanium, of which the DOD gets 95 percent from non-domestic sources, including Russia, and production of aluminum, both of which are used in the production of aircraft, ships, and submarines. There is also an investment in Chinese export-restricted graphite. Additionally, there are several recycling projects, including extracting REEs from acid mine drainage and production of terbium oxide from recycled fluorescent light bulbs. There is even a workforce development project that was awarded in August 2024. While these projects span a wide breadth of the critical minerals landscape, there are still some gaps. For instance, there are no investments in samarium cobalt magnets or for gallium or germanium, for which China recently restricted exports. This may be due to a lack of funding, as DPA Title III must fund many different industrial base sector shortfalls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figures 2 and 3 show the road maps for combined DPA Title III and IBAS current and future investments for strategic and critical materials and batteries, both of which contain projects for critical minerals. There continue to be investments in REE projects. Investments are also being made in niobium and tungsten, materials that go into refractory metals and superalloys and are used for components such as turbine engine blades and penetrators. Additionally, there are now projects for germanium and gallium, as well as additional recycling and workforce projects. Mining and refining of the main elements used in battery production—nickel, cobalt, lithium, and manganese—continue to be the focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-3&quot;&gt;RECOMMENDATIONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the DOD has made significant investments—totaling $781 million—in the critical minerals sector to onshore or friend-shore capabilities and reduce U.S. dependencies on adversarial sourcing during the Biden administration, there is still much to be done. It has taken decades for these capabilities to atrophy, and it will take many years and many more millions of dollars to rebuild them. More investment dollars are needed, especially if the government’s predicted timeline (by roughly 2027) for Chinese readiness for a potential invasion of Taiwan is to be believed. If the United States were to come to Taiwan’s aid, it is unlikely that China would continue to provide the country with critical minerals. Therefore, the capability for critical minerals production must be rebuilt quickly, before it is too late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the DPA Title III budget is used to address a multitude of industrial base shortfalls, not just critical minerals. Even though the total budget may seem large, the amount available for critical minerals is not enough to address the considerable gap that exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increased appropriations for both the DPA Title III and IBAS programs would allow for greater investments in critical minerals. The DPA Title III base budget increased from $373 million in FY 2023 to $588 million in FY 2024, but the program demonstrated it could execute much more ($850 million). Appropriating a base budget for DPA Title III that is at least $750 million to $1 billion would give the program the flexibility to invest more in critical minerals while maintaining or increasing investments in other important sectors. The IBAS program has consistently shown it can execute annual budgets at or near $1 billion, so appropriating a base budget in that range would help ensure consistency for critical minerals investments, rather than relying on inconsistent congressional additions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several other recommendations that would help improve the ability of the DPA Title III program to impact the critical minerals landscape:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delegate authority for approval of PDs to the secretary of defense.&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, it takes approximately one year to staff the PD package and obtain the president’s signature. This timeline needs to be shortened to allow for more responsive industrial base investments. The secretary of defense is well positioned to understand the national security implications of the threat and can confer with the heads of other departments and agencies who may have equities, prior to signing a designation for the use of DPA Title III authorities for a particular critical minerals industrial base shortfall.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make greater use of purchases and purchase commitments.&lt;/strong&gt; As mentioned earlier, purchases and purchase commitments will help sustain the capabilities that have received investments and provide industry with the demand signal and business case to make their own investments. Greater utilization of this authority will rely on two factors: an increased budget and a return to non-expiring funding being appropriated by Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase investments in the workforce.&lt;/strong&gt; The workforce shortage is one of the key issues in all sectors of the industrial base, as was highlighted in the DOD’s EO 14017 report. The IBAS program has been making investments in the workforce for several years, but the DPA Title III program has traditionally not made such investments, primarily due to a smaller overall budget. The IBAS program has been very successful with its National Imperative for Industrial Skills (NIIS) initiative, which facilitates multiple approaches to recruit, train, hire, and retain skilled workers. The NIIS initiative recognizes the interplay of K–12 and post-secondary education and training tracks. The key principles of the program are (1) active, sustained partnering with industry, academia, military departments, federal agencies, and state governments; and (2) creating regionally focused activities targeting capacity where skills are most needed (e.g., regional submarine industrial base efforts intensified and scaled in New England and Virginia). Additional funding would enable both programs to support additional workforce development efforts in key sectors, such as critical minerals.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continue to leverage private equity and venture capital.&lt;/strong&gt; Private capital will multiply the impact of DPA Title III funding and assist small companies that lack the cash flow to fund cost share for awards. It will also mean DPA Title III does not have to absorb the extra cost, allowing those funds to be allocated to other projects.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continue to work with commercial industry to generate market pull and demand.&lt;/strong&gt; The DOD’s demand in this sector is very small, so it is vital that commercial industry helps generate part of the demand signal to develop resilient and sustainable domestic supply chains. For instance, the automotive industry also uses rare earth magnets in electric motors and sensors, as well as lithium batteries in electric vehicles. Other critical commercial technologies, such as cell phones, are equally dependent on these materials. While commercial industries may not view dependency on China from a national security perspective, they should be concerned from an economic security and liability perspective. In such cases, the DOD should continue to work with these industries to help provide the necessary demand signal to sustain a domestic capability for these materials.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD recognizes the importance of critical minerals to national security. These minerals are present in nearly all the weapons systems and platforms the DOD purchases and uses. Although the department’s demand is small compared to the commercial sector, the criticality of these materials drives it to make investments to ensure a secure supply. The investment strategy is derived from recommendations in the DOD’s report in response to EO 14017, which identified strategic and critical materials as one of the five key focus areas at risk for the DOD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DPA Title III and the IBAS programs, both led by DOD’s IBP office, have made and continue to make investments in the critical minerals industrial base. The IBP office is also coordinating with and leveraging investments made by other U.S. agencies (e.g., the DOE) as well as allies and partners (e.g., Canada and Australia). Beyond increased funding, the additional recommendations outlined in this chapter would help strengthen the DOD’s ability to secure the critical minerals supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The MSP has successfully seeded the importance of mineral security in the global resource discourse.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;nternational cooperation is one of the key pillars of the U.S. government strategy to help address vulnerabilities in the nation’s supply chains for critical minerals. In this context, the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP) is one major diplomatic initiative that specifically focuses on this issue. The MSP has successfully seeded the importance of mineral security in the global resource discourse, elevated critical minerals as a focus of U.S. resource diplomacy, and mobilized a coalition of market democracies to diversify global mineral supply chains. With several modifications, the MSP—as well as U.S. leadership through it—has the potential for a more dynamic, long-term, and durable presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;membership-and-objectives&quot;&gt;MEMBERSHIP AND OBJECTIVES&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Announced at the Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada (PDAC) convention in Toronto in June 2022, the MSP has seen its number of partners grow from 10 countries plus the European Union to 14 countries plus the European Union in the two years since its inception. Some partners are global leaders in advanced technology manufacturing that are highly import dependent on component minerals, while others are mineral-rich advanced economies. A common thread appears to be the desire to see the global supply chains for critical minerals become more diversified and resilient to disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MSP focuses on the full value chains—from mining to recycling—for minerals and metals that are “most relevant for clean energy technologies,” such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, manganese, graphite, rare earth elements (REEs), and copper. In its own words, the MSP addresses four areas of major critical minerals challenges:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Diversifying and stabilizing global supply chains;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Investment in those supply chains;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Promoting high environmental, social, and governance standards in the mining, processing, and recycling sectors; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Increasing recycling of critical minerals.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In engaging mineral-rich third countries, the MSP is committed to ensuring that “minerals are produced, processed, and recycled in a way that helps countries realize the full economic benefits of their resources.” In fact, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations are the defining value proposition to mineral-rich countries, as exemplified by repeated emphasis on these issues in press releases and remarks by MSP leadership. The partnership positions itself as a global advocate for high ESG standards and a promoter of benefiting host localities. As such, resource-rich countries seeking MSP support are expected to demonstrate transparency around bidding processes and the engagement of local communities, while MSP partner countries and their firms are expected to adhere to high ESG standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initiative has emphasized the role of private investment and the importance of transparency in making global mineral supply chains more diversified, robust, and resilient. While the global mining industry has a few leading companies (commonly known as “mining majors”) from market economies—such as Australia, the European Union, and the United Kingdom—the global supply chains for minerals for the energy transition are currently dominated by Chinese companies, whose ascent was facilitated by government support. MSP leaders likely judged—correctly—that reducing China’s preeminence would require private capital to augment the budgetary stream from its partner countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prospective projects, submitted by MSP partners and driven by their companies, are not geographically limited to partner jurisdictions. Proposals are screened and then further evaluated by the project working group based on the investment climate, the need for the mineral, and the potential for investment. The MSP supports selected projects by amplifying their efforts to attract investment and secure financing in various forms, including by offering political support, technical guidance, loans, political risk insurance, or financing through export promotion banks or export credit agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;major-developments-and-achievements&quot;&gt;MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of September 2024, the MSP has begun supporting about 30 projects: 16 on upstream mining and mineral extraction, 7 on midstream processing, and 7 on recycling and recovery. These projects collectively source cobalt, copper, gallium, germanium, graphite, lithium, manganese, nickel, and REEs from around the world, including at least 13 projects in Africa, 6 in the Americas, 5 in Europe, and 3 in the Asia-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No single, official repository of MSP projects—including project terms and progresses—seems to exist in the public domain, but support has come in various forms. U.S. contributions through the MSP have included a $3.4 million technical assistance grant by the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) for Pensana Rare Earths in Angola, a nonbinding DFC letter expressing potential loan provisions for Kabanga Nickel in Tanzania, and a nonbinding letter of interest by the Export-Import Bank of the United States (U.S. EXIM) for potential debt financing of up to $600 million toward the REE-focused Dubbo Project in Australia. Other MSP partner support has included the arrangement of a $105 million debt facility by the German KfW IPEX-Bank toward a graphite project in Tanzania, as well as a mineral-related coordination framework between Congolese commodity-trading and mining company La Générale des Carrières et des Mines (Gécamines) and the government-affiliated Japan Organization for Metals and Energy Security (JOGMEC) that aims to advance coordination in mineral exploration, production, and processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major institutional development was the April 2024 establishment of the MSP Forum, which was set up to “deepen and cement the MSP’s partnership with mineral-producing countries.” Cochaired by the United States and European Union, the MSP Forum has two work streams, one focusing on project development and the other on policy dialogues. Operationally, the project component will be led by the United States, and its scope “may include project information sharing among MSP partners, Forum members, and the private sector,” as well as technical collaboration. The policy dialogue component, led by the European Union, might cover sustainable production, boosting local capacities, regulatory cooperation, application of high ESG standards, and effective recycling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, the forum has expanded the MSP’s operational scope beyond identifying and supporting projects—likely in an effort to dispel the perception that MSP engagement is a new form of resource colonialism by advanced industrialized economies to exploit mineral-rich countries to fuel their industrial needs. While the forum likely helps increase the quality of communications between the MSP partners and forum members (i.e., mineral-rich, non-partner countries), membership does not seem to afford access—automatic or direct—to financial or technical assistance from the MSP, including access to benefits under the provisions of the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act. It remains to be seen whether the forum will effectively advance confidence building between the MSP partner countries and MSP Forum members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, in September 2024, development finance institutions and export credit agencies of the MSP partner governments established the MSP Finance Network. Aiming to “strengthen cooperation and promote information exchange and co-financing,” the network includes nearly 30 participating institutions, including the DFC and U.S. EXIM. This long-warranted development could enhance the scope and depth of MSP support, especially through the successful facilitation of cofinancing by multiple public and private institutions from MSP partner countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;challenges-in-advancing-msp-goals&quot;&gt;CHALLENGES IN ADVANCING MSP GOALS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the MSP has furthered collective efforts to diversify global supply chains for minerals and metals that are important for the energy transition, several challenges have become evident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;clarity-of-purpose&quot;&gt;Clarity of Purpose&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting forward ESG as the MSP’s preeminent value proposition likely stems from the desire of this U.S.-led group of advanced industrialized democracies to distinguish its global minerals activities from those of China. In fact, Chinese-owned mining projects in the Global South have increasingly become subject to ESG scrutiny, as civil society has reported and analyzed. For example, the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre, a corporate watchdog, identified 102 alleged abuses—both human rights and environmental violations linked to Chinese companies’ mining operations overseas, spanning 18 countries—from January 2021 to December 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, even though the MSP seeks to actively “advocate” for high ESG standards—which form its core principles and shape the key criteria in mineral project selection, including the vetting of host countries and investor companies—the MSP has limited operational latitude on this front. The partnership is not set up to formulate its own set of standards or enforce a single set of standards for minerals production, processing, or recycling. Instead, it defers to each partner country to apply and enforce its own standards, hoping to strike a delicate balance between respecting the judicial sovereignty of its individual partners and advancing ESG goals. While such pragmatism likely accords flexibility to MSP operations and agility to its inner workings, it may be obscuring the precise value proposition of the MSP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to ascertain whether—and to what extent—the application of high ESG standards might have limited the number of MSP projects approved or slowed the pace of project selection. Meeting ESG goals entails a long-term commitment that has not come easily even in advanced industrialized democracies. For example, the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act set the stage for financial disclosure under the auspices of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) related to conflict minerals. However, the SEC has stopped enforcing actions against noncompliant companies as of 2017. Therefore, the MSP might reassess the degree to which the application of high ESG standards should dictate its activities. The combination of the robust growth outlook for critical minerals demand and the extreme geographical concentration of mining and processing capacities generates an unprecedented sense of urgency in diversifying and expanding mineral supplies and supply chains. While few would likely dispute the importance of ESG concerns, there appears to be merit in recalibrating how ESG standards interact with the MSP’s objective of “diversifying and stabilizing global supply chains” for critical minerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;financial-support&quot;&gt;Financial Support&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other major challenge for U.S. engagement with the MSP concerns financing. The primary tool for the U.S. government to unlock private capital for development needs is the DFC, which was created through the Better Utilization of Investments Leading to Development (BUILD) Act of 2018. The DFC can use direct loans and loan guarantees, political risk insurance and reinsurance, equity investment, feasibility studies, and technical assistance to support private investments in low- and lower-middle-income countries. It can also support activities in upper-middle-income countries “if such support is certified to have U.S. economic or foreign policy interests at stake and is designed for development impact.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is a misalignment between where the mineral resources are and the income classification of the host countries. Many prospective projects that could unlock additional supplies of critical minerals are in countries that are not in low- or lower-middle-income categories, including Australia (which has 28 percent of the global reserves of lithium and 21 percent of nickel), Brazil (which has 22 percent of graphite and 16 percent of nickel), Chile (which has 36 percent of lithium), and Indonesia (which has 21 percent of nickel). Yet both Brazil and Indonesia are upper-middle-income countries, while Australia and Chile are high-income countries, based on World Bank classifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DFC has a variety of tools to facilitate private investments in not only minerals production projects, but also infrastructure projects (e.g., roads and ports) that support the extractive sector (e.g., mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction). However, DFC support for extractive projects has been extremely limited. Only 14 of the 1,345 projects supported by the DFC and its predecessor agencies since 1999 are in the extractive sector. The pace is picking up, however. Nine of these fourteen projects have been approved since 2020, including six that are related to minerals and metals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The type of support for the six projects varies from technical assistance to equity investments, but the equity investment has been limited to two projects to date. The $105 million of equity is ring-fenced to two of TechMet’s projects—an REE recovery project in South Africa and a nickel and cobalt project in Brazil. The DFC has given a $150 million loan to Twigg Exploration and Mining for graphite mining and processing operations in Mozambique. If the United States is to lead in strengthening and diversifying the global supply chains for critical minerals away from China, greater DFC support for minerals projects will be essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-4&quot;&gt;RECOMMENDATIONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MSP is a major multilateral platform in which the U.S. government has invested a considerable amount of diplomatic capital. Several areas are ripe for improvement and modifications, however, and the United States should pursue the following actions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extend the MSP’s scope to include technical assistance.&lt;/strong&gt; The MSP plays a valuable coordinating role by bringing together key stakeholders and helping to identify and support minerals projects. One area in which the partnership could expand its support is technical assistance to MSP Forum members, especially in the form of geological surveys and resource mapping. Many mineral resources remain unmapped or under-mapped. For example, the absence of a systematic geological survey is one impediment to unlocking Africa’s mineral resource potential. In contrast to surveys conducted by an individual developer, even if it were from an MSP partner country, such mapping could become a communal asset that helps unlock private capital and could aid junior mining companies whose financial resources are more limited.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better align DFC parameters with MSP objectives.&lt;/strong&gt; The following adjustments and modifications would make the DFC better equipped to aid the United States’ role in the MSP, in turn empowering the partnership and granting it more operational flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remove the certification requirement for upper-middle-income countries for project that contribute to critical minerals value chains.&lt;/strong&gt; Critical minerals projects, ranging from extraction to recycling, have “U.S. economic or foreign policy interests” by nature, given the importance and urgency of supply chain diversification. This modification would not negate the importance of screening proposed projects for compliance with other DFC policies but could help redress the existing misalignment between where needed minerals are and the income classification of host countries.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relax the restriction against support to a majority state-owned or state-controlled entity.&lt;/strong&gt; DFC financing is presently geared toward private sector endeavors in the developing world. However, restricting this support to companies that are mostly privately owned or controlled hinders the DFC’s ability to engage key entities in the mining sector. For example, Gécamines, whose commanding ownership of cobalt and copper in Africa has made its coordination agreement with JOGMEC a highlight of recent MSP endeavors, is a state-controlled mining company. In some undertapped mineral-rich countries, the resources are wholly owned or controlled by the state. While reasons vary depending on the country and mineral, the state ownership of minerals can be a result of the process of nationalization that occurred in connection with the decolonialization of developing countries. Permitting DFC support for state-owned entities could help enhance the institution’s operational reach in a sector where the distinction between public and private may not be highly relevant—especially given the historical complexity regarding mineral ownership and the very notion of equity that the MSP Forum seeks to advance.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Begin considering a state financing tool that is not tied to an overseas development mandate.&lt;/strong&gt; While the above modifications merit serious consideration as Congress focuses on DFC reauthorization in 2025, it is also worth exploring if they merit establishing an institutional capacity similar to that of JOGMEC. Affiliated with Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI), JOGMEC has the authority to make strategic investments abroad to enhance Japan’s energy security. Free of restrictions on state ownership or control and income classification, JOGMEC support in the minerals sector around the world has included subsidies to 54 exploration projects, investment and loans to 23 exploration projects (including joint interest acquisition with Japanese companies), and loan guarantees to 8 mine development projects. The most notable accomplishment is JOGMEC’s strategic investment in Australia—a high-income country outside the DFC support scope—in the aftermath of the 2010 Chinese embargo on REE exports to Japan. The $250 million loan and equity deal to Lynas helped diversify Japan’s REE supply sources while also saving the company from bankruptcy. Lynas now produces 12 percent of the world’s rare earth oxides and meets one-third of Japan’s overall REE supply needs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-6&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Minerals Security Partnership illustrates the collective desire of partner countries to counter China’s dominance of global mineral supply chains. Whether the MSP can successfully turn this desire into collective support for economically viable and politically durable projects has significant implications for the pace of diversifying global supply chains and strengthening U.S. mineral security. Modifications to the MSP and DFC could put a new U.S. administration in a better position to succeed in addressing these pressing challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In recent years, both Democratic and Republican presidents and bipartisan members of Congress have increasingly expressed the need to streamline permitting for new mine projects that are environmentally and socially responsible.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With domestic mineral demand forecasted to soar due to America’s burgeoning re-industrialization and overseas mineral supplies imperiled by jurisdictional and shipping risks, members of the U.S. executive branch and Congress increasingly support a modernized permitting system that facilitates the development of domestic mining projects. They also generally back high permitting standards for safety, health, labor, emissions, and the environment, as well as Tribal consultation and community engagement. This emerging bipartisan consensus presents an opportunity for federal agencies to update rules and for Congress to pass laws streamlining permitting for new mines that are environmentally and socially responsible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter addresses the federal permitting process for new U.S. mines that extract hardrock minerals such as copper and nickel. It focuses predominantly on permitting for mine development—that is, building the mine—rather than exploration, production, or reclamation because permitting for mine development is more extensive than permitting for exploration and must also consider production and reclamation. This chapter first provides a historical overview of mine permitting in the United States before describing the current system of mine permitting. The final section recommends actions to the president and Congress to streamline permitting for domestic sustainable mining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;historical-overview&quot;&gt;HISTORICAL OVERVIEW&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The history of mine permitting in the United States can be categorized into three parts: mining expansion, mining efficiency, and environmental protection. For nearly its first hundred years of existence, the U.S. government—both the executive branch and Congress—deferred on establishing a general mining law or code. U.S. courts mainly applied English laws and decisions when mining issues emerged, which rarely occurred. However, the U.S. government’s acquisition of mineral-rich western territories and the resulting legal questions necessitated concrete U.S. laws and regulations. The U.S. government initially sought to generate revenue by leasing certain lands for mineral development, including lead and copper mines, but the system largely failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then in 1866, the federal government enacted a law declaring that federal public lands with minerals are “free and open to exploration” by U.S. citizens and those intending to become citizens, in alignment with “the local customs or rules of miners in the several mining districts.” Amendments to this law were enacted in 1870, and the Mining Act of 1872 ultimately clarified the process for individuals to explore public lands and, upon making a mineral discovery, to acquire mineral rights and develop mineral claims. Given the prevailing national interest to incentivize mineral development, there were low federal fees and no federal royalties for mining on these lands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, English common law usually applied to mineral development on the private lands east of the Missouri River, while the mining laws of 1866, 1870, and 1872 generally pertained to mineral development in the public lands west of the river. These mining laws indeed proved successful in expanding U.S. mineral production. (See the timeline at end of the chapter for a record of major U.S. federal laws affecting hardrock mining.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government tied the national welfare to the continued productivity of the mining industry, so amid declining ore grades in the 1910s, its attitude toward mining shifted to encompass not only development but also efficiency—that is, minimizing waste in the mining process. As long as mining companies sought to reduce wasteful mining, the government generally urged a permissive view toward their activities. It even prioritized efficiency during World War I, largely maintaining its system for permitting mines on public lands. Still, the U.S. government lacked a national mining policy that applied to both public and non-public lands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government attitudes into the mid-1930s continued to emphasize mining efficiency. With the expansion of military programs and eventually the outbreak of World War II, the U.S. government sought to increase its mineral supply through federal mineral stockpiles and subsidies to mineral projects rather than permitting actions for the development of new mines. Meanwhile, it continued to urge mining efficiency and minimizing waste. The most notable permitting action in the 1940s was Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1946, which authorized hardrock mineral leasing on acquired public lands and was anchored by prior laws like the Act of March 4, 1917. During the Korean War, the U.S. government adopted similar stockpiling, subsidy, and mining efficiency policies as it did during World War II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, some mines developed before and during this period had serious negative impacts on human health and the environment, including releases of pollutants that contaminated groundwater and surface water. Starting in the late 1950s, members of Congress increasingly sought to pass laws to help protect the environment. Many of these bills aimed to balance mineral development with environmental protections. In 1969, Congress passed one of its most consequential pieces of environmental legislation, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and it was signed into law in 1970.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time of the law’s passage, the most noted part of NEPA was the creation of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), which was tasked with creating new environmental programs and directing federal agencies to assess the environmental effects of their own programs. But the most significant part of NEPA would arguably become Section 102. This section broadly outlines the NEPA administration process for federal agencies, including environmental impact statements (EISs) for “major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.” Major federal actions ultimately came to encompass federal agencies issuing certain permits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the enactment of NEPA, U.S. mine development slowed amid higher costs associated with environmental compliance, as well as higher energy, capital, and labor costs. In 1970, U.S. mineral exploration and development work declined for the first time since 1966, and mineral exploration and development work declined again the following year. The U.S. Bureau of Mines noted at the time that health, safety, and environmental requirements “strongly influenced” U.S. mineral development. In 1972, U.S. exploration and development work declined for the third-straight year amid the growing costs of environmental regulations and health and safety standards. Congress that year passed several additional laws concerning the environment, including the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments, which largely created the modern Clean Water Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mineral exploration and development work declined further in 1973, and additional environmental regulations contributed to higher costs for U.S. mines through the rest of the 1970s. Capital expenditures per ton of output in the mining industry increased from $25–$30 per ton in the early 1970s to $75–$90 per ton in 1976. Many new mines and capacity expansions were delayed or canceled. Mine development not only became costlier but also took longer: By some estimates, the development timeline for U.S. mineral projects in 1976 was 15 years. For permitting alone, a U.S. Forest Service (USFS) official estimated that the minimum processing time for a mineral lease and mining plan was 3 years. Concerns thus arose in the 1970s that the NEPA process took too long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These concerns persist regarding the cost and length of the federal permitting process for new mines. As discussed in the next section, the laws and regulations that predominantly affect modern U.S. mine permitting today stem from laws and corresponding regulations enacted in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-current-system&quot;&gt;THE CURRENT SYSTEM&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing a mine in the United States today requires federal, state, and local permits, authorizations, and compliance. Which permits are needed depends on the mine’s location and plan of operations. Mines located on public and non-public lands largely require the same federal permits, and a mine’s plan of operations affects which specific permits are required based on how the mine might impact health, safety, and the environment (see Table 1). For example, an underground mine that plans to backfill with mine tailings would require an Underground Injection Control permit under the Safe Drinking Water Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rhwN9DG.png&quot; alt=&quot;image14&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1: Federal Permitting Requirements for Most U.S. Hardrock Mines.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Author’s analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All mines require permits under federal programs, but the federal government has delegated permitting authority to the state governments for issuing certain permits. For instance, most state governments issue National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits pertaining to Section 402 of the Clean Water Act. Mines usually require NPDES permits because their plans of operations affect discharges for stormwater (e.g., rainwater) and mine contact water (e.g., runoff ). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) still retains oversight of state NPDES programs. Similarly, most state governments have permitting authority over Clean Air Act permits, yet the EPA again maintains oversight. These permits are often required for mines due to the crushing and dust associated with their operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for permits needed directly from the federal government, mines generally need a Section 404 permit under the Clean Water Act. This permit is necessary if the mine’s plan of operations involves dredging or filling material—for example, installing a culvert for a stream crossing or building a storage facility for waste rock or tailings—in locations considered jurisdictional waters subject to the Clean Water Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all states except Michigan and New Jersey, the federal government via the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) retains authority over issuing Section 404 permits. The EPA maintains veto power over these permits in all states—and the EPA has exercised this veto, such as over the Pebble Mine project in Alaska. For the USACE to issue a Section 404 permit, the mine project must also receive Clean Water Act Section 401 certification—which the state government issues—and comply with Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, when a federal agency decides to grant a permit like a section 404 permit or approve a mine on public lands, it is considered a major federal action under NEPA and thus requires the lead federal agency to prepare an EIS. This process requires the lead federal agency to assess the environmental impacts of its proposed action and possible alternative actions, including no action. After receiving the mine application, plan, and related technical reports, the lead agency scopes the EIS, authors the draft EIS, prepares the final EIS, and issues a Record of Decision, which is the federal government’s final determination on whether to approve a project’s plan of operations (see Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ryZUVg4.png&quot; alt=&quot;image15&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Overview of National Environmental Policy Act’s Environmental Impact Statement Process.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors elaboration based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2023-04/r9-rtoc-presentation-mining-issues-breakout-spring-2023.pdf&quot;&gt;Environmental Protection Agency, “Mining Issues: EPA Region 9 Regional Tribal Operations Committee Meeting,” presentation, April 20, 2023, slide 18&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a mine that seeks a section 404 permit on non-public lands, the USACE is the lead agency in the NEPA process. The EPA reviews and comments on the USACE’s EISs and can act as a cooperating agency. To illustrate the length of the process, the USACE’s average timeline in 2021 across all types of projects, from publishing a notice of intent for drafting an EIS to publishing a final EIS, was 5.8 years. The Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 did establish a two-year timeline for the federal government to complete EISs, but the lead federal agency can extend the deadline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tamarack Nickel project in Minnesota offers an example of this permitting process. Even though it is located wholly on non-public lands, including both state lands and private lands, federal permits are likely required, including a Section 404 permit under the Clean Water Act and, thus, Section 106 compliance under the National Historic Preservation Act and Section 7 compliance under the Endangered Species Act. Consequently, the project must follow the NEPA process, with the USACE expected as the lead agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For hardrock mines on public lands, the lead federal agencies for NEPA reviews are either the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) within the Department of the Interior or the USFS within the Department of Agriculture. While the BLM administers mining claims on all public lands, including regulations for preventing “unnecessary or undue degradation” to public lands, the relevant surface management agency—either the BLM or the USFS—oversees the mine development. USFS regulations for mining are practically unaltered since 1974, and BLM regulations are largely unchanged since 2001.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, the BLM and USFS permit mines on public lands in the process depicted in Figure 2. For all types of projects reviewed by the USFS in 2021, the average timeline from publishing a notice of intent for drafting an EIS to publishing a final EIS was 5.8 years. For new hardrock mining projects approved by the BLM between FY 2013 and April 2024, the average timeline for the entire process—from the project appearing in the BLM’s records to the BLM authorizing ground-disturbing activities—was 4.6 years. Thus, regardless of the lead federal agency, the NEPA process can be expected to take around five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the Mining Act of 1872, the BLM and USFS further regulate mining on public lands based on whether the public lands are non-acquired or acquired. Non-acquired public lands have always been federally owned, while acquired lands have been obtained by the federal government, such as through a purchase, gift, or condemnation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On non-acquired public lands, the location system applies to hardrock minerals. After receiving authorization, firms and individuals can mine these minerals if the public lands are not closed or withdrawn from mineral entry and by paying a one-time $49 location fee, a $25 processing fee per new claim, and an annual $200 maintenance fee. Mineral production under the location system is not subject to a federal royalty, although some entities—including the Biden administration’s Interagency Working Group on Mining Laws, Regulations, and Permitting—supported imposing federal royalties on these minerals. Conversely, on acquired public lands, the leasing system applies to hardrock minerals. If the public lands are open to mineral activity, firms and individuals can mine these minerals after receiving authorization, but the mineral production is subject to federal royalties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To illustrate the above permitting process, the Thacker Pass lithium project in Nevada is on BLM-managed lands. Correspondingly, plans of operations and reclamation had to be submitted, and because approving the plan of operations was considered a major federal action, the BLM became the lead agency in the NEPA process. Although the plan of operations was received in September 2019 and the final Record of Decision was reached in January 2021, the project faced legal challenges until March 2024 concerning its potential impact on properties spiritually, culturally, and historically significant to several Tribes. Thus, even a relatively quick permitting process can be followed by lengthy litigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In another example, the Idaho Cobalt Operations is on USFS land. The USFS was, therefore, the lead agency in the NEPA process, with the EPA acting as a cooperating agency. With the mine’s plan of operations changing in 2006, it took eight years from the USFS publishing a notice of intent for drafting an EIS in 2001 to reaching a Record of Decision in 2009. As with many mine projects, the greatest environmental concerns were the mine’s potential impacts on surface water and groundwater. To mitigate these risks, the approved plan of operations addressed factors such as tailings and waste rock management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, certain types of mines can receive special permitting coverage under Title 41 of the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act (FAST-41) of 2015. FAST-41 created the Permitting Council to streamline federal permitting by coordinating federal environmental permits and approvals for certain projects; it also created the Federal Permitting Dashboard to enhance permitting timeline transparency and predictability. In 2021, mining was added as a sector eligible for FAST-41 coverage. To be eligible, a mining project must meet different requirements depending on the specific criteria. For example, the “objective” criteria require that the project be subject to NEPA, need more than $200 million in investment, and not qualify for other expedited permitting processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2023, the Hermosa manganese-zinc project in Arizona became the first mining project covered by FAST-41. Although the Hermosa project will involve extensive mine development and mineral extraction on private lands, for which it will need state permits, the planned expansion of the mine operations will include USFS land, invoking the NEPA process and making the project eligible for FAST-41 benefits under the objective criteria. With FAST-41 coverage, the Hermosa project expects a more efficient permitting process, and it anticipates a Record of Decision in 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-for-streamlining-the-process&quot;&gt;RECOMMENDATIONS FOR STREAMLINING THE PROCESS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government—both the executive branch and Congress—could improve the process for permitting new domestic mines by improving permitting clarity, cost, and timelines. An inefficient permitting regime dissuades those seeking to build new mine projects and can cause delays or even cancellation for projects in development. Thus, an inefficient permitting regime limits the pipeline of mines, and those projects take a long time to come online, both constraining and delaying new mineral supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Streamlining permitting for environmentally and socially responsible new mines has garnered bipartisan federal support, including from both the Trump and Biden administrations. For example, the Trump administration’s Executive Order 13953 directed agency heads to, “as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, use all available authorities to accelerate the issuance of permits and the completion of projects in connection with expanding and protecting the domestic supply chain for minerals.” In Congress as well, members of both parties have sought to streamline permitting for mines, best evidenced by the Energy Permitting Reform Act of 2024, introduced by Senators Joe Manchin (I-WV) and John Barrasso (R-WY).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following recommendations seek to promote sustainable mining, helping the United States strengthen its national security, grow its economic prosperity, and pursue its environmental objectives. Recommendations are specifically tailored for the federal government—both the executive branch and Congress—not state or local governments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-to-the-president&quot;&gt;RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE PRESIDENT&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue a new rule that enhances Tribal consultation and community engagement with mine applicants in the NEPA process.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To better address the input of Tribes and local communities affected by permitting new mines, the next presidential administration could issue a new rule that enhances Tribal consultation and community engagement in the NEPA process. An oft-cited study using 2021 data found that a majority of mine sites for nickel, copper, lithium, and cobalt in the United States are located within 35 miles of Native American reservations. In the NEPA process, however, federal agencies—not the mining applicants—are required to consult with the Tribal authorities, who have noted that this interaction is often not timely or constructive. This new rule should require mining companies to consult with the requisite Tribes and engage with the local communities according to set guidelines upon beginning the NEPA process, such as by conducting onsite tours, holding mandatory monthly meetings, and issuing automatic project notifications. Such engagement and consultation would help address issues and thus avoid lawsuits that may arise concerning the NEPA process.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expand FAST-41 coverage under the Permitting Council’s “discretionary” criteria to mining projects that will extract energy transition minerals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To increase the number of mining projects covered by FAST-41, the next president could direct the Permitting Council to exercise its voting authority under the discretionary criteria to cover more projects that will extract minerals on the Department of Energy’s “critical materials for energy” list. The only mining project covered by FAST-41 as of September 2024 is South32’s Hermosa project, despite mining projects having become eligible for FAST-41 coverage in January 2021. Under the objective criteria, a mining project like the Idaho Cobalt Operations would not have been eligible for FAST-41 coverage—even though the mine was subject to NEPA and did not qualify for other expedited permitting processes—because it required less than $200 million in investment. The Permitting Council could bypass the objective criteria’s total investment requirement by voting to cover specific mine projects that will extract energy transition minerals.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue a new rule for the CEQ’s “intensity” factors that establishes clear thresholds for potentially significant impacts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help federal agencies ascertain if projects require EISs, the new administration’s CEQ could issue a new rule for “intensity” factors that establishes clear thresholds for potentially significant environmental impacts. Determining if a time-consuming EIS is required instead of a simpler environmental assessment (EA)—which can take roughly half the time to complete—depends on whether a major federal action (e.g., granting a federal permit) may significantly impact the environment. The lead agency in the NEPA process determines the significance based on the “context” and “intensity” of the action’s impact, and the CEQ defines the context and lists 10 intensity factors. A conclusion or “substantial question” that the action may have a significant impact for one factor triggers an EIS; however, the CEQ does not currently define thresholds for triggering each factor. A new rule that clarifies these definitions would enable agencies to pursue EAs when appropriate rather than favoring caution by immediately drafting an EIS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-to-congress&quot;&gt;RECOMMENDATIONS TO CONGRESS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase funding for more agency staffing to support NEPA reviews.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To better ensure timely NEPA reviews, Congress could increase funding for agencies to hire more mineral experts. In 2016, BLM and USFS officials reported that field offices, which are the specific agency units leading the NEPA process, have limited mining expertise, causing delays. Additional staffing could enable agencies to engage in early planning meetings with mine project applicants and help reduce applicant-caused delays, such as submission of mine plans that lack adequate information and clarity. Thus, adequate staffing with the necessary expertise could help facilitate the NEPA process.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase funding for permit applicants to offset costs associated with the permitting process.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To help reduce the costs faced by mine applicants, Congress could appropriate more funding to defray permitting-related costs. Indeed, the Department of Defense already offers and has disbursed Defense Production Act Title III grants to mine projects to help cover costs related to the NEPA process. This financial support can be increased and expanded to cover additional costs. For instance, mine applicants generally have to pay for third-party contractors assisting in the NEPA process, yet the quality of these contractors varies and leads to corresponding delays. Congress could pass funding for permit applicants to hire approved contractors with a track record of responsive, high-quality work in the NEPA process, both reducing mine applicants’ compliance costs and streamlining the NEPA process.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish categorical exclusions (CEs) for the construction, expansion, or modernization of mines that will produce energy transition minerals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To satisfy environmental requirements under NEPA while expediting permitting timelines, Congress could pass legislation—similar to the Building Chips in America Act of 2023—that treats the permitting of mines for energy transition minerals as categorically excluded from EA and EIS requirements. Illustrating the faster permitting timeline for CEs, the USFS took an average of seven months to complete a CE between 2005 and 2020. To be covered by the CE, a project must produce at least one energy transition mineral as the primary product. For example, an iron ore mine that produces neodymium as a byproduct would not be subject to a CE. Importantly, the covered energy transition minerals should be listed in the legislation and could include those minerals on the Department of Energy’s critical energy materials list.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Timeline of Major U.S. Federal Laws That Affect Hardrock Mining.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-7&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For much of its history, Congress sought to impose a permitting regime that fostered and supported U.S. mineral development, given the importance of minerals to national security and economic prosperity. However, in the 1960s, the legislative branch became increasingly concerned about the impact of mining on human health and the environment. It successfully passed a series of laws to help address these issues, and the resulting regulations and judicial review from administering these laws still affect the permitting of new mines. In recent years, both Democratic and Republican presidents and bipartisan members of Congress have increasingly expressed the need to streamline permitting for new mine projects that are environmentally and socially responsible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These officials cite the necessity of new mines for not only national security and economic reasons but also environmental sustainability, including the adoption of new energy technologies. With the public interest of the government and the private interest of the mining industry generally supportive of streamlined mine permitting, both the incoming Trump administration and Congress could modernize the permitting process for new mines in the United States. As U.S. Geological Survey director George Otis Smith wrote in 1919, “Public interest and private interest in the long run are less antagonistic than either the captain of industry or the public servant has suspected.” Public and private interests now align on the importance of permitting new mines while simultaneously upholding high environmental and social standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Closing the midstream gap in the U.S. supply chain is crucial for safeguarding strategic interests and maintaining leadership in the global technologies that will shape the future.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critical minerals have become essential to the technologies that power modern economies. While much attention is given to mining, it is the midstream stage—the processing and refining of these raw materials—that poses the greatest challenge for the United States. Processing these minerals into usable materials is a critical, yet often overlooked, part of the supply chain. It is essential to explore the key obstacles to developing strong midstream capabilities, examining the historical, economic, and geopolitical factors that have contributed to the current gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the United States has made progress in increasing its mining capacity, the country still struggles to efficiently process these critical minerals. Addressing this midstream bottleneck is essential for reducing dependence on foreign adversaries and building a more resilient supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-midstream-bottleneck&quot;&gt;THE MIDSTREAM BOTTLENECK&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Strategic Blind Spot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. critical minerals supply chain is missing a key component: midstream processing and the conversion of raw minerals into advanced materials. This stage involves transforming mined ores into high-purity metals and producing materials tailored for specific end uses. Although the United States is a significant producer of minerals such as copper and rare earth elements (REEs), it is a net exporter of both because it lacks the infrastructure needed to process them domestically. In 2023, the United States produced more than 12 percent of the REEs mined globally but exported 93 percent of those materials. During the same period, the United States produced 5 percent of the world’s mined copper and exported 32 percent of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These important raw materials—whether mined or recycled—are considered critical to national defense and economic security, yet they are exported at high rates, often to China, where they are processed and converted into finished products. As a result, the United States finds itself exporting its raw materials only to buy them back in the form of advanced technologies like cell phones and electric vehicles. This reliance creates strategic risks that directly affect national security and economic autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without robust midstream processing capabilities, the United States is exposed to serious potential supply chain disruptions. Geopolitical tensions, export restrictions, or price manipulation could significantly impact the availability of critical materials. In recent years, China has implemented multiple export restrictions on critical minerals, particularly targeting raw materials such as gallium, germanium, and REEs, which are crucial for advanced technology manufacturing. In July 2023, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce announced export controls on gallium and germanium products, which took effect on August 1, 2023. These controls require companies to apply for special export licenses, effectively reducing global supply amid fears of a broader Chinese strategy aimed at countering Western semiconductor production capabilities. China has also shown a willingness to restrict other strategic resources, like REES, of which it refines 92 percent of the global supply. Beijing has imposed export restrictions on rare earth processing and magnet technologies, underscoring its readiness to use its near-monopoly position as leverage in ongoing trade disputes, particularly with the United States and the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;History shows that these disruptions are likely to occur at the least opportune times, whether due to a global pandemic, such as Covid-19, or international conflicts, such as the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lack of domestic processing capability means that some of the most crucial U.S. technologies remain vulnerable to the influence of foreign adversaries. The fact that China holds dominant positions in processing for many essential minerals, including lithium (65 percent), cobalt (74 percent), copper (42 percent), and graphite (100 percent), makes this dependence especially concerning. As global demand for critical minerals rises, authoritarian regimes like those in China and Russia are exploiting the West’s hesitancy toward mining and refining, allowing them to nurture U.S. dependence in a deliberate effort to weaken Western technological leadership and economic influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closing the midstream gap in the U.S. supply chain is crucial for safeguarding strategic interests, reinforcing economic independence, and maintaining leadership in the global technologies that will shape the future. This challenge is not insurmountable, but it would be a mistake to underestimate the urgency or complexity of the task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Decoding the Complexities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Midstream processing of minerals typically begins with physical beneficiation, where the ore is crushed and the valuable minerals are separated from waste rock through techniques like flotation or magnetic separation. However, many minerals require further refining to reach a pure, usable form. At this stage, two primary methods are used: pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pyrometallurgy involves the use of high temperatures to extract metals, especially from ores that are rich in sulfides, such as nickel, cobalt, and copper. In this process, the ore is heated in a furnace, triggering chemical reactions that separate the metal from other elements. While this technique is well established and effective for certain ores, it is energy intensive and produces harmful emissions. The significant energy and environmental costs associated with pyrometallurgy make it less appealing for widespread use, especially as industries seek cleaner, more sustainable processing methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hydrometallurgy, by contrast, uses chemicals to dissolve metals from ores, allowing them to be recovered from the solution. This method is often applied to oxide ores, such as those containing lithium or copper, as well as laterites, which are a key source of nickel and cobalt. Hydrometallurgy tends to be more energy efficient than pyrometallurgy and can have a lower environmental impact, provided the chemicals are managed responsibly. For example, different hydrometallurgical techniques are needed in lithium production depending on whether the lithium is extracted from spodumene ore (a solid rock) or brine (saltwater). Brine extraction traditionally involves evaporating water to concentrate the lithium, but newer technologies like direct lithium extraction (DLE) are being developed to speed up the process and reduce water usage, making it more sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Midstream processing of minerals often involves byproduct extraction, especially when dealing with minerals such as gallium or germanium, which are rarely found in high concentrations on their own. For example, gallium is primarily obtained as a byproduct of aluminum production from bauxite, while germanium is recovered from zinc ores. Extracting these byproducts involves hydrometallurgical processes that dissolve the primary metal-bearing minerals, from which trace elements can be separated. Gallium is extracted from the caustic liquor used in the Bayer process for refining bauxite into alumina, which contains only small parts per million of gallium. The gallium is precipitated through additional chemical treatments, making its production more complex and economically viable only when bauxite production volumes are high and market prices justify the added expense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, germanium is typically recovered from zinc smelting residues using a combination of acid leaching and solvent extraction. As with gallium, this adds a layer of cost and complexity to the refining process, often making the economic feasibility dependent on favorable market conditions and the presence of sufficient germanium concentrations in the feedstock. Environmental factors also need to be considered, as byproduct extraction generates additional chemical waste and often involves heavy use of acids and solvents. Managing these waste streams safely is crucial, as improper handling can lead to significant environmental damage, including contamination of water resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge in refining critical minerals lies in the fact that each mineral, along with its specific ore type, requires a tailored processing approach. These processes vary in terms of cost, efficiency, and environmental impact, adding complexity to midstream operations. REEs, for instance, require intricate chemical processes, such as solvent extraction, to isolate individual elements. This process is particularly complex because REEs often occur together in nature and must be separated one by one. Therefore, businesses that maintain continuous, optimized operations—without frequent stops or interruptions—gain significant efficiency advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building a sustainable and competitive midstream processing industry is especially challenging due to the unique characteristics of each mineral. Companies must not only advance technologies that make processing more efficient but also address the environmental consequences of these methods. Innovations like DLE for lithium and closed-loop systems that recycle chemicals and water show promise, but scaling these technologies to industrial levels remains a work in progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the United States faces shortages of skilled labor and advanced equipment, as much of the processing infrastructure has moved overseas. The need for specialized knowledge in metallurgy, chemistry, and engineering further complicates efforts to scale midstream processing domestically. Developing these capabilities will require significant investment, innovation, and a strategic focus on workforce development and infrastructure expansion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-workforce-challenge&quot;&gt;The Workforce Challenge&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the primary challenges to expanding midstream processing capabilities in the United States is the shortage of skilled labor. Successfully processing critical minerals requires specialized expertise in fields such as metallurgy, chemistry, and engineering. Additionally, large-scale industrial operations demand experienced workers who can manage the complex processes involved in transforming raw materials into refined, usable products. Currently, the U.S. workforce is underprepared to meet these demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major factor contributing to this shortage is the decline in the number of mining and metallurgical engineers. According to a 2023 McKinsey report, the number of mining engineering graduates in the United States has dropped by 39 percent since 2016. Similar trends can be seen across other technical disciplines. At the same time, rapidly growing industries like battery manufacturing, semiconductors, and clean energy are attracting skilled workers with higher wages and better career opportunities. By comparison, critical minerals processing is a niche sector with fewer established players and a steeper learning curve, making it less appealing to prospective workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gap in expertise is not limited to technical positions; it also affects management and operational roles. In countries like China, government-backed investments and years of experience have fostered a self-sustaining industry, complete with a robust pipeline of skilled talent. The United States, by contrast, often must rely on foreign experts or make significant investments in retraining domestic workers. This process is time consuming and costly, creating another obstacle to scaling midstream operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without a coordinated national strategy to develop the necessary workforce, the United States will continue to face difficulties in expanding its midstream processing capabilities. Addressing this challenge requires investment in education and training programs that focus specifically on the skills needed for critical minerals processing. These programs must also work to increase interest in the field among new graduates and career switchers. Without a concerted effort to build a skilled workforce, the United States will face ongoing barriers to creating a strong, competitive midstream sector capable of supporting its broader industrial and technological goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;navigating-feedstock-and-market-immaturity&quot;&gt;Navigating Feedstock and Market Immaturity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The availability of feedstock for processing is a critical challenge for the U.S. midstream sector. Mining delays due to local permitting or geopolitical instability abroad in key mining regions can disrupt the steady supply of raw materials necessary to keep processing facilities operational. While some critical minerals are sourced from stable partners like Australia and Canada, others come from regions with more complex geopolitical dynamics. For instance, most of the global supply of cobalt is mined in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a country known for political instability and humanitarian concerns. Meanwhile, the production of REEs is dominated by China, which raises additional concerns about supply chain reliability, given the geopolitical tensions between the United States and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further challenge is the disparity between exchange-traded and non-exchange-traded minerals. Exchange-traded commodities, such as copper, nickel, and lithium, benefit from well-established markets with price transparency, liquidity, and hedging options. These features attract investors and create smoother market operations by allowing companies to manage risks more effectively. In contrast, non-exchange-traded minerals, like REEs and gallium, present far more opaque pricing, limited buyers, and unpredictable supply chains. This lack of transparency makes it difficult for businesses to forecast costs and plan investments, which further discourages the development of processing facilities for these minerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The absence of transparent and reliable markets makes it challenging for U.S. producers to attract private capital. Investors are hesitant to engage in industries where pricing and supply are unpredictable, leading to financing gaps that hinder the expansion of midstream infrastructure. This decentralized nature of the U.S. critical minerals market stands in sharp contrast to China’s vertically integrated model, where state-backed investments ensure a more stable supply chain from mining through refining. In China, government support for mining and processing creates a cohesive market ecosystem that offers stability to investors and businesses alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the United States to build a viable midstream sector, policy support will be essential in improving the transparency and maturity of domestic markets for critical minerals. This could include measures such as those described below to increase price transparency, encourage the establishment of standardized markets for non-exchange-traded minerals, and provide incentives that make investment in these areas more attractive. Without these steps, U.S. efforts to establish a robust midstream processing capability will continue to face significant barriers due to market uncertainties and the unpredictability of feedstock availability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-levers&quot;&gt;POLICY LEVERS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How the United States Can Close the Gap&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To tackle the challenges of developing midstream processing capabilities for critical minerals in the United States, a multifaceted strategy is required—one that integrates government policy with private sector innovation. Several key policy actions can help accelerate progress in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support workforce development.&lt;/strong&gt; Establishing a National Critical Minerals Workforce Initiative will address workforce challenges in domestic projects by leveraging federal programs and tax incentives. The Department of Labor should prioritize critical minerals in the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) to support education in metallurgy, chemistry, and mining engineering. Community colleges can partner with WIOA boards to create certifications and degrees, while regional training centers can integrate into the American Job Centers network, enhanced by the National Science Foundation’s Advanced Technological Education program.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act can also support high school programs in critical minerals, building a talent pipeline. Funding for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) clubs and science fairs can promote interest, and collaboration with the Department of Energy’s Minority Educational Institution Student Partnership Program can encourage underrepresented groups.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Expanding scholarships and loan forgiveness programs will attract talent. The Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant Program can offer scholarships for mining and chemical engineering, while a loan forgiveness program can support graduates in the critical minerals sector, with coordination from the Department of Defense to create a fund under the department’s Science, Mathematics, and Research for Transformation (SMART) program.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish the U.S. Critical Minerals Reserve.&lt;/strong&gt; The United States should establish a U.S. Critical Minerals Reserve to ensure a stable and secure supply of essential raw materials needed for midstream processing, thereby strengthening national security and economic resiliency. This reserve would function as a financial and strategic mechanism to mitigate supply disruptions caused by geopolitical risks, market volatility, and timing misalignments that occur due to the noncontiguous ramp of mining, processing, downstream production, and supply and demand. This approach aligns with the recommendations from the House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party, which emphasized reducing U.S. dependence on foreign-controlled supply chains for critical minerals, especially those dominated by China.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The mechanism by which the reserve would work is straightforward. By lending capital to authorized market makers (AMMs), who will then procure specified critical minerals from allowed jurisdictions, the reserve would support domestic and allied supply chains, stabilize mineral prices, and mitigate risks associated with foreign-controlled resources. The AMMs, backed by private capital to achieve profit, would seek to reduce production costs through innovation while supporting downstream efforts to grow demand. The AMMs would take price risk, backed by federal loans, shifting that risk away from U.S. critical minerals producers. Consequently, the industry would gain resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update permitting to reduce delays and preserve safeguards.&lt;/strong&gt; To facilitate the development of critical minerals projects, it is important for the U.S. federal government to prioritize efforts to update the permitting process for mining and midstream operations. In order to minimize bureaucratic delays while preserving essential environmental safeguards, enhanced coordination between different federal, state, and local agencies will be required. In doing so, a more efficient pathway for obtaining permits can be established, which is crucial for ensuring a stable and competitive supply of critical minerals.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A central component of this approach involves building on the existing Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council (FPISC) to create a centralized “one-stop shop” specifically for critical minerals projects. Presently, navigating the permitting landscape requires companies to interact with multiple regulatory bodies, often leading to redundancies and significant delays. By leveraging the framework of FPISC, a more cohesive system can be put in place—one that aligns regulatory agencies at all levels and reduces inefficiencies. In 2021, mining was added to FPISC’s list of covered projects nder the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act (FAST-41). Expanding the FAST-41 program to include critical minerals projects explicitly would be instrumental in ensuring dedicated personnel are available to manage these projects, providing necessary technical assistance and promoting transparency in the permitting process.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Another key strategy is to increase the use of programmatic environmental reviews and categorical exclusions to expedite the permitting process for critical minerals projects at the federal level. Programmatic environmental impact statements can be developed to evaluate the impacts of broad categories of activities associated with critical minerals in advance rather than requiring repetitive, project-by-project reviews. By covering common types of critical minerals activities—such as mineral exploration, drilling, processing, and material manufacturing—these programmatic reviews can establish baseline analyses. This proactive approach streamlines approvals by allowing subsequent individual assessments to focus on specific site conditions and deviations rather than reanalyzing general impacts that have already been addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;An interagency task force led by the Department of the Interior and including the Environmental Protection Agency, Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and the U.S. Forest Service could provide the structure needed to improve the permitting process. This task force would prioritize developing clear timelines for permit applications, allocating resources to support permit reviews, and offering guidance to companies seeking permits. Additionally, increased funding for the BLM and U.S. Geological Survey will be important so that these agencies can hire specialized personnel devoted exclusively to critical minerals projects, with the goal of reducing approval times without compromising the integrity of environmental assessments.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Amending the America Creating Opportunities for Manufacturing, Pre-Eminence in Technology, and Economic Strength (COMPETES) Act to mandate the expedited consideration of critical minerals projects, particularly those with implications for midstream processing, could serve as a platform for enacting legislation related to critical minerals permitting. By adopting a model similar to the Renewable Energy Coordination Offices within the BLM, a specialized expedited permitting pathway could be established for critical minerals, ensuring that these projects receive appropriate priority.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;By creating a streamlined pathway and prioritizing projects of strategic importance, the United States can foster a resilient and competitive critical minerals sector that is better positioned to meet current and future demand.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-8&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Path Forward for U.S. Midstream Leadership&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To close the midstream gap, the United States must pursue a coordinated strategy that combines policy support, private investment, technological innovation, and workforce development. As the global race for critical minerals intensifies, the United States cannot afford to fall behind in building a robust processing and refining capability. Without it, the country risks not only lagging in technological advancements but also compromising its energy security and economic independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The path forward to establishing a competitive critical minerals midstream in the United States will be challenging. Labor shortages, the need for market maturation, and reliance on foreign suppliers all present significant hurdles. However, the opportunities for U.S. leadership are equally significant. By fostering innovation, investing in skilled talent, and building resilient, transparent supply chains, the United States can strengthen its position as a global leader in critical minerals. This effort is essential for securing a stable foundation for the future of technology, and by acting decisively now, the United States can ensure long-term competitiveness in the global market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;gracelin-baskaran-1&quot;&gt;Gracelin Baskaran&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The United States cannot, and should not, remain on the sidelines when it comes to minerals. But its entry into the international field will have to come with a model that competes on economics and practices.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past 30 years, China has emerged as a critical player in the mineral supply chains crucial for national and energy security. Although it produces only 10 percent of the world’s lithium, cobalt, nickel, and copper, China imports sufficient quantities to process 65 to 90 percent of the global supply of these metals. This dominance is the result of years of industrial planning and foreign policy initiatives from Beijing. For the United States, China’s dominance poses a strategic challenge, especially given rising geopolitical tensions and Chinese export restrictions on critical commodities, including gallium and germanium, which are vital for semiconductors; graphite, which is key for electric vehicles; and antimony, which is used in many defense technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the United States has limited domestic reserves—including less than 1 percent of the world’s reserves of commodities such as cobalt, nickel, and graphite—it must develop a strategy to reduce its dependence and enhance its mineral supply security. The good news is that many resource-rich countries want to work with the United States and its partners to develop mineral resources if they can bring tangible benefits to host jurisdictions. Resource-rich countries want to diversify partners because they have realized that relying on a single country for investment and offtake is a risk. Additionally, Western companies are generally more responsible, environmentally conscious, and attentive to human rights and labor conditions, which can reduce the friction between communities, workers, firms, and the government. The bad news is that the U.S. government cannot command the efforts of mining companies, which are private companies accountable to shareholders. Instead, the United States must create an environment that will enable the private sector to compete with state-owned enterprises and offer more benefits to resource-rich countries. The result should be a new model of mining that is mutually beneficial for companies, resource holders, and U.S. consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the Trump and Biden administrations set out to improve supply through better exploration, production, recycling, and reprocessing of critical minerals. However, the United States’ efforts to secure its supply chain have been reactive and unsystematic, especially in international exploration and mining. U.S. officials often learn about projects after they have been announced, missing out on the chance to coordinate investments with Western partners. In particular, the United States will need to engage in Africa, Latin America, and other resource-rich regions in the Global South.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the world’s most resource-rich countries are among the most difficult in which to do business. U.S. government efforts can enable investment by helping reduce risks for projects and operators. The solutions, however, are not one-size-fits-all. A framework for prioritizing countries is a key starting point—and then identifying how tools can be deployed in these jurisdictions can follow. Approaches can include government-to-government cooperation agreements, technical assistance on legal and regulatory reforms, public-private partnerships, and concessional financing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will also be important to overcome the historical legacy of mining, wherein communities and workers bore many of the consequences of resource extraction, including environmental damage, human displacement, and poor economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States cannot, and should not, remain on the sidelines when it comes to minerals. But its entry into the field will have to come with a model that competes on economics and practices. With a more systemic approach, the United States can enable its diplomats, policymakers, and private sector actors to source the minerals needed to process and manufacture goods that are required for the twenty-first century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government has limited resources—and developing a targeted strategy for engagement will require identifying priority jurisdictions and developing appropriate tools to advance U.S. interests. Given the ever-changing landscape of electoral outcomes, policy changes, and geological discoveries, this chapter establishes criteria for identifying priority jurisdictions—drawn from ample global experience—and makes policy recommendations on how the United States can use financial and nonfinancial tools to advance its goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-framework-for-identifying-priority-jurisdictions-for-government-cooperation&quot;&gt;A FRAMEWORK FOR IDENTIFYING PRIORITY JURISDICTIONS FOR GOVERNMENT COOPERATION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, the United States has primarily engaged with emerging markets through aid and national security initiatives. In 2007, the United States established the Africa Command to address security challenges, with the U.S. military spending nearly $2 billion annually on its operations in Africa. On the aid front, in 2023, U.S. government aid to emerging economies totaled $223.7 billion, of which $53.5 billion was allocated to Africa. Latin America received considerably less—approximately $2.5 billion was requested by the Biden administration for Latin America and the Caribbean in the same year, to be disbursed through the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the United States has done little to engage with these countries from a commercial perspective, particularly in the mining sector. Recent efforts include the Lobito Corridor under the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, a $150 million loan for a graphite project in Mozambique, and backing through the Minerals Security Partnership for the Serra Verde rare earth elements project in Brazil. However, these investments have not followed a cohesive strategy and generally occur in isolation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are five broad considerations that determine a high-potential mining jurisdiction: (1) geology—mineral reserves and quality; (2) policy stability, transparency, and rule of law; (3) quality of infrastructure; (4) the ability to secure and maintain a social license to operate; and (5) historical trade relations and market access. This section draws on examples from across the world to unpack these considerations. However, none of these factors can be taken in isolation; prioritization should be based on their aggregate impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;quantity-and-quality-of-mineral-reserves&quot;&gt;Quantity and Quality of Mineral Reserves&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any strategy must align priority minerals with available resources, taking into consideration recent discoveries, ore grade, and the size of identified deposits. Indonesia serves as an excellent example of a jurisdiction prioritized by investors and policymakers despite its challenging policy environment, driven by rising resource nationalism. Not only does Indonesia have a fifth of the world’s nickel, but it also has some of the highest-quality and most profitable reserves, as is evident through metrics like recovery rate and mill-head grade. (Recovery rate refers to the proportion of nickel successfully extracted from raw ore, while the mill-head grade indicates the average nickel concentration in mined ore processed through a mill.) Among the world’s five largest nickel mines—Kola Division in Russia, Jinchuan in China, Sudbury Operations in Canada, Sorowako in Indonesia, and Polar Division in Russia—Sorowako stands out with the highest recovery rate (88 percent, compared to 25.4–85 percent for the other four mines) and the second-highest mill-head grade (1.68 percent), surpassed only by Russia’s Kola operation (2.3 percent). Indonesia’s dominance in nickel production played a significant role in U.S. president Joe Biden and Indonesia’s then-president Joko Widodo’s decision to elevate their countries’ bilateral relationship to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in 2023, despite Indonesia’s poor environmental track record in nickel production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;policy-stability-transparency-and-rule-of-law&quot;&gt;Policy Stability, Transparency, and Rule of Law&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mining investments are long term, so confidence in the stability of the government and its policies; institutional capabilities to enforce mineral legislation, regulations, and standards; and transparency are all important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite possessing some of the world’s richest copper deposits—boasting ore grades exceeding 3 percent, substantially higher than the global average of 0.6–0.8 percent—and holding half the world’s cobalt reserves, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) struggles to attract Western mining companies due to political instability, corruption, and weak enforcement of laws. At present, Glencore and Ivanhoe are among the only Westerns firms operating in the DRC. Both First Quantum Minerals, a Canadian company, and Freeport-McMoRan, a U.S. company, have exited since 2010. First Quantum Minerals’ departure from the DRC resulted from a conflict with the government over the expropriation of one the company’s major assets. During a visit to the DRC in August 2024, both industry and government officials agreed that corruption is a significant deterrent to attracting Western investment. Without a central tax authority, any government entity can impose a tax and freeze a company’s assets until it is paid. So, despite having some of the best copper deposits in the world—both in size and quality—and half the world’s cobalt, investors remain hesitant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policy stability is a key consideration. As demand for minerals rapidly rises, an increasing number of governments are adopting resource nationalism policies to secure a larger share of benefits from their natural resources. These policies may include higher taxes and royalties, nationalization or state ownership, export control (such as nonautomatic licensing, quotas, tariffs, or bans), and local ownership requirements. In recent years, countries have leveraged bans on raw resource exports to mandate local processing and value addition. However, such policies often elicit mixed reactions from investors. New investors may hesitate to enter, while existing investors must decide whether to comply or divest. Countries that adopt resource nationalism policies on short notice risk signaling policy volatility, which can deter investment. Greenfield investment is drying up in jurisdictions with resource nationalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;quality-of-infrastructure&quot;&gt;Quality of Infrastructure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mining and processing require critical infrastructure, including energy, water, ports, rail, and roads. Mining is one of the most energy-intensive industries in the world, accounting for 10 percent of global energy consumption. Estimates suggest that the mining industry’s energy consumption could grow by a factor of two to eight by 2060.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Affordable and stable base load power can make mining and processing investments significantly more commercially attractive. Saudi Arabia has made substantial investments in renewable energy and boasts some of the lowest energy costs in the world. Its Al Ghat wind project set a record for the lowest electricity cost from wind power—just 1.56558 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) levelized cost of energy (LCOE). Saudi Arabia’s Wa’ad Alshamal project has the second-lowest cost, at 1.70187 cents/kWh LCOE. Additionally, Saudia Arabia has the lowest LCOE for solar photovoltaics. These developments have positioned Saudi Arabia to become one of the world’s largest mineral processing hubs. By 2030, the kingdom aims to be one of the seven biggest mineral processors in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countries with energy shortages are at a disadvantage when it comes to attracting mineral extraction and processing investments. Some of the most mineral-rich countries are among the most energy-poor—and they are overwhelmingly in Africa. In 2022, only 21.5 percent of the population in the DRC had access to energy, compared to 33.2 percent in Mozambique, 36.1 percent in Madagascar, and 45.8 percent in Tanzania. While some companies have opted to build their own energy generation and transmission infrastructure, this adds a significant cost to doing business. In South America, the global mining company Anglo American has made significant energy investments and operates entirely on renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transportation infrastructure is vital for global mineral supply chains. Commodities must move within countries and across borders and oceans. Among the world’s 10 largest ports by volume of goods moved, 7 are in China. Of the 50 largest ports, 2 are in Latin America (Santos, Brazil; and Colon, Panama), and one is in Africa (Tanger Med, Morocco). These ports serve as critical hubs facilitating the global trade of minerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rail is the most efficient way to transport minerals to ports, as the bulk nature of commodities can be damaging to roads. Transporting bulk commodities by rail also generates 75 percent fewer carbon emissions compared to road journeys. Africa’s landmass is larger than the combined areas of the continental United States, China, Europe, and India—yet its 82,000 kilometers of rail is only slightly more than the combined rail networks of France and Germany. Much of Africa’s rail infrastructure has been poorly maintained, with nearly a fifth entirely nonoperational. As a result, most commodities are transported by road. However, roads also present significant challenges. Africa has one of the lowest road densities in the world, with just 27 kilometers of road per 10,000 people, and less than a third of its roads are paved. This lack of infrastructure underscores the rationale behind the Partnership for Global Infrastructure Investment’s Lobito Corridor, which aims to connect the DRC, Zambia, and the rest of Angola to Angola’s Port of Lobito, thereby reducing transportation costs for mineral exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;securing-social-licenses-to-operate&quot;&gt;Securing Social Licenses to Operate&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social license to operate is a concept used to describe the informal and ongoing approval of a mining company’s operations by the surrounding community and stakeholders. Unlike legal permits issued by governments, social licenses are granted by communities and based on trust, legitimacy, and consent. Social license to operate is one of the biggest risks facing mining companies. For three consecutive years—2019, 2020, and 2021—it topped the list of the 10 biggest risks cited by the mining industry in Ernst &amp;amp; Young’s annual survey. Half of the mining executives surveyed identified it as the biggest risk. Looking ahead, executives still rank it among the top five risks facing the industry in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peru is a prime example of the impact of social license to operate on investment. It is one of the only Latin American countries to have seen a decline in investment in recent years. Over the last five years, from 2019 to 2024, exploration investment increased by 21.6 percent in Chile, 26.9 percent in Mexico, 51.7 percent in Brazil, and 105.4 percent Argentina. The only major mining jurisdiction that saw a reduction in exploration investment was Peru, which declined by 12.6 percent. During this time, there has been a substantial increase in social unrest related to mining in Peru. In August 2023 alone, there were 71 mining-related protests. Fitch Ratings, a major credit rating agency, cited mining-related social unrest, protests, and blockades as a significant challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Panama is increasingly viewed as “uninvestable” after social unrest and subsequent government action led to the closure of its biggest mine. First Quantum Minerals’ $10 billion Cobre Panama copper mine was one of the world’s largest copper-producing mines, accounting for 1.5 percent of global copper supply. Since beginning production in 2019, it had accounted for 75 percent of Panama’s exports and 5 percent of its gross domestic product. However, a storm was brewing. In addition to high unemployment and corruption there was also growing resentment over the mine’s environmental impact—particularly river and soil contamination. There was also sentiment that the mine should be in the hands of the Panamanian people rather than foreign companies. Illegal blockades of the international port and mine access road forced the mine to stop production in November 2023. These were the country’s worst protests in decades. At the end of November 2023, the Supreme Court of Justice ruled that First Quantum Minerals’ mining concession contract was unconstitutional. It is hard to see an outcome in which mining companies would want to undertake new projects in Panama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;historical-trade-relations-and-market-access&quot;&gt;Historical Trade Relations and Market Access&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Market access—or a company’s ability to sell goods and services across borders—is a critical determinant of a company’s investment decisions. Market access involves the conditions, barriers, and regulations that impact trade, such as tariffs, quotas, technical standards, and trade agreements. A strong history of bilateral trade—built on stable market access—can make mining investments more commercially attractive to investors. Canada, China, the European Union, Japan, Mexico, and the United Kingdom are among the United States’ biggest trading partners. With the exception of China, which has imposed a barrage of export restrictions, there is little concern that future investments in these countries are at risk. Historical trade ties are a strong signal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Namibia is a prime example of a country with which the United States has strong trade ties—and significant room to increase mineral trade. Namibia is a key beneficiary of the African Growth and Opportunity Act, a U.S. unilateral trade preference program signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 2000 and renewed in 2015. Importantly, Namibia has key critical minerals vital to safeguarding U.S. security interests. Its Lofdal heavy rare earths operation produces 2,000 tons per year of rare earth oxides and has rich deposits of two of the most valuable heavy rare earth metals, which are used in defense systems, lasers, electronics, and renewable energy technologies. Namibia also has the third-largest uranium reserves in the world—a vital input for nuclear power—and has large copper, cobalt, lithium, zinc, and fluorspar reserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;leveraging-the-framework-for-minerals-diplomacy&quot;&gt;LEVERAGING THE FRAMEWORK FOR MINERALS DIPLOMACY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When determining which countries the United States should prioritize, none of the considerations discussed above should be taken in isolation. If geology alone were enough, policymakers and investors would focus on mining nickel in Australia, whose total reserves match those of Indonesia. Unfortunately, higher production costs have rendered Australian nickel uncompetitive. Over the last two years, BHP closed its Nickel West operations and West Musgrave project in Australia, and Glencore shut down its Koniambo Nickel SAS operation in New Caledonia due to unprofitability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If historical trade ties were enough, the United States would have much stronger minerals trade with Latin America. The United States has more free trade agreements with Latin American countries than with any other region in the world. These include agreements with Chile, Mexico, and Peru. Yet, in 2021, Chile exported $28.2 billion worth of copper to China, compared to just $6.5 billion to the United States. Similarly, Mexico, one of the United States’ biggest trade partners, sent 94 percent of its copper exports to China, compared to just 1 percent to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If resource nationalism were the sole determining factor, Vale Base Metals would cease mining nickel in Indonesia, and Freeport-McMoRan would not still have its copper operations there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If social license to operate were the determining factor, First Quantum Minerals would not be focusing its efforts on restoring operations at its Cobre Panama mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If infrastructure was the primary determinant, investors would not be flocking to Zambia. The country is experiencing a 500 megawatt (MW) energy deficit due to a drought that is undermining hydroelectric power generation and causing rolling blackouts. The country also has significantly higher transportation costs because it is landlocked. Transportation costs add 40 percent to production expenses because accessing ports such as Beira, Dar es Salaam, Durban, Lobito, and Walvis Bay is difficult and time consuming. Nonetheless, First Quantum Minerals announced a $1.3 billion investment to expand copper production; Anglo American has returned to Zambia after two decades; Rio Tinto is pursuing an exploration campaign; KoBold, a U.S. firm, is building Zambia’s biggest copper mine; IHC has acquired a major asset; and Barrick Gold has scaled up exploration with plans to create a super-pit at its existing mine, potentially extending its life by 60 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the aggregation of these considerations that determines what constitutes a high-potential mining jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 1 evaluates the performance of selected countries, chosen because they are home to multiple priority resources. The table applies the considerations framework to these countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canada, Australia, and Saudi Arabia are high-income countries with which the United States should pursue collaboration, including providing financing and leveraging subsidies and tax credits, as outlined in the table above. When it comes to emerging markets, Namibia should be a priority jurisdiction. With some infrastructure support, Tanzania and Zambia’s attractiveness could increase substantially, making them important sources of nickel, graphite, and rare earth elements. Argentina, Brazil, and Chile would benefit from building capacity for firms to strengthen their social license to operate through more active benefit sharing with communities. It is no surprise that there is an aversion among Western investors to enter the DRC and even South Africa, or that Peru is one of the only Latin American countries to have experienced a decline in investment over the last five years. Addressing these factors can improve the attractiveness of these jurisdictions to mining companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-for-building-minerals-diplomacy&quot;&gt;RECOMMENDATIONS FOR BUILDING MINERALS DIPLOMACY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has a range of tools it can better deploy to strengthen minerals diplomacy. While discussions often center on concessional financing, the United States’ arsenal is significantly larger. If used strategically, these tools can enhance U.S. supply security and redesign supply chains, enabling countries that have historically exported resources to China to shift their exports to the United States and other Western nations. These instruments can be broadly categorized into four areas: financing, geological mapping, infrastructure, and market incentives. This section offers recommendations for each of these four areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reform the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation.&lt;/strong&gt; The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) was not originally established to finance minerals security needs. However, it has become the primary vehicle for funding such projects overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Two amendments could significantly enhance the DFC’s capacity to support minerals security interests. First, the White House’s Office of Management and Budget should amend its rules to allow the DFC to make equity investments in mining projects. Equity investments send a strong signal to both companies and countries, as government equity can help mobilize additional private capital and foster government-to-government cooperation. Second, revising or introducing legislation to enable the DFC to finance mining projects in high-income, resource-rich countries is essential. Under current rules, the DFC cannot fund projects in countries such as Canada and Chile. Congress could address this issue similarly to its approach with the European Energy Security and Diversification Act of 2019. That legislation authorized the DFC to finance energy projects in high-income European countries, including a $500 million loan guarantee for a liquified natural gas project in Poland aimed at reducing reliance on Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support infrastructure development in priority jurisdictions.&lt;/strong&gt; One way China has advanced its minerals security goals is through infrastructure development. This approach benefits host jurisdictions while ensuring that mining operations have access to essential energy, water, and transportation infrastructure. Such investments are vital for sustaining the mining ecosystem. During the first 10 years of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), it invested $1 trillion, including $634 billion in construction contracts and $419 billion in nonfinancial investments. In 2023 alone, China allocated $7.9 billion to energy investments. That same year, it made BRI investments in 61 countries in 2023, with Africa overtaking the Middle East as the largest recipient. These investments have allowed China to secure raw materials from domestic processing. For example, in 2018, Chile became one of the first Latin American countries to join the BRI, and today, nearly one-third of China’s raw copper comes from Chile.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The United States has several mechanisms for financing infrastructure abroad, including the DFC and Power Africa. Power Africa, launched by President Barack Obama in 2013, was an innovative, government-led partnership aimed at increasing energy access in Africa. Initially, it set out to add 10,000 MW of energy capacity and 20 million connections by 2030. In 2014, Power Africa tripled its goals. However, over time, budgetary appropriations have significantly declined, hampering its ability to operate at the required scale.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To deploy soft power effectively, strengthen minerals diplomacy, and reduce barriers to entry for Western mining companies, mechanisms like the DFC and Power Africa will require substantially larger budget allocations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leverage the U.S. Geological Survey to undertake geological mapping and de-risk exploration in priority jurisdictions.&lt;/strong&gt; Many developing countries remain either unmapped or reliant on outdated geological surveys. For example, 45 percent of Zambia’s land is still geologically unmapped, and the remaining 55 percent was last mapped before 1998. Geological mapping can help de-risk investments for exploration companies, which is crucial given that over 99 percent of exploration projects are unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Building mapping capabilities will require budgetary allocations. Additionally, embedding U.S. Geological Survey attachés at embassies to oversee mapping efforts presents an important opportunity for advancing minerals diplomacy. These attachés could collaborate with geological surveys and mining ministries in host jurisdictions, fostering stronger partnerships and supporting informed resource development strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop carrots—subsidies and tax credits—to incentivize investment in priority jurisdictions globally.&lt;/strong&gt; The lack of U.S. investment incentives has allowed China to gain control over many of Africa’s natural resources. China’s foreign direct investment in Africa grew from $75 million in 2003 to $4.2 billion in 2020, primarily in the mining sector. Similarly, China has made substantial investments in Latin America, focusing on critical minerals, energy, telecommunications, and transport infrastructure. In November 2024, Chinese president Xi Jinping visited Peru, where he launched the first phrase of a $3.5 billion port project aimed at strengthening trade routes from Latin America’s Pacific coast to China.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the value of trade between China and Africa increased from $10 billion in 2000 to $25 billion in 2021—over four times the growth seen between the United States and Africa. In Latin America, Chinese trade has soared from $12 billion in 2000 to $450 billion in 2023. Investment incentives and de-risking measures—such as subsidies, tax credits, and loan guarantees—will be critical for countering Chinese investment and fostering U.S. engagement in these strategic regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-9&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While an “America First” approach and developing domestic mining are important, continuing to lag in emerging markets presents a critical vulnerability for the United States for two reasons. First, the United States lacks sufficient quantities and quality of many commodities essential for national, economic, and energy security. Second, allowing China to continue to outpace the United States in Latin America, Africa, and Asia only strengthens China’s dominance in global mineral supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the United States cannot pursue efforts in every resource-rich country. Prioritizing target countries for minerals diplomacy will be crucial. This chapter proposed a framework for identifying these countries based on five considerations: (1) mineral reserves and quality; (2) policy stability, transparency, and rule of law; (3) quality of infrastructure; (4) the ability to secure and maintain a social license to operate; and (5) historical trade relations and market access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the United States must move beyond discussions about what it should do—action on financing instruments, infrastructure and mapping, and incentives is imperative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mining-the-deep-sea&quot;&gt;Mining the Deep Sea&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A New Minerals Frontier&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;seaver-wang&quot;&gt;Seaver Wang&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China’s multi-sector deep sea mining industry efforts, which enjoy clear national policy backing, stand in stark contrast with the United States’ nonexistent seafloor minerals strategy.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the coming years, scientific, technological, and regulatory trends appear likely to unlock the economically viable and environmentally responsible collection of metals-rich nodules from the abyssal seafloor at depths of several kilometers. Yet despite the potential of seafloor polymetallic nodules to dramatically alter existing critical minerals supply chains, the United States has neglected to develop policies that can help realize the potential of this emerging sector and deliver strategic national benefits. At present, U.S. passivity increases the likelihood that new production from seafloor metals will simply flow to Chinese metallurgical processing plants, exacerbating current patterns of critical minerals import dependence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A robust U.S. critical minerals strategy should immediately break from this trend of inaction and take steps to leverage nodule resources as a new, diversified source of metals to support energy transition efforts. In the near term, given its nonparticipation in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the United States cannot directly access minerals within the international seabed area. Policymakers should therefore take a multi-pronged approach, aligning diplomatic efforts, existing Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) incentives, and policy support for downstream industries to attract nodules extracted from overseas to domestic mineral-processing and battery-manufacturing plants. Eventually, the United States should become a party to UNCLOS, gaining equal access to minerals from the international seabed and helping influence and strengthen international governance of the high seas. Public support for research on the seabed, deep sea technologies, and environmental best practices can also better position the country to compete in this emerging sector. Meanwhile, improved federal mapping of offshore mineral resources in territorial and extended continental shelf waters may identify promising mineral deposits for development under U.S. sovereign authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-new-mineral-frontier&quot;&gt;THE NEW MINERAL FRONTIER&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With each passing year, viable commercial mineral harvesting from the seafloor becomes increasingly realistic. Historical barriers to deep sea mining are diminishing in the face of better resource mapping, improving robotics, and falling cost propositions relative to land-based resources. Spurred by growing demand for minerals for clean energy, regulatory developments for resource collection on the international seafloor are proceeding slowly but steadily. Countries are also increasingly pursuing seafloor mineral resources in their exclusive economic zones (EEZs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2024, the Norwegian government moved to allow exploratory resource-mapping and equipment-testing activities on its offshore continental shelf. Japan has tested the viability of several different kinds of seafloor mineral deposits in its EEZ in past years, most recently discovering a significant concentration of metals-rich nodules in the country’s easternmost sovereign waters in July 2023. In August 2024, India opened up its EEZ for exploration contracts. In the South Pacific, the Cook Islands expects to make key regulatory decisions on seafloor nodule collection within years. Meanwhile, in December 2023, the United States took a key first step toward securing seafloor resources by declaring boundaries for the U.S. extended continental shelf (ECS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under UNCLOS, seabed minerals and extractive activities beyond the boundaries of countries’ sovereign rights fall under the regulatory authority of the International Seabed Authority (ISA), an independent international organization. However, opposition from lawmakers hostile to international seafloor governance has blocked the U.S. Senate from ratifying UNCLOS for over 30 years, leaving the United States one of the few countries not party to UNCLOS and the ISA. Without full membership, it cannot sponsor mineral-related activities on the international seabed. At the same time, the federal government has devoted little policy attention to pursuing hardrock minerals in sovereign waters. Thus, despite seafloor metals’ value as an alternative to import dependence on critical minerals from China, the United States still lacks any meaningful policy strategy for ocean minerals. Without decisive federal action, seabed minerals may simply become the newest entry on a long list of strategic commodities firmly under Chinese state and industry control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three different types of mineral-rich seafloor deposits have historically attracted the most attention for excavation: polymetallic nodules (also called manganese nodules), ferromanganese crusts (also called cobalt crusts), and polymetallic sulfide deposits (also called seafloor massive sulfides). No commercial exploitation of these seafloor minerals is taking place today, although exploration efforts (i.e., resource mapping and equipment testing) have increased in recent years. Some polymetallic nodule and ferromanganese crust resources likely lie in seafloor areas under U.S. jurisdiction, particularly in the Pacific, but these and other deposits in U.S. EEZ waters remain incompletely characterized. Globally, seabed mineral exploration to date has mostly targeted the international seafloor, particularly rich nodule fields in the central and western Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ferromanganese crusts and polymetallic sulfide deposits are tightly embedded into seafloor rock and sediment, making extraction difficult, environmentally challenging, and reliant on excavation techniques akin to those used for surface mining on land. Exploratory testing of systems to mine them remains relatively immature and may prove difficult to balance cost effectively with good environmental management. Because environmentally responsible and economically viable harvesting of ferromanganese crust and polymetallic sulfide resources is likely beyond reach for the foreseeable future, focusing policy efforts on such deposits seems relatively unproductive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, polymetallic nodules are potato-sized nuggets of metallic minerals that sit clustered atop sediment-covered, plains-like regions of the abyssal seafloor, typically at depths of 3.5–6 kilometers (2.2–3.7 miles). These nodules possess rich manganese, nickel, copper, and cobalt content. Collection requires little more than a means of lifting them to the ocean’s surface. Most collector system concepts involve using robotic underwater vehicles that separate nodules from sediment using hydraulic jets, then transporting these nodules via pipe to a ship on the surface using hydraulic or mechanical lifting systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quality of nodule resources and relative simplicity of their collection have made nodules the focus of most exploration efforts. Of the 31 exploration contracts in international waters granted by the ISA, 19 target nodules while only 7 and 5 target polymetallic sulfide deposits and ferromanganese crusts, respectively. Moreover, technology for harvesting nodules is approaching commercial readiness, with several Western operators having successfully tested collector vehicle systems. Chinese state-owned companies, benefiting from coordinated support from industry partners, academic researchers, and national policy, intend to test similar technologies in international waters in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given current momentum, it seems likely that seafloor nodule collection will proceed with or without the United States. How soon this new frontier of metal resources manifests depends on many factors: technological performance and costs, the speed at which regulatory frameworks develop, government policy and scientific support, and the scope of demand induced by commodity markets. In any event, the United States should take proactive steps to leverage deep sea nodule resources. A fresh, ambitious policy approach could establish U.S. leadership in a strategic emerging technology sector and strengthen the national critical minerals supply picture in a single stroke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-do-seafloor-nodules-matter-to-the-united-states&quot;&gt;WHY DO SEAFLOOR NODULES MATTER TO THE UNITED STATES?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Clarion-Clipperton Fracture Zone (CCZ) contains the largest polymetallic nodule field in the world, with 21 billion dry metric tons (23 million tons) of nodules. With a typical mass composition of 31 percent manganese, 1.4 percent nickel, 1.2 percent copper, and 0.2 percent cobalt, the CCZ may hold 6 billion metric tons (6.6 tons) of manganese, 270 million metric tons (300 tons) of nickel, 230 million metric tons (250 tons) of copper, and 50 million metric tons (55 tons) of cobalt. The CCZ alone thus exceeds known land-based cobalt and manganese resources—not reserves—by a factor of two, while holding nickel equivalent to over half of terrestrial resources. This quantity of minerals can produce up to 6.9 billion electric vehicle (EV) battery packs, more than enough to support the global transition to EVs a few times over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seafloor nodules thus offer a tantalizing opportunity to help the United States diversify four critical minerals supply chains at once while supporting domestic EV manufacturing. Chinese industry players currently dominate the value chain for cobalt, nickel, copper, and manganese. Around 70 percent of all global cobalt and nickel processing capacity operates in China, as does 44 percent of global copper refining. Consequently, Chinese firms perform over 75 percent of global manufacturing of nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) cathode materials for EV batteries. This poses substantial challenges to U.S. automakers seeking to meet domestic-sourcing criteria for the critical minerals mined and processed for use in batteries. Manganese nodules could overturn this calculus, playing to U.S. strengths in artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, and oceanographic science while significantly expanding the country’s access to manganese, nickel, copper, and cobalt. Conversely, failure to capitalize on the seafloor nodule opportunity may funnel collected minerals to ascendant Chinese battery technology firms, further cementing their supply chain dominance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, recent economic assessments suggest nodule operations can produce minerals at attractively low prices relative to conventional mining. Seafloor nodules could consequently support low-cost battery mineral feedstocks, increasing the economic competitiveness of downstream processing and battery manufacturing and helping reduce the costs of transitioning to clean energy and transportation technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some challenge whether United States should consider harvesting seabed minerals at all, citing environmental concerns. Nodule collector vehicles will likely disturb the upper 5–15 centimeters (2–6 inches) of seafloor sediment and create a localized sediment cloud while introducing noise and light, disrupting organisms living on or around the nodules. But considering the higher and harder-to-manage environmental impacts of conventional mining on land, policies focused on nodules actually offer the United States an opportunity to help reduce the long-term environmental impact of global mineral supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seafloor nodule operations inherently allow for reduced environmental impacts, continuous improvement in impacts management, and strong enforcement of regulations. First, coproduction of four critical minerals from a single seafloor nodule area yields environmental benefits by obviating the need for multiple different mining projects on land. In contrast to land-based mining where operators must clear and excavate a sizeable area of the targeted landscape before extracting a single ton of ore, impacts from robotic collection are incremental, allowing for ongoing improvements that reduce the footprint of subsequent operations. The technology for nodule harvesting is still young, and successive generations of equipment may achieve better environmental protection—by selectively harvesting nodules with AI assistance, for instance, or by muffling underwater noise from the pipe system lifting nodules to the surface vessel. Ship-based operations, which operate far from human settlements, also offer advantages for regulators seeking to monitor or audit nodule collection activities. Overall, a holistic comparison of seafloor nodules relative to land-based minerals arguably increases the value of nodule resources from a policy perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-current-international-state-of-play&quot;&gt;THE CURRENT INTERNATIONAL STATE OF PLAY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To develop an effective U.S. strategy for polymetallic nodules, policymakers will need to consider the current state of play in international regulations and governance, seafloor exploration and pilot testing, and parallel policy efforts advanced by other nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For international waters beyond countries’ sovereign EEZs, UNCLOS established the International Seabed Authority to oversee and regulate commercial activities on the seafloor. The United States is the sole major country not party to UNCLOS and only participates in the ISA as an observer, unable to sponsor applications for exploration or exploitation contracts. While the Deep Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act of 1979 theoretically tasks the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) with issuing licenses for seabed minerals beyond the U.S. EEZ—with Lockheed Martin holding rights to two areas of the CCZ since 1984—the likelihood of intense diplomatic and political backlash strongly discourages both NOAA and private sector actors from unilaterally claiming seafloor minerals outside the UNCLOS framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since commencing operations in 1996, the ISA has seen seabed mineral collection evolve from a vague hypothetical into a technologically viable emerging industry. Although the authority has implemented a permitting framework for seabed mineral exploration, the original 2020 target date for finalization of a permitting system for mineral exploitation has come and gone, delaying completion of the ISA’s Mining Code. The 29th session of the ISA, in mid-2024, saw the first complete reading of the draft regulations on exploitation. The organization seeks to complete its regulatory framework by mid-2025, subsequently requiring approval by consensus from the rotating 36-member ISA Council and the 170 members of the full ISA Assembly. As per the text of UNCLOS, “consensus” means “the absence of any formal objection,” meaning any council or assembly member can stall codification of ISA regulations. With a growing list of 32 member countries calling for a precautionary pause or moratorium on deep sea mining until the ISA formalizes robust regulations—or until researchers can study potential environmental impacts more extensively—this approval process faces a real risk of failing to reach consensus over the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, U.S. policymakers would be remiss in deprioritizing seafloor minerals on account of the ISA’s sluggishness. The authority only governs mineral collection on the international seafloor, leaving countries free to pursue activities within their own EEZ boundaries. While some countries have committed to applying the ISA’s Mining Code to guide permitting of mineral exploitation activities in their own EEZs, this is voluntary and not universal practice. As such, commercial seabed mining in territorial waters may potentially outpace policy developments at the ISA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ISA regulations are also steadily progressing as underwater technology improves and scientific knowledge accumulates. The newly elected secretary general of the ISA, Leticia Carvalho, has expressed determination to maintain the authority’s neutrality as a decisionmaking forum, as well as delivering a consensus by 2025 on how member states will approach finalizing the Mining Code. Such efforts will gradually facilitate consensus building at the ISA sooner or later. Given the current pace of resource mapping and collector-system testing, a finalized permitting framework will likely see nodule collection efforts move rapidly to full-scale production, spearheaded by both Chinese and Western companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Chinese operators are moving ambitiously to develop international seabed resources, aiming to become first movers once regulations fall into place. Overlooked by most media reporting and unhindered by environmental activists, Chinese research institutions, state-owned enterprises, and private sector partners are investing significant efforts into resource surveys and technology development for the exploitation of the three main seafloor mineral resource types. This network of corporations and research centers can fully study, finance, build, and operate all components of a maritime minerals industry, including robots, specialized vessels, and onshore ore processing facilities. Many of these deep sea mapping, monitoring, and robotics platforms possess military dual-use value for submarine, anti-submarine, and reconnaissance operations and for targeting seafloor pipelines and cables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s multi-sector deep sea mining industry efforts, which enjoy clear national policy backing, stand in stark contrast with the United States’ nonexistent seafloor minerals strategy. The Chinese state-owned firms Beijing Pioneer and China Minmetals Corporation plan to conduct nodule collector field tests in 2025. Beijing is also the largest financial contributor to the ISA and plays an active role in negotiations, vocally advocating for a firm pathway toward finalizing the ISA’s regulations on exploitation. Overall, China holds five ISA exploration contracts, the most of any single country: three for nodules, one for ferromanganese crust, and one for polymetallic sulfides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the remaining 26 ISA contracts, U.S. partners through NATO and the Minerals Security Partnership hold a total of 15 contracts, including 8 for nodules. However, only Belgium, India, Japan, and South Korea have shown clear interest in developing minerals on the international seafloor, while the remaining 4 contracts for nodules belong to U.S. allies—Germany, the United Kingdom, and France—that have expressed some opposition to near-term commercial-scale nodule collection. Importantly, small island states hold an additional 5 nodule exploration contracts, 4 of which—Cook Islands, Kiribati, Nauru, and Tonga—partner with U.S.- and Canada-based companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, current international nodule exploration efforts remain competitive with Chinese programs from a technological, business, and resource-quantity perspective but exhibit more vulnerabilities to activist opposition and shifting national policies. The selection of players that will emerge as early leaders in nodule collection and related deep sea technologies thus remains an open question—one the United States still has opportunities to shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-5&quot;&gt;RECOMMENDATIONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to China’s efforts—characterized by significant capital investment, active ISA participation, and the tight integration of government, academic, and industry work—the United States essentially does not possess a national policy strategy on seafloor minerals. Over the past three decades, the federal government has not moved meaningfully to update and modernize regulations governing offshore minerals and has undertaken only sporadic efforts to research seabed mining. Broader underinvestment in critical minerals supply chains, such as the current lack of any operating domestic nickel- or cobalt-refining facilities, also inhibits U.S. competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might conclude that Washington should seek to ratify UNCLOS to gain access to polymetallic nodules and other resources and secure stronger legal protections for the United States’ extended continental shelf. However, ISA membership will only allow U.S. access to nodules over the long term. The immediate benefit of ratifying UNCLOS would be geopolitical: The United States has endeavored to protect freedom of maritime navigation with neither the ability to hold leadership positions at UNCLOS institutions nor access to the UNCLOS dispute settlement framework, while also enduring accusations of hypocrisy for enforcing a treaty it is not party to. At the ISA, it would be playing catch-up, with limited ability to help formulate initial ISA Mining Code rules, regulations, and procedures. Meanwhile, the United States would require significant lead time to directly sponsor new applications that secure contracts to explore and exploit international seabed resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While accession to UNCLOS would greatly strengthen U.S. maritime interests, political constraints pose obstacles not only to Senate ratification but also to seafloor mineral policy in general. Some conservative policymakers have consistently blocked UNCLOS ratification, arguing that participation would require the United States to relinquish sovereign powers to international institutions. Meanwhile, the State of Hawaii recently joined California, Oregon, and Washington in enacting a moratorium on mineral exploitation in state coastal waters (which typically extend to 3 nautical miles offshore). These moratoria pose minor implications for critical minerals, as the vast majority of hardrock mineral deposits are located further offshore. Yet these state policies highlight interest from other, liberal political coalitions in opposing ocean mineral exploration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such political tripwires pose difficulties for developing seafloor mineral policies that can secure bipartisan support. However, measures to establish downstream U.S. access to polymetallic nodules, coupled with support for offshore resource mapping, deep sea technology development, and onshore nodule processing, may be able to attract broader political buy-in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the near term, the United States should strive to position itself as a promising destination for processing nodules and incorporating refined minerals into the domestic battery supply chain. One of the advantages of nodule resources is that the United States could receive nodule materials without holding ISA contracts of its own, as long as domestic facilities can refine the metals competitively. Inaction will allow Chinese metallurgical industries to master nodule processing, gaining a monopoly even on nodules collected by non-Chinese operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the United States can pursue several actions to gain advantages in this sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clarify existing policies to better support development of a domestic processing sector.&lt;/strong&gt; The domestic critical minerals component of the IRA’s 30D EV tax credit provides a strong incentive for battery and EV manufacturers to source eligible metals mined or processed domestically or by free trade agreement (FTA) partners. Yet neither the IRA nor subsequent Department of Treasury guidance has addressed the eligibility of minerals sourced from the international seafloor. Clarification that collected nodules brought to the United States and FTA partners as the first port of call would count toward the Treasury Department’s Traced Qualifying Value Add Test for the 30D credit would incentivize bringing harvested nodules to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fund research and pilot projects for nodule processing.&lt;/strong&gt; Mineral recovery from nodules will require different processing steps and workflows, opening a window for new market entry. Onshore processing of nodules will likely utilize many smelting and chemical-leach processes either in wide practice or with previous commercial-scale precedent. But polymetallic nodules are not a standard feed material for metallurgical refineries and will require unique process flowsheets, of which industry actors are currently engaged in lab and pilot-scale testing. Full process demonstration and product quality verification help operators prove their viability and move toward full-scale projects. As such, nodule-processing pilot and demonstration projects could benefit greatly from Department of Energy and Department of Defense awards through the IRA’s 48C credit, the Defense Production Act Title III office, and the Loan Programs Office.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But making the United States a destination for harvested nodules depends on the overall economic viability of domestic mineral-processing operations. As such, broader efforts to improve the competitiveness of domestic processing and refining—through affordable energy inputs, permitting reforms, and policy interventions to combat price volatility—will also help make the United States more attractive as a host country for downstream industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incorporate polymetallic nodule collection into the United States’ international critical minerals strategy.&lt;/strong&gt; The Department of State should proactively identify opportunities to expand the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP) to countries that ambitiously pursue nodule collection. Diplomatic engagement, technical assistance, and facilitated financing could strengthen early efforts by states such as the Cook Islands, Jamaica, or Nauru to develop nodule resources. Such partner countries could even consider sponsoring U.S. firms to explore or exploit nodules on the international seabed. Policymakers can similarly coordinate with existing MSP partners such as India, Japan, or South Korea that are advancing EEZ seafloor mineral exploration efforts. Robust diplomatic efforts can not only help diversify supply chains but also create new avenues for U.S. access to nodules.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deepen scientific understanding of seafloor minerals to improve public opinion, study offshore mineral potential, and advance better environmental and economic outcomes.&lt;/strong&gt; Infrequent policy attention toward offshore hardrock minerals over the past few decades has left much of the extended continental shelf unexplored by modern oceanographic sensing techniques. Surveying efforts can support and expand upon the efforts of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and U.S. Geological Survey to catalog a National Offshore Critical Mineral Inventory, potentially identifying promising new U.S. offshore deposits through mapping and characterization. Other research should seek to quantify industry-related questions such as life-cycle environmental impacts and economic feasibility. Many of these activities can inform longer-term modernization of federal regulations for leasing and permitting offshore minerals. Federal agencies can also help engage environmental activists’ concerns through reports that review the scientific literature on potential impacts from seafloor nodule collection, track advances in collection system technologies, and highlight remaining questions and opportunities for impact mitigation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combined, these actions can position the United States far more competitively on polymetallic nodules, a substantial new critical minerals resource with the most promise for sustainable and economic development among known seabed mineral deposit types. Nodule collection can allow the United States to dramatically diversify four key metal supply chains for the clean energy transition while simultaneously reducing environmental impacts associated with these raw materials. Decisive policy efforts in this area can also strengthen nationally important industries such as robotics and deep sea capabilities, enhance U.S. overseas partnerships, and elevate U.S. leadership in strategic international forums. A new Congress and executive administration should not hesitate to integrate seafloor nodules into the nation’s critical minerals strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Leading mining practices today can ensure that critical minerals are produced with minimal freshwater use, a small footprint on land, few if any local or global air pollutants, and a net-positive impact on plants and animals.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction-1&quot;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mining is an ancient industry, with evidence of copper piping used in Egypt from 2500 BC and other more basic uses of metals and minerals stretching back many centuries further. Yet modern and responsible mines bear little resemblance to the rudimentary and often damaging practices of bygone eras. Leading mining practices today can ensure that critical minerals are produced with minimal freshwater use, a small footprint on land, few if any local or global air pollutants, and a net-positive impact on plants and animals. In addition, such projects enjoy the support of local communities and Indigenous peoples; contribute to local and regional economic development through jobs, taxes, and infrastructure; and ensure the health and safety of workers and neighbors. Many such examples exist in the United States and around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet for every example of responsible mining, there are numerous examples of irresponsible practices, past and present. Polluted lands and water, a depleted state of nature, and long-term health impacts on workers and communities are a reality for many mining communities today. At least 23 million people are estimated to live on floodplains contaminated by potentially harmful concentrations of toxic waste from metal mining. Mining activities have also often been linked to human rights violations, conflict, and corruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any industry—particularly one as diverse as mining, which has an estimated 25,000 companies operating in 140 countries globally—has a range of responsible and irresponsible actors. The reputation of the overall industry is shaped disproportionately by the actions of the less responsible, setting in motion a vicious cycle that continues to create the space for irresponsible mining. A poor reputation for mining overall means less public and community support for new mines, which discourages responsible companies from seeking to operate, especially as developing a new mine can require billions of dollars before the first ore is extracted. Land is thus left open for illegal and irresponsible operators to take over, often undetected—as mining activities often take place in remote locations, governments may struggle to enforce local laws and regulations (where they exist), particularly in countries where the state has less capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it may be impossible to eliminate all irresponsible mining everywhere, it is possible to make responsible mining the norm in the United States and its allied countries. Doing so requires action on three fronts: regulatory measures, voluntary standards, and market mechanisms. Each is discussed below, and regulatory measures are covered in more detail in Chapter 10 by Morgan Bazilian and Gregory Wischer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;regulatory-measures&quot;&gt;REGULATORY MEASURES&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mining is by nature a highly regulated industry in the United States and in most countries. Aside from mining-specific laws, a range of environmental, social, and economic legislation typically applies, such as the National Environment Policy Act and the Clean Water Act. Both are necessary and potentially useful, as they provide the requisite infrastructure through which to ensure responsible mining practices. Yet there are several challenges regarding the application of regulatory measures to mining. A new mine can require hundreds—and in some cases, thousands—of permitting obligations, take years of effort prior to approval, and put significant financial investment at risk. The substance of these requirements, however, are essential social and environmental safeguards that should be preserved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is industry and government consensus that there is excessive bureaucracy, uncertainty, and complexity in current legislation and its application in the United States. Globally, there is data for 127 mines that have come online since 2002 and the discovery-to-production process has taken an average of 15.7 years. The United States is significantly behind the global average. A recent study by S&amp;amp;P Global on behalf of the U.S. National Mining Association showed that the country has the second-longest mine development times in the world, at almost 29 years on average from first discovery to first production—second only to Zambia, at 34 years. The rate of slow mine development is problematic. The expected demand for copper alone is likely to result in the need for between 35 and 195 large new copper mines over the next 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How, then, can the permitting process be streamlined while maintaining strong social and environmental safeguards? There are three important methods the U.S. government can consider, drawing from the experience of other jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implement a “one-stop-shop” mechanism.&lt;/strong&gt; While the form of this mechanism will no doubt vary from country to country, it would not only cut through the complex systems of regulations but, crucially, could also ensure authorities strike the right balance between fast-tracking applications and implementing social and environmental safeguards. For instance, the EU Critical Raw Materials Act (CRMA) allows for “strategic projects” (defined as those that extract identified strategic raw materials) to benefit from a streamlined and predictable process to help project developers navigate the national permitting systems. This approach is designed to expedite permits through a single authority and administrative system, while at the same time ensuring that environmental review, public participation, and sustainability remain embedded in the approval process. This is difficult—if not impossible—to achieve without a single point of contact. Other countries that already have or are considering similar single-point systems include Chile, Oman, and Saudi Arabia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set some “non-negotiable” elements while allowing flexibility in others, ensuring that expedited permitting can go hand in hand with high standards.&lt;/strong&gt; For instance, the CRMA’s non-negotiable requirements include compliance with the conditions set in the directives on habitats (92/43/EEC), water (2000/60/EC), and birds (2009/147/EC), as well as in the European Union’s recent Nature Restoration Law. If it meets these criteria, a strategic project can benefit from the expedited permitting process even if it has residual negative impacts in other areas. Another way the CRMA strikes this balance is to exclude the time the project developer takes to complete the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) from the rapid-approval time window. This exclusion is because the EIA is the responsibility of the project developer, and it ensures that the EIA process is not unduly rushed and that steps are not skipped. With this protection in place, the act further streamlines the process by requiring that a decision on “screening” under the EIA directive (2011/92/EU) should be made within 30 days, rather than a previous timeframe of 90 days, and that the maximum time for public participation in the EIA process should not exceed 85 days.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coordinate, cross-link, or “nest” requirements of different acts within one another.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, in Western Australia, the Mining Act and the Environmental Protection Act are coordinated. In addition, the country’s Department of Mines and Petroleum has a memorandum of understanding with its Environmental Protection Authority that delegates certain tasks to the former. Various conditions—in accordance with various laws—are appended to the licenses obtained under the Mining Act. Furthermore, the Mining Act links the granting of mining rights to provisions on how the environment should be handled. This effectively consolidates all environmental provisions within the legislation, in turn ensuring a streamlined and administratively efficient process while minimizing gaps and overlaps that could lead to poor environmental or social outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But regulatory reform is only one way to encourage responsible mining. An often more powerful lever is the effect of voluntary standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;voluntary-standards&quot;&gt;VOLUNTARY STANDARDS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past two decades, numerous voluntary standards for responsible mining have been developed, mostly initiated by the mining industry itself. One of the earliest examples is the Mining Principles put forth by the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) in 2003. Adopting these principles is a condition of membership for the organization’s 24 mining and metals companies, which collectively make up approximately one-third of the global industry across 650 sites in over 50 countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other notable examples include the Towards Sustainable Mining program developed by the Mining Association of Canada, which has now been adopted in several other countries; the Copper Mark, which brings together the mining and business components across the value chain through a robust assurance system; and the Responsible Gold Mining Principles developed by the World Gold Council. Each of these standards aims to promote continuous improvements in responsible mining practices for the facilities that voluntarily elect to adopt them. There are important differences across them, however, as they have varying levels of breadth (number of topics covered), depth (the specificity of performance requirements), governance (who decides what is or is not covered by the standard and how claims are assessed), and assurance systems (how third-party verifiers are required to substantiate claims made against the standard).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to “upstream” or mining-specific standards, various “downstream” or product-specific standards have also been developed, including, among others, ResponsibleSteel and the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative. These standards are focused on individual commodities and therefore seek to cover all stages of the value chain, from the initial extraction of the ore through the various processing stages to the development of the final product. They are best thought of as “product-back” standards that contrast with the upstream systems, which can be seen as “mining-forward.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge today is that the mining companies that self-identify as being responsible often apply multiple voluntary standards, which adds significant costs and audit burdens in addition to causing confusion and complexity for stakeholders. On the other hand, large portions of the 25,000-strong overall mining industry adopt no voluntary standards at all, thus escaping the scrutiny and discipline that come with the disclosure requirements associated with these standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are ways to maximize the effectiveness of voluntary standards as a tool to drive more responsible mining. Primary among these methods is support for the consolidation of existing standards. The current landscape of voluntary standards is crowded, confusing, and cumbersome for both the companies that apply them and the stakeholders who rely on them. ICMM, the Mining Association of Canada, the Copper Mark, and the World Gold Council are already in the process of consolidating their standards into one global system with independent, multistakeholder oversight. Additional efforts should be supported by resisting any attempts to create further standards and incorporating—where relevant and appropriate—compliance with high-quality voluntary standards, as the European Union refers to in its Critical Raw Materials Act. Conformity with high-quality voluntary standards could also be made a condition of public procurement to help scale up adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Voluntary and regulatory mechanisms can be complementary tools to drive the widespread adoption of responsible mining practices. However, there is a third category of actions that is necessary to enable the maximum uptake of such practices: market mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;market-mechanisms&quot;&gt;MARKET MECHANISMS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While metals and minerals are bought and sold in a variety of ways, including direct sales from producers to customers (who may still transform or on-sell the product), commodity exchanges such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or London Metal Exchange (LME), and illegally or “off-the-books” trading, particularly in the case of precious metals such as gold. By and large, individual tons of a particular commodity of a specified grade are indistinguishable from each other and have the same essential chemical and physical properties, irrespective of whether they were produced using responsible or irresponsible methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fungibility of metals gives rise to a major challenge in making responsible mining the norm. Put bluntly, as long as there are both a clean-but-expensive way of mining and a cheap-but-dirty way, many will choose the latter since the customer cannot usually tell the difference based purely on the attributes of the product. This is different from, for example, farm produce, for which irresponsible practices such as excessive use of fertilizer could be ascertained through visual or chemical testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This perverse incentive for irresponsible practices is made worse by the lack of a well-developed mechanism for pricing metals differently based on their provenance or quality of production. This is most acute in the case of commodity trading platforms such as the LME, which essentially uses a single reference price for a commodity. The LME has responsible sourcing requirements traders must satisfy before being able to do business on the platform, theoretically setting a “floor” of responsible mining practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, beyond this, there are few if any mechanisms currently available on exchanges such as the LME to allow commodities to be priced higher if they have been produced more responsibly or, conversely, priced lower if they lack certain assurances on their provenance or performance on sustainability criteria. This has come into sharp focus in the case of nickel, where the divergence between responsible and irresponsible practices can be quite large. In particular, the greenhouse gas emissions associated with production can vary by orders of magnitude even within the same class of nickel, which is based on method of production. Despite a growing call, particularly from Western producers, for the LME to introduce differential pricing for “green nickel,” the exchange has not yet moved to create such tiered pricing, citing a lack of liquidity and critical mass and highlighting the risk of the market not working efficiently if contracts were to be subdivided further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the challenge lies in defining “green.” There is as much debate about what metrics should be considered (should it only be greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental factors, or should it also include social performance?) as what data would be used and how it would be collected and assured (would site-level Scope 1 and 2 emissions suffice, or would it need to include upstream and downstream Scope 3 emissions, too?). The lack of clarity around these issues has curtailed the development of tiered pricing mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, operators that do not appear to follow any voluntary codes have flooded the market with metal produced amid credible allegations of environmental destruction. This has caused the shuttering of large nickel companies that do follow voluntary responsible mining practices, such as the Nickel West operations and the West Musgrave project in Australia. This trend can be expected to continue unless there are efforts made to reward those following responsible practices through some form of price mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These risks to market efficiency are real and need careful work and attention—especially given the even bigger challenge posed by not having clear market mechanisms to incentivize responsible production. The solution may not be merely to institute a “green premium,” but could include provisions such as tiered pricing in public procurement or other requirements for market access. However, these proposals all depend on having clear and commonly accepted definitions of “green” and “responsible” production, hence the need for consolidation and harmonization of voluntary standards, as previously mentioned, and clarity on how these fit with regulatory requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-6&quot;&gt;RECOMMENDATIONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the analysis of regulatory, voluntary, and market mechanisms to encourage responsible practices, the U.S. government should:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a national panel on mining.&lt;/strong&gt; This idea emanates from the Towards Sustainable Mining (TSM) voluntary scheme developed by the Mining Association of Canada. The TSM Community of Interest Panel is an independent group of stakeholders, communities, and nongovernmental organizations that oversees the implementation of the standards program. Consisting of 12 to 15 members, the panel is designed to provide guidance to auditors and implementers on the issues of particular importance and resonance in the local context.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The United States could benefit from importing and adapting this panel structure, even if it currently does not and may never adopt the TSM program. Such panels, which include cross-stakeholder dialogue leading to improved understanding and trust building, are useful and important in their own right, even if not anchored to a voluntary scheme. A U.S. version could help shape domestic regulation, inform policy discussions, and resolve conflicts. And it may not need to be a single body but could instead involve multiple panels for different regions. Engaging the National Mining Association to explore the feasibility of such a mechanism would be an appropriate early step.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incorporate voluntary responsible mining standards into trade agreements.&lt;/strong&gt; Over the past 10–20 years, governments in both producing and consuming countries have increasingly incorporated voluntary sustainability standards into trade policy instruments—particularly free trade agreements (FTAs)—to address environmental, social, and economic concerns regarding commodity production and trade. Before 2018, there were only 17 FTAs worldwide referring to Voluntary Sustainability Standards (VSS) across different sectors. However, almost half of all new agreements over the following five years referred to them in some way.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There is no notable example of voluntary responsible mining standards being included in FTAs, and research on commodity-specific standards being included in such instruments is limited and available only for certain agricultural products. Yet including such standards in trade agreements would be uniquely suited for the United States, given its importance in the global trade ecosystem and its ability to use trade to influence practices both domestically and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There are different ways in which voluntary mining standards could be incorporated into trade agreements. These can range from loose to broad measures, including exchanging information on the provenance and socio-environmental performance of commodity production and promoting cooperation in areas such as labeling, to more specific aspects, such as giving preferential treatment to products that are certified under particular schemes. The most notable example of this from another sector is the European Free Trade Association (EFTA)–Indonesia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, whereby palm oil imported into Switzerland from Indonesia benefits from preferential tariff treatment if producers comply with one of three specified voluntary schemes.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;It would not necessarily be advisable to include specific criteria in the case of mining and metals given the rapidly changing landscape of responsible mining standards, but such incentives could be considered by indicating the attributes schemes need to have rather than naming particular ones.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support the development of “green premium” instruments.&lt;/strong&gt; Venues where commodities are traded, such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, face legitimate barriers to developing instruments that would offer suppliers of responsibly produced metals a “green premium.” At the same time, the industry’s ability to voluntarily develop such mechanisms is limited by antitrust laws and regulations, which prohibit coordination action by producers who might collude to manipulate or otherwise alter prices. This gives the U.S. government the opportunity to explore various mechanisms for supporting the development of green premiums.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;First, U.S. public entities can participate in buyers’ clubs that favor and reward responsible producers of mineral-based products. A notable example is the Sustainable Steel Buyers Platform, which aims to pool demand for responsible steel from different buyers, thus giving impetus and scale to the producers of these commodities. Having a deliberate focus to participate in such initiatives can ensure that through their sizeable purchases of minerals, U.S. public entities help grow the market for responsibly produced products.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Second, the United States can facilitate or lead the development of a multilateral pilot initiative among leading Western commodity exchanges to assess the feasibility of pooling trading activities in a way that provides large enough markets for contracts to be priced based on sustainability criteria. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the London Metal Exchange would be the most obvious participants in such a pilot. This could be funded by the U.S. government, thereby overcoming one of the main barriers holding back the development of such instruments: the lack of liquidity in any individual exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-10&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a segment of society that believes any form of extraction from the earth is by definition irresponsible, the term “responsible mining” seems an oxymoron. Yet mineral production can incorporate a wide range of responsible practices. Given the essential role of metals and minerals in modern society and the reality of the need to extract significantly greater quantities in the future, there is perhaps no more urgent question than how to make this production as responsible as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has an essential role to play in this regard, both domestically and abroad. The three most salient actions the U.S. government can take include establishing a national panel on responsible mining, incorporating voluntary standards into trade frameworks, and supporting the development of green-premium instruments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Washington cannot assume that traditional alliances or free trade agreement status indicate alignment with U.S. security interests.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States’ dependence on foreign rivals, especially the People’s Republic of China (PRC), for critical and strategic minerals presents a material vulnerability to its industrial, energy, and defense sectors. This vulnerability quietly developed over decades, only coming to public attention in 2010 after Beijing banned the export of rare earth elements (REEs) to Japan. Although Washington has elevated critical minerals as a top security issue, the United States remains dependent on an increasingly adversarial China. This chapter explores the importance and urgency of the United States developing resilient and secure critical minerals supply chains and recommends a comprehensive strategy to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lessons-not-learned&quot;&gt;LESSONS (NOT) LEARNED&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States’ dependency was decades in the making. The United States and Europe were both happy to offshore low-margin and oftentimes heavy and polluting industries to other nations and import the refined goods on a just-in-time basis. This system worked well for years. However, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has forced Washington to confront its out-of-sight, out-of-mind reliance on China multiple times across the past three presidential administrations. Presidents Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and Joe Biden each responded to China’s provocative actions differently—but incompletely, given its continued dominance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-obama-years&quot;&gt;The Obama Years&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Obama assumed office as China dramatically increased its military spending, replaced Japan as the United States’ largest foreign creditor, and in 2010 became the world’s second-largest economy. During his term, Beijing publicly launched the Belt and Road Initiative, a strategy of coercive investments designed in part to lock up natural resources for China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2010, Japan detained a Chinese trawler captain after repeated instances of illegal fishing and ramming Japanese coast guard vessels. In response, China temporarily banned the export of REEs to Japan and implied that it would impose new quotas. These actions skyrocketed REE prices by more than 400 percent, drawing condemnation from Washington and Brussels. In response, the Obama administration (joined by Japan and the European Union) initiated a World Trade Organization (WTO) case against China in 2012, stating:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Now, if China would simply let the market work on its own, we’d have no objections. But their policies currently are preventing that from happening. And they go against the very rules that China agreed to follow. Being able to manufacture advanced batteries and hybrid cars in America is too important for us to stand by and do nothing. We’ve got to take control of our energy future, and we can’t let that energy industry take root in some other country because they were allowed to break the rules&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) criticized the WTO case. He said, “There are faster ways to assert leverage on China than relying on the WTO, which could take years to resolve the case.” He instead called to restrict Chinese mining in the United States and limit World Bank funding of PRC mining projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After two years of deliberations, the WTO finally concluded in 2014 that China violated trade rules. The U.S. trade representative Michael Froman stated, “By upholding rules on fair access to raw materials, this decision is a win not only for the United States, but also for every nation that respects the principles of openness and fairness. Those principles are the pillars of the rules-based global trading system, and we must protect them vigilantly.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than restrict exports, China flooded the market with supplies, sending prices crashing. In less than a year after the United States won in the WTO, its only REE mine filed for bankruptcy protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two terms of the Obama administration witnessed a rising and more brazen and provocative China. In response, Washington looked to well-intended, albeit conventional, remedies such as diplomatic convenings and Brenton Woods–era institutions to help settle disputes. However, the United States was unable to limit China’s rising dominance of the critical mineral sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This experience showed that conventional mechanisms are only effective when countries agree to the conventions themselves. Since China rejects them, the United States needs to consider an alternative approach to the traditional rules-based order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-trump-years&quot;&gt;The Trump Years&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, the Trump administration viewed critical minerals as a proxy for U.S. economic and national security. In December 2017, Trump issued an executive order directing the Department of the Interior to develop a critical minerals list. The resulting May 2018 report identified 35 minerals considered critical to the economic and national security interests of the United States, which informed the interagency’s focus areas. The report helped increase awareness of the PRC’s control of critical mineral supply chains, beginning in emerging markets targeted by the Belt and Road Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department of State created new bilateral and multilateral initiatives, such as the Energy Resources Governance Initiative (ERGI), to lay the foundation for alternative investment channels to the PRC. For example, when the PRC sought to make major investments to secure critical minerals in Greenland, ERGI enabled the Bureau of Energy Resources to pursue a series of diplomatic engagements that successfully culminated in memorandums of understanding to support Greenland’s geologic endowment and preference U.S. and allied investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, ERGI sought to elevate transparency, support mineral-producing countries, and eventually leverage the newly established U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) to provide seed capital to de-risk projects and attract otherwise reputation-sensitive investors. However, the administration was unable to implement its permitting reform ideas, and although historic, the DFC made only one critical minerals investment. Moreover, as the Trump administration utilized existing tools such as tariffs and diplomatic initiatives, it faced domestic permitting obstacles and lacked adequate financing tools to support many U.S.-based and U.S.-backed mining projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with new initiatives and approaches, the U.S. government must do more to support domestic and allied investment to develop a secure critical minerals supply chain. This may require establishing new government tools while rethinking and optimizing existing ones to fit the mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-biden-years&quot;&gt;The Biden Years&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Biden sought to return the United States to a more conventional diplomatic position. He rescinded certain Trump-era energy sanctions (such as on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline), called for a review of China-directed tariffs, and immediately directed the administration to reenter the Paris climate accord. In further contrast to the Trump administration’s focus on national security and defense, the Biden administration prioritized the climate crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding that meeting its ambitious climate change and clean energy goals would require an exponential increase in critical minerals, President Biden issued Executive Order 14017 in February 2021, which mandated comprehensive reviews of supply chains across the U.S. government. The Department of the Interior issued a new critical minerals list, adding 15 new minerals, bringing the total to 50. Meanwhile, the Department of Energy (DOE) released its own new critical materials list for energy. The DOE material list rightly included copper as a “critical” mineral, but the USGS list excluded it, even though it is vital for every part of the modern U.S. economy—including infrastructure, clean energy technologies, electronics, and automotives—and the International Energy Agency has forecasted a copper shortage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) established new federal programs, incentives, and, importantly, billions of dollars in funding to support clean energy supply chains. The Biden administration channeled much of those direct grants and loans into domestic minerals processing and clean-tech manufacturing facilities, which should improve domestic capacities in both. The IRA has been so effective in attracting clean-tech investment that it has alarmed European partners, who sought to force “concessions” from President Biden to allow EU companies to benefit from certain IRA subsidies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department of State’s Minerals Security Partnership seeks to accelerate the development of a clean energy supply chain by convening governments and industry. The department also leads the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, which aims to promote mining-related investment, such as the Lobito Corridor project. In addition, the DFC increased its investment in Techmet, a technology metals company, from $25 million to $105 million but has not diversified equity-level investments in any other mining investors or operating companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration’s prioritization of climate action above other issues has contributed to pragmatic but conflicting messages. The IRA prohibits U.S. taxpayer funds from going to a “foreign entity of concern,” which covers firms controlled by China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran. However, China is by far the largest and least expensive critical minerals producer and clean-tech manufacturer in the world. To disqualify Chinese content from receiving taxpayer subsidies, as per the law, would increase prices—making electric vehicles unattractive to many American buyers. Therefore, the Department of the Treasury amended its rules in December 2023 to allow up to 25 percent of otherwise disqualified Chinese content to receive U.S. taxpayer subsidies under the IRA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration’s actions appear to have had an impact. Beijing went back to the 2010 playbook, announcing curbs on the export of gallium, germanium, graphite, antimony, and REE technology. China furthermore flooded the market with cobalt, crashing prices and putting the United States’ only cobalt development project into care and maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on these experiences across administrations, developing a responsible and secure clean energy supply chain will require two things to be effective. First, the government needs to have absolute clarity of mission in recognizing the challenge the United States is trying to overcome. Second, there must be accountability to guard against mission creep and navigate the complexity and equities across the government. This will entail marshaling the United States’ limited resources around the mission to optimize impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-us-critical-minerals-strategy&quot;&gt;A U.S. CRITICAL MINERALS STRATEGY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China remains the world’s dominant producer, processor, and buyer of critical minerals. The CCP continues to push domestic policies that artificially stimulate demand for its strategic sectors, mobilize state financing to influence market dynamics, and shirk environmental and human rights protections to produce commodities at the lowest cost. These are long-standing tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States is still behind, but over the past three presidential administrations, it has learned a great deal, gained political support, and increased its tools and capabilities to develop a meaningful and comprehensive response. However, an effective strategy will require a blending of the Obama, Trump, and Biden administrations’ approaches and will test domestic and international relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mission-clarity&quot;&gt;Mission Clarity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should be clear about its objective. National security and climate change are both important and interrelated, but the U.S. government ultimately needs to prioritize one over the other. It is hard to imagine how the world can address climate change by increasing reliance on China, the world’s super polluter, to produce inputs for clean energy technologies. The United States can and should develop a responsible and secure critical minerals supply chain necessary for economic growth, defense, and clean energy. However, realizing such a goal while reducing reliance on CCP-backed industry will be more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has repeatedly tried to strike a middle road by partnering with China on climate change but holding firm on core principles such as human rights and environmental standards in critical minerals supply chains. The CCP has rejected such attempts. Rather the PRC rejects the primacy of addressing climate change and instead views the matter as a core point of contention within the U.S.-China bilateral relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although disappointing, the CCP’s approach is rational from its perspective. The party-state is motivated first to advance its interests and second to increase its leverage or control over the United States and the rest of the world. By dominating the critical minerals supply chain, China forces the United States to increase its dependence on its adversary—and therefore forces Washington to question its security positioning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government should be clear in its mission to develop secure and responsible critical minerals supply chains. Successive administrations have repeatedly recognized that China dominates the production and refining of critical minerals—and thus also the defense industry and clean tech. To contest this threat, the White House should explicitly articulate its intention to develop secure supply chains and phase down reliance on China—not to provoke hostile powers but to galvanize interested stakeholders. Clear and unequivocal goal setting will signal to partner governments, resource-rich countries, and investors that the United States is on the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;accountability-and-coordination&quot;&gt;Accountability and Coordination&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government should have a single point of accountability to oversee and coordinate the administration’s multiple lines of effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IRA and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided historic levels of federal funding and new programs to develop clean energy and critical minerals supply chains. This explosion in funding coincided with the dramatic expansion of agencies working on critical minerals. Under the Biden administration, when counting, 15 federal agencies claim a meaningful role in U.S. critical minerals policy. While the increased interest is a positive development, the lack of clear oversight and management of such a complex set of issues can lead to inefficiencies or agencies working at cross-purposes, which may frustrate the mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remedy this, the U.S. government should appoint or designate a special presidential coordinator at a minimum of an ambassadorial level to manage the critical minerals portfolio. This will be a difficult but necessary role: Although every federal agency or cabinet member may have an interest, some interests are more consequential to achieving the mission than others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, this special coordinator should align U.S. policies to address the country’s current pacing challenge. As mentioned, the IRA has accelerated domestic clean energy–related manufacturing. However, the United States has not taken sufficient action to increase supplies of the critical mineral inputs needed to feed these new gigafactories and industrial facilities. It may only take 5 years to build a plant but some 15 years to turn a discovered resource into a producing mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;update-finance-tools&quot;&gt;Update Finance Tools&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government should update and integrate its mission into international finance tools. The country has just two such financing entities: the DFC and the Export–Import Bank (EXIM). Both should have a clear critical minerals mandate and be empowered to act upon it, as well as the flexibility and resources to respond to the challenges of today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DFC was designed to advance U.S. foreign policy, which is why the secretary of state serves as the chairman of the agency’s board. Yet, as the name suggests, the DFC must also consider a “development” impact. However, the statute does not provide a framework for weighing or prioritizing these factors. The U.S. government should be clear about its goals and financing, particularly as mining is such a long-term endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DFC’s equity and debt tools are intended to catalyze private sector investments into key industries in emerging market countries. However, the White House’s Office of Management and Budget, like the DFC itself, chooses to treat equity investments as if they were grants, which for accounting purposes are treated as a loss. Furthermore, when the equity investment realizes its returns, those funds are returned to the Department of the Treasury, not the DFC. This accounting treatment significantly limits the agency’s ability to make the requisite investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scoring problem is a historical practice, not a statutory requirement. The White House could remedy the situation by issuing new scoring criteria but appears unwilling to take on that political fight without an express congressional mandate to do so. As such, Congress should provide that directive and make the United States’ primary international finance tool appropriate for the realities of the market and geopolitical statecraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DFC’s investments should be both strategic and commercial. With those goals in mind, and to improve political support for an expanded remit, the DFC should prioritize investments in domestic companies. Currently, there is no preference to support U.S. companies with U.S. taxpayer dollars over foreign parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EXIM Bank is the United States’ export credit agency (ECA). The 90-year-old institution must compete against the 115 foreign ECAs around the world, especially from the PRC. In its 2019 reauthorization, Congress recognized the threat and strength of China’s investments and directed EXIM to establish the China Transformational Exports Program (CTEP). Through CTEP, EXIM gained greater flexibility to lend to projects focused on 10 strategic industries, including critical minerals. Congress should continue to build upon CTEP and further lower the domestic content requirements that constrain EXIM’s lending authorities. The bank should also have the clear ability to provide debt financing at the company rather than project level. By providing company-level lines of credit, EXIM can empower U.S. companies to take advantage of strategic projects in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has two important international finance tools. The DFC and EXIM must be rightsized for the challenges of today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;permitting-reform-at-long-last&quot;&gt;Permitting Reform, at Long Last&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government has long been talking about, but doing little to improve, its permitting process. The federal permitting process has grown into a complex and uncertain process regardless of project type, whether related to a natural gas pipeline or solar power installation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bipartisan members of Congress have advocated for permitting reform but have made little substantive progress over the years. The exhaustive federal permitting process is a main obstacle to meeting the IRA’s clean energy goals. The IRA contains billions of dollars to develop clean energy networks, which will require the construction of electric transmission lines and improvements to the grid. According to Representative Scott Peters (D-CA), “The problem is that the average line is taking 10 years to build, but seven years of that is process.” The timeline is even worse for mining. According to an analysis by S&amp;amp;P Global, it takes an average of 29 years to turn a discovered resource into a mine in the United States, the second-longest mine development time after Zambia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The realization that today’s exhaustive permitting process is undermining clean energy goals has helped to expand the parties calling for reform. In July 2024, Senators John Barrasso (R-WY) and Joe Manchin (I-WV) introduced the Energy Permitting Reform Act, which aims to start addressing some of these challenges. The bill proposes to improve certainty in decisionmaking by requiring a final agency decision within 150 days, reducing administrative steps, and providing clarity over the controversial Rosemont decision. The bill avoids some of the more controversial proposals, according to some industry advocates, such as tightening standing requirements to legally challenge projects or proposals to increase community engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the bill has secured strong bipartisan support, environmental opposition groups have rejected the legislation, arguing that only clean energy, not oil, gas, and mining, should share in the benefits of permitting reform. The bill—which goes too far for some but not far enough for others—represents an incomplete but positive and needed step forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Permitting reform often includes difficult and long-standing issues, particularly concerning the history of mining in the western United States. Yet the federal government’s failure to address permitting—in the meantime allowing the purchase of minerals known to be produced in a manner inconsistent with environmental protections, respect for human rights, or inclusion of local communities—is patently wrong. The United States should address this challenge head-on, especially if mining operations are to scale up to meet current and future clean energy targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sticks&quot;&gt;Sticks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IRA provided billions of U.S. taxpayer-funded dollars as “carrots” to incentivize investment in clean energy technologies. Many of these carrots take the form of tax credits that seek to reduce costs for consumers. While subsidies are tried-and-true measures that can affect consumer behavior, such carrots alone are insufficient to remedy China’s critical minerals dominance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, “The Chinese government is seeking to become the world’s greatest superpower through predatory lending and business practices, systematic theft of intellectual property, and brazen cyber intrusions.” Specifically, the Biden administration’s supply chain report found that overreliance on China for critical minerals and materials posed national and economic security threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is hard to imagine a situation where China would allow the United States to out-subsidize and erode its dominant market share. After all, the CCP is the world’s leader in economic statecraft, blending coercive domestic consumption, state investment in strategic industries, provincial support of local champions, and a willful blindness toward best-practice standards. And mining has been the bedrock of Chinese domestic industrial strategy and foreign policy for decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response, the United States should take a more active and definitive role in countering the CCP’s market-manipulating activities. Some businesses may argue that the U.S. government should go to great lengths to deal with the Chinese state and Chinese private sector separately. However, this is a fool’s errand, as there is little distinction between the two. According to Stanford’s Center on China’s Economy and Institutions, a large share of China’s economy operates in a gray zone of mixed or blended ownership: “The number of private owners with direct equity ties with the state almost tripled between 2000 and 2019, and those with indirect equity ties rose 50-fold. The analysis suggests that equity ties to the state may have aided, not constrained, the growth of China’s private sector.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should take a much more realistic approach to address the threat it faces. To start, the United States should prohibit the use of taxpayer funds to subsidize Chinese technology or critical mineral interests. Furthermore, the U.S. government should require any company receiving taxpayer funds to certify that any imported or incorporated Chinese content or technology meets reporting standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should also consider critical minerals and clean energy supply chains in light of today’s new era of economic realpolitik. Washington cannot assume that traditional alliances or free trade agreement status indicate alignment with U.S. security interests. For example, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen would like the European Union to qualify for IRA subsidies even though several European EV factories are owned by Chinese companies. And in November 2022, German chancellor Olaf Scholz, together with the heads of Volkswagen and other companies, met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Beijing to boost business ties. Such moves to increase dependence on a strategic threat weaken free nations’ shared security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even as it works to strengthen traditional alliances, the United States should take a more pragmatic approach. U.S. and European officials have discussed creating a critical minerals buyers’ club, but to be credible, club membership should be dependent on more rigorous criteria than just geography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-11&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2010, China banned the export of REEs to Japan. In so doing, the CCP fired the first, transformative salvo in an ongoing fight to leverage its critical minerals dominance to coerce, intimidate, and extort. The United States has since learned some valuable lessons. Successive administrations have tried multiple, albeit incremental, remedies aimed at encouraging China to behave responsibly and incentivizing U.S. and allied companies to reorient their consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although meaningful, these incremental tactics have not altered the CCP’s strategy, and the United States has failed to develop secure supply chains. Building on the experience of the past three administrations, the United States should follow the above guidance to achieve its objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. leaders should recognize that, given the scale of the challenge, the federal government has a meaningful role to play. Yet, the country’s comparative advantage lies instead in its dynamic and world-leading private sector. To that end, U.S. diplomacy and financial tools should be rightsized to achieve the mission. This rightsizing must also apply to domestic policy. Leaders must finally take on long-standing special interests to advance meaningful permitting policy reform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has been forced to engage in a new era of economic realpolitik. This awareness requires the United States to reconsider traditional alliances and partner relationships at a company or project level. Chinese companies have expanded and, in certain instances, entrenched themselves within traditional allies’ commercial interests. As such, the U.S. government needs to guard against unintentionally supporting adversarial interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his famous speech launching the Space Race, President John F. Kennedy asked Americans “to accept a firm commitment to a new course of action, a course which will last for many years and carry very heavy costs.” Kennedy’s Apollo program was transformative for the United States’ leadership in the world and led to innumerable technological innovations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transforming the United States’ economic engine presents a challenge orders of magnitude greater than putting a man on the Moon. But while building secure clean energy and critical mineral supply chains will be neither easy nor inexpensive, it is increasingly vital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book has highlighted the cross-cutting importance of critical minerals security for national security, economic competitiveness, and the energy transition. Minerals are the bedrock of military technologies, semiconductors, electric vehicles (EVs), and clean energy technologies. The United States’ overreliance on China has already brought dire consequences, as evidenced by the full ban on germanium, gallium, and antimony exports to the United States, alongside strict restrictions on graphite in December 2024. Addressing these challenges is not merely an economic necessity, but a national security imperative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strengthening U.S. critical minerals supply chains demands a comprehensive strategy focused on domestic resource development, advanced processing and recycling technologies, international partnerships, and sustainable practices. This volume explores these strategies and provides concrete recommendations for multiple dimensions of minerals security to ensure resilience and self-reliance in critical minerals supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This volume has three primary objectives with regards to critical minerals and the future of the U.S. economy. First, it shows dependence of the twenty-first-century U.S. economy on a wide range of minerals for industries such as defense, semiconductors, and clean energy—and identifies where key minerals vulnerabilities exist within these supply chains. Second, it evaluates the policies and legislative initiatives undertaken during the Biden administration, identifying both strengths and weaknesses, before providing recommendations to enhance these efforts. And finally, it puts forward a comprehensive set of recommendations in key areas for the new administration, including domestic permitting, midstream processing, international engagement, and responsible mining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This volume is intended to be a resource for policymakers in the new U.S. administration and Congress, written by experts with deep expertise working with industry and government. This book shows that critical minerals have never been more important for the U.S. economy than at this critical juncture. And yet significant vulnerabilities continue to exist in the supply chain, despite the ongoing efforts by government and businesses to address them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three prevailing themes emerge from the rich and diverse analysis contained in these chapters. First, critical minerals are ever-more pervasive in the modern U.S. economy and crosscut all facets of defense, economic security, and energy security. Second, although the U.S. government has taken credible steps and has invested hundreds of billions of dollars in addressing vulnerabilities in the critical minerals supply chain, it remains dependent on foreign adversaries—primarily China, but also Russia for minerals such as palladium. Lastly, given the dispersion of mineral resources globally, the United States will not be able to achieve full independence in the supply chain on its own. Addressing domestic permitting bottlenecks will need to go hand-in-hand with working with allies in developed countries and the Global South to break China’s stranglehold on the global critical minerals market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fundamentally important element of any new approach to critical minerals policy must be undertaken in a strategic and integrated fashion. The interconnected policy recommendations put forward by the authors in this volume address the challenges of critical minerals dependency by promoting economic security, sustainability, and innovation. The United States urgently requires a comprehensive critical minerals strategy. By developing such an integrated approach, the United States will strengthen the foundation for industries essential to the future, including defense, semiconductors, EVs, and renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten key recommendations emerged in this volume:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-develop-a-comprehensive-incentives-package-for-mineral-production-and-processing&quot;&gt;1. Develop a comprehensive incentives package for mineral production and processing.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The administration should create a comprehensive incentives package focusing on minerals production and processing for vital industries, including defense, semiconductors, EVs, and energy. This strategy must go further than the CHIPS and Science Act, which was developed to bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing but failed to include any support for securing the minerals needed to produce the semiconductors. Any new strategy must also be more aggressive than the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which created useful incentives to invest in critical minerals production and processing but was self-limiting, given that it only applied to the United States and countries with which it had a free trade agreement. The incentives must support domestic and international mineral production. The lack of sufficient U.S. mining supply chain investment incentives abroad has allowed China to gain control of a substantial share of resources in Latin America and Africa and export them back to China for processing. If the United States is to meaningfully loosen China’s chokehold on mineral production, it must implement incentives that reach both producers at home and investors abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minerals projects in the United States are struggling to stay competitive and remain operational amid low commodity prices and intense competition from China. Chinese mineral operations tend to use cheaper energy sources and labor to keep costs low. Additionally, projects are often heavily state subsidized, with the government serving as a buyer of last resort to manipulate markets and keep prices low. As a result, Western producers are unable to compete and in some cases are producing at a net loss. As a result, Western investors are less eager and more hesitant to invest in minerals projects in the United States and in partner nations. Incentives help these strategic projects to remain competitive and profitable by providing capital support upfront that offsets the costs and risks of mineral investments. Comprehensive incentives packages that target minerals beyond those used in EV batteries are a necessity to ensure Western private industry makes the investments now that will yield the required minerals for strategic industries in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has thus far been insufficient investment in the critical minerals needed for advanced semiconductor technologies, particularly gallium and germanium. Implementing tax credits for midstream production of minerals domestically and in key allied countries can help to ensure these complex projects get off the ground. For EVs, the 30D provision of the IRA should be modified to expand benefits beyond solely free trade agreement (FTA) countries. Few mineral-rich countries currently hold an FTA-equivalent agreement with the United States, and are therefore excluded from IRA benefits. This is a critical step to incentivize mineral-rich nations to secure offtake agreements with Western countries instead of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FEOC rules should be tightened for incentives across industries. The current FEOC threshold of 25 percent ownership is too high and means projects with significant Chinese ownership are receiving benefits subsidized by U.S. taxpayers. However, given the limited number of projects outside of China for some key minerals, eliminating all tax benefits immediately could undermine market confidence and lead to supply chain disruptions. Instead, FEOC rules should be gradually phased down to 0 percent so that only projects that align with U.S. interests receive benefits, bolstering the production of minerals that support the semiconductor, EV, energy, and defense industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-invest-in-innovation&quot;&gt;2. Invest in innovation.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. economy continues to be among the most innovative in the world, and the power of this innovation must be harnessed to drive technological progress, improve competitiveness, and reduce the country’s critical minerals vulnerabilities. Investments in building recycling capabilities also reduce the quantity of primary minerals that need to be mined in the future, reducing the risk of future shortages. Innovation will be particularly critical for the semiconductor and defense industries, which are the mainstay of the country’s national and economic security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Semiconductors:&lt;/strong&gt; After initially imposing export restrictions on gallium and germanium in 2024, China escalated to a full export ban of these two commodities to the United States in December 2024. The United States needs to rapidly build the technological expertise for refining gallium and germanium. Achieving the required purity levels of over 99.99 percent for the semiconductor industry necessitates specialized technology, infrastructure, and knowledge, which are currently absent. Currently, the United States has just one company refining high-purity gallium and only one facility for germanium. Establishing a research and development (R&amp;amp;D) lab could foster innovation, enhance processing capacity, reduce the industry’s environmental footprint, and reduce production costs. Targeted funding through CHIPS Act initiatives, such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s R&amp;amp;D program and the Microelectronics Commons, would support advanced materials research, facilitate commercialization, and drive the next generation of semiconductor manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EVs:&lt;/strong&gt; Given the importance of sustaining the economic competitiveness of the domestic automotive industry, the new administration should invest in R&amp;amp;D into cost-efficient, resource-abundant battery technologies and recycling technologies to strengthen the circular economy. Innovative battery technologies and the development of substitutes for scarce materials are key to alleviating resource pressures. Ongoing research into alternative battery technologies that reduce or eliminate reliance on critical minerals like cobalt must be supported by grants and collaborations with universities and startups.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as the Department of Energy funds laboratories for critical minerals in EVs and clean energy, the Department of Commerce should support similar initiatives for semiconductor minerals like gallium and germanium to scale refining capabilities and technologies. Likewise, the Department of Defense should similarly adopt efforts for minerals like tungsten and antimony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-strengthen-stockpiling&quot;&gt;3. Strengthen stockpiling.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should establish a Critical Minerals Reserve to stabilize supply chains, mitigate geopolitical and market risks, and reduce dependence on foreign-controlled resources, using authorized market makers backed by federal loans to procure minerals from approved jurisdictions and support domestic and allied industries. The National Defense Stockpile (NDS) was created under the 1939 Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act to provide for the acquisition of critical materials to meet defense industry needs in cases of national emergency. In the event of a natural disaster, regional conflict, or large-scale war, government-owned physical reserves of minerals can provide both the U.S. military and commercial industry with minerals needed for national defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategic stockpiles are increasingly put forth as a potential policy tool to not only provide materials in a national security emergency but also as a mechanism to help stabilize commodity markets. A government-run minerals stockpile can serve as a buyer of last resort for private industry. When global prices are too low for U.S. producers to compete due to subsidized Chinese production, the government could purchase minerals for the stockpile to drive demand and raise prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To strengthen mineral stockpiles, Congress should boost discrete program appropriations for the NDS Transaction Fund. From 1968 to 2022, Congress appropriated no new budget authority for minerals stockpiling. Over the past few decades, the minerals stockpile was depleted significantly, as the Department of Defense determined that over 99 percent of the stockpile was excess to the department’s needs and Congress soon authorized its disposal. As of 2023, the stockpile’s value was estimated at just 1.2 percent of its 1962 value when adjusted for inflation. Overall, the twenty-first century has seen minimal policy action around mineral stockpiling. Consequently, the NDS is significantly smaller and less powerful as a market mechanism than China’s minerals stockpile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-adopt-a-coordinated-government-approach&quot;&gt;4. Adopt a coordinated government approach.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States will need to strengthen both its mission clarity and coordination. At present, the U.S. government has yet to agree on a single critical minerals list, lacks a coordinating agency, and has incomplete incentives. The U.S. government should have a single point of accountability to oversee and coordinate the administration’s multiple lines of effort. There are currently 15 government departments and agencies working on critical minerals. While the increased interest is a positive development, the lack of clear oversight and management of such a complex set of issues can lead to inefficiencies or agencies working at cross-purposes, which may frustrate the mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-support-the-implementation-of-responsible-mining-practices&quot;&gt;5. Support the implementation of responsible mining practices.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the consistent grievances with some Chinese firms is their poor environmental, social, and governance practices. This includes heavy deforestation and land degradation, low wages, failure to employ local workers, and use of bribery. Adopting responsible mining practices can differentiate the United States from China and make it a more attractive investment partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Environmentally and socially responsible standards are vital in mining to address the sector’s significant environmental, social, and governance challenges. They promote sustainable practices by reducing pollution, protecting biodiversity, and ensuring efficient resource use. Such standards also emphasize fair community engagement, worker safety, and ethical governance, helping to build trust and manage risks like corruption and reputational damage. They also provide helpful frameworks to be applied to new emerging frontiers for mineral extraction, like deep sea mining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With growing investor and consumer demand for responsibly sourced materials, adherence to environmental and social principles improves social license to operate, regulatory compliance, access to green financing, economic feasibility, and long-term profitability for minerals projects on land and under the sea.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Voluntary standards should be consolidated into one global system with independent oversight to streamline compliance and increase the effectiveness of industry-imposed standards that are currently inconsistent and cumbersome. This could be achieved by creating a national panel on mining and incorporating standards into trade agreements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The federal government should fund research and pilot projects for deep sea mineral processing and work toward full-scale projects with support from programs like the Inflation Reduction Act’s 48C credit, the Defense Production Act, and the Loan Programs Office.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;6-bolster-financing-for-minerals-supply-chain-development&quot;&gt;6. Bolster financing for minerals supply chain development.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), Defense Production Act (DPA), and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) provide significant grant funding, loan guarantees, and tax credits that offer vital sources of capital for minerals projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without these financing mechanisms, few Western projects would be profitable, and few companies would be willing to invest in risky but strategic projects abroad. With government financing support, companies like Lynas Rare Earths, Syrah Resources, Albemarle Corporation, and TechMet are initiating and expanding mining and processing capacity both in the United States and in foreign partner countries. But current financing mechanisms are still not enough to compete with foreign adversaries and secure mineral resources around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The limitations of the DFC, DPA, and IRA programs leave many key mining jurisdictions outside of financing mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DFC can be amended by Congress to expand its impact by allowing financing in high-income countries. The DFC’s role in fostering minerals security is still fairly new, but a number of DFC-backed investments in Brazilian nickel, South African copper, and Angolan rare earths are already making an impact by helping to mitigate risks for strategic projects in mineral rich but underdeveloped nations. The DFC can continue to foster government-to-government cooperation and grow its impact by expanding its authorities and the number of eligible nations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DPA spending authority should be increased while making greater use of purchasing commitments. DPA funds can now be used for projects in not only the United States and Canada but also Australia and the United Kingdom. More eligible jurisdictions mean more strategic projects can be funded to close supply chain gaps for defense minerals. More DOD purchase commitments can sustain the capabilities that have received investments and provide industry with the demand signal and business case to make their own additional investments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Price floors are a key financing support mechanism that gives projects assurance they will remain profitable even in the face of volatile and falling commodity prices. With this price support, industry is more likely to make strategic investments, knowing their products will sell at a fixed price without being subject to uncertain market conditions vulnerable to Chinese manipulation. Price floors hedge risks and keep operational key minerals projects that serve U.S. interests.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together, these policy adjustments will augment current financing programs and allow financial support to reach mineral-rich jurisdictions that were previously left out of these opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;7-develop-the-critical-minerals-workforce&quot;&gt;7. Develop the critical minerals workforce.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Society for Mining, Metallurgy, and Exploration has estimated that more than half of the current workforce will be retired and replaced by 2029 (roughly 221,000 workers). A skilled workforce is crucial for sustaining industries reliant on critical minerals. Throughout this volume, authors have recognized the need for investments into education, training, and lifelong career learning. Workforce development programs focusing on technical training in mining, materials science, processing and refining, defense applications, and advanced manufacturing will prepare the American labor force to support resilient domestic supply chains and maintain technological leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new administration should work with Congress to establish a National Critical Minerals Workforce Initiative, leveraging federal programs like WIOA and tax incentives. This would help address workforce challenges by supporting education in key fields, fostering community college certifications, and integrating regional training centers into the American Job Centers network.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Increasing investments in workforce development, leveraging successful initiatives like the Industrial Base Analysis and Sustainment (IBAS) program’s National Imperative for Industrial Skills (NIIS), would strengthen recruitment, training, and retention efforts in key sectors such as critical minerals through active partnerships and regionally focused activities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;8-streamline-the-domestic-permitting-process&quot;&gt;8. Streamline the domestic permitting process.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the United States is to effectively boost domestic production of critical minerals, a number of serious challenges in the domestic permitting process must be overcome. A streamlined permitting process reduces delays, lowers costs for mining companies, and encourages private sector investment in domestic projects, reducing dependence on foreign-controlled supply chains. It also enhances the efficiency and predictability of regulatory reviews, enabling companies to plan and execute projects more effectively while maintaining environmental and community safeguards. By balancing environmental, social, and governance concerns with expedited approvals, a reformed permitting process supports a resilient and competitive critical minerals industry, bolsters economic growth, and ensures that the United States can secure a stable supply of these essential materials for its energy transition and technological needs. The authors in this book have suggested the following concrete initiatives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Congress should increase funding for agencies to hire more mineral experts, enabling timely National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) reviews by improving early engagement with mine project applicants and reducing delays caused by insufficiently detailed mine plans. Congress should also allocate additional funding to defray mine applicants’ permitting costs, including support for hiring approved, high-quality contractors to streamline the NEPA process and reduce compliance burdens.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new administration should direct the Permitting Council to use its voting authority to include more mining projects under FAST-41, bypassing the $200 million investment threshold for projects extracting critical energy transition minerals.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new administration’s Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) should issue a rule establishing clear thresholds for “intensity” factors in the NEPA process, enabling agencies to determine when an environmental impact assessment (EIS) is sufficient and avoiding unnecessary environmental impact statement preparation. Increasing the use of programmatic environmental reviews and categorical exclusions would streamline permitting for critical minerals projects by pre-evaluating broad categories of activities, reducing redundancy in individual project assessments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Congress could pass legislation categorically exempting mines producing primary energy transition minerals from NEPA’s environmental assessment and EIS requirements, expediting permitting timelines while specifying covered minerals from the Department of Energy’s critical energy materials list.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;9-pursue-strategic-international-engagement&quot;&gt;9. Pursue strategic international engagement.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States will need to take a page out of China’s playbook if it is to meaningfully compete. Over the past 30 years, China has leveraged its foreign policy to establish a dominant position in global critical minerals markets. Although it produces only 10 percent of the world’s lithium, cobalt, nickel, and copper, China has made strategic investments globally and imports enough to process 65 to 90 percent of the global supply of these metals at home. The United States will need to collaborate with historical allies—like Australia, Canada, and the European Union—in addition to Global South countries. This will require a judicious balance of sticks and carrots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The administration should prioritize stable tariff policies and minimize tariffs with allied nations to maintain investor confidence and minimize potential supply chain disruptions. It should balance tariffs and restrictions on Chinese products to address market manipulation, unfair practices, carbon intensity, and human rights without applying a blanket exclusion on Chinese firms, given that non-Chinese supply chains for a number of commodities are currently underdeveloped or undeveloped.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The U.S. government can align its diplomacy efforts with its financing mechanisms—for example, priority financial support can be given to partners and forum members in the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP). It can also reform existing financing instruments to enable greater flexibility to fund supply chain diversification projects. For example, the 2025 reauthorization of the DFC provides an opportunity for the institution to go beyond its current mandate and finance mining projects in high-income allied countries like Canada and Chile.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States should utilize technical assistance. This includes supporting the geological mapping of resource-rich countries, which can de-risk investments for exploration companies seeking to invest in emerging economies. This is vital because over 99 percent of exploration projects are unsuccessful. This effort also includes investing in infrastructure. The mining industry is highly energy and water intensive and requires rail and port infrastructure to be exported. China has gained a significant upper hand through infrastructure investment in resource-rich developing countries. During the first 10 years of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), it invested $1 trillion. These investments have allowed China to secure raw materials for domestic processing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;10-strengthen-the-defense-industrial-base&quot;&gt;10. Strengthen the defense industrial base.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is rapidly expanding its investments in munitions and acquiring advanced weapons systems and equipment at a pace five to six times faster than the United States. While China operates with a wartime mindset to enhance its military readiness, the United States maintains a peacetime approach. Even before the implementation of new restrictions, the U.S. defense industrial base struggled with insufficient capacity and limited surge capabilities to meet production demands for defense technologies. Restrictions on critical mineral inputs will only exacerbate this gap, enabling China to further outpace the United States in developing these capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Joint Staff should develop a war-planning scenario aligned with DOD policy and National Defense Strategy objectives. This updated scenario would enable the generation of more realistic estimates for defense-related critical minerals requirements, ensuring adequate preparedness for future conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DOD should stabilize funding for critical minerals in the base budget to ensure predictability for industry and investment planning, moving beyond reliance on one-off supplemental appropriations by utilizing mechanisms like discrete program increases or functional transfers within industrial mobilization programs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DOD should streamline critical minerals sourcing rules by conducting an acquisition reform study to identify and consolidate overlapping regulations, simplifying exception structures. It should also develop a legislative proposal to reduce compliance burdens while supporting sub-tier supplier validation and military specification development. Furthermore, delegating authority for approving Presidential Determinations to the secretary of defense would significantly shorten the timeline for industrial base investments while ensuring informed decisions on critical minerals shortfalls with input from relevant departments and agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/MRMoqIg.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，今（7日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第130日審訊，黎智英第38日作供，控方繼續盤問黎，談及黎對國際線的認知。黎早前供稱未聽聞過「對華政策跨國議會聯盟」（簡稱 IPAC），惟控方展示訊息紀錄，裴倫德（Luke de Pulford）在2020年5月底告知黎 IPAC 將會成立，又傳送相關新聞稿和網站，並一度問黎能否保留頭版。黎其後傳送時任《蘋果》副社長陳沛敏的聯絡方法給裴倫德，著對方將照片傳送給陳沛敏。《蘋果》最終在6月5日刊登報導。控方質疑黎聲稱「不在乎」IPAC 的說法。法官李素蘭問，所以黎當時不知道 IPAC 是關於什麼，但是同意刊登它？黎同意。另外，控方反覆追問，黎在《國安法》之後仍然支持「光時」嗎？黎多次表明不會回答。控方最終指出，黎在《國安法》之後支持「光時」。黎否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎供稱未曾聽聞日本線和李字軒&quot;&gt;黎供稱未曾聽聞「日本線」和李字軒&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行繼續盤問，圍繞黎與同案被告陳梓華和被指為本案「共謀者」之一的「攬炒巴」劉祖廸之間的關係。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，在2020年1月11日台北陽明山別墅會議之後，黎曾與陳梓華有對話。黎稱不記得。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華早前供稱，在會議翌日晚上，他與劉祖廸跟李宇軒進行線上會議，其後將會議內容告知黎。陳告訴黎：「Andy（李宇軒）同劉祖廸都同意喺國際線上面跟隨你嘅行動。」而李宇軒會「打國際線」，黎卻認為李宇軒和劉祖廸都應該要一同「打國際線」。至2020年1月底，陳再次聯絡黎，告知他：「『攬炒』（劉祖廸）唔想打議會線，但係喺國際線上面，就會全力開火。」陳另向黎提及「當時有條日本線，就係李宇軒打嘅」，惟當時很難接觸到「枱底人」，黎則叫陳等人聯絡其私人助手 Mark Simon，以協助美國線。陳引述黎提醒他們：「叫我哋唔好咁心急，因為係一個 long game（持久戰）。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指向黎指出上述案情，黎一概否認，指陳梓華編造出來，又重申他從沒聽聞李字軒，直至在庭上才聽到。黎又稱未曾聽聞「日本線」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑黎未有提醒陳梓華對國安法謹慎&quot;&gt;控方質疑黎未有提醒陳梓華對《國安法》謹慎&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年5月21日，黎智英向陳梓華傳送人大公布實施「港版國安法」的報導，並說：「仆街打到嚟喇！」陳回覆黎：「黎前輩：事情至今，已經難以逆轉形勢，我唯一擔心是你與 Martin 及你們家人的自身安全，萬事請以自身安全與事業存續為首要考慮。國安法主要針對境外內勇武人士，港獨份子及煽惑群眾人士。你務必謹慎。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎其後回覆陳：「我們不要擔心個人安危。一旦站出來爭取自由，便要準備作戰至最後一刻，我們雖然未必會勝利，但必須堅持下去。不用擔心。更好的日子即將來臨。」（“Let’s not worry about personal security. Once came out to join the fight for freedom one is prepared to fight to the last. We may not win but must persist. Don’t worry. Better days will come.”）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在盤問下，黎否認訊息意思是叫陳「堅持（persist）」，只是說安慰的說話，叫他不要擔心個人安危。惟控方指黎說「必須堅持下去」。黎則稱是泛指所有香港人，「準備作戰至最後一刻，我們雖然未必會勝利，但必須堅持下去。」控方問黎所以他叫陳「準備作戰至最後一刻」？黎同意。控方又問，黎也會「準備作戰至最後一刻」？黎亦同意，不過他否認籲陳繼續作戰。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑，黎在早前供稱一直提醒身邊的人謹慎，避免觸犯《國安法》，然而他未有在訊息中提醒陳對《國安法》謹慎。黎則稱當時的討論話題是安慰及鼓勵陳，不容他作出提醒。他同意未有作出提醒。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到「作戰」是什麼意思，黎指是「一直進行的那種反抗」。控方問即是「反政府運動」？黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華曾傳送攬炒團隊眾籌連結-控方質疑黎聲稱從沒聽聞攬炒團隊說法&quot;&gt;陳梓華曾傳送攬炒團隊眾籌連結 控方質疑黎聲稱從沒聽聞「攬炒團隊」說法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年5月28日，陳梓華向黎智英傳送「連登」討論區連結，題為〈【突發】攬炒過後是晨曦！攬炒團隊《重光香港計劃》眾籌上線！〉。黎則稱未曾按進去連結查看，因為對此不感興趣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎早前供稱從沒聽聞「攬炒團隊」，可是從這個訊息表面看來，黎有看過「攬炒團隊」，因此黎的證供是不真實。黎否認不真實，只是當時未留意這是「攬炒團隊」。控方指出，黎其實是知道「攬炒團隊」。黎說：「你可以這樣說，但這不是真實的」，其後表示不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，眾籌網站提及：「2020年5月，國安法兵臨城下，但我地香港人已經準備好攬炒。天助自助者，琴晚國務卿 Pompeo 亦措辭強硬，直言香港自治已死，全面制裁即將降臨。」黎稱沒有留意到網站是關於推動進一步制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方再度展示2020年6月15日《蘋果》的「隔牆有耳」欄目，題為〈中共威脅全球民主自由 攬炒巴加入國際聯軍反抗〉，問黎當時是否知道「攬炒巴」劉祖廸參與國際游說。黎則稱可能只曾「瞥一眼」報導，因版面有太多相片，但強調未有留意標題上的「攬炒巴」。他稱平日也不會閱讀「隔牆有耳」欄目。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認籲陳梓華及其他人繼續在文宣和國際線上工作&quot;&gt;黎否認籲陳梓華及其他人繼續在文宣和國際線上工作&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提及2020年6月16日，黎與陳梓華在壹傳媒大樓見面。陳早前供稱，他在會上說：「我認為應該要褪（讓步）」，黎當時回應《國安法》「雷聲大雨點小」。黎同意說過《國安法》「雷聲大雨點小」，因當時認為中共不會摧毁香港，但他稱沒有聽過陳說要讓步。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又指，黎稱：「會以身作則，會繼續喺唔同嘅媒體上面呼籲制裁同埋關注。」陳引述黎籲陳「都應該係咁」，又籲他叫其他人繼續在文宣和國際線上工作。當控方今日覆述陳的證供時，黎表示：「我完全不同意。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指：「再一次，你沒有提醒陳謹慎，是否同意？」黎說：「我沒有提醒他，因為大家都知道《國安法》來臨。」控方問，該次會面之後，黎有否提醒陳？黎則稱：「他是成年人，他知道應該怎樣做，我不是他的父親，你為什麼問這個問題呢？」控方追問，所以黎的答案是沒有？黎同意沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱不知對華政策跨國議會聯盟簡稱是ipac&quot;&gt;黎稱不知「對華政策跨國議會聯盟」簡稱是「IPAC」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方談及「對華政策跨國議會聯盟」（Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China，簡稱 IPAC），並引述陳梓華的證供，在6月16日的會面中，黎問陳為何不加入 IPAC，因黎覺得「IPAC 好重要，一定要有呢啲國際支持，先會有用。」黎否認說過，重申陳編造故事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示訊息，「香港監察」創辦人羅傑斯（Benedict Rogers）在2020年5月31日說：「Hi, Jimmy. My friend Luke de Pulford would like to be in touch with you regarding a new Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China which he is setting up. I am also involved in it as an advisor. May I give him your number?」黎回覆：「Of course. Thank you.」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑，黎的證供是他直至當天從未聽聞 IPAC？黎起初確認他獲告知，但是未有留意，因為他不感興趣；其後在追問下，黎稱他只見到「對華政策跨國議會聯盟」的全名，但是未有把它與其簡稱「IPAC」視為一樣，即使見到全名也未有看重。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;裴倫德透過訊息傳送ipac資料給黎-控方質疑黎並非不在乎&quot;&gt;裴倫德透過訊息傳送IPAC資料給黎 控方質疑黎並非「不在乎」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著展示訊息，裴倫德（Luke de Pulford）於2020年5月31日問黎：「Can you speak now?」，黎回覆：「I call you now.」控方問二人最終有否通話？黎起初稱不記得，但其後稱他承諾過別人的話理應是有通話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年6月1日，裴倫德向黎傳送文件「IPAC Briefing 31 May」，並說：「There’s more information here www.ipac.global but the site is under construction so please don’t share yet.」、「Will send a press release tomorrow」，黎回覆「Ok. Thanks. Jimmy」。控方指，裴倫德傳送的網站標題為〈IPAC: Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China〉，因此黎是知道「IPAC」等同於「Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China」。黎稱當時沒有留意，又稱不在乎。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭質疑，若然黎不在乎的話，為何不向羅傑斯說「不要把我的電話號碼交給裴倫德，我不在乎這個對華政策跨國議會聯盟」？黎則稱：「我不會表現到如此無禮。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，黎並非「不在乎」，當裴倫德聯絡黎的時候，黎表示「I call you now.」。黎則回應，這是出於禮貌回覆，並一度說「我甚至不認識裴倫德。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李素蘭追問：「你會打電話給你不認識的人嗎？」黎則稱，因為羅傑斯給了他的電話號碼給裴倫德，而裴倫德問可否談話，所以他便回覆「現在打給你」，重申只是出於禮貌。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;新聞稿顯示ipac為了一致地回應中國崛起&quot;&gt;新聞稿顯示IPAC為了一致地回應中國崛起&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示裴倫德傳來的 IPAC 資料，顯示 IPAC 是由世界各地的議員組成，為了一致地回應由中共統治的中國崛起，對民主國家帶來的挑戰。（“Developing a coherent response to the rise of the People’s Republic of China as led by the Chinese Communist Party is a defining challenge for the world’s democratic states.”）控方問這是否與黎一直以來所提倡的觀點一致？黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示 IPAC 共同創辦人名單，當中包括日本眾議員菅野志櫻里（Shiori Yamao）、英國國會議員施志安（Iain Duncan Smith）和時任美國共和黨參議員盧比奧（Marco Rubio）。黎稱從沒聽聞菅野志櫻里，但肯定有聽聞盧比奧，施志安則不記得在哪裡聽聞過，可能是在庭上。黎其後指，從沒想過日本人也有參與，對此感到意外。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訊息顯示裴倫德與黎談及頭版事宜-黎同意替ipac宣傳&quot;&gt;訊息顯示裴倫德與黎談及頭版事宜 黎同意替IPAC宣傳&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年6月1日，裴倫德向黎傳送訊息：「Jimmy, we may have to delay launch because of what’s happening in the US. Prob Sunday or Monday.」黎回覆「Ok, thanks. Jimmy」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同日，裴倫德再傳訊息：「Launch confirmed for Monday 8th 08:00am Hong Kong time. Do you release your front page the previous evening? If not, you could have it for Monday’s paper…」黎回覆：「I don’t know about front page but will try to put it in prominent place if front page is not available. Thanks, Jimmy」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問裴倫德想黎將什麼放在頭版？黎稱不知道，因他讓員工自行決定放什麼在頭版，而他當時只是禮貌回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示訊息，2020年6月3日裴倫德告訴黎，IPAC 將會在星期五（即6月5日）成立，又指「如果他們打算報導包括我，請讓我提供新照片——《蘋果日報》的照片很差。（“If they want to include me in the story please let me give new photos - Apple Daily ones are bad.”）」。黎其後傳送時任《蘋果》副社長陳沛敏的聯絡方法給裴倫德，著對方將照片傳送給陳沛敏。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指由此可見，黎於2020年6月3日已知道 IPAC 將會正式成立，而黎同意替 IPAC 宣傳，所以他才會傳送陳沛敏的聯絡方式給裴倫德。黎同意。法官李素蘭問，所以黎當時不知道 IPAC 是關於什麼，但是同意刊登它？黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認給予編採指示叫陳沛敏報導ipac成立&quot;&gt;黎否認給予編採指示叫陳沛敏報導IPAC成立&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指另一邊廂，黎有傳送訊息給陳沛敏，提醒她直至星期五之前都不要刊登報導。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，有關 IPAC 成立的報導最終有刊出，並展示2020年6月5日的《蘋果》報導〈斥強推港版國安法踐踏人權 9議會結盟強硬抗中共〉。控方指，黎傳送給陳沛敏的訊息，其實是一個編採指示，叫她刊登新聞報導。黎否認，並指他只是轉發手頭上的資訊給陳。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，裴倫德向黎傳送訊息：「Thanks for all your support Jimmy. Thinking of you daily.」，黎回覆：「Thank you so much! Sorry that we couldn’t make your news our front page because it coincides with June 4th reporting.」，黎又感謝對方的理解。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎拒答國安法後是否支持光復香港-時代革命&quot;&gt;黎拒答國安法後是否支持「光復香港 時代革命」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指 IPAC 報導被編排在報紙 A12 頁，又提到報紙上方的橫條寫有「惡法臨城」，旁邊含有「光復香港 時代革命」口號照片，問黎是否留意到。黎稱它屬於裝飾，經常出現在版面上。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎是否支持這句口號？黎表示這不是他要思考的問題，過去很多人叫喊這句口號。控方追問，所以黎支持這句口號？黎稱未有想過。法官杜麗冰問：「你是否反對它？」黎稱沒有思考過，但是他不認為他會反對一些放在其報紙上的東西。控方繼續追問黎是否支持「光時」。黎重申沒有思考過，但是如果他的報紙刊登過，他理應是支持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後反覆追問，國安法之後，黎仍然支持「光時」嗎？黎多次表明不會回答，因這是假設性的問題，又指庭上展示的報紙是《國安法》之前。控方最終向黎指出，他在《國安法》之後支持「光時」。黎否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑黎冀國際阻止國安法實施-卻聲稱不知ipac&quot;&gt;控方質疑黎冀國際阻止國安法實施 卻聲稱不知IPAC&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在法官李運騰提問下，黎承認在2020年6月的時候，他仍然希望香港有國際支持，而報導所指「9議會結盟強硬抗中共」，屬於他希望得到的支持。控方則質疑，黎希望國際支持，但是卻聲稱不留意 IPAC？黎堅稱未有留意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，黎曾在公開訪談中要求制裁官員，又在2020年5月底計劃赴美國會見彭斯及議員，黎希望國際社會能夠阻止國安法實施，而 IPAC 正正符合黎的想法，也是黎想要的東西，因此黎必然會留意。黎堅稱未有留意到 IPAC，「無論你問我多少次，我的回答也是相同。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑，所有羅傑斯和裴倫德傳送給黎的東西，黎都不感興趣？黎指二人傳送東西給他，只是想透過他來刊登在《蘋果》。控方追問，這些訊息是關乎人權，是黎一直以來提倡的東西，不會引起黎的興趣嗎？黎稱沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑黎三度說謊-黎否認並稱知道ipac並非罪行&quot;&gt;控方質疑黎三度說謊 黎否認並稱知道IPAC並非罪行&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年6月13日，裴倫德在訊息中感謝黎轉發 IPAC 的帖文。黎則稱該帖文是其「徒弟」李兆富撰寫，而他可能只曾「瞥一眼」。法官杜麗冰指，黎早前供稱直至在庭上才聽聞 IPAC，然而，「這則有關 IPAC 的帖文擺在你面前，你會否同意你早前告訴法庭的證供是不準確？」黎否認不準確。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎向法庭說謊。黎否認。控方續指：「有關 IPAC 的事情，你三度向法庭說謊。」黎再否認，反稱自己沒有理由說謊，又指知道 IPAC 並非罪行，「這不是一件大事。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至7月7日，裴倫德向黎傳送 Twitter 帖文的連結，載有英國國會議員施志安的發言影片，談及中國打壓香港及新疆維吾爾族人，提及制裁林鄭及取消官員的外國護照等。黎則稱他未看過影片，堅稱不知道施志安呼籲制裁林鄭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下周一（2月10日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economic security has become a critical focus for policymakers and the private sector, driven by escalating geopolitical tensions and a growing awareness of the security vulnerabilities in global financial systems and supply chains. However, the approaches taken by individual EU member states, the EU itself, and the private sector to prioritise, manage and mitigate economic security risks remain highly fragmented. This lack of coordination has amplified strategic and financial vulnerabilities, highlighting the urgent need for unified action. To address this challenge, the Centre for Finance and Security (CFS) at RUSI established the European Economic Security Taskforce in 2024, creating a platform for collaborative and cross-sectoral discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CFS is uniquely positioned to deliver this timely initiative, given its reputation as a leading research programme based in Brussels and London that specialises in the intersection of finance and global security. As part of a preeminent defence and security think tank, CFS has used its cross-disciplinary expertise and multi-jurisdictional network to convene this Taskforce. The Taskforce brings together international policymakers, geoeconomic academics and experts from security, industry and the private sector. Taskforce members contribute their expertise in a personal capacity and do not represent their organisations, which include numerous EU member state governments, the European Commission and associated institutions, NATO, and the key allies of Australia, Japan and the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inaugural Taskforce meeting was held on 9 September 2024 and focused on the concept of economic security. Taskforce members highlighted how a lack of definitional clarity had encouraged siloed thinking on economic security issues, particularly between the trade and security communities. Furthermore, Taskforce members identified that fragmentation in economic security policymaking – both at a member state and an EU level – was exacerbated by an absence of EU governance structures capable of addressing economic security in a strategic and cohesive manner. Taskforce members agreed that this fragmentation and systems failure had resulted in a less effective relationship between European policymakers and the private sector on economic security issues as compared to other regions, such as North America or Asia Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second Taskforce meeting, held on 26 November 2024, built on these findings by examining the systems and structures necessary to develop robust European economic security priorities, policies and relationships at the member state level, across the EU, and in collaboration with international allies. The meeting featured three plenaries, each adopting a progressively broader perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first session, titled “Looking Inward”, explored current member state and EU frameworks, and considered what measures might be necessary to strengthen economic security within Europe. The second session, “Looking Outward”, examined the EU’s economic security relationships with like-minded partners and discussed the effectiveness of international platforms. The third session, “Looking Forward”, focused on the mission of the recently confirmed European Commissioner for Trade and Economic Security, Maroš Šefčovič, to develop “a new economic security doctrine”. Drawing on the discussions from the first two sessions, Taskforce members deliberated on the potential purpose and scope of this doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the interconnected nature of the discussions that took place, this report does not provide a strict linear summary of the matters raised. Instead, it highlights key observations that emerged from each of the three plenaries and addresses a recurring theme – the role of public–private partnerships (PPPs). At the end of each section, a bullet-pointed summary of the findings is provided. As the meeting was conducted on a non-attributable basis, the names and affiliations of participants are not disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;looking-inward--european-economic-security&quot;&gt;Looking Inward – European Economic Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meeting began with Taskforce members from various member states sharing how their countries were developing and enacting economic security policies. While some Taskforce members commented that the European Commission’s package of measures to strengthen economic security had provided a helpful framework, others felt that most member state efforts remained incremental and reactive, instead of being based on comprehensive and forward-looking strategies. Many Taskforce members reiterated concerns raised during the first meeting – that the fragmentation of economic security policymaking across government sectors had created increased bureaucracy and hindered interagency strategies. Although many Taskforce members highlighted positive steps taken by their countries to map out national strengths and vulnerabilities, it was acknowledged that this was often conducted within the context of a broader national security strategy, as opposed to a standalone economic security policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One member state representative shared that their country had established a dedicated intergovernmental committee under the prime minister, involving all ministries concerned with economic security. This committee not only facilitated horizontal discussions on economic security across government portfolios, but also invited regional representatives to provide field-based insights, enabling the committee to address risks that may be developing at the local level. This Taskforce member elaborated that their government employed several instruments to further their economic security priorities, such as investment screening mechanisms, measures to protect sensitive scientific research, and a government fund to invest in companies targeted by foreign economic statecraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The differing approaches to economic security among member states prompted two Taskforce members – one a country representative and the other a geoeconomic expert – to suggest that the first step should be “getting our own house in order”. The country representative argued that misaligned economic security structures within member states made it premature to seek partnerships with third countries (countries that are not members of the EU), as EU-wide coordination would not be possible. The geoeconomic expert cited the recent electric vehicle tariff dispute between the EU and China as an example of how China exploits European disunity “to pick off individual member states with a carrot and stick approach”, effectively undermining broader EU objectives. Many Taskforce members felt that this example highlighted the need for economic security policies to be unified at the EU level. However, others argued that greater effort should be made to harmonise frameworks and share best practices among member states, without necessarily involving the European Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turning to the EU, one Taskforce member observed that under the new Commission, “the status of economic security has clearly reached a new level”. The Taskforce member remarked that one only has to look to the mission letters to see that nearly every Commissioner has an aspect of economic security embedded within their portfolio. This will require unprecedented interdepartmental coordination at the EU level, though what systems will be used to achieve this have yet to be determined. The Taskforce member emphasised that one of the Commissioner for Trade and Economic Security’s top priorities should be investing in governance structures. Other Taskforce members agreed that an “EU governance level” on economic security was required, though opinions differed on what form it should take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One geoeconomic expert suggested that “the economic security conversation needed to be shifted upwards in the hierarchy”. While efforts to strengthen governance structures within the European Commission are vital, this expert argued that equal attention should be given to the role the European Council can play in facilitating horizontal conversations on economic security. Two suggestions made by the Taskforce member included creating “jumble Councils”, which bring together different Council formations, and better utilisation of the Coreper ambassadors, who already operate across Council policy areas but rarely discuss economic security issues. Another Taskforce member referenced the “2 + 2 dialogue” of the US–Japan Security Consultative Committee as a good model that could be adapted to enable interdepartmental economic security discussions across Council configurations or between European Commission Directorates-General.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taskforce member discussions on the importance of establishing EU-level governance structures frequently referenced how recent geopolitical instability and global shocks have amplified the need to promote European coherence and coordination on economic security. The re-election of Donald Trump to the US presidency was cited by some Taskforce members as a critical challenge to transatlanticism, although others suggested that Trump’s economic proposals should be viewed primarily as a negotiation strategy. More broadly, many Taskforce members described the urgent need to address an emerging “paradigm shift” away from an open economic system and free trade, towards closed economic policies and protectionism. These Taskforce members felt that horizontal governance structures on economic security could play an important role in addressing the ideological debate over the future of the European single market. To use the words of one Taskforce member, pan-European discussions must focus on articulating “what is the EU’s offer to the rest of the world? And how does the EU communicate that to the rest of the world in a way that resonates?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;first-plenary-findings&quot;&gt;First Plenary Findings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continued fragmentation:&lt;/strong&gt; Economic security policymaking and risk management remain fragmented at the member state level, undermining broader EU objectives, although positive steps towards cohesion have been made.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interagency coordination:&lt;/strong&gt; The European Commission’s heightened focus on economic security across Directorates-General will require enhanced governance structures to support unprecedented levels of interdepartmental coordination.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A clear message:&lt;/strong&gt; Defining the EU’s “offer” on economic security is vital in the context of a global paradigm shift away from rules-based multilateralism and open markets and towards rising economic nationalism and protectionism.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;looking-outward--international-economic-security&quot;&gt;Looking Outward – International Economic Security&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Persuasively articulating the European “offer” on economic security will be critical to engaging with international partners, and the importance of partnerships was emphasised by many Taskforce members throughout the second plenary. One Taskforce member with extensive European Commission experience outlined the “three circles of partners” that exist between the EU and third countries. The “inner circle” consists of likeminded partners with whom the EU cooperates closely on a regular basis, such as the G7 countries. The “middle circle” includes the EU’s free trade agreement network and “middle powers”, which the Taskforce member described as states that do not wish to “take sides” in geopolitical contests but share common interests with the EU, for instance, in critical mineral security. Finally, the “outer circle” encompasses the broadest set of countries and intergovernmental organisations, including the G7+, the OECD and the WTO, where the EU works to uphold a rules-based trade system. Taskforce members agreed that sustaining partnerships across these three categories, particularly with outer-circle partners, will require greater investment in the future, given the emerging global paradigm shift away from open economic systems towards closed and protectionist policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance of prioritising and strengthening economic security partnerships was highlighted by numerous Taskforce members. One noted the crucial role that international relationships play in raising awareness of economic security risks and supporting countries facing economic coercion. Many Taskforce members praised the work that had been achieved through the G7 in building consensus on economic security definitions, objectives, guidance, implementation and coordination. Some Taskforce members expressed optimism that similar outcomes could be achieved through the G7+, particularly in relation to promoting and preserving openness within the global economy. However, others felt that the size of the G7+ limited its ability to act proactively, rendering it a forum for primarily reactive conversations. Other Taskforce members suggested leveraging Global Gateway partnerships to strengthen Europe’s position on economic security issues, such as critical dependencies and sanctions circumvention. However, one Taskforce member with experience of the programme commented that its primary focus is on international development, rather than geopolitical objectives, which currently limits its potential impact for economic security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taskforce members also emphasised the value of learning from third country experiences, citing Australia, Japan and South Korea as examples where economic security best practices could inform EU efforts. An Australian Taskforce member shared that their government prioritises economic security dialogues with trusted global partners and, to best facilitate this, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade had recently established an Economic Security Branch. Economic security-related departments across the Australian government (such as the Treasury and the defence and intelligence agencies) can contribute to this central outward-facing body, which is responsible for managing international economic security relationships and identifying possible areas of collaboration. However, the Australian Taskforce member noted that it was often challenging, if not impossible, to find neat areas of overlap with other countries, due to differences in economies and vulnerabilities. Therefore, they stressed the importance of flexibility and adopting the mindset of “one size cannot fit all”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The notion that there is, as one Taskforce member described it, “a no-common-denominator approach to economic security partnerships” was reiterated throughout the second plenary. Several Taskforce members linked this back to the idea of articulating the European “offer” on economic security, commenting that flexibility will be needed to ensure that the offer can be tailored to the diverse needs of international partners. However, it was acknowledged that establishing pan-European structures capable of managing these relationships, without adding unnecessary bureaucracy, would be challenging. Some Taskforce members suggested that the EU should follow the Australian example of establishing a cross-cutting Economic Security Branch, but adapting such a structure to function effectively across the various EU institutions would require careful consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding to this complexity, a Taskforce member with expertise in EU international relations highlighted that partnerships under the European Economic Security Strategy differ from those envisaged under the “new economic foreign policy” announced by President Ursula von der Leyen in the “Political Guidelines for the 2024–2029 European Commission”. The Taskforce member explained that the political guidelines clearly indicate that the new economic foreign policy will sit above economic security priorities because advancing economic security is just one of the policy’s “three central planks”, alongside strengthening trade and investing in partnerships. As a result, the EU will need to coordinate two distinct yet intersecting types of partnerships – those supporting the European Economic Security Strategy, narrowly focused on economic security objectives, and those under the broader economic foreign policy, aimed at advancing EU competitiveness and innovation. The Taskforce member noted that, while neither type of partnership is new, their enhanced prioritisation within the Commission underscores the need for holistic economic security policymaking, systems and dialogues to ensure alignment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;second-plenary-findings&quot;&gt;Second Plenary Findings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance of partnerships:&lt;/strong&gt; Strengthening economic security partnerships between the EU and third countries has produced valuable outcomes, but this will require increased investment to ensure continued progress.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A tailored approach:&lt;/strong&gt; A “one-size-fits-all” approach will not suffice when partnering with third countries. The EU must remain flexible to adapt its economic security “offer” to the diverse needs of its international partners.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coordinating dialogues:&lt;/strong&gt; Enhanced systems are essential to effectively coordinate the intersecting economic security dialogues arising from the European Economic Security Strategy and the new economic foreign policy, ensuing consistency, efficiency and alignment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-role-of-ppps&quot;&gt;The Role of PPPs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance of PPPs to economic security strategies was a key topic of discussion during the first Taskforce meeting. Consequently, during the second meeting, Taskforce members sought to avoid repeating points that had been made previously. Nevertheless, across the first and second plenaries, valuable insights emerged on PPPs within the context of the meeting’s focus on “systems and structures”, which will be briefly summarised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taskforce members emphasised the critical need to implement systems that actively involve the private sector in economic security dialogues. One Taskforce member commented that there was a disconnect between the economic security policies being developed at the member state and EU levels, and their implementation by the private sector. The Taskforce member shared their experience that many companies, already feeling frustrated and constrained by regulation on other topics, often lack the capacity or willingness to engage with new economic security measures. The Taskforce member concluded that without robust systems to improve communication, information sharing and trust between the public and private sectors, there is little point in planning economic security strategies, because their implementation will be ineffectual. A private sector Taskforce member echoed these concerns, pointing out that companies face inconsistent legislation, growing regulatory demands, and competition from international commercial players operating under fewer – or no – rules. These challenges fundamentally impact how businesses advance their investments and operations. The Taskforce member emphasised that coherence and cooperation are essential for fostering private sector support for economic security goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The value of effective communication between policymakers and the private sector was underscored by an Australian Taskforce member, who shared their country’s experience in resisting China’s punitive trade measures.20 The Taskforce member explained that closed-door discussions between senior government officials and industry leaders about the nature of economic coercion challenges had been instrumental in building a shared sense of mission on economic security objectives. Taskforce members agreed that such tactics can be highly effective with domestic companies and thus offer valuable lessons for member states. However, others noted that the EU faces considerable challenges in engaging with multinational or US-orientated firms. These entities often operate under different priorities and legal frameworks, complicating efforts to build alignment on EU economic security objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ppps-findings&quot;&gt;PPPs Findings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthening collaboration:&lt;/strong&gt; To ensure effective implementation of economic security strategies, robust systems for improved communication, information sharing and trust between the public and private sectors must be established.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhancing engagement:&lt;/strong&gt; Informal communication channels between senior policymakers and domestic companies can play a crucial role in building private sector support. However, effective strategies must also be developed to engage multinational and US-based companies on economic security issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;looking-forward--a-european-economic-security-doctrine&quot;&gt;Looking Forward – A European Economic Security Doctrine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the final plenary, Taskforce members were asked to build upon the previous discussions and consider the potential, and possible pitfalls, of a European economic security doctrine. A recurring theme throughout the first and second plenaries, as well as during the inaugural Taskforce meeting, was the current fragmentation of economic security policymaking. This is evident in the silos amid government ministries and between the trade and security communities; a lack of alignment among member states; a disconnect between member state initiatives and EU-level policies; and ineffective engagement with the private sector. Taskforce members agreed that an economic security doctrine could provide “the link” between these areas of fragmentation, fostering greater cohesion, coordination and consensus. However, there was also a general acknowledgement that, as one Taskforce member observed, “this is easier said than done”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many Taskforce members emphasised that an economic security doctrine should not replicate the European Economic Security Strategy. One Taskforce member suggested that the doctrine should focus on mapping out “who does what, when, and with what tools”. However, some Taskforce members argued that this level of detail could not be achieved by a single doctrine. Instead, they advocated for the development of multiple doctrines tailored to specific industries or supply chains, which would use risk assessments to identify sensitive pinch points, outline applicable tools, and address potential conflicts between member state and EU competences. In contrast, others expressed concern that multiple doctrines would lead to even greater fragmentation, government intervention and institutional bureaucracy, overburdening the private sector and undermining competitiveness. Instead of trying to cover the field, a Taskforce member raised the importance of realism, suggesting that a doctrine should focus on identifying the most strategic economic security steps the EU needs to take within the next five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing on these various observations, a geoeconomics and security specialist offered a defence perspective on the concept of a doctrine. The Taskforce member explained that, in a military sense, a doctrine serves as the bridge between strategy and implementation, ensuring coherence. Operational fields – analogous to specific industries or supply chains in the context of economic security – do not require separate doctrines, but rather tailored approaches within a unified framework. The Taskforce member emphasised that the purpose of a doctrine is to establish clear goals: defining what needs to be achieved; within what time frame; and identifying all instruments that are necessary to reach those objectives. The doctrine thus becomes an encapsulation of the overarching strategic vision, which can be adapted into a suite of tailored operational approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need to articulate a strategic vision for the future of European economic security emerged as the central consensus point of the third plenary, with several Taskforce members commenting that this was missing from the European Economic Security Strategy. Revisiting discussions from the first plenary, a number of Taskforce members suggested that a strategic vision should be thought of as the European “offer” on economic security, which could be operationalised through a doctrine. One Taskforce member commented that crafting such a vision requires answering a fundamental question: “What does the EU want to use its economic power for?” There was broad agreement that the EU should transition from its current risk-based and defensive economic security agenda towards a more proactive and offensive stance. One Taskforce member highlighted that the euro is the second most important currency in the international monetary system and that the EU is the world’s second largest economy. They argued that a doctrine’s offensive objectives should focus on how the EU can leverage its economic power to strengthen international economic security, benefiting both Europe and its likeminded partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance of effectively communicating that a European economic security doctrine benefits not only Europe, but also serves the interests of broader partners, was the concluding focus of the discussion. Several Taskforce members voiced concerns about how adversaries have successfully weaponised language on economic security topics. One example provided was the recent UN debate on unilateral coercive measures, where adversarial narratives framing such measures as illegal, unjust and exploitative gained significant traction. The failure of Europe to clearly articulate the objectives of its sanctions regime against Russia, or to secure broad third-country and private sector support after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, highlights a critical challenge facing a European economic security doctrine. As one Taskforce member aptly noted, “the language of the pitch is probably as important as the substance”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taskforce members agreed that careful drafting will be needed to develop a doctrine with global resonance. European economic security must not be presented as a zero-sum game or, in the words of one Taskforce member, as an expression of a “Fortress Europe mentality”. Instead, the doctrine should emphasise mutual benefit and shared prosperity. To achieve this, another Taskforce member suggested using the G7 as a sounding board to refine effective language. However, due to widespread perceptions of a geopolitical divide between the G7 and BRICS, the Taskforce member stressed that it would be important to deliver the doctrine’s message through more inclusive platforms, such as the OECD, the WTO or the G20. Despite the fractured nature of these multilateral institutions, engaging with them would demonstrate the EU’s genuine commitment to collaboration on a positive vision for the global economy. This could strengthen alliances with Europe’s likeminded partners, enabling the doctrine to be an instrument of unity, not division.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;third-plenary-findings&quot;&gt;Third Plenary Findings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An overarching vision:&lt;/strong&gt; A European economic security doctrine can encapsulate an essential overarching vision for European economic security, which can be adapted into tailored approaches for specific industries and supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic realism:&lt;/strong&gt; A doctrine could create cohesion among fragmented areas of economic security policy, but it is important to remain realistic and strategic about its potential impact.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Careful communication:&lt;/strong&gt; The doctrine’s language must be carefully crafted and communicated to gain the support of international partners and prevent it from being weaponised by adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second meeting of the RUSI European Economic Security Taskforce featured a series of constructive and forward-looking discussions. Over three plenaries, Taskforce members emphasised the urgent need for enhanced systems to enable greater economic cohesion among member states; improve interdepartmental coordination at the EU level; and strengthen collaboration with international partners and the private sector. These structures, and other existing economic security initiatives, could be aligned under a doctrine that articulates an overarching vision for European economic security. Such a doctrine would need to be carefully crafted and communicated to ensure it serves as a unifying, not divisive, instrument on the world stage. While the meeting underscored the practical and ideological complexities of this goal, Taskforce members expressed strong optimism about the potential for likeminded actors to unite in developing a proactive and positive response to shared economic security challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taskforce will continue to examine emerging issues for economic security in 2025, including the future of transatlantic trade relationships, key priorities for PPPs, and the security implications of Europe’s economic interactions with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper’s main focus is on three case studies: Syria, the Central African Republic (CAR) and Mali, but Wagner as a whole is also considered. To assess the group’s profitability, the paper aggregates various sources of financial information to understand Wagner’s financial model, its revenue sources and its costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of Wagner’s deployments were loss making, others barely profitable and some very profitable (the CAR and Syria). It was part of its venture-capitalist business model that failures should happen and were even deemed acceptable, if other operations produced sufficient revenue. Moreover, Prigozhin engaged in his Wagner business also because the favours that his Russian businesses received from President Vladimir Putin were likely conditional on Prigozhin returning them, including by serving the geopolitical interests of Russia abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wagner did not make huge profits overall, especially when the risks involved are considered. Prigozhin made his money with his Russian businesses. It is clear that his ventures in Africa and the Middle East did not contribute significantly to Russia’s coffers, whether in terms of taxes paid or any other way. That does not even appear to have been the purpose: rather, they were intended to sustain Russia’s foreign policy initiatives. At least in the short term, this objective was achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prigozhin’s death raised serious questions about the sustainability of the Wagner business model. The Russian government did try to encourage other tycoons linked to the Kremlin, such as Gennady Timchenko and Arkady Rotenberg, to adopt the model, but neither showed much enthusiasm nor managed to replicate Prigozhin’s mix of shadowy but entrepreneurial business operations. This resulted in Wagner’s activities in Africa being curtailed, but not dismantled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wagner’s colonial-style business model only really took hold in the CAR and Syria. In Syria, the model became unacceptable even to Bashar al-Assad’s regime, despite its heavy dependence on Russian support. The prospects for it being replicated elsewhere now look remote, not only because of the rarity of Prigozhin’s “talent”, but also because it clashes with increasingly nationalist African and Middle Eastern environments. Wagner may be described as a product of a phase of oligarchic politics in Russia, when Putin saw wealthy cronies as a more viable business model than Russia’s rusty state apparatus, even in foreign policymaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper stresses that any revenue accruing to Wagner from its extractive operations needs to be offset against costs. Large deployments of fighters and equipment are very burdensome financially, and big revenue-generating businesses would be needed to justify them. With Prigozhin gone and given the lack of appetite for his neo-colonial approach among governments who might make use of Wagner’s style of operations, a more feasible approach for achieving substantial profits in the future would be a focus on smuggling. Wagner was already engaged in such activities, for example with the Captagon amphetamine trade in Syria. It is far from clear, however, that Russia will allow Wagner to focus on smuggling activities, which would be difficult to control from Moscow. Moreover, such operations could well undermine Russia’s diplomatic aims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the very origins of the Wagner Group (Wagner), there has been a close connection between its “warriors for hire” business and the exploitation of natural resources. This began with Wagner’s predecessor, the Slavonic Corps, mercenaries commanded by one of Wagner’s founders, Dmitry Utkin, who were contracted by Bashar Al-Assad’s regime in Syria to protect oil facilities in exposed locations such as Deir ez-Zor. Although the Slavonic Corps experiment was a failure, it provided a model for Wagner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been speculated that following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, mining operations in Africa contributed to the relief of sanctions on Russia and even to funding the military effort in Ukraine. This argument is based on estimates of what logging ($1 billion) and mining contracts ($2.7 billion) in the Central African Republic (CAR) might be worth over their lifetime. If this speculation were correct, the implications would be major. However, as this paper shows, translated into yearly revenue, these figures could be irrelevant in terms of Russia’s war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A somewhat different take can be found in the description by the late Russian journalist Kirill Romanovsky of Wagner as a “new version of the East India Company”, referring to the British trading company that ended up taking control of much of the Indian subcontinent and Hong Kong in the 18th and 19th centuries. In this view, the stress is on Wagner being a “state in the guise of a merchant”, that is, something much more self-serving than believers in a grand scheme of the Russian state might assume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper argues that this interpretive model suits Wagner only to a limited extent. Others have raised doubts about the profitability of the entire Wagner enterprise. This paper shows that Wagner paid for the costs of its operations on the whole, and that while it was profitable, its margins were not particularly impressive given the high-risk character of its business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper examines the questions of whether Wagner was profitable at its peak, and the implications of its business model for Russia and Russia’s geopolitical rivals – both in the recent past and in the future. The questions are posed in relation both to specific deployments in the paper’s case study countries – Syria, the CAR and Mali – and to Wagner as a whole. Libya is omitted from this paper in part because Wagner operated there on a contract allegedly paid for by the UAE and did not directly intervene in Libya’s oil industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address these research questions, this paper aggregates various sources of financial information in order to understand Wagner’s financial model – its revenue sources and costs – with the aim of assessing both the group’s profitability and the potential policy levers that could be used to disrupt its operations. In recent years, many investigative and analytical reports have highlighted Wagner’s business operations and sources of income, which range from government security and military contracts to the exploitation of natural resources. These reports rely on a combination of interviews, leaked documents and financial statements filed publicly by Wagner’s many companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research for this paper relies on both primary and secondary sources of information. A total of 38 interviews were carried out by the project’s research team in Syria, the CAR, Mali and Mozambique, as well as in other countries. The interviews were with current and former Wagner staff (13); Russian and non-Russian diplomats and military officers (three); government officials, military officers, representatives from business and local community elders from Syria, the CAR and Mali (18); and four experts and analysts working on Wagner in various European and North American countries. All interviews were carried out between 2023 and 2024, as part of the project “Wagner Group and Russia’s Presence in Africa and the Middle East”, whose output includes three further research papers that deal with other aspects of Wagner’s operations. A few interviewees spoke in their official capacity or as external observers, but the large majority spoke on condition of anonymity. It was then decided to anonymise all interviews regardless in order to avoid interviewees being traced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the topic of this study, it inevitably relies largely on verbal sources (both formal interviews and informal conversations between researchers and witnesses). The authors are aware of the limitations that this implies and have made every effort to gather what was available from news reports and reports produced by other researchers. While there is of course no direct access to primary written sources, such as the records of Wagner itself or the Russian government, the authors benefited from some material leaked to the media. The authors sought to corroborate and supplement the information obtained from interviews with a review of other publicly available data, such as trade data and statistics, publicly available corporate information and other sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The limitations discussed above derive primarily from having to conduct primary research in conflict-affected countries. However, in the aftermath of Wagner’s mutiny in 2023, when many staff members left Wagner or developed grudges against the Russian state, finding individuals willing to be interviewed became easier than expected. Still, the body of data collected is inevitably incomplete, and follow-up on specific themes was often not possible, which is reflected in the analysis in the paper. The three research teams were led by individuals with extensive experience and contacts in the field, so although obtaining access was not a major problem, the authors are aware that interviewees could be affected by social desirability bias, resulting in prejudiced information about rival organisations and/or overstatement of achievements, capabilities and resources. Such risks were addressed by ensuring a balanced mix of interviewees to reflect differing points of view and incorporating test questions in the questionnaires to assess the reliability of the sources. The research team also focused the discussion on issues that were the least controversial for the interviewee in order to incentivise cooperation and information sharing. Given Wagner’s controversial character, it was difficult to identify neutral sources and opinions were highly polarised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors analysed the data – cleansing it of what stood out from the bulk – with the aim of highlighting not only Wagner’s sources of income (drawing on prior reporting, in particular) but also the potential costs of generating this income. In most cases, transporting mined or extracted goods requires a number of logistical steps. Potential policy levers are therefore implied in relation not only to reducing revenue to Wagner, but also to increasing its costs, interrupting its logistics and disrupting its access to international markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wagner’s position in Syria, Mali and the CAR became more tenuous after the 2023 Wagner mutiny in Russia and the death of the group’s leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin. Since then, other Russian private military groups, such as Redut and Africa Corps, have moved into (or are negotiating their way into) many of Wagner’s operations in Africa, causing instability that was reflected in the interviews for this paper, which were carried out after the deaths of Prigozhin, Utkin and Valery Chekalov, Wagner’s financial manager. Despite, or perhaps because of this instability, the authors believe there remains an opportunity to understand the business drivers for Wagner and its successors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;limitations-and-challenges&quot;&gt;Limitations and Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the transnational nature of Wagner and the recent changes to its operations, there are several important limitations and caveats in relation to the research for this paper. These correspond to key questions, many of which have been the subject of extensive academic and policy debates, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which companies comprise(d) Wagner?&lt;/strong&gt; This remains unclear and difficult to determine with precision. Prigozhin’s career famously spanned business activities from catering to gold, so establishing which business activities are part of Wagner’s private military and security company (PMSC) business model is both important and nebulous. For this paper, the authors focus on the PMSCs active in the three country case studies, but also briefly consider the Russian origins of some of Wagner’s funding, which they assess to be similar to the start-up capital that Prigozhin used to expand first into Syria, and potentially beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Wagner’s current status?&lt;/strong&gt; The evidence the authors have gathered suggests that certain individuals connected with the Wagner model, particularly in the CAR, remain active (see below). However, in July 2024, when the research was completed, the situation remained fluid. Russia’s use of PMSCs has adapted to new circumstances, with a proliferation of smaller businesses and direct Ministry of Defence (MoD) contracts. Wagner is and always has been primarily a group based on Prigozhin’s charisma, and it is now tentatively gathering around his 25-year-old son Pavel, who previously controlled a number of businesses, but was not involved in running Wagner. Attempts to take over Wagner’s business activities have succeeded in Syria, but in other deployments – and in the CAR and Mali in particular – personnel and operational control are not dramatically different from when Prigozhin was alive.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How reliable is the data on Wagner?&lt;/strong&gt; Whether provided by Russian official sources, Wagner’s client governments, local sources, or sources opposed to Russia, data is of dubious reliability. Exact timeframes are rarely available. While there is at least relative consensus on the salaries paid to Wagner staff, there is uncertainty about Wagner’s costs, and the investments it made in mining operations, for example. This affects efforts to estimate the profitability of Wagner’s operations. The authors have, therefore, often had to make a judgement call.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that this paper does not aim to offer an audit of Wagner’s finances, but is an attempt to assess the viability of the group’s business model in the case study countries. For this, estimates can suffice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper has two chapters. Chapter I provides a detailed overview of Wagner’s sources of income, its costs and profitability in the three case study countries. The chapter includes background on Prigozhin’s other business activities in Russia, with the primary aim of identifying any links between them and Wagner. Chapter II discusses the vulnerabilities of the Wagner business model, which could have an impact on the group’s long-term sustainability and even viability. The Conclusion draws the analysis together and assesses how Wagner’s business model has served both Prigozhin’s business operations and Russian foreign policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-wagners-revenue-costs-and-profitability&quot;&gt;I. Wagner’s Revenue, Costs and Profitability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter explores Wagner’s different revenue sources and offers rough estimates of the group’s operating costs and an analysis of how profitable Wagner’s business model has been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;prigozhins-russian-capital&quot;&gt;Prigozhin’s Russian Capital&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper does not analyse Wagner’s (or Prigozhin’s) Russian operations in depth. However, it would be remiss to ignore the contracts of Wagner companies with Russian state organisations. In a June 2023 speech, Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed that Wagner was funded heavily by the Russian state, more than RUB86 billion (about €818 million) for a single year. This figure is likely to be due mainly to Wagner’s involvement in Russia’s war in Ukraine, but it also highlights the fact that Wagner conducted many business activities with the Russian state in addition to its African and Middle Eastern operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the relationship between Prigozhin and Russia long pre-dates Wagner. Numerous journalists have sought to compile the full scale of its finances using publicly available information, including Russian government procurement data. Between 2014 and 2021, holding companies that were part of Prigozhin’s Concord Group recorded a turnover of €5.6 billion, the majority of which was reported to come from Russian state agencies. Many of the contracts were with the Russian MoD, which granted them for a wide range of services, including cleaning, catering, maintenance, repairs and fuel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scholars have noted that these funds were part of a relationship in which Wagner was deliberately kept well funded, allowing it to accumulate capital which then enabled its venture capitalist-style expansion into new markets such as Syria, the CAR and Mali. After that, however, according to Anna Arutunyan and Mark Galeotti, “the heavy lifting – primarily ensuring security and logistics – fell to Wagner and Prigozhin”. These authors argue that Wagner became an “expensive luxury” that nevertheless allowed Prigozhin to remain useful to the Kremlin for “future deniable operations”. It is not clear, however, whether Putin saw Wagner as a luxury. In a pattern not exclusive to Prigozhin, or to Russia, the civilian contracts arbitrarily channelled to Prigozhin appear to have been ordinary state expenditure. The prices charged by Prigozhin might have been inflated (there is no evidence for this), but what was specific in the Putin–Prigozhin relationship was that rather than focusing on supporting Putin politically at home, Prigozhin enabled or supported a revival of Russia’s superpower pretensions abroad. This business model proved to work in Syria first, where oil revenue eventually generated returns, encouraging Prigozhin to replicate the model elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;syria&quot;&gt;Syria&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wagner’s involvement in Syria began in 2015, in the context of Russia’s operational and combat support for the Assad regime. The group was involved in frontline operations – training militias, advising government forces and securing energy and infrastructure facilities. Data is opaque, as is usual with Wagner, but some rough estimates can be made. One is that during the period from approximately 2015 to 2016, the cost of providing Wagner fighters to Assad’s regime was estimated at €30–€95 million (around €2.3–€7.9 million per month), which covered their salaries. Since the number of fighters is estimated to have peaked at 2,500, the higher-end estimate can be taken to place the cost per Wagner fighter per month at €3,160 at peak strength. Leaked Russian MoD data suggests that the approximate cost of the year-long campaign carried out by Wagner can be estimated at between $76.5 and $154.5 million per year, including equipment, food, accommodation and compensation for relatives in the event of a Wagner fighter’s death, during the dates when that peak figure of around 2,500 troops was reached (there would have been some fluctuations in the numbers month to month). The latter, leaked, figures would appear to be too low if all was included, considering the previous figures and the high cost of military equipment. The more likely scenario, which reconciles the two sets of figures, is that it cost a maximum of $5,150 ($154.5 million per year for 2,500 men) per Wagner fighter per month, which could make sense if all but personal equipment and logistics were excluded. In 2015–16, a former Wagner member estimated the salaries at $3,180–$5,300, depending on the period (as they reduced over time). This seems roughly consistent with the leaked MoD figures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 2016, the costs of the operation diminished (with fewer than 500 fighters remaining by 2021), and Wagner signed its first profit-making opportunity in Syria since the five-year contract that had been signed in late 2016. This contract allowed Evro Polis LLC, a company connected to Prigozhin’s Concord Group, to recapture rebel-held oil and gas fields, in return for which the company would receive 25% of the profits, as well as repayment of its costs. One Syrian interviewee stated that the idea of paying for the recapture of oil fields with a share of their profits came from Wagner itself, not from Damascus or Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To capture the oil fields, Wagner formed the Al-Sayyad Company for Guarding and Protection Services Ltd, a group known colloquially as “ISIS Hunters”, led by Lieutenant General Ali Mahmoud Abbas. In contrast to the purpose implied by the ISIS Hunters’ moniker, the group’s “core task was to take care of the oil field”. Its fighters were reported to have been trained and experienced, taken from existing army and militia units, although seemingly demoralised from the beginning. By the time ISIS Hunters was emerging, Wagner’s original Russian MoD contract was being phased out and its principal concern was not with the battlefield, but with the security of and revenue generated from the captured oil fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oil and Gas Revenue&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once they controlled the fields, Wagner subsequently operated the oil and gas assets through four primary entities: Evro Polis LLC, Velada LLC, Mercury LLC and Kapital LLC. Specifically, the Syrian regime also awarded two primary exploration and production contracts in 2019, and a further contract in 2021. In 2019, Velada LLC was awarded Block 23, a 2,159-square kilometre gas field north of Damascus and Mercury LLC was awarded Blocks 7 and 19, two oil and gas fields on the left bank of the Euphrates. Kapital LLC, which opened in 2017, received a further contract in 2021 for exclusive oil exploration in Shelf 1 in Syria’s economic zone in the Mediterranean, off the coast of Tartus province. The combined value of these contracts has been estimated at $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reporting based on publicly filed financial statements for these companies shows that they posted significant profits. Despite being sanctioned by the US in 2018, Evro Polis LLC posted sales of $134 million in 2020, resulting in a net profit of $90 million. Mercury LLC was sanctioned by the EU in 2021, by which point it had already generated revenue of $67 million (2018–21).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research interviews for this paper support the view that the oil fields were profitable. However, one interviewee, a source in Wagner’s finance team, gave higher figures than the public financial statements, saying that, for example, overall, Wagner had earned $37 million per month through its oil operations in Syria. Other sources suggest different figures. For example, a Russian opposition journalist has written that around $20 million was earned through oil and gas sales in 2018. In any event, it is likely that the level of revenue would have fluctuated over time. Multiple sources close to Wagner’s operations in Syria have stated that Wagner had an agreement not to pay taxes in the country, and that it excelled at coercing Syrian officials and partners to operate under conditions and at rates imposed by the group itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How these revenue figures translated into profit is less clear, as there is less operational reporting about the business costs. The interviews show that Wagner-affiliated geologists and managers took over key controlling and management functions in the oil and gas businesses, but they relied on the existing local workforce and its sales functions. They also had Syrian partner businesses in a variety of roles, including in some cases helping with smuggling operations. Among these were Udeh, General Petroleum, Syrian Petroleum, Al-Furat, Yasir oil companies and others. These companies appear to have been willing to work with Prigozhin, due to the extraordinary profits made by avoiding taxes and customs, which were shared with Syrian business partners, who today describe that time as a bonanza. Through Syrian Petroleum and General Petroleum, even the Assad family benefited from Wagner’s involvement. In the words of a Syrian official:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[These Syrian businessmen who were working with Wagner] were undoubtedly wealthy throughout their time with Wagner; there were no controls and no taxes at all. [They] are therefore unhappy because, I believe, they lost a powerful partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another Syrian official essentially agreed that payments were made to local partners, including, he claimed, members of the Assad family. Sources also said the Russian government received between 10% and 30% of Wagner’s contracts. All this substantially reduced the amount of cash left for Wagner to pay its costs and make a profit. Other reported costs have been minor, such as the donation of protective goods and other equipment to support Syria during the Covid-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the profits from the oil and gas operations were clearly significant and almost certainly exceeded €100 million per year, given that, as shown above, Evro Polis’s profits alone were close to that figure. The value of Wagner’s Syrian operations is perhaps best demonstrated by the extended negotiations between Russia and Syria following the mutiny and Prigozhin’s death. In the aftermath of the mutiny, multiple sources in Syria corroborated that the Russian government, specifically the MoD, took steps to seize these enterprises. A source within Wagner’s finance team claimed that Wagner received no compensation for the seizure of these businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Drug Trade&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important revenue source for Wagner was trade in the amphetamine Captagon. One interviewee, a Russian diplomat, referred to this trade as being on a par with Wagner’s oil and gas operations, saying that Wagner’s economic efforts were “busy with drug trafficking and fuel trafficking”. This opinion was corroborated by a Syrian businessman who worked with Wagner. The rise in Captagon production coincided with Russian (and Iranian) support for Assad’s forces regaining control of the Daraa region, a hub of production of Captagon in Syria previously held by the Free Syrian Army. The Captagon industry’s turnover has been estimated at more than $5.7 billion, with the bulk coming from Syria. In fact, the trade is “several times larger than all of Syria’s annual exports combined”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the Captagon industry in Syria is heavily fragmented, and so Wagner’s profits would have been at best only a relatively small fraction of the total turnover, it could easily have accounted for a major share of the group’s business in Syria. There is no indication, however, that the Russian state was interested in this business. The diplomat interviewed volunteered a negative comment on the drug trade (“they were busy with drug trafficking”) without prompting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overall Profitability&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The absence of data on revenue generated for Wagner from its involvement in the Captagon trade makes it difficult to estimate the total contribution of the Syrian operation. Overall, however, it is clear that, until Wagner was expelled from the country in September 2023, Syria was a significant source of net revenue for Wagner, at more than €100 million per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-central-african-republic&quot;&gt;The Central African Republic&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wagner’s operations in the CAR began in December 2017, when the UN granted Russia an exemption from the existing embargo to provide arms to the government led by President Faustin-Archange Touadéra. By 2018, Touadéra appeared in public with a personal protection detail that reportedly included Wagner personnel. Since then, Wagner has steadily expanded its financial interests in the country to include gold and diamond mining, as well as timber mining. Before Prigozhin’s death, the group had also set up alcohol and coffee production (although the profitability of these ventures is unclear, as discussed below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wagner’s key security companies operating in the CAR are Sewa Security Services, a subsidiary of Lobaye Invest SARLU, which have both been sanctioned, as have key personnel operating on behalf of Wagner in the country. According to research interviewees, Wagner has not set up Russian-registered businesses in the CAR. Instead, the group relies on CAR companies run by figureheads but controlled by Wagner operatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wagner’s CAR operations remain the most intact since the death of Prigozhin, although it is unclear whether this will continue. A Wagner source in the CAR claimed that prior to Prigozhin’s death, the group was making billions of dollars annually through its revenue streams, including gold, diamond and timber mining. This estimate appears high, and indeed other interviewees disputed the claim. The same source remarked that after Prigozhin’s death, Wagner was only making $200 million per year in the CAR, presumably referring to revenue. Considering that the Ndassima gold mine, by far the most profitable operation in the CAR, was still operating at the time of the research interviews, it seems unlikely that the reduction in revenue would have been as large as suggested by the source. The “billions” should, therefore, be taken as hyperbole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Wagner members have said that the CAR was the model, or “an advertising poster” for Prigozhin – an example of a symbiotic relationship between the group and its host country that was seen as beneficial to both parties. This is evident in the wide range of income streams, ranging from natural resources to tax and customs capabilities. It is in the CAR that Wagner managed to follow the “East India Company” model most closely, with Wagner and the Touadéra regime rapidly developing a collaborative relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the CAR, Wagner is a network of individuals that has subsumed state and corporate functions – diplomacy, military, business – and has grafted itself on to local power networks in the pursuit of mutually beneficial and profitable projects. Over time, these networks have become interdependent. John Lechner and Marat Gabidullin note that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Although the presence of Wagner has tipped the power balance in the government’s favour, historical modes of governance – the relationship between armed groups and the state and between the centre and periphery – have changed little in the CAR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A source close to the CAR’s Ministry of Finance has been reported as estimating Wagner’s earnings from the CAR government at a total of about €7.6 million per month – or an overall total of about €391 million since 2018. These figures include security services and other support provided by Wagner, although the other contracts have not been specified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following sections focus on Wagner’s key income streams and the costs associated with them, to the degree that is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Security and Support Services&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the CAR, Wagner provided between 500 soldiers in 2018 and up to 2,000 in 2021. While one 2024 report estimated that Wagner had around 1,600 soldiers in the CAR, a Wagner source suggested that by April 2024, only 600 remained. These soldiers were reportedly paid around $3,000 per month each, payments made in roubles to the fighters’ accounts in Russia. Thus, the salary costs for a year for 600–1,600 soldiers would be $21.6 million to $57.6 million. One interviewee claimed that the Russian MoD took 30% of Wagner’s revenue under this contract, to cover additional costs borne by the MoD, which provided equipment and air transport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the available data, it is not possible to say whether the Russian MoD managed to make a profit out of this percentage, or whether it instead in practice subsidised Wagner’s operations. If the MoD gained financially, this would highlight another feature of Wagner’s model, which is that, although the group does not pay taxes (see below), it may pay some percentages as formal or informal charges in exchange for a contract. The MoD charge in this case seems to be formal, but there are reports of Wagner paying bribes to government officials in countries where it is operating, such as Mozambique, Syria and Cameroon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Customs and Tax Collection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been reported that Wagner established control over parts of the CAR’s customs agency, and collected taxes from agricultural production. In May 2021, the CAR government signed an agreement with Russia on customs cooperation, with Wagner operatives involved in the scheme. Reports on the scheme cited concerns among traders over “surcharges” enforced by Russian agents. Before October 2021, this was formulated as “technical assistance” to certain customs offices, but it was reportedly later changed to a contract covering tax and customs services. In 2022, Nigerian media reported allegations that Wagner operatives were collecting taxes on agriculture exports across the Bria, Ouadda and Ndele regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Involvement in customs is likely part of Wagner’s contract in the CAR, but whether funds were raised through the “surcharges”, and in what quantities, is unclear. Aside from being a potential source of income, Wagner’s role in tax collection likely serves another function – as a way of avoiding customs charges on its own trading activity. This would contribute to the profitability of the Wagner business model, demonstrating the group’s capture of key revenue-earning state functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gold Mining at Ndassima, the CAR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2018, Lobaye Invest was granted a contract to “identify possible gold and diamond deposits”. In the same year, the Prigozhin-affiliated front company Midas Resources was granted a 25-year mining concession for the Ndassima gold mine, Wagner’s most valuable asset in the CAR. The mine had been previously operated by Aurafrique, part of Canada’s AXMIN group, before it was taken over by anti-government rebels in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a 2020 statement, the CAR’s Ministry of Mines estimated that the gross value of gold deposits at the site was $2.8 billion. Some experts have estimated annual revenue generated from the mine at between $100 million and $290 million, which if true would make it one of Wagner’s central financial assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, earlier reporting from Ndassima’s previous owners raises questions about these figures, and implies that they come at a cost. When the mine was first taken over by rebels in 2013 (after which the CAR revoked AXMIN’s licence to the site), the mine was not at a production stage. Further, AXMIN documentation indicates that the project had recently been at an early phase only, requiring significant investment to begin achieving financial results. A 2006 pre-feasibility study by AXMIN for the entire project in the CAR showed potential reserves of 1.54 million ounces of gold, of which a newly discovered deposit at Ndassima was one part. At current prices (at the time of writing), this would have a total value of more than $4 billion. However, AXMIN also expected to incur $110 million in exploration and development costs for the site – a figure that rose to $280–$310 million in its 2013 Annual Report, following clashes between government forces and rebels at the site. A US report from early 2023 indicated that Wagner has also invested in hugely expanding the mine to encompass eight production areas, although it is unclear how much the development cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AXMIN anticipated possible production of 200,000 ounces per year, following the full development of the site – which could allow revenues of up to $500 million at current prices (at the time of writing). The volume of production at the site is still unclear, but even with Russian-backed expansion, the form of mining continues to be primarily artisanal, and it is not clear whether the industrial facilities present are a result of investments made by Wagner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wagner’s artisanal mining may have its own costs. Interviewees highlighted that Wagner’s business model was to lease out the concessions and permits that its companies were granted. This means that Wagner likely made only a certain percentage on the total revenue. Indeed, one interviewee noted that the group was likely to make more money “taxing” or leasing out to artisanal miners and others, rather than operating the mines itself. This is consistent with Wagner’s lack of expertise in mining, and with a report that maps out the value chain in the CAR’s artisanal mining sector, which highlighted several layers in a hierarchy of local personnel managing artisanal mining sites, including workers, mine managers, landowners (often local tribal leaders), traders and trade facilitators, and buyers and exporters. At each stage, producers incur certain costs and make a profit when selling on to the next stage. It is unclear which elements Wagner controls, how, and at what price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wagner also received permits to explore other gold mining sites in the country. Documents dated 2018 showed that Lobaye Invest had won exploration rights for diamonds and gold at seven sites, including an area near Yawa, in the southwest of the CAR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are reports that Wagner actively sought to reshape the mining sector in the CAR to its advantage, for example attempting to “influence the revision of mining legislation so that the legal framework would serve its own economic interests, particularly its control over production”, or recommending that the government bring the artisanal mining sector under state control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diamond Mining at Ndassima&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wagner conducts its diamond operations through Lobaye Invest and Russian-owned Diamville SAU, a company established in March 2019. Lobaye Invest’s contracts include the July 2018 contract to identify diamond deposits, as well as a three-year contract allowing it to mine diamonds and gold in five areas, four of which are defined as “red zones” by the Kimberley Process (a global initiative to end conflict diamond mining): Bangassou, Ouaddah, Bria and Sam-Ouandja.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was not possible to obtain financial information about proceeds from Wagner’s diamond operations, largely because of the secrecy of diamond transportation and sale. Research by the European Investigative Collaboration, the All Eyes on Wagner collective and the Dossier Center has placed the value of legal diamond exports by Diamville to the UAE and Antwerp between October 2019 and January 2021 (16 months) at $12 million. This suggests an annual turnover of $9 million. Some estimates have placed the total value of diamond sales (including smuggling) in the tens of millions. The CAR Kimberley Process Permanent Secretariat listed Diamville as one of the top diamond exporters from the CAR in 2021 and 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wagner likely employs the same labour and market practices in diamond mining as for gold: relying on artisanal miners and taking a percentage of the profits. The same labour abuses apply (as they do to artisanal mining in the CAR in general): public reporting and interviewees noted that the employees of these mines are paid poorly, and that some may be considered “even slaves”. Wages, according to one interviewee, “are low, paid irregularly, and not always in full”. Resistance is met with torture or death, according to many reports. These practices in all likelihood pre-date Wagner’s arrival, differing only perhaps in the greater coercion involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Timber Logging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another source of revenue for Wagner in the CAR is timber. In February 2021, Bois Rouge (formerly Wood International Group SARLU and later operating as Ripperwood SARL) received a logging permit for an area measuring 186,600 hectares in the southwest of the country. This permit had reportedly previously been held by a company called Batalimo Forest Industries, whose permit was revoked in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall value of these logging permits is unclear, but some estimates place the concession’s value at $890 million, using international pricing. Investigators have tracked some of Bois Rouge’s exports using shipping records, which show that timber worth at least €3.4 million alone entered the EU in 2022. They highlighted seven shipments of wood that arrived in Denmark and France, including two shipments after European media reports had linked Bois Rouge to Wagner. A Wagner source put the value of timber exports at $20 million per year before Prigozhin’s death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The costs for these goods include labour (likely to be minimal, given the company’s labour practices) and equipment. Journalists have highlighted at least 260 records showing Bois Rouge imports of Russian equipment in late 2021. These goods included asbestos sheets, a tractor and building materials. The importer for these goods was Logistique Économique Étrangère.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CAR government has reduced or revoked taxes for Wagner-linked companies. In April 2021, a letter from the CAR’s minister of finance outlined that Wagner would only have to pay customs duties of 5% on its imports for five years. The letter also stated that Bois Rouge would receive exemptions from corporate taxes and have VAT payments reduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current status of this business is unclear, with one interviewee stating that the business is currently not operational, and another stating that production decreased rapidly after Prigozhin’s death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Other Minerals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are limited reports that another Prigozhin-affiliated company, M-Finance, has been involved in mining other stones, such as quartz and mica (a silicate mineral). Meanwhile, in 2019, Midas Resources took over a greenstone mine in the CAR previously operated by Aurafrique, which had held the mining permit since 2006. The revenue generated by this is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alcohol Production&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wagner expanded into the alcohol business in the months before Prigozhin’s death. In 2023, the group was reported to have established a brewery in Bangui, and equipped it with Russian technology. The construction of the brewery was estimated to have cost between $25 million and $30 million. Local bars were often forced to sell its brands Africa Ti L’Or and Bière Russe. According to expert analysis of satellite images obtained by Bloomberg and All Eyes on Wagner, the plant was built with the capacity to produce 500,000 hectolitres (one hectolitre is equal to 100 litres) of beer annually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The market entry strategy of the Wagner-backed brewery reflects its approach to targeting competition. Prior to the opening of the Bangui brewery, a series of attacks and propaganda campaigns were launched against the Mocaf brewery, a CAR subsidiary of the French company Castel, in Bangui. French-language flyers were distributed accusing Mocaf of “financing terrorism”. It has been alleged that Wagner was behind an arson attack on Mocaf, as a result of which 50,000 bottles of beer were destroyed, with damage amounting to $200,000. (This campaign will have incurred some costs, although probably not significant ones.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, it was reported that two local vodkas, Bamara and Wa Ne We, emerged in November 2021, announced by billboards, launch parties and other events. The seller was reported to be First Industrial Company, registered in the name of one of Wagner’s top leaders in the CAR, Dmitry Sytyi. The company reportedly employed two Russian engineers and about 20 CAR employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most reports highlight the unprofitability or low profitability of these businesses, despite them “pay[ing] nothing to the state and therefore enjoying an advantage over competitors”. The perception is that they have reduced operations since Prigozhin’s death. Given the considerable cost of the imported Russian equipment, compared with the price of beer in Bangui (under $2 at a pub), making the brewing venture profitable is likely to have been a challenge from the start. It is not clear whether Prigozhin’s death affected the business, which may have been prevented from maturing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Other Costs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the specific costs outlined by each revenue stream, further reporting provides insights into other potential costs that Wagner incurs in the course of its business in the CAR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, French journalists have highlighted Wagner’s large communications and surveillance centre in Cameroon, “through which some of Wagner’s transmissions” pass from the CAR. However, there is limited reporting on the technology at the centre, its costs or any funding that might have been provided by the Russian authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also reports that Wagner and Sewa Security Services have remodelled runways at airports in the CAR, and conducted other repairs at airfields from which it operates extractive and military activities. In addition, it has been reported that Wagner imported geological exploration and drilling equipment to support its two new companies intended to conduct oil exploration: Capex and Petrolex. There is no estimate of these costs, although the equipment could require a relatively high initial investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also reports of smaller, social costs paid by Lobaye Invest, including the funding of a local radio station, as well as humanitarian expenditures, such as building a hospital. Lobaye Invest has also sponsored a beauty pageant and a soccer tournament. Interviewees indicated that these are relatively low-cost finance operations, although the radio station Lengo Songo, which is popular in the CAR, requires ongoing financial support of an unspecified amount. After Prigozhin’s death, funding to the radio station was significantly reduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overall Profitability&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, assuming a revenue range of €91 million (the minimum it is known Bangui was transferring to Wagner) to €200 million per year (the claimed amount inclusive of mining revenue after Prigozhin’s death) and costs of the Wagner contingent of $25–$100 million (salaries plus 30% for the loaned equipment) (see Table 1), this puts the yearly profit range for Wagner’s top management at €0–€100+ million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mali&quot;&gt;Mali&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the three case study countries, Mali’s economy is the least advanced. Wagner’s revenue primarily originates in its contract with the Malian government, for which it reportedly earned about $10 million per month in 2021 for the initial deployment of 1,000 Wagner members. It is not clear whether this is paid to the Russian MoD (which holds the contract) or to Wagner itself. Some reports state that Mali lacks the cash to pay Wagner, and therefore that the group has been paid in gold levied from the mining operators by the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wagner paid recruits $2,500 per month, so an average for fighters should be close to $3,000 per month, with senior staff earning more. If these figures are correct, the wages – totalling around $4 million per month – would eat up a large chunk of Wagner’s Mali contract. In Syria, discussed above, actual costs, excluding equipment and logistics, were significantly higher than basic salaries. Moreover, it seems safe to assume that Russian MoD charges for equipment (including jet strike aircraft, helicopters and drones) and long-range transport were up to 30% of the contract value, as discussed above for Syria and the CAR. Overall, this does not leave much in the way of profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gold Mining&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There appear to have been discussions between Bamako and Wagner over a scheme similar to the one used in Syria. This featured Wagner recapturing artisanal gold mines from the control of hostile groups and developing them. The company M-Invest, which was also active in the CAR, has been said to be seeking gold and mineral mining in central and southern parts of Mali. Another company, Alpha Development, has been named as the Russian successor to these mining prospects. Previous exploiters reportedly saw their mining permissions taken away and granted to Prigozhin’s companies. According to media sources, Wagner deployed geologists in the gold mining areas in the south to assess the potential around October 2021. Wagner was reported to be inspecting mines such as Tin-Aykaren, in an area under Jama’a Nusrat ul-Islam wa al-Muslimin influence, Igouzar near Kidal, Tassik near Takalot, possibly the Alkit site on the Kidal–Gao road and, especially, the N’Tahaka mine. However, it is difficult to confirm this information, and other sources have denied any visits took place. It has been reported that, according to diplomatic sources, Wagner had difficulty gaining access to the country’s gold mines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Malian government has seemed to hesitate to disrupt existing contracts for the exploitation of the largest mines, the additional cost of fighters and/or equipment that may be required could further incentivise the junta to consider granting mining concessions to Wagner. Recently, a mine operated by Canadian-listed Barrick Gold has come under increasing pressure, including the arrest of two employees in late September 2024. It has been speculated that this mine was the primary target of a potential Russian takeover, although, at the time of writing, Barrick Gold and Mali claim to be seeking an agreement to resolve their dispute. Reportedly, the struggling Malian government carried out an audit of its mining sector in 2023, hoping to identify licences that were not being used, or mines that were underexploited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus far, despite these indications of Russian interest in replicating the model it had used in the CAR, there have been no confirmed reports that Wagner or associated companies have been granted any new gold mine concessions in Mali. Similarly, some reports have said that there was a possibility of Wagner involvement in the Russian mining company Marco Mining SARL, which has held a gold mining permit since 2009 – but, again, no further details were identified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, as noted above, government bodies have reportedly pursued other options for raising revenue from existing gold mine operators, including through raising taxes, increasing government stakes in mining companies, and conducting audits to increase the country’s ability to pay for security services. This has led to various reports that international companies are indirectly funding Wagner in Mali through tax payments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late 2023, there were reports that Mali had signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding with Russia to build a gold refinery in Mali. However, some analysts have expressed scepticism about the economic utility of this, given the difficulty of competing with the “makeshift smelters” used by smugglers. Further, Mali already has two refineries, and the business purpose of creating another is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Other Sources of Income&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few other income opportunities available to Wagner were highlighted by interviewees. Wagner forces were confirmed to have visited the artisanal manganese quarry site at Tassiga in the Bourra municipality, Ansongo District, which was closed following the coup in Niger and the Economic Community of West African States sanctions that were placed on Mali. Other than that, rather than commenting on other significant sources of income, interviewees primarily highlighted the widespread looting and pillage that Wagner-led forces undertook. This included taking cows and goats from the local population before selling them on to other local groups for resale. There were similar reports of the theft of jewellery, mobile phones and motorcycles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overall Profitability&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear that operations in Mali were not profitable for Wagner. Delays in payments from the Malian government and the failure to take control of any mining operation may even have resulted in Wagner losing money, although the data is not accurate enough to make this a definitive statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This contrasts with the picture that emerges from Syria and the CAR, where Wagner’s operations produced profits of several millions of dollars (Table 1). Nonetheless, overall, even if the yearly profits accrued to the Russian state and not to Prigozhin (which seems very unlikely), in all likelihood they would not be enough to pay the costs of only one day of Russia’s fighting in Ukraine. This would appear to settle the question raised earlier, of whether Wagner Group’s operations in Africa and Middle East were intended to fund the Russian military effort in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-key-vulnerabilities-of-wagners-business-model&quot;&gt;II. Key Vulnerabilities of Wagner’s Business Model&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key strengths of Wagner’s business model appear to have been its flexible, entrepreneurial nature – and its charismatic leadership. Wagner’s deals involved Prigozhin and a small group of people, who operated with some support and latitude from Russia. This worked well, especially when Wagner’s clients were also personalist regimes – the group was not in the business of national (state) security, but that of preserving ruling elites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following Prigozhin’s death, this strength became a weakness. Clients such as the governments of Mali and the CAR reportedly view Wagner’s pretender successors, such as Redut and Africa Corps, as overly bureaucratic and much more subject to Putin’s close oversight. Wagner’s business model has changed the least where Wagner’s top leadership has remained in place (regardless of any nominal change in allegiance), as in the CAR, with Dmitry Sytyi. Nonetheless, Western governments have struggled to capitalise on any potential weakness in these personalist relationships, in part because they may themselves lack their own personal links with these regimes (and may not wish to develop them).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There remain other vulnerabilities in the Wagner business model. Given how controversial Wagner’s operations have been, it is conceivable that it and any successors would be targeted by efforts to either restrict its revenue or increase its costs of trading, such as additional sanctions. While rebranding operations could help Wagner evade sanctions, there are still costs and risks associated with its business model. Wagner’s sales of natural resources (timber, gold, minerals, diamonds) via international markets to countries supporting sanctions could be disrupted through a more thorough implementation of those sanctions. The possible emergence of coalitions opposing human rights, environmental and other infractions, even among groups and countries not otherwise oppositional to Russia, should not be discounted. Wagner would suffer if the financial and trading channels it uses were closed down. The role of the UAE in funding Wagner’s operations in Libya, for example, has been highlighted in the media, but the UAE also played an important role in Wagner’s gold smuggling and financial transactions, and one UAE firm has already been sanctioned by the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another vulnerability is that Wagner’s tendency to behave erratically raises hostility. In Syria, the growing rancour it aroused within the Assad regime contributed to its expulsion from the country in 2023. Friction with the Syrian security forces over smuggling operations allegedly even led to Wagner assassinating Syrian officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the CAR, rivalries with Chinese mining companies emerged, for example at the Ndassima mine. Chinese nationals were even murdered at a mining site between 2022 and 2023 and there were allegations that Wagner was responsible. Beijing sent a fact-finding mission to Bangui as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wagner’s business and smuggling activities also risk alienating clients who have contracted it to fight or provide security for them. A Syrian official noted that Wagner “abandoned its primary duties of battling and securing everything when they started smuggling”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a risk of clients becoming insolvent. In Mali, the junta sometimes seemed to be struggling to pay Wagner and this created friction, with Wagner sometimes refusing to take part in operations. In Syria, after 2017, when the Assad regime became responsible for paying Wagner’s bills, delays in payment also caused friction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the CAR, the only client where, by 2022, Wagner’s operations really resembled the East India Company model, complaints about its exploitative attitude soon began rising. Tactical defeats, such as the Tinzaouaten battle in Mali in July 2024, the likes of which Wagner experienced on a number of occasions, could also compromise operations and impose unexpected costs. Wider failures – especially likely where the Russian MoD was not willing to rush to the rescue – could completely undermine Wagner’s business model by discrediting the group as a competent organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other, non-financial, risks for Wagner. One of the biggest dangers for the group is the possibility that the Russian state apparatus, never too friendly with Prigozhin’s beast, might seize the opportunity to push through a more conventional model of foreign policymaking. Putin’s Africa Alliance plan seems to embody such a conventional approach. This plan, which has not yet been officially announced, promises more traditional development aid. According to an interview with a former Wagner member:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;They would manage the same projects that Wagner was managing, but they would also have to take care of the local population and pay more to each country’s government, which Wagner was not doing. In addition, they would have to manage public infrastructure in addition to these projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen whether such plans are implementable – at the time of writing, few resources had been committed to the Africa Alliance department and it had a staff of fewer than 20. Opposition within Russia’s intelligence agencies has been reported by a Wagner source. The Africa Alliance budget has hovered around a few million US dollars, funded by the Russian government, wealthy businessmen and other unspecified organisations outside Russia, although there have been “plans” to raise large amounts for projects mainly in infrastructure and mining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, Prigozhin appears to have been right to keep a low profile in the early days of Wagner’s operations. International visibility peaked at the time of Wagner’s involvement in Ukraine in 2023, making Wagner a major target for sanctions by hostile states. It was the rise of Prigozhin’s media profile in Russia itself that ended up causing the most damage. Wagner’s competitive position has significantly worsened in relation to those of a myriad of smaller actors who smuggle across Africa and the Middle East, making the group’s business model much less practicable than in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has set out to assess how financially sustainable the Wagner business model has been in Africa and the Middle East. In this regard, the death of Wagner’s founder, Yevgeny Prigozhin, raised serious questions. Clearly, the Russian government tried to get the Wagner model adopted by others, such as Redut, but it appears that Russia has not found a viable alternative to Wagner’s handling of shadowy but entrepreneurial business operations. This explains why Wagner’s activities in Africa and the Middle East have been curtailed, but not completely dismantled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is increasingly clear that Wagner’s operations should be seen as a whole: its venture capitalist business model meant that failures were expected and were deemed to be acceptable, so long as other operations produced sufficient revenue. For Prigozhin, the “whole” included his Russian businesses, where the favours he received from Putin were likely conditional on Prigozhin returning them, including by serving the geopolitical interests of Russia abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The profitability of Wagner’s operations in Syria, Mali and the CAR was modest overall, but the picture changes when Prigozhin’s Russian businesses are included. On this basis, it appears that Prigozhin’s ventures in Africa and the Middle East did not contribute significantly to Russia’s coffers, and certainly did not lighten the burden of the cost of war in Ukraine. Although calculations in this paper are estimates, they would have needed to be at least one order of magnitude higher to achieve an appreciable impact in Ukraine. In fact, it is likely that they were never intended to. What they were meant to do was to sustain Russia’s foreign policy initiatives in Africa and the Middle East, with any profit likely taken by Prigozhin himself. On the whole, this objective appears to have been achieved, even if an exact calculation is not possible. It is not clear, for example, what financial losses Wagner might have incurred in Syria when it was forced out and its oil and gas companies were seized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the perspective of venture capitalists such as Prigozhin, however, the appeal of Wagner’s colonial-style business model would appear to be limited. As a result, the likelihood of it being replicated and expanded appears low, not only because of Prigozhin’s rare “talent”, but also because Wagner tends to be its own worst enemy, especially in the increasingly nationalist African and Middle Eastern environment. Its only real success, in terms of asserting an East India Company-style model, has been in the CAR, where it managed to entrench itself in a way not replicated anywhere else. Indeed, Syria apart, Prigozhin sank significant resources only into the beer plant in Bangui and the Ndassima mine in the CAR. The beer plant seems to have been a failure. In Mali, Wagner has yet to enter the mining sector. In a sense, Wagner might go down in history as a product of a phase of oligarchic politics in Russia, where relying on wealthy cronies seemed a more viable solution than trusting Russia’s rusty state apparatus, even in foreign policymaking. Without Putin’s favours to Prigozhin’s pre-Wagner businesses, the creation of Wagner itself might not have made much sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CAR was the exception rather than the rule, and replicating it seems a remote possibility. Burkina Faso, for example, stayed well clear of importing Wagner’s business model, helped by the fact that the regime was not in such a desperate state as the CAR’s. Even in the CAR, moreover, profits were in the range of some tens of millions of dollars per year – no gamechanger for Russia, and not even a strong profit margin for such high-risk business. The question that arises is why, short of a direct request by the Russian government (within the framework of returning Putin’s favours), would Prigozhin and his son, Pavel – who seems to be continuing his father’s legacy – want to engage in other similarly risky adventures for such relatively small margins? This question appears even more germane for any potential imitators of the Wagner model. Claims made by a former Wagner source that Gennady Timchenko, Redut’s master in Syria, and then Arkady Rotenberg, were offered Wagner’s Syrian businesses and struggled to make them work would seem to confirm this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Prigozhin intended to reinvest his profits in new mercenary campaigns elsewhere – there are reports that Pavel Prigozhin intends to use accumulated capital to launch operations independent of the Russian MoD. However, so far none of these has materialised, possibly due to limited viability without Russian MoD support, given the need for heavy equipment, logistics and back-up resources. The slow rapprochement between Wagner and the Russian MoD during 2024 could also be undermining these independent plans. Perhaps such ventures simply make little economic sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of the type of business that could deliver high profit margins is the Captagon amphetamine trade in which Wagner engaged in Syria, as this would need little additional investment. Wagner’s smuggling operations on behalf of Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces are another example of a profitable business: again, little additional investment and few human resources are needed. All that would be required for a similar operation would be a network of force deployments around a given region for logistical support and greater security. Large deployments of fighters and equipment are rarely profitable on their own, although a possible exception is when large deployments are carried out for wealthy patrons such as the UAE (as, allegedly, in Libya).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least for a time, Prigozhin showed that Wagner could bring Russian big business and state apparatus together. It turned out to be a chimera. The Wagner business model might still develop profitable operations, due to the experience gained through the group’s smuggling operations. It remains to be seen whether Russia will allow Wagner to focus on smuggling activities, which might be profitable in themselves, but are hard to control from Moscow. With the friction caused by Wagner in Syria (and also Mozambique and Libya) still fresh in his mind, Putin might not want to risk such operations undermining Russia’s diplomatic aims.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;黎智英否認指示「攬炒巴」推動外國制裁 亦否認提出「支爆」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/4MYBHlE.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，今（6日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第129日審訊，黎智英第37日作供，控方繼續盤問黎，談及被指為本案「共謀者」之一的「攬炒巴」劉祖廸。黎供稱最初從新聞得知劉在「連登仔」之中有影響力，是一名精神領袖，惟他不知劉的背景、是否本土派等。控方指，黎供稱在2020年1月在台北陽明山與劉見面，目的是叫劉組成勇武派的領導團隊，然而黎在事後未有跟進相關進度。控方又指，當時黎其實知道「攬炒巴」與勇武派並無關係，反而知悉劉參與國際游說。控方指出，黎在陽明山會議上指示陳梓華和劉祖廸，去請求外國針對中國和香港實施制裁和敵對行動。黎否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎供稱冀劉祖廸運用其影響力-說服勇武派組成領導團隊&quot;&gt;黎供稱冀劉祖廸運用其影響力 說服勇武派組成領導團隊&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行提及，黎在主問時供稱，聯絡「攬炒巴」劉祖廸的目的，是叫他善用理大被圍封事件的時機，去成立一個勇武派的領導團隊，以約束勇武派的暴力行動。黎亦供稱上述是2020年1月台北陽明山會議中的主要討論話題，其他話題則不重要。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 副刑事檢控專員 周天行&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今問，會議上有什麼其他話題。黎稱劉祖廸提及「支爆」，而黎亦有當場作出評論，指中國使用大量金錢來管控人民，增加了國家財政開支，但他的記憶已經非常模糊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就著黎要求陳梓華聯絡劉祖廸，控方指黎的說法是想劉成立領導團隊；可是黎在法官杜麗冰的提問下，稱不會期望劉領導勇武派，只是想劉運用其影響力去說服或平息勇武派。控方質疑黎前後說法不一致。黎則否認說法有變，堅稱兩個種說法沒有分別。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問黎的最終說法是什麼。黎稱基於劉有如此的影響力，他應該嘗試說服勇武派去組成領導團隊。他又指，劉不可能返回香港，因此他不可能在不身處香港的情況下，親自組成領導團隊，而劉運用其影響力，是他身處英國時唯一可以做的事情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰追問，所以黎的意思是，第二種說法才是較為準確？黎起初稱不是較為準確，但是在追問下，黎表示：「OK，OK⋯⋯我們不要花時間在這裡吧。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱得知劉是連登仔-法官李素蘭問及連登是什麼&quot;&gt;黎稱得知劉是「連登仔」 法官李素蘭問及「連登」是什麼&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到從何得知「攬炒巴」劉祖廸這個人，黎稱從新聞得知劉在「連登仔」之中有影響力，在連登討論區中是一名精神領袖。法官李素蘭問及「連登」是什麼，是一個媒體還是一個平台？控方指是一個平台。李素蘭問：「是不是需要加入才能使用？」法官李運騰則補充，按其理解「連登」是一個網上平台，人們可以發表意見。黎同意李官說法，指「連登」是一個社交媒體，好像 Instagram 般。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官又問，是否所有「連登仔」都是勇武派？因黎的說法似乎把所有「連登仔」都說成是勇武派。黎認同：「對，所有『連登仔』都是勇武。」李素蘭問：「所以『仔』是勇武？」不過在進一步澄清下，黎更正指年輕的勇武派會使用「連登」來溝通，他們是「連登仔」，但不代表所有「連登」使用者都是勇武派。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱不知道劉祖廸背景在連登上說了什麼及是否本土派&quot;&gt;黎稱不知道劉祖廸背景、在「連登」上說了什麼及是否本土派&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎有否追看「連登」？黎稱沒有，又稱從來都沒有上「連登」。控方問黎從何得知劉祖廸？黎稱從《蘋果》的報導、記者及泛民的口中，因很多人都談論劉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎是否知道劉的背景？黎稱不知道，只知道他非常有影響力。控方追問黎如何得知劉有影響力？黎指因為陳梓華及很多人均形容劉很有影響力。控方問黎是否知道劉在「連登」上說了什麼、過去做了什麼事情。黎稱不知道，但只知道人們都和應劉的說話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑，黎僅僅基於「攬炒巴」這個標籤，而認為劉很有影響力。控方又質疑，黎不會有興趣知道劉做過什麼嗎？黎稱不會。控方問黎有否閱讀過他撰寫的文章；黎稱沒有。控方指，黎僅因為劉的大名而覺得他具影響力。黎則重申，因為聽聞很多人說過他有影響力。法官李運騰則指，黎已說過劉很有名，不認為控方需要繼續深究。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官另外問到，所以黎也不知道劉的政治立場？黎表示不知道劉的政治立場，也不知道他是否本土派。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方黎知道攬炒巴參與國際游說-與勇武派並無關係&quot;&gt;控方：黎知道「攬炒巴」參與國際游說 與勇武派並無關係&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年6月15日《蘋果》「隔牆有耳」欄目，題為〈中共威脅全球民主自由 攬炒巴加入國際聯軍反抗〉，以及2020年10月24日的《蘋果》報導〈遊行被圍捕險洩身份 攬炒巴死裏逃生 帶署歷警暴 拒保後返英〉。當中提及劉加入「對中政策跨國議會聯盟（IPAC）」、「透過眾籌所得的資金，攬炒團隊在多國報章刊登文宣，向全球揭露港府鎮壓異見者的狀況」、「第一件湧上心頭的就是以保皇黨議員涉違《國際人權法》為由，撰寫信件向外國政府陳情，取消各人的外國公民資格」、「攬炒巴主力國際戰線，低調進行游說，早前更與歐洲議會議員進行溝通及閉門會議。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示2020年10月24日黎的 Twitter 帖文，當中標註「攬炒巴」劉祖廸的帳戶：「I salute to @finnlau_cd. At only 26, he has the wisdom knowing exactly when and what the right role to play. He inspired his peers in his former role, and he’ll do it this time. The outside world support is very important. #StandwithHongKong」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，從上述文章及黎的帖文可見，所有有關劉的內容均是關於國際游說，而不是組成領導團隊。黎則引述報導：「『我要攬炒』，一個自連登討論區冒起、間接影響反送中運動走勢的名字」，指「連登仔」就是勇武派。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方則指，黎在2019至2020年期間叫陳梓華聯絡「攬炒巴」，然而黎知道「攬炒巴」與勇武派並無關係。黎不同意，反稱：「他與勇武派完全有關」，又指報導已經清楚說了劉「間接影響反送中運動走勢」。控方續指，當黎在2020年1月11日在台北陽明山與劉見面時，黎乃知悉劉參與國際游說。黎不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎曾供稱不知外國議員組團來港觀察區選-控方展示訊息羅傑斯事前告知&quot;&gt;黎曾供稱不知外國議員組團來港觀察區選 控方展示訊息羅傑斯事前告知&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在主問時供稱不知道外國議員組團來港觀察區議會選舉。控方遂展示黎與「香港監察」創辦人羅傑斯（Benedict Rogers）之間的訊息。羅傑斯在2019年11月16日向黎說，外國議員正計劃來港觀察區選﹐包括英國上議院議員奧爾頓勳爵（Lord David Alton），有的議員關注保安問題，問黎有何意見。黎回覆：「這裡沒有保安問題，情況沒有這麼壞，不用擔心！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;羅傑斯又向黎傳送新聞稿，當中提及一群香港義工組織了一個獨立選舉監察小組，成員包括奧爾頓勳爵（Lord David Alton）、立陶宛議員 Mantas Adomėnas 和 加拿大議員 David Kilgour。區選觀察小組由「Fight for Freedom, Stand with Hong Kong」和「香港故事」合辦。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，由此可見黎獲告知外國議員打算來港觀察區選，並非如黎早前所供稱從不知情。黎起初回應稱，當時回覆羅傑斯的時候，只集中在「奧爾頓勳爵」和「保安問題」上，其後表示不記得觀選團一事。法官杜麗冰追問黎是否同意自己的證供不準確？黎最終同意是不準確。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎傳送裴倫德文章予陳梓華並指劉祖廸也應閱讀-惟否認想二人參與國際游說&quot;&gt;黎傳送裴倫德文章予陳梓華並指劉祖廸也應閱讀 惟否認想二人參與國際游說&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎智英在2020年1月8日，即在台北陽明山別墅會面之前，向陳梓華傳送一篇裴倫德（Luke de Pulford）刊登於《蘋果日報》網站的文章〈Advice from a friend〉。陳回覆稱他看過文章，認為可以幫助到他說服那些「頑固的領袖」；黎亦指文章值得閱讀，而劉祖廸也應該看。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，裴倫德的文章提及國際游說，指「無領袖運動」會使香港人在國際游說的時候衍生代表性的問題。文章另指，暴力抗爭會使外國政客遠離香港人，損害運動得到國際支持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指出，黎傳送這文章給陳梓華及劉祖廸，是想二人參與國際游說。黎否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑事後黎未有跟進劉祖廸有否組成勇武派領導團隊&quot;&gt;控方質疑事後黎未有跟進劉祖廸有否組成勇武派領導團隊&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就陽明山別墅會議，黎主問時供稱目的是叫劉祖廸組成勇武派的領導團隊，並稱劉在會上表現似乎願意接受黎的提議。控方今問，黎有在事後跟進相關進度嗎？黎說沒有。控方又問黎有否叫陳梓華和 Mark Simon 去跟進？黎亦稱沒有，因他放手讓劉等人去做。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，若果黎沒有跟進的話，怎樣知道劉有否組成領導團隊？黎則稱，他不會做到好像要跟進對方有否按照其提議去做，又指對方是成熟的成年人，不需要去跟進。控方質疑，連一個跟進的訊息也沒有？黎指沒有，因他尊重對方。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認曾提議認識枱底人用來做國際游說推動反華政策&quot;&gt;黎否認曾提議認識「枱底人」用來做國際游說、推動反華政策&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提及2020年1月5日，即會議之前六日，Mark Simon 在訊息中提到：「好消息是，陳梓華成功使國際登報的群組與朱牧民同步，使華盛頓少一道競爭的聲音（這並非一件易事）。」控方問會上有否討論相關事項？黎稱沒有，陳梓華和其他人也沒有提及。控方問，黎不會有興趣知道當時國際游說的情況嗎？黎則稱不感興趣，又稱不知道那些與朱牧民同步的群組是誰。控方向黎提議，黎沒有在會上詢問，是因為陳梓華已經在2019年12月告訴過他關於訪美的事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華早前供稱，他在會上向黎介紹「rip」就是李宇軒，而李曾赴美國會見議員，黎智英其後稱「唔應該係咁」，因為老泛民已經可以介紹到這些議員，「唔需要去嘥呢啲資源，重要嘅係佢哋應該識多啲枱底人，而唔係一直喺度識啲枱面人，例如 Rick Scott、Ted Cruz、Tod Young，呢啲係老泛民本身就已經有 connection。」黎在庭上否認說過上述說話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華又指，黎提到要認識一些「枱底人」例如政治顧問或制訂政策的人，因這些關係很有用，可以用來做國際游說，推動反華政策。黎亦否認說過，因「枱底人」並非他會使用的字眼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎堅稱支爆話題由劉祖廸先提出-控方質疑黎對支爆概念並不陌生&quot;&gt;黎堅稱「支爆」話題由劉祖廸先提出 控方質疑黎對「支爆」概念並不陌生&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華指，「黎智英話長遠嚟講，應該爭取國際認同，然後由佢哋去做 embargo（禁運）、制裁，去向政府施壓，然後我哋要團結唔同嘅板塊，再加埋民間嘅力量，先可以達到『支爆』。」黎在庭上否認說過上述說話，只是泛指一般的施壓。控方問黎是否同意施壓也可以包括實施制裁和禁運？黎同意，但堅稱他沒有提及制裁和禁運。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎又稱，「支爆」的話題是劉祖廸首先提出。控方問黎，他對「支爆」的概念其實並不陌生，問他是否同意。黎不同意。控方接著問「中國經濟內爆」的概念呢？黎則同意熟悉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方遂出示黎於2019年9月30日，刊登於《華爾街日報》的文章〈There’s Hope for Freedom, Even in China〉，當中提到「如果中國經濟內爆（If China’s economy implodes）」字眼。控方又指，黎與以色列前副總理 Natan Sharansky 進行網上對談的時候，曾提及中國政府調配更多資源在監控人民上，會導致中國破產，並會導致中國經濟內爆。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ADrz973.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，有沒有可能「支爆」的話題是由黎提出的？黎則堅稱劉先講「支爆」，然後他不知道什麼是「支爆」，經劉解釋後，黎才知道「支爆」是指中國經濟內爆。黎又堅稱不是說中國政府花大量金錢監控人民會導致「支爆」，只是在說假設的情況。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認指示陳梓華和劉祖廸請求外國實施制裁和敵對行動&quot;&gt;黎否認指示陳梓華和劉祖廸請求外國實施制裁和敵對行動&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎曾向劉提及國際游說的四個步驟，首先令外界知道香港發生什麼事，然後呼籲他們去譴責和關注事件，「香港人先會知道，外國政府冇離棄，同埋冇忽視佢哋，同埋可以保持士氣。」控方又指黎認為需要接觸外國「枱底人」，以影響他們的對華政策。黎則否認說過相關言論，指乃陳梓華編造出來。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方向黎指出，至少在會議當日，黎指示陳梓華和劉祖廸，去請求外國針對中國和香港實施制裁和敵對行動。黎表示：「不同意，是他（陳）編造出來。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問黎指示發動一人一信救香港-兩星期後卻指國安法雷聲大雨點小&quot;&gt;官問：黎指示發動「一人一信救香港」 兩星期後卻指國安法「雷聲大雨點小」？&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年6月16日，黎與陳梓華在壹傳媒大樓見面，陳早前供稱黎當時說過《國安法》「雷聲大雨點小」。黎則稱這是他的一廂情願，因當時覺得中國不會摧毀香港。但他否認為了安慰陳而說出這番說話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎說會繼續利用《蘋果》作為平台去呼籲制裁？黎則稱：「說出這話是瘋狂的」，因他經常告誡同事、家人和朋友小心行事，「我怎可能呼籲制裁呢？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問到，黎何時開始謹慎？黎稱在6月的時候仍然感到鬆懈，因為他希望《國安法》「雷聲大雨點小」，但是閱讀《國安法》條文之後，便變得「強烈地謹慎（intensively cautious）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰提到，黎在5月底的時候指示發動「一人一信救香港」，為何在大約兩星期之後，卻向陳說《國安法》「雷聲大雨點小」？黎則稱，面對《國安法》不能夠什麼也不做，但是同時間仍然感到樂觀和抱著希望。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;初選結束後-黎訊息形容是奇蹟-twitter轉發新聞&quot;&gt;初選結束後 黎訊息形容是「奇蹟」 Twitter轉發新聞&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，昨日控方問及黎是否關注初選，並展示多項訊息，顯示黎在2019年12月至2020年7月之間，持續跟「徙弟」李兆富、李永達、李卓人和陳梓華等人討論初選。控方今指，初選於2020年7月11至12日舉行，7月12日晚上，陳梓華向黎傳送訊息：「感謝你為初選做的所有事。這在香港歷史上非凡。」黎回覆：「這是奇蹟！」控方問黎是否仍然關注初選？黎表示：「你可以這樣說，但是我只是出於禮貌回覆他。」控方另展示黎在7月12至13日發布的三則 Twitter 帖文，顯示黎在初選結束之後，轉發相關新聞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;黎智英被追問下承認關注民主派初選 曾叫李兆富物色電子投票軟件 訊息稱戴耀廷「進程有點慢」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/qftuVGG.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，今（5日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第128日審訊，黎智英第36日作供，控方繼續盤問黎，圍繞黎與同案被告陳梓華之間的關係。陳曾供稱黎曾談及初選，惟黎在早前主問時否認曾向陳談及初選，又稱對於初選並不關注。控方則展示訊息紀錄，顯示早於2019年12月，黎叫「徙弟」李兆富替民主派初選尋找合適的電子投票軟件，並叫李永達聯絡李兆富請教安裝及管理電子投票事宜。黎其後向李提議舉辦公開演講或辯論（barnstorming），引起市民對初選的興趣，又稱可以安排《蘋果》直播。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就2020年1月的台北陽明山會議，黎否認談及初選及電子投票系統報價，因當時戴耀廷和區諾軒等人接手了籌辦初選的工作，而他們否決了電子投票的主意，黎亦稱不再關注初選。至3月，黎指戴耀廷籌辦初選「進程有點慢」，籲李永達跟進了解。在控方和法官的追問下，黎最終承認對初選感興趣及關注，但堅稱沒有牽涉其中。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱黎談及初選-黎否認並稱不關注&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱黎談及初選 黎否認並稱不關注&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行繼續盤問黎。同案被告陳梓華（Wayland Chan）曾供稱，他在2019年11月27日第三次與黎見面時，黎稱「會支持本土派，如果啲素人參加初選，先會有認受性。」同年12月31日第四次與黎見面時，陳稱黎說過舉辦初選「可以集中到嗰啲黃絲嘅票源」，亦認為初選能夠吸納到參與過反修例運動的年輕人票源，提高投票率。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/t1eyAX8.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 副刑事檢控專員 周天行&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;然而黎在主問時供稱，他不認為自己曾向陳談及初選，對於初選並不關注，也不記得疫情之前是否有人開始談論初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訊息紀錄顯示黎於2019年12月中與李永達談及初選-指李兆富是初選軟件的始作俑者&quot;&gt;訊息紀錄顯示黎於2019年12月中與李永達談及初選 指李兆富是「初選軟件的始作俑者」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方遂展示2019年12月15日的訊息，顯示黎向李永達說：「達哥，Simon Lee（李兆富）是我多年的舊同事，他是初選軟件的始作俑者。有問題可以直接請他到場示範，教有關人士使用。謝謝。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「初選軟件的始作俑者」的意思，黎稱李兆富提出網上投票形式的主意，而非由他研發投票軟件。因李兆富聽聞初選，而他對於民主派事務熱心，所以便提議網上投票的方法是最好。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱泛民一直關注選舉𠝹票問題-非基於前美領事意見而討論初選&quot;&gt;黎稱泛民一直關注選舉「𠝹票」問題 非基於前美領事意見而討論初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰提及昨日證據，2019年11月25日，前美國駐港澳總領事郭明瀚（James Cunningham）發送訊息，指區選目標應該是從建制中取得政治力量，又指未來目標應該是立法會選舉和進入特首選舉的程序（CE process）。李官續指，然後三個星期之後，黎與李永達便談論起初選？黎則稱，李永達開始思考初選的以什麼模式進行是最好，所以他才告訴李永達，李兆富可以協助。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官接著問到，誰是原先提出初選主意的人？黎稱不知道，他相信自己在李永達提及初選的更早之前已聽聞過，「但那次不是認真的討論，只是隨意地提及初選」，因為泛民一直關注選舉「𠝹票」問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，是否因為郭明瀚提及立法會選舉和特首程序，泛民才開始討論初選？黎則稱不是，泛民舉辦初選的主意並不是基於郭明瀚說的任何話，因「𠝹票」問題一直在泛民的腦海中，直至戴耀廷提出初選主意。黎又指，立法會選舉是非常重要，「我們不需要郭明瀚去提醒我們。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訊息顯示黎更早之前著李兆富尋找電子投票軟件&quot;&gt;訊息顯示黎更早之前著李兆富尋找電子投票軟件&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問李兆富提出主意之前有否與黎討論？黎稱沒有，直至李兆富提出網上投票的主意之後才知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示更早之前的訊息，2019年12月12日，黎問李兆富：「請回電我，我需要你的幫助去尋找電子投票軟件。」李兆富其後回覆黎。黎說：「我的會議定於明晚的晚飯，希望我能有投票軟件的資料準備好。」李兆富回覆：「我找到數個（軟件）但是還未測試他們。我的準則是：以雲端為基礎，及必定能夠防止一名選民投票多過一次。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;訊息顯示在12月15日之前，黎與李兆富已經有討論過初選。控方質疑黎未有道出真相，直至他向黎展示相關訊息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/FHX0Sva.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訊息顯示黎與李兆富討論初選電子投票系統-並替李永達牽線&quot;&gt;訊息顯示黎與李兆富討論初選電子投票系統 並替李永達牽線&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示訊息，2019年12月13日，李兆富向黎表示，經過測試數個投票系統之後，他選擇Scytl，指它有經驗及在世界各地都有政黨使用它來舉行初選。黎其後問，選民能否使用自己的手機來投票，而不用出示身份證號碼？能否傳送投票平台連結給選民，讓他們自行進入平台投票？黎並提及《蘋果日報》可以傳送投票連結給370萬讀者，亦提議經《明報》和《立場新聞》傳送。黎指若然可以在手機上投票的話，可以每部手機只限投票一次，而不需要提供身份證號碼，冀李兆富考慮其提議。李兆富表示明白，稱沒有打算用身份證號碼，一手機一票已足夠。黎回覆：「Ok. Wonderful. Thanks a lot.」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方繼續展示同日訊息，黎確認在晚上的會議之後，傳送訊息給李兆富：「他們（泛民）覺得它非常有用，你知道每一次投票的價錢是多少嗎？」、「如果泛民使用應用程式上有問題，他們可以直接聯絡你嗎？另外，你可以查一查價錢嗎？」、「李永達會請教你有關使用方法。謝謝。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問及晚上的會議有誰人出席。黎稱有何俊仁、李卓人、林卓廷和李永達等。控方問戴耀廷和區諾軒有否出席？黎指沒有。曾審理初選案的法官李運騰此時打斷控方：「周先生，雖然我不會運用我在過去審訊的個人知識，但是區諾軒的會議是在2020年1月。」控方遂沒有繼續提問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年12月17日，黎向李兆富傳送訊息：「李永達有聯絡你嗎？他們可能需要你替他們安裝及管理電子投票程序。」、「任何增加了你工作量的費用，請找我支付。」李兆富則稱李永達尚未聯絡他。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到相關「費用」是什麼，黎稱是測試電子投票系統的費用，而非整個初選的經費，「我看不到自己會支付整個初選。」李官問黎會否接受驟眼看他的訊息，會理解他可能支付電子投票系統的安裝及管理費用？黎同意看起來是。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎同意非常留意初選-但堅稱陳梓華提起的時候未有為意&quot;&gt;黎同意非常留意初選 但堅稱陳梓華提起的時候未有為意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎看起來有點熱衷於設立初選的電子投票系統。黎則稱，這是他一貫做法，若果他嘗試幫助他人，他會確保自己能幫上忙；又指因為他承諾過李永達等人協助電子投票，所以他盡力確保其幫忙是有效，否認是「熱衷」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎在主問時供稱他未有意識到初選，惟根據上述訊息，黎是非常留意初選。在追問下，黎同意。控方接著指，黎在庭上未有道出真相。黎否認，稱只是不為意陳梓華的說話，反問：「我為什麼要說謊？真相是當陳梓華提起初選的時候，我未有為意。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2019年11月底黎專欄提及泛民初選主意&quot;&gt;2019年11月底黎專欄提及泛民初選主意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華另供稱，在2019年11月27日第三次與黎見面時，黎說過應該結合街頭、議會和國際力量，延續反修例運動的熱情，迫使政府回應訴求。控方展示2019年12月22日的專欄文章〈我們堅持下去才有希望〉，當中黎稱：「我們逆權運動仍須繼續」，指區議會大勝可以令年輕人看到街頭以外另一途徑的抗爭力量，又指香港人保護家園的決心獲得了自由世界的支持，美國政府通過《香港人權民主法案》。控方指，由此可見當黎談及「逆權運動」的時候，是在指街頭、立法會議會和國際線，這三條戰線，而這亦是黎在11月27日與陳梓華見面時，告訴陳的東西。黎稱他有可能這樣說過，但是現在已不記得。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另引述文章最後一段：「李永達說，最有效避免滲透者鎅票惡行的方法，是泛民舉行初選，選出參選的候選人。這是個好主意，而且利用手機電子投票軟件投票，可以確保沒有重複投票之慮，方便又準確。」黎確認引用李永達的觀點。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 初選案被告區諾軒法庭上肖象（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎確認2019年12月底仍然有跟進泛民初選的進度&quot;&gt;黎確認2019年12月底仍然有跟進泛民初選的進度&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年12月30日，李永達向黎稱：「我們已找到袁天佑牧師、鍾劍華、區諾軒成立一討論平台，在2或3號開會，然後用一段時間讓素人參加討論」，他希望可以在3月內進行立法會初選第一次試行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎庭上提到，區諾軒曾要求與他見面，之後便到他的辦公室，不久之後區便前往日本升讀博士。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同日，黎向李永達傳送一則長訊息，當中提議舉辦巡迴演講或辯論（barnstorming），引起市民對初選的興趣，又稱可以安排《蘋果》及其他媒體直播，「這可以成為一連串延續活動，作為逆權運動的一部份。」控方問黎是否把初選視為逆權運動的一部份？黎同意可以如此理解，因立法會的活動可以是運動的一部份。黎並確認，上述訊息顯示他仍然有跟進泛民初選的進度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎同意知悉2020年初美國政府想知道關於初選的事&quot;&gt;黎同意知悉2020年初美國政府想知道關於初選的事&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提到，2019年12月31日黎與陳梓華在車上會面。陳供稱黎說過年輕人應該集中在選舉上，舉辦初選的好處是「可以集中到嗰啲黃絲嘅票源」，並籲陳將黎的訊息告訴其他人。黎表示不記得有說過這番話，但是似乎合符邏輯。至於11月27日的見面，黎則稱不記得有向陳談及初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著展示2020年1月5日的訊息，在黎、李柱銘和 Mark Simon 的群組中，Mark Simon 指白宮留意到區選，而時任副總統彭斯認為民主派在區選大勝是一個「很大的訊號」，他們認為值得了解更多民主派初選計劃。控方問黎在當時是否已經知道美國政府想知道關於初選的事？黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Simon 同日另一則訊息指，香港民主派初選的主意在華盛頓非常受歡迎，因此可能需要黎或一個資深人物向他們解釋。控方問黎可能是其中一個談論初選的代表？黎同意。控方問黎最終有否在華盛頓談論初選？黎稱不記得自己有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;至2020年1月李兆富仍有向黎交進展-稱系統需應付到國家級駭客&quot;&gt;至2020年1月李兆富仍有向黎交進展 稱系統需應付到「國家級」駭客&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年1月11日的訊息，李兆富向黎表示，與軟件公司來回溝通過，他向對方清楚表明要應付到「國家級」駭客和網絡攻擊，對方則回覆這方面是他們協助客人的首要考慮。李亦表示正在研究如何使人們更難投票多於一次。黎籲李持續與李永達溝通，因他們會對可能發生的意外較謹慎。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，李兆富持續向黎交代電子投票系統的最新發展。黎同意，但稱沒有收到相關報價。然而控方指2019年12月30日，李兆富的訊息提及軟件公司報價為大約8萬美元。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 初選案被告 戴耀廷（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認陽明山會議曾討論初選-又稱戴耀廷接手之後便不再涉及籌辦&quot;&gt;黎否認陽明山會議曾討論初選 又稱戴耀廷接手之後便不再涉及籌辦&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華早前供稱，在2020年1月的台北陽明山會議中，黎曾談及初選及電子投票系統報價。黎則否認，因當時戴耀廷和區諾軒等人接手了籌辦初選的工作，而他們否決了電子投票的主意，因此在台北陽明山會議中，相關系統報價不會是話題之一。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方則指，即使會議上有提及報價，但是初選依然是話題之一，並且黎有討論過。黎則稱，「攬炒巴」劉祖廸可能有提過初選，但只是輕輕帶過。黎亦不同意劉是將會參與初選的「素人」，因劉身處英國，而他不會敢回來香港。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，黎曾告訴陳梓華，會向初選提供經濟資助。黎則否認，因在戴耀廷接手之後，他不再涉及籌辦初選，也沒有人叫他參與。控方問黎有否獲告知初選的籌辦事宜。黎則稱，如果他有聽聞過，那只是與泛民食飯期間，聽到他們隨意地及粗略地談起初選，但不是有意地告訴他。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰問黎有否協助籌辦初選？黎回答：「完全沒有。」控方追問，那麼黎是否提供了《蘋果》作為平台？黎同意《蘋果》作為平台。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱不曾與戴耀廷交談過-曾要求泛民約飯聚跟進初選情況&quot;&gt;黎稱不曾與戴耀廷交談過 曾要求泛民約飯聚跟進初選情況&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年1月28日的訊息，李永達向黎稱，他與戴耀廷、李卓人、李兆富剛會面討論初選，形容「非常有成果」，並希望在兩星期之內弄清楚所有事情。控方指，李永達持續告訴黎有關初選籌備和討論的最新情況。黎同意。
控方問黎：「你有跟戴耀廷討論過嗎？」黎稱他沒有與戴交談過，但過去曾數次親身見面，例如與李柱銘和朱耀明見面期間碰見戴，強調只是偶然遇見戴，而非有意與他見面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年2月3日，黎問李永達：「是否可以找幾位大佬聚一聚，跟進一下初選情況？謝謝。」李回覆：「好。」翌日，李傳送訊息，指李柱銘、何俊仁、李卓人、「高佬」林卓廷、黃浩銘和李永達自己，會在星期六吃午飯。控方問黎，由此可見黎熱衷於知道初選的最新發展？黎同意：「對，我想知道。」被問到飯局上討論了什麼，黎稱只是問他們在做什麼，現在已不記得詳細對話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華向黎傳送眾志alliance出選名單-控方稱非突然提及初選&quot;&gt;陳梓華向黎傳送「眾志Alliance」出選名單 控方稱非「突然」提及初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年2月26日，陳梓華向黎傳送「眾志Alliance」的出選名單，新西派出朱凱廸、新東派出何桂藍、九東派出黃之鋒、梁凱晴做「Plan B」、九西派出張崑陽、港島派出羅冠聰、超區則派出岑敖暉。黎當時回覆陳：「我們要著手處理，如果初選有認受性，他們也必須參與。且看看事態發展如何。（“Thanks. We’ve to work on them. But if the primary has legitimacy, they will have to join. Let’s see.”）」陳回覆：「我會盡力處理它。（“I will try my best to work on it.”）」、「至少不會讓他們拖累。（“At least not to let them ruin it.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎在主問時聲稱陳「突然（out of the blue）」傳送上述名單給他，但是黎一直都獲告知初選發展，亦熱衷於知道，又指黎一直以來都知道初選的詳情。控方向黎指出，陳並非「突然」傳送上述名單給他。黎則稱，他說「突然」的意思，是因為對於陳獲得有關資訊而感到意外，但他同意初選是他與陳之間其中一個討論話題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎在追問下改稱關注初選-但不牽涉其中&quot;&gt;黎在追問下改稱關注初選 但不牽涉其中&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又質疑黎聲稱「不關注初選」的說法，因從早上到現在，庭上展示的訊息均可以見到，黎一直掌握初選的事態發展，又質疑若然黎不關注，為何會相約泛民飯聚以討論初選？法官李運騰亦指，Mark Simon 的訊息指可能需要黎或資深泛民在華盛頓解釋香港初選，問黎怎會不關注初選？黎則回應，當時已有人接手籌辦，而且已開始了籌備初選的過程，所以他不再關注初選。黎稱，如果有人向他問起初選，他便會解釋，但重申當時籌備過程已開展，故他不再關注初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官指：「當我們使用『關注（concerned）』一字的時候，並不是說你是初選組織者。」法官李素蘭接著指，「關注」即代表「你感興趣（you were interested）」。黎遂回答：「對，我是感興趣。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑黎更改證供，並不是道出真相。黎則強調，就他個人而言並非牽涉在初選之中，但是他關注相關議題。（Concerned 在英語可理解為「關注」或「有關」）黎指：「如果你基於一個字來指稱我說謊，那你有自由如此做。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李素蘭最後指，當黎向陳梓華談及初選的時候，乃有意識地談論。黎同意，不論相關話題是由自己或陳提起，他都會關注。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，同日黎將陳的「眾志 Alliance」名單轉發給何俊仁、李卓人和李永達。控方問黎，當時是否仍然關注初選？黎回答他感興趣，但是他並不牽涉初選之中。（“I was interested but I was not concerned about it.”）控方追問，《蘋果》給予他們一個平台，「你是否牽涉其中？（Were you concerned about it?）」黎稱：「我沒有牽涉其中，我與它完全無關。（“I was not concerned about it. I have nothing to do with it.”）」控方問黎有否叫《蘋果》促進初選？黎否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎指戴耀廷辦初選進程有點慢-籲李永達跟進了解&quot;&gt;黎指戴耀廷辦初選「進程有點慢」 籲李永達跟進了解&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年3月3日，黎向李永達傳送訊息：「達哥，Simon 跟我今天開會令我覺得初選 Benny 那邊進程有點慢，你們是否要跟進了解一下。謝謝。」控方指，直至2020年3月，黎仍然緊貼初選的發展，並非常關注。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，李兆富當時仍然參與其中？黎則稱，如果李仍然有參與，也很快便不會參與，因戴耀廷不打算使用電子投票。李官問，黎肯定戴在3月時放棄電子投票嗎？黎堅稱：「我肯定戴耀廷改變主意，他不喜歡（電子投票）。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/fuQJBDw.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指黎在國安法之後仍關注初選&quot;&gt;控方指黎在國安法之後仍關注初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年3月4日的訊息，李永達向黎說：「我們在星期六會與戴耀廷和區諾軒開會，我們會籲他們加快初選計劃。」控方指，李稱會「籲他們加快初選計劃」，是因為黎叫李如此做。黎稱：「好吧，我同意。」控方追問，在3月4日的時候，黎是否仍關注初選？黎稱不記得。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎知道初選將於2020年7月舉行。黎回應：「我當然關注，因為我們提供了平台給他們。」控方續指，即使在《國安法》實施之後，黎是否仍關注初選的發展？黎則稱：「我認為那時候，我的所有關注都在國安法上。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此時法官李運騰打斷，指本案並非關於初選的審訊，如果控方問及《國安法》實施之後的初選事宜，便衍生一個問題，是否需要向黎給予警告。辯方大律師關文渭指，「初選」本質上並非違法。李官問：「所以你們沒有感到不安？」關文渭則指，理解當黎談及「初選」時，是泛指一般的初選。李官遂說：「那好吧。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年7月1日的訊息，黎向李卓人討論初選的電子投票系統，並問黎在《國安法》生效之後，有否繼續關注初選？黎則稱不只是他自己，其他泛民都很關注。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as these companies grow more powerful, the systems that are meant to enforce accountability seem ill-equipped to do so. Where Big Tech companies cherry-pick the privileges of state-like power, without submitting to the associated responsibilities, they risk fraying the public’s trust. To preserve and strengthen the post-World War II international order, which is already facing profound challenges, there should be a clear-eyed reckoning with Big Tech’s agency as influential international actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critiques of Big Tech are abundant. Accusations range from anti-competitive practices, neglect of social harms, democratic encroachment, and the warping of humanity itself. And these concerns are not without merit: Unchecked corporate power threatens societal cohesion and traditional governance structures. Yet, relentless condemnation of lawful and highly successful enterprises risks paralysis. When every flaw is fatal, we risk letting perfect become the enemy of good enough. The challenge lies in finding a middle ground—acknowledging Big Tech’s power can be a force for social benefit, while creating sensible mechanisms to ensure their accountability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rise of Big Tech reflects a seismic shift in international relations. Power has leaked out of the corridors of government. It’s now exercised in data centers, server rooms, and undersea cables. Recognizing this, the U.K. Secretary of State for Science, Innovation, and Technology argued in November of last year that countries should approach Big Tech with “humility,” and treat them like nation-states. More recently, some of the most exclusive seats at President Donald Trump’s inauguration were taken by powerful Big Tech executives—filling the space typically reserved for elected officials. Their presence and prominence reflects how the international order is changing. It is not only multipolar but multistakeholder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question, then, should not just be whether to accept Big Tech’s influence, but also how to channel it responsibly. We propose three possible pathways. First, grant Big Tech formal membership in international organizations. Second, enhance and expand existing treaties and national legislation with an increased focus on enforcement. Lastly, encourage companies to adopt transparent reporting on their global activities. The solution is uncertain, but a common goal is in reach: make Big Tech accountable for its power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;establishing-and-exerting-influence&quot;&gt;Establishing and Exerting influence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term “Big Tech” echoes legacy descriptors like “Big Oil,” “Big Banks,” and “Big Pharma,” highlighting the scale and dominance of multinational corporations that shape influential industries. However, unlike its predecessors, Big Tech wields a unique, quasi-sovereign power over cyberspace—a recognized domain of war and the backbone of our economic and social interactions. Their control extends beyond monopolizing products—it grants them the ability to shape the rules, norms, and processes governing our digital lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big Tech’s quasi-statecraft can be understood through three distinct functions: diplomacy, state-like involvement in armed conflicts and crises, and ownership and operation of domains through which state interactions are mediated (e.g., cyberspace).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take diplomacy: During the first Trump administration, Microsoft led calls for a Digital Geneva Convention to establish international rules protecting civilians from state-led cyber threats. While the initiative stalled amid diplomatic wrangling, it revealed how Big Tech companies were beginning to rethink their role in the world. By 2020, Microsoft went further, establishing a U.N. representation office in New York. Two years later, the United Nations responded in kind by creating the Secretary General’s Envoy on Technology. These moves underscore how Big Tech is embedding itself in international institutions. State actors are taking notice. Denmark was the first country to appoint a dedicated tech ambassador, a trend now mirrored by several states seeking to engage Big Tech on equal footing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding armed conflict, Big Tech companies have played a pivotal role in the ongoing war in Ukraine. Starlink has ensured mostly uninterrupted connectivity for Ukrainian forces. The Ukrainian government migrated critical data and government services to the cloud to protect against Russian attacks, and private companies have gathered intelligence, hardened targets, and responded to incidents. This level of involvement in the war goes beyond the traditional role of suppliers or contractors. It resembles a form of deputization, whereby private companies are given authority to perform state-like activities under specific circumstances. At most, these activities reflect how companies are seizing an opportunity to elevate their agency and status through unilateral or multilateral actions that materially change conditions in active conflict zones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underpinning the functions of diplomacy and state-like involvement in armed conflicts is a third function: ownership and operation of cyberspace and associated capabilities. Cyberspace—the fifth sphere of power projection—is distinct when compared to the other four, which are owned and/or shared by states through treaties and principles of sovereignty. Cyberspace is simultaneously a physical infrastructure as well as an information ecosystem. The two are inextricably linked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the corridors and meeting rooms of the United Nations—where states are the operators—in cyberspace, the private sector owns the pitch, largely sets the rules of the game, and has the best players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, Big Tech occupies a privileged position in one of the most consequential arenas: cyberspace. Big Tech’s influence, however, also exposes a fundamental tension. While these companies have become de facto actors in the international system, they are free from many of the accountability systems that constrain state actors. This is not a lawless, zero-sum “Wild West,” however. Big Tech is beholden to shareholder expectations, national regulations, and international standards. Yet these mechanisms, based on a concern for consumers and principals, are no substitute for broader responsibility to citizens and global society. The issue is not necessarily Big Tech’s influence, but the inability of existing international frameworks to adapt to its emergence as a dominant actor in cyberspace and a near-peer in world affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dont-hate-the-player-change-the-game&quot;&gt;Don’t Hate The Player, Change the Game&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adapting to Big Tech’s growing global role is not just about blaming companies for taking initiative. It is also about reforming structures and processes to introduce accountability. To date, similar attempts in multilateral forums to integrate the private sector have had limited success. As the international system reckons with the rise of Big Tech actors, three intuitive pathways appear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Big Tech companies could be granted formal membership of key international organizations—recognizing the multistakeholder status quo. This could range from observer status at the United Nations to increased participation rights in specialized governance forums like the International Telecommunications Union. For example, Big Tech companies could get a vote in setting international standards or in selecting leadership, and participate in world radiocommunication conferences. Inclusion would bring companies into existing frameworks, creating opportunities to enforce accountability among peers through existing mechanisms. Doubtlessly controversial, this approach could normalize and better define the remit of their contribution to a rules-based system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, countries and international organizations could enhance international treaties and national legislation to better control private sector influence. Multilateral agreements, akin to those governing arms control or nuclear proliferation—each of which already have some private sector oversight—could set controls on Big Tech’s operations in critical areas such as global digital infrastructure. Simultaneously, national governments can update legislation and regulatory frameworks to close loopholes and bolster enforcement against company excesses. The European Union is broadly taking this approach under the auspices of the Digital Markets Act and the Cyber Resilience Act, though these aims are not always made explicit. Alas, these initiatives have also been criticized as a veiled attempt to pursue industrial policy along geopolitical fault lines and makeup for European regulation stifling the growth of the technology sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, companies can adopt greater corporate transparency. Tech companies could apply standards like environmental, social, and governance statements that are tailored to their international activities. These “international engagement, compliance, and governance” reports would represent a bespoke opportunity for firms to outline their global posture. Such reports could self-assess a company’s activities in the preceding year and narrate their plans—including future strategy, partnerships, and upcoming participation in international processes. These disclosures would produce additional sources of qualitative and quantitative data—similar to governments setting out strategies or policy papers. In turn, this data could empower civil society, companies’ employees and shareholders, as well as governments to hold these companies accountable for their actions on the world stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of these proposals will settle the total balance of the accountability deficit, and in all likelihood, the status quo will persist. Even those countries that acknowledge that action should be taken to redress the power and accountability imbalance ultimately have limited bandwidth—amid a “studs up” trade war between the United States and China—to dedicate resources to reconciling corporate accountability. Countries and trading blocs may also use an accountability agenda as cover to promote national or regional interests and champions to undermine those of rival powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, historical precedents—such as efforts to engage Big Tech in the United Nations and Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe counter-terrorism forums—suggest that expectations should be managed. International institutions can be notoriously slow to adapt, while Big Tech moves fast—and often breaks things. We hope this reflection offers a starting point to consider accountability for Big Tech’s exercise of international influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On balance, it is neither feasible nor desirable to show Big Tech a “red card.” The transformative impact of technology on power dynamics within international society is undeniable and will only intensify. The challenge lies in ensuring that Big Tech’s immense influence is aligned with the rules of the game. It should be accountable—not just to shareholders or national regulators but to the wider public. Through our ongoing research with King’s College London and the University of Bath, we aim to drive the conversation forward, shedding light on the critical intersections of technology, governance, and statecraft.&lt;/p&gt;

Currently, dependence on foreign adversaries for uranium poses a significant risk to U.S. nuclear supply chains, impacting both energy and defense.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uranium is a crucial mineral for energy and national security—it fuels the nuclear energy that underpins today’s economy and is key to propelling future growth to meet the surge in energy demand from artificial intelligence. However, supply chain vulnerabilities and dependencies on foreign adversaries challenge U.S. leadership in the sector and create national and energy security risks. Russia and China are rapidly expanding their offtake of mined uranium from international partners, uranium enrichment capabilities, and nuclear infrastructure. To strengthen uranium and nuclear fuel supply chains, the United States must work with allies, implement conducive trade and tariff policies, and invest in both domestic enrichment capacity and uranium ore production abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uranium is one of the most consequential elements of the modern era. It led to the proliferation of nuclear weapons in the twentieth century and underpins the renaissance of nuclear energy in the twenty-first century. It is the feedstock for nuclear power, which is the largest source of carbon-free energy in the United States, accounting for 19 percent of total U.S. energy production in 2023. The United States currently produces more nuclear energy than any other country and has the most operating nuclear reactors in the world. But the U.S. lead may not be permanent. For several years, U.S. nuclear electricity generation was declining or stagnant as plants retired without a sufficient number of new reactors to replace them. Consequently, China is set to surpass the United States’ nuclear generator capacity by 2030, with 150 new nuclear reactors set to come online between 2020 and 2035.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uranium supply is perhaps the biggest threat to U.S. nuclear leadership—but this wasn’t always the case. From 1953 until the 1980s, the United States was the world’s leading producer of uranium, owing partially to government subsidies. During this period, the United States produced between 20 and 45 million pounds of uranium concentrate annually, even reaching a point where it did not need to import any uranium. In comparison, in 2023, the United States produced roughly 50,000 pounds of uranium domestically and imported upward of 30 million pounds annually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ZnMlaSC.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Sources of Uranium for U.S. Nuclear Power Plants, 1950–2022&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government has deprioritized uranium security over the last seven years. The 2018 United States Geological Survey (USGS) Critical Minerals list, which forms the basis for government incentives like the Inflation Reduction Act, identified uranium as critical. When it released the list in 2018, the USGS noted,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Federal interagency feedback to Interior on the initial draft list highlighted one mineral, uranium, with both fuel and non-fuel uses, and for which Energy Information Administration data indicated high production concentration and significant import reliance . . . uranium, while primarily known as a fuel mineral, also has important non-fuel uses, and otherwise meets the criteria for inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, uranium was the only mineral removed from the Biden administration’s 2022 USGS Critical Minerals list on grounds that it was a “fuel mineral.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a clear disconnect in policy efforts to secure front-end fuel cycle capacity—including uranium mining—and efforts directed at nuclear power development. Over the past several years, bipartisan support for nuclear power has been increasing. In 2023, the United States joined 21 countries pledging to triple global nuclear capacity by 2050 at the United Nations Climate Summit in Dubai. Under the White House nuclear deployment roadmap, the United States alone plans to add 200 gigawatts (GW) of domestic nuclear power by 2050. Republican support for boosting nuclear energy is even, on average, much stronger than Democrat support, signaling a more bullish outlook for the industry over the next four years; the Make America Great Again 2024 platform from the Republican National Convention promises that “Republicans will unleash Energy Production from all sources, including nuclear, to immediately slash Inflation and power American homes, cars, and factories with reliable, abundant, and affordable Energy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fundamentally requires creating a resilient, secure, and larger-than-ever uranium supply chain. At present, uranium supply is heavily concentrated in the hands of Russia and China—together, these adversaries hold over 50 percent of the world’s uranium enrichment capacity—creating untenable risks to U.S. energy and national security. Despite this, the United States has not added uranium back to the U.S. Geological Survey’s list of critical minerals, although one of President Trump’s first executive orders on “Unleashing American Energy” called immediately for the secretary of the interior to consider its return. Addressing these risks and building secure uranium supply chains must be on the list of priorities for the incoming administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the contentiousness surrounding uranium is its dual use in weapons and energy. This has generated nearly a century of tension. In 1939, Albert Einstein wrote a letter to President Franklin Roosevelt in which he noted that recent research both led him “to expect that the element uranium may be turned into a new and important source of energy in the immediate future,” and that it was also “possible to set up a nuclear chain reaction in a large mass of uranium . . . [that could] . . . lead to the construction of bombs.” He added that “A single bomb of this type, carried by boat and exploded in a port, might very well destroy the whole port together with some of the surrounding territory.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the United States holds the second-largest nuclear weapons arsenal in the world, following Russia, and is scheduled to spend $756 billion on nuclear weapons modernization programs between fiscal years 2023 and 2032. The United States has been building its nuclear force from land, air, and sea to deter adversaries and assure allies. This key tenet of national security depends on access to fissile uranium materials. At the same time, the United States is engaged in disarmament and arms control agreements and talks with Russia and China, whose nuclear arsenals rival that of the United States. This dichotomy presents a unique set of challenges for policymakers and the uranium industry—how do you expand uranium production, enrichment capacity, and access for the United States and its close allies while adequately containing the industry to avoid the proliferation of nuclear weapons by adversaries?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, to remain ahead of foreign adversaries in nuclear energy production and defense capabilities, the United States must work internally and with allies to develop a secure uranium supply chain that does not depend on imports or infrastructure from adversaries. Given that it is a reliable source of baseload power, nuclear power will be vital for meeting the growing demand for energy that is being driven by artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-uranium-supply-chain&quot;&gt;The Uranium Supply Chain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The uranium-to-nuclear fuel supply chain is lengthy, complex, and riddled with supply chain vulnerabilities each step of the way, from mine to reactor. Uranium is mined primarily in Kazakhstan (43 percent), Canada (15 percent), Namibia (11 percent), Australia (9 percent), Uzbekistan (7 percent), and Russia (5 percent). The United States mined a mere 75 metric tons of uranium in 2022— a negligible amount equivalent to just 0.02 percent of the world’s production. The ore is then milled into triuranium oxide (U3O8), commonly known as yellow cake. Global yellow cake production is similarly dominated by Kazakhstan (39 percent), Canada (20 percent), Namibia (12 percent), Australia (9 percent), Uzbekistan (7 percent), and Russia (5 percent). Yellow cake uranium undergoes the enrichment process to increase the concentration of the uranium-235 isotope (U-235), the only fissile uranium isotope found in nature, from just 0.7 percent of total uranium to upward of 5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The uranium enrichment process is where foreign adversaries tighten their control on nuclear supply chains. Four companies dominate this stage in the fuel cycle: Russia’s State Nuclear Energy Corporation (Rosatom), the China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC), Orano in France, and British-German-Dutch consortium Urenco Group. At present, Rosatom holds 38.5 percent of the world’s uranium enrichment capacity, and China’s CNNC holds 24.2 percent. Together, they control 62.7 percent of the world’s commercial uranium enrichment capacity. The United States has only one commercially operating enrichment plant, with limited capacity, which is owned by Urenco. The vast majority of the United States’ uranium must be imported, with nearly 30 percent coming from Russia in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. reliance on Russian uranium can be traced back to the Megatons to Megawatts Program—a government-industry partnership initiated between the United States and Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union. For 20 years, the program took bomb-grade uranium from decommissioned Russian nuclear weapons and converted it into low-enriched uranium suitable for U.S. commercial nuclear reactors. At the time, the program successfully enhanced world security by decreasing stockpiles of nuclear weapon materials while generating clean power. Although the program came to an end in 2013, the U.S. nuclear industry still relies on Russia for much of its enriched uranium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Complicating matters further, the next generation of advanced reactors will require fuel enriched to higher U-235 concentrations (between 5 and 19.5 percent), known as high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU). The U.S. Department of Energy projects that more than 50 metric tons of HALEU will be needed per year by the end of the decade for the 20 different U.S. companies currently developing advanced reactors. The United States has yet to reach commercial-level production of HALEU. Russia and China are the only countries confirmed to have the infrastructure to produce HALEU at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinas-strategic-offtake-of-uranium-from-developing-markets&quot;&gt;China’s Strategic Offtake of Uranium from Developing Markets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia is not the only foreign adversary of concern in the uranium supply chain. China is swiftly taking strategic action to secure uranium for its ambitious nuclear agenda. It has made strategic investments in uranium-rich countries around the world to secure feedstock for its domestic nuclear programs—both civil and defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Namibia has the world’s third-largest uranium reserves, with 11 percent of the world’s supply, and is responsible for 12 percent of global yellow cake production. The China National Uranium Corporation (CNUC), China General Nuclear Power Group, and China Africa Development Fund hold significant ownership stakes in all three of Namibia’s operating uranium mines. An additional risk is posed by the government of Iran, which holds a minority stake (15 percent) in the Rössing operation through a 1976 transaction. However, CNUC and the government of Namibia adhere to all international sanctions on Iran. As a result of this China-Namibia partnership in the uranium mining sector, 77 percent of Namibia’s uranium exports goes to China. There is currently no notable U.S. investment in Namibia’s uranium sector, despite the two countries sharing positive economic relations and Namibia being a key beneficiary of the African Growth and Opportunity Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has also engaged in bilateral cooperation with Kazakhstan to extract uranium and produce nuclear fuel. Kazakhstan is the largest uranium producer in the world, accounting for 43 percent of world production. The central Asian country also holds some of the highest value deposits in the world for low-cost extraction. China has been purchasing natural uranium from Kazakhstan since the early 2000s, and it has signed purchase contracts across an array of suppliers. With a longstanding working relationship with Kazatomprom, Kazakhstan’s national nuclear company, China offtakes nearly 30 percent of Kazakhstan’s uranium exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, China is making strategic investments in nations that have yet to develop their significant uranium resources. For example, Brazil holds 5 percent of the world’s uranium reserves yet produces only a negligible amount of uranium. Nuclear Industries of Brazil is eager for industry collaborators, calling for bids from foreign partners interested in uranium exploration in the country. China answered the call. In November 2024, China Nonferrous Trade (CNT) purchased Brazil’s largest uranium mine for just $340 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-comparison-of-uranium-policies-under-trump-and-biden&quot;&gt;A Comparison of Uranium Policies Under Trump and Biden&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nuclear energy industry largely enjoyed support from both the Trump and Biden administrations as an imperative for energy security. During his first administration, President Trump signed two bills to facilitate building and receiving permits for advanced nuclear reactors, increased funding for the industry in annual budgets, and established the U.S. Nuclear Fuel Working Group. President Biden also passed funding for nuclear projects in both the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The two administrations, however, targeted different ends of the nuclear supply chain: The Trump administration was generally more focused on the upstream mining of uranium, while the Biden administration focused more resources on the front and back ends of the nuclear fuel and reactor industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under President Trump’s first administration, he set up the Nuclear Fuel Working Group to address the “significant challenges in producing uranium domestically” as “an issue of national security.” As a result of the group’s findings, President Trump requested $1.5 billion from Congress in his 2021 budget request to revitalize the uranium industry and create a national uranium stockpile, saying that propping up U.S. uranium production in the face of cheaper imports was a matter of vital energy security. The $1.5 billion would have provided significant subsidization to domestic upstream uranium mining companies. The move was not without opposition; critics argued that the measure was a thinly veiled government bailout of the uranium industry, consisting of primarily just two companies and their investors. The budget request was ultimately interrupted just weeks later by the Covid-19 crisis and Trump’s unsuccessful bid for reelection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Biden addressed the nuclear energy industry within both the IIJA and the IRA. However, uranium is not classified as a USGS critical mineral, meaning it will not qualify for the suite of IRA incentives aimed at the critical mineral industry. Rather, the nuclear industry was addressed in separate provisions in the IRA and IIJA. Together, these provisions mobilized billions of dollars in funding through the Department of Energy (DOE) for the development of domestic HALEU for advanced nuclear reactors, nuclear technology demonstrations, loan guarantees for large projects, and tax credits to reduce the costs of technology commercialization. Notably, the IRA and IIJA focused on the downstream nuclear sector rather than upstream uranium mining. While lithium, nickel, and cobalt mining projects are eligible for some incentives under the IRA and IIJA, no incentives currently exist for raw uranium production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Biden also signed into law the Accelerating Deployment of Versatile, Advanced Nuclear for Clean Energy (ADVANCE) Act in July 2024. The bipartisan bill aims to promote a domestic nuclear energy renaissance by streamlining and reducing costs for licensing and permitting for reactors as well as expanding opportunities for foreign direct investment. The bill focuses entirely on the downstream nuclear energy industry and does not address uranium supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only in its final months did the Biden administration turn its attention to uranium supply chain concerns. In August 2024, the Prohibiting Russian Uranium Imports Act went into effect, banning the import of enriched uranium from Russia. The bill is complemented by $2.7 billion in appropriated funds for domestic uranium enrichment, as directed by the Nuclear Fuel Security Act. The DOE is directed to expand the American Assured Fuel Supply Program to ensure the availability of uranium, including HALEU, from domestic sources and allies. It is so far unclear how the DOE plans on achieving the program objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States will need to figure out its strategy for securing enriched uranium quickly to meet its supply needs. Global demand for enriched uranium is expected to rise 28 percent as new reactors come online, and the United States could need an estimated 2000 metric tons of HALEU by 2035—an industry that currently does not exist at commercial scale outside of Russia. The United States is the world’s largest importer of enriched uranium. While nearly 70 percent of its imports come from European countries (France, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom), the remaining 30 percent currently comes from Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-does-the-return-of-the-trump-administration-mean-for-the-nuclear-and-uranium-industries&quot;&gt;What Does the Return of the Trump Administration Mean for the Nuclear and Uranium Industries?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Trump returns to the oval office, the landscape of mining and minerals policy is vastly different than four years ago during his first term. Critical mineral security is at the forefront of geopolitical policy concerns. The Covid-19 pandemic demonstrated just how vulnerable to disruption supply chains are, and policymakers on both sides of the aisle have sworn to remove all reliance on foreign adversaries from these supply chains, both upstream and downstream. At the same time, tensions with both China and Russia are at all-time highs since the Cold War. The political environment is ripe to address the uranium supply chain with policy actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump will need large quantities of uranium to feed his nuclear energy and defense agendas. Reducing electricity costs is a key priority for Trump, who has made promises to slash energy costs in half within 18 months of taking office. With an all-of-the-above energy strategy, Trump stated on day one that he will “approve new drilling, new pipelines, new refineries, new power plants, new reactors.” Reliable supplies of uranium will be necessary to support these new reactors coming online. Additionally, Trump’s nuclear weapons policy, if anything like his first term, is likely to favor building nuclear capabilities for deterrence over arms reduction efforts and diplomatic agreements with foreign adversaries. Greater quantities of highly enriched uranium will be required for a buildup of nuclear weapons stockpiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The domestic uranium mining industry will likely find more support under the Trump administration, and projects may encounter fewer permitting delays and hurdles. Uranium mines in Arizona and Utah have sat dormant for years due to fierce criticism from native tribes and environmentalists. Following the requests of native tribes, President Biden designated a million acres of land in Arizona a national monument, permanently banning mining from the uranium-rich region. President Trump has historically downsized national monuments, and may reverse some, or all, of President Biden’s designation in Arizona as well as open the region back up to mining projects. Additionally, Trump may reintroduce his uranium subsidies from 2019 with the goal of building a domestic uranium industry that can feed strategic stockpiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the Trump administration may deprioritize government support for, and perhaps even defund, the DOE’s Loan Program Office (LPO), which has been vital for financing downstream nuclear industry, particularly for large, expensive nuclear reactor projects. The LPO has served as a lifeline for large nuclear power expansions such as Georgia Power’s Plant Vogtle. Vogtle is now the nation’s largest energy generation site of any kind in the United States, and the first nuclear reactor built in the United States in 35 years. The project was made possible by $12 billion in loan guarantees from the LPO. Still, the project faced major obstacles that resulted in seven years of delays and $17 billion in cost overruns. Consequently, this means higher energy costs for Georgia Power customers. Trump has been highly critical of both the Vogtle project and the LPO. Yet, defunding the LPO would mean that large nuclear projects like Vogtle’s would have substantially less access to large loan guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-accelerate-and-expand-incentives-for-domestic-uranium-enrichment-capabilities-including-for-haleu&quot;&gt;1. Accelerate and expand incentives for domestic uranium enrichment capabilities, including for HALEU.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. nuclear energy and defense industries will need large quantities of enriched uranium, including HALEU, which the U.S. currently does not produce at commercial scale. Over the past four years, the United States has incentivized investments in critical mineral processing and refining for electric vehicles and renewable energy technologies with IRA tax credits. However, since uranium is no longer a USGS critical mineral, it has been excluded from these incentives. Despite enriched uranium’s importance to the next generation of nuclear reactors as well as to nuclear weapons, and despite Russia’s dominance in production, the United States has not taken decisive action to incentivize domestic industry. The DOE’s HALEU program funded under the IRA has so far proved inadequate in stimulating new domestic enrichment capacity. The next administration can incentivize domestic uranium enrichment by making such facilities eligible for the same 45X and 48C production and investment tax credits that currently benefit critical mineral projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-foster-conducive-tariff-policies-with-uranium-producing-allies&quot;&gt;2. Foster conducive tariff policies with uranium-producing allies.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tariffs are a bedrock of President Trump’s economic diplomacy tool kit. At a time when China and Russia already account for 62.6 percent of the world’s enrichment capacity, it is particularly important to foster collaborative policies with uranium-rich allies. Not only is Canada the second-largest producer and exporter of uranium in the world, behind only Kazakhstan, it is the single largest supplier of uranium to the United States, providing about 25 percent of its domestic consumption. Canada does not enrich its own uranium, but it provides critical feedstock for the United States as it builds its own enrichment capabilities. President Trump’s announcement that he would impose a 25 percent tariff on all Canadian imports will have significant consequences for the United States’ uranium supply. The imposition of tariffs on this uranium and/or the volatile tariff policies more generally have the potential to displace Canadian uranium exports to other countries, exacerbating an existing uranium shortage in the United States. Rather than imposing the proposed tariffs, the United States should enact a preferential supplier trade regime in the nuclear sector with key allies. Preferential trade status for nuclear suppliers in countries like Australia, Canada, France, Japan, and the United Kingdom can strengthen uranium security through trade, rather than weaken supply chains with tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-enhance-partnerships-with-key-allies-canada-and-australia-through-a-joint-uranium-supply-chain-partnership-initiative&quot;&gt;3. Enhance partnerships with key allies Canada and Australia through a Joint Uranium Supply Chain Partnership Initiative.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. domestic uranium mining will not be enough—the United States sits on a mere 1 percent of the world’s known uranium resources. Canada and Australia are two of the United States’ closest allies, from both economic and defense standpoints, with significant uranium reserves and production capacity. The next administration should deepen cooperation among these allies to advance the development of uranium supply chains for both civilian and defense purposes. A precedent of trade and defense agreements and partnerships already exists among these three nations; take, for example, the Canada-Australia Partnership on Emerging Missile Defence Research, the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue linking the United States and Australia, and the AUKUS agreement linking the United States and Canada. A multilateral joint partnership for uranium production and nuclear capabilities between these three governments and their private industry counterparts holds the potential to strengthen uranium supply chains for allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4-secure-mineral-offtake-from-uranium-rich-countries-currently-dominated-by-china&quot;&gt;4. Secure mineral offtake from uranium-rich countries currently dominated by China.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the United States must secure mineral offtake from uranium-rich countries by encouraging investments in developing nations with shared interests—a strategy that China has artfully deployed for decades by integrating minerals security into its foreign policy. Namibia, Brazil, and Kazakhstan have significant uranium reserves and significant potential to supply the United States with uranium feedstock for nuclear fuel. The United States can no longer allow China to be the only power fostering bilateral cooperation and stakeholder relations targeting the mining industries of developing nations. Namibia has a long-standing friendly relationship with the United States based on shared democratic principles and trade relations through the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). The United States is Brazil’s second-largest trading partner and has invested more foreign direct investment (FDI) dollars than any other country. Moreover, the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) set up its first office in Latin America in Brazil and is providing financing for projects related to other commodities, including nickel and rare earths. Finally, the United States was the first country to recognize Kazakhstan’s independence, and the two nations routinely cooperate on nonproliferation issues as a cornerstone of their relationship. There is great opportunity for deepening bilateral partnerships in the uranium industry, and the next administration should prioritize fostering industry partnerships, encouraging U.S. investment in exploration abroad, and opening more avenues for engagement between the administration and the governments of these uranium-rich nations.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;黎智英稱只籲陳梓華平息暴力 控方質疑見到勇武派卻未勸說 黎：不能好像傳教士般&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/xGLQbcE.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，今（4日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第127日審訊，黎智英第35日作供，控方繼續盤問黎，圍繞黎與同案被告陳梓華的關係。黎早前供稱，與陳的溝通一直都只涉及平息示威暴力，而否認曾叫陳參與國際游說。控方質疑黎為何會認為和平的人能夠說服勇武的人，又問黎如果勇武的人反過來說服到和平的人使用暴力呢？控方另引述黎的專欄文章〈這是良知之戰〉，其中提到：「有一次我與十多個勇武派年輕人談話，其中有三位二十歲出頭的年輕人私下說，會不惜犧牲生命保護香港。」控方質疑，黎當時有機會遇見勇武派，但是卻未有叫他們平息暴力。黎則稱當時他們來到蘋果大樓，只是與他們短暫地對話，亦不知道他們是勇武派之中較激進的一方，還是較保守的一方。黎又稱不能好像傳教士般向他們說教。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱冀陳平息前線暴力-控方質疑和平的人如何能夠說服勇武的人&quot;&gt;黎稱冀陳平息前線暴力 控方質疑和平的人如何能夠說服勇武的人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行繼續圍繞同案被告陳梓華（Wayland Chan）提問。早前證供提及，黎在李柱銘的介紹下認識陳梓華，黎稱當時李形容陳為「勇武派之中的保守派」。控方指，黎一方面說陳是「勇武」一員，另一方面卻說他不是暴力人士，要求黎澄清。黎則稱，陳是參與「前線」的人，但不是所有前線的人都使用暴力，而陳屬於和平的那批人。黎又引述李柱銘介紹陳時，指陳是「比較保守」、「比較和平嗰啲」。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 副刑事檢控專員 周天行&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎怎樣知道陳是前線示威者的領袖之一？黎則稱，如果陳不是領袖的話，李不會介紹陳給他；加上陳當時處理登報計劃的過渡性貸款，又承諾會還款，如果陳不是領袖的話，他不可能做到這些事情。控方質疑，這可能是黎的假設。黎稱基於上述，當時很自然地把陳理解為領袖之一。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著問黎，為何認為一個像陳梓華般保守、和平的人，能夠平息到示威中的暴力？黎回應，如果陳是一個保守、和平的人，背後理應有原因和本錢去做保守的人，因此認為他有能力去平息暴力。控方指這是黎的假設。黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭問，根據黎的說法，前線示威者分為兩個群組，分別為和平示威者和暴力示威者，問黎認為其中一個群組的人可以怎樣說服另一群組的人？黎回應，不是所有前線的人都是暴力，只是部分人使用暴力。
控方追問，為什麼黎認為和平的人能夠說服勇武的人？黎僅稱：「我們要嘗試所有辦法」，因暴力事件會破壞當時的運動。控方質疑，如果勇武的人反過來說服到和平的人使用暴力呢？黎則重申，和平的人有其理由選擇和平。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問黎為何認為陳梓華有能力說服其他人？黎僅指：「不論他是否有能力也好，這不會阻止到我去嘗試。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎認為勇武派需有領袖而非各自即興行動&quot;&gt;黎認為勇武派需有領袖而非各自即興行動&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2019年11月12日的訊息，黎向陳梓華說：「看到那個男子被淋油及點火，令我感到害怕（dreaded）。年輕及勇武派是時候應該有人領導，你有時間明日或之後日子會面及討論嗎？」翌日，陳梓華出席黎住宅的飯局，出席者還有何俊仁、李永達和林卓廷。這是黎與陳第二次親身見面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎供稱，他當時認為勇武派之間需要有領袖，以約束他們的行動，而不是每個人都各自作出即興行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年11月25日，前美國駐港澳總領事郭明瀚（James Cunningham）向群組發送訊息，該群組成員包括黎、李柱銘和 Mark Simon。郭明瀚稱，如果區選被視為繼續示威暴力的認證的話，他恐怕會造成重大的策略性錯誤，目標應該是從建制中奪取政治力量，又指未來目標應該是立法會選舉。黎同日回覆，指沒有人將區選民主派大勝視為授權暴力，他們視為可以緩和街頭運動的暴力，因現在有兩條途徑去反抗政府，黎認為下一步應該是建立領袖群組，以指揮未來運動方向。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方黎向陳梓華及泛民傳送香港人權與民主法案消息-因他們進行游說工作&quot;&gt;控方：黎向陳梓華及泛民傳送《香港人權與民主法案》消息 因他們進行游說工作&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年11月15日，黎向陳梓華傳送一張香港民主委員會的Twitter截圖，並指時任共和黨參議員盧比奧（Marco Rubio）將《香港人權與民主法案》放上參議院審議，最早可以在當日或下周投票表決，「很難不通過，很棒的消息。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在庭上稱，除了陳梓華之外，他有將相同訊息傳送給其他民主派，因認為他們會有興趣知道。控方則指，黎認為陳會感興趣，是因為陳會進行游說工作。黎否認，堅稱純綷向朋友提供資訊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方則反駁指，李卓人的確有做游說工作，並提及早前證供顯示，2019年4月2日李卓人傳送訊息，提及泛民訪美目的是要求美國修訂法律，以懲罰損害一國兩制、推動《逃犯條例》修訂的香港官員。黎僅回應李卓人多數到歐洲國家游說；又指在他傳送訊息的泛民朋友之中，只有李卓人涉游說，其他人如何俊仁、林卓廷、李永達等，均沒有做游說。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方向黎提議，黎獲告知李卓人將會在10月到訪美國，目的是要提倡懲罰中國官員，而黎對此知情。黎則稱記不起。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;庭上就黎是否知悉香港民主委員會而爭持，黎稱不知道「HKDC」是香港民主委員會。法官李素蘭質疑，黎早前供稱他訪美時知道朱牧民創辦香港民主委員會，現在卻稱不知道該組織？黎則反駁，他當時只是說朱創辦一個支持香港反修訂運動的組織。控方問黎當時有否詢問詳情，黎稱沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑黎有機會遇見勇武派卻未叫他們平息暴力-黎不能好像傳教士般&quot;&gt;控方質疑黎有機會遇見勇武派卻未叫他們平息暴力 黎：不能好像傳教士般&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提到，早前證供指黎與陳梓華於2019年11月27日，在停泊在金鐘的私家車上見面。黎早前亦供稱，他與陳梓華溝通的內容一直以來都是叫陳平息暴力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過控方向黎展示其專欄文章〈這是良知之戰〉，其中提到：「有一次我與十多個勇武派年輕人談話，其中有三位二十歲出頭的年輕人私下說，會不惜犧牲生命保護香港。我問他們年紀輕輕為甚麼有這種想法。他們都說，因為愛香港。我當時聽了哽咽，答不上話來，是否發生不重要，殉道精神已在。」控方問黎見到「勇武派年輕人」時，有否叫他們平息暴力？黎則稱當時他們來到蘋果大樓，只是與他們短暫地對話。控方追問，因此黎的答案是沒有？黎承認沒有，因不知道他們是勇武派之中較激進的一方，還是較保守的一方。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎的文章指他們說「會不惜犧牲生命保護香港」，惟黎卻未有勸告他們不要那麼激進？黎說沒有，又指示威者在前線面對警察的時候，所有事情都有可能發生。控方質疑，黎當時有機會遇見勇武派，但是卻未有叫他們平息暴力。黎重申不知道他們是較激進還是較保守，又稱不能好像傳教士般向他們說教。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰指，黎作為《蘋果日報》的東主，當有一些人到訪辦公大樓，他不會詢問這些人是誰、是否前線、是否在做訪問嗎？黎則稱當時只見了他們很短時間，因此沒有如此詢問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著指，至少《蘋果日報》有勇武派的聯絡方法，既然如此，為何黎不聯絡他們並勸說他們？黎則稱，他不會向記者拿取別人的聯絡方法，這不是他的習慣，因此他沒有如此做。黎重申，他乃經陳梓華勸說勇武派。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑黎透過文章來美化殉道精神鼓吹攬炒概念&quot;&gt;控方質疑黎透過文章來美化「殉道精神」、鼓吹「攬炒」概念&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方引述文章：「黑夜靜寂無人，全副武裝警察排列嚴陣以待，在尋找敵人。未有催淚彈、胡椒噴霧、布袋子彈發射，未有警棍狂揮掠影硝煙四起之前，已等得不耐煩。馬路對面行人路，孤身一人站着的白衫青年問：『阿Sir，係咪跌咗良心？』，即使是兩手空空孤身一人的青年，也不能錯過『敵人』的出現。不由分說一群警察衝過去，為了發洩個痛快，幾個警察把青年推倒壓在地下，打到頭破血流。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎承認不清楚上述事件日子、為何警察排列嚴陣以待及白衫青年的姓氏等，只是從新聞中得知事件。控方質疑黎編造故事，黎否認。控方又指，黎其實支持暴力。黎亦否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎透過文章來美化「殉道精神」。黎否認，指殉道是當對方損害自己的時候犧牲自己。控方則稱，目的是為了損害對方，這是「攬炒」的概念。黎稱這不是殉道，殉道的概念是為了真理不惜犧牲自己。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方最後指出，黎透過文章鼓吹暴力、引起市民對政府的憎恨、激使他人不守法。黎一概否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎提議陳梓華與羅傑斯見面-控方質疑與游說制裁有關&quot;&gt;黎提議陳梓華與羅傑斯見面 控方質疑與游說制裁有關&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2019年12月20日的訊息，陳梓華向黎表示他身處倫敦，雖然只逗留一日半，但是希望盡量善用在當地的時間，問黎有什麼人可以介紹他見面。黎其後推薦陳可以見「香港監察」創辦人羅傑斯（Benedict Rogers）和奧爾頓勳爵（Lord David Alton）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，黎提議陳梓華與羅傑斯及奧爾頓勳爵見面，並非為了平息示威者暴力，是不是？黎不滿道：「為何所有事情都要與平息暴力有關？」、「難道我叫他去廁所也是關於平息暴力？」此時法官杜麗冰打斷黎。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著問黎，為何引薦陳與羅傑斯見面？黎僅指，因為陳梓華要求他幫助，陳問他有什麼人可以會見，所以便施以援手，正如他經常向陳尋求協助。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指黎引薦陳會見羅傑斯，是想他游說外國制裁。黎反指：「這是你的說法」，又批評周天行：「你真不受拘束！你毫無羞恥和公正之心！（You are so free! You are so free of shame and integrity!）」法官杜麗冰再度打斷，並厲聲說：「黎先生，黎先生，黎先生，你能否好心地約束自己，不要作出陳述，只回答問題呢？」杜官表示，她不容許證人在她的法庭上批評控方，黎在證人台上只需要回答問題，不應作出陳述。法官李運騰向黎解釋，控方並不是「把說話塞進你的口中」，只是向黎指出控方的案情，這是他們的責任，黎只需回答同意或不同意，並籲黎控制情緒。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方羅傑斯提倡馬格尼茨基制裁-黎稱不知情&quot;&gt;控方：羅傑斯提倡馬格尼茨基制裁 黎稱不知情&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎當時知道羅傑斯正在提倡馬格尼茨基法案（Magnitsky Act）。黎否認，反稱對此不知情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方遂向黎展示羅傑斯的兩篇文章。第一篇為2019年11月14日發布的〈Now Is the Time for the U.S. to Stand With Hong Kong〉，作者是羅傑斯和「香港監察」總監 Johnny Patterson。內容提及示威者沒有獲得自己政府的幫助，他們正在聚焦《香港人權與民主法案》，它可以透過馬格尼茨基制裁，確保侵犯人權的人士承受相關後果，並向中國發出清晰信息，不能既侵害香港自治和自由，同時又獲取利益。（The protestors have no help from their own government, and so are looking to the world to assist. They focus on the Human Rights and Democracy Act because it contains powerful provisions which would strengthen their hand. It guarantees that pro-democracy protestors who are arrested do not find their applications for visas blocked after a political trial; it ensures that the violators of human rights bear the consequences of their actions through the application of Magnitsky sanctions; and it sends a clear signal to China that it cannot erode the city’s autonomy and freedoms while reaping the benefits, by strengthening State Department scrutiny of Hong Kong’s freedoms.）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，羅傑斯實際上有提倡馬格尼茨基法案，而且把上述文章傳送給黎，因此黎對此知情。黎則稱他收到訊息後，沒有按進去相關連結，並沒有閱讀文章。他又稱很少閱讀羅傑斯傳送給他的文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示另一篇文章為2019年11月15日發布的〈“It’s the people of Hong Kong who are leading the struggle, but they deserve our support”〉，首段提到羅傑斯正在與國會協商及呼籲實施針對中國的馬格尼茨基法案。（Benedict Rogers, a British human rights activist, is continuing his work in the UK, liaising with Parliament and calling for the enactment of Magnitsky law against China.）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎則稱，當時不知道羅傑斯提倡馬格尼茨基法案，直至後來或者在法庭上才知道。控方問黎當時對羅傑斯有什麼認知？黎稱知道羅傑斯是支持香港，曾為香港絕食抗議，又為香港示威和撰寫文章。被問到支持香港什麼，黎稱羅傑斯支持香港、要求英國政府支持示威者的運動，但不知道他推動馬格尼茨基法案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法官問及黎為何形容羅傑斯為熱誠的香港自由鬥士和支持者&quot;&gt;法官問及黎為何形容羅傑斯為「熱誠的香港自由鬥士和支持者」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰問黎，為何向陳介紹羅傑斯的時候，會形容他為「熱誠的香港自由鬥士和支持者（fervent HK freedom fighter and supporter）」，黎想向陳知道什麼？杜官又問，若然黎只想陳梓華平息示威暴力，為何會向陳形容羅傑斯為「熱誠的香港自由鬥士和支持者」？黎表示只是介紹羅傑斯，認為陳可能對羅傑斯感興趣。杜官問黎是否認為，除了平息暴力之外，陳另外也涉足國際游說？黎否認，強調純綷向陳介紹羅傑斯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭問，黎在訊息中提到「雖然他（羅傑斯）獲得充滿可疑的 Irene 支持」，是什麼意思。黎指 Irene 是一名女士，有人曾告訴他 Irene 的背後動機可疑，而她可能向羅傑斯提供金錢。李素蘭追問，那為什麼黎還會將羅傑斯介紹給陳梓華。黎則稱為了公道起見，有需要向陳交代 Irene 的事，雖然羅傑斯獲可疑的人捐款，但是他相信羅傑斯是正直。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭又指，黎剛才指羅傑斯在英國絕食抗議，問黎：「這怎樣幫助到香港？」黎回答，絕食是為了引起英國當地人關注香港狀況。杜麗冰追問，羅傑斯想英國當地人做什麼？黎則稱不知道，叫法官去問羅傑斯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，控方指黎希望陳同時能見到奧爾頓勳爵，並指他正在爭取英國向香港人批出BNO護照，即是替香港游說。黎則稱爭取BNO護照並非屬於「替香港游說」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎同意mark-simon作為中間人與陳梓華溝通&quot;&gt;黎同意Mark Simon作為「中間人」與陳梓華溝通&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年12月30日，陳梓華向黎傳送訊息，表示已回港，形容英國之行「有成果（fruitful）」，因曾與羅傑斯見面。翌日，陳告訴黎：「那個嘉賓樂意會見你。（The guest is happy to meet you.）你在台北什麼時候可以？他直至2020年1月8日都可以。」控方指，不爭議訊息中的「嘉賓」是「攬炒巴」劉祖廸，黎當時正在計劃赴台灣與劉見面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年12月30日，Mark Simon 向黎傳送訊息，指陳梓華已與「攬炒」溝通，他在2至8號期間可以從倫敦前往台北，問黎可以在哪個日子在台灣與他見面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，Mark Simon 與陳梓華溝通，並且作為黎與陳之間的「中間人」。黎同意，惟不同意 Mark Simon 是就劉祖廸的事情溝通。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎自稱是運動的領袖之一-因經營報紙及發表意見&quot;&gt;黎自稱是「運動的領袖之一」 因經營報紙及發表意見&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年1月5日，Mark Simon 向群組傳送訊息，提及白宮留意到香港2019年11月的區議會選舉，時任副總統彭斯認為是一個「很大的訊號」，他們認為值得了解更多關於民主派初選，因很多人認為有當選的政治人物能在華盛頓代表香港行動是很重要，同一時間需要聆聽資深民主派（Senior figures）或意見領袖（Opinion leaders）對於大局的看法和想美國做什麼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎會否視自己為「資深民主派」？黎同意，指自己年紀上是。控方接著問黎會否視自己為「意見領袖」？黎則不認為自己是「意見領袖」，但指自己是「運動的領袖之一」。杜麗冰問及，那麼其他的領袖是誰？黎則舉例指李柱銘、何俊仁、李永達和李卓人。黎其後補充，他之所以成為運動的「領袖」，是因為他經營一份報紙，以及會發表意見；但他稱自己不是運動的組織者之一，也從未出席會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mark-simon向黎匯報陳梓華成功使國際登報群組與朱牧民一致-惟黎否認知悉其參與國際游說&quot;&gt;Mark Simon向黎匯報陳梓華成功使國際登報群組與朱牧民一致 惟黎否認知悉其參與國際游說&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，Mark Simon 在訊息中提到：「好消息是，陳梓華成功使國際登報的群組與朱牧民變得一致，使華盛頓少一道競爭的聲音，這並非一件易事。」控方問及國際登報的群組成員是誰人？黎則稱當時未有去了解，因不太關注。法官李運騰問，這個國際登報群組是否與「攬炒巴」屬同一個群組？黎指不是，因他認為「攬炒巴」的團隊是做行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎同意控方所指，Mark Simon 是在向他匯報。控方指出，黎當時已經知陳梓華某程度上參與國際游說工作。黎否認。控方續指，至少有人告知黎。黎亦否認，稱他只是知道陳令國際登報群組與朱牧民一致。控方追問，黎知道朱牧民當時正在做國際游說？黎同意。控方指，因此黎知悉陳某程度上參與國際游說工作。黎否認，重申他只知道陳將兩組人放在一起，這是他僅有的資訊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指出，黎不單只叫陳梓華平息示威暴力，亦有叫他參與國際線。黎則稱：「這方面沒有證據，我不同意，是你編造出來的。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;控方質疑黎智英以探望孫女作為藉口 向法庭申請離港 實為會見美國官員和議員&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，今（3日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第126日審訊，黎智英第34日作供，控方繼續盤問黎。控方提及，2020年5月黎被控刑事恐嚇罪，並被法庭施加不得離港的保釋條件，惟訊息紀錄顯示黎其後仍計劃前往美國，其私人助手 Mark Simon 並嘗試安排他會見時任美國副總統彭斯及美國議員等人。控方又指，黎於同年6月向高院申請更改保釋條件，期間僅向法庭提及到美國探望女兒和剛出生的孫女，而從未提及計劃會見美國官員和議員。控方質疑，黎以孫女出生作為前往美國的藉口和掩飾，又質疑黎向法庭隱瞞會見美國官員和議員的計劃。黎否認，堅稱探望孫女是申請赴美的主要原因。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mark-simon在群組引述台灣消息人士指拜登對華政策對抑制中國無用處&quot;&gt;Mark Simon在群組引述台灣消息人士指拜登對華政策對抑制中國無用處&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行繼續盤問黎。控方證供早前提到，人大常委會於2020年5月28日通過決定訂立港區國安法。黎的私人助手 Mark Simon 於同年5月29日創立 WhatsApp 群組「DC Dems」，成員包括他、黎智英、前美國駐港澳總領事郭明瀚和前美國國防部副部長 Paul Wolfowitz。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年6月4日，Mark Simon 向群組傳送訊息，引述一名「與蔡英文非常緊密」的台灣朋友評論拜登的對華態度，指美國民主黨打算採取多邊主義來與崛起中的中國交涉，又指如果拜登勝出2020年的美國總統選舉，美國可能會回復奧巴馬的政策，對於抑制中國的進攻將毫無用處。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Simon 另一則訊息指，他將會到華盛頓會見民主黨的眾議員和參議員，「拜登團隊似乎滿足於不涉足香港事務，我們可以持續嘗試。」黎回覆：「對，這也是我的感受。我們要花多些功夫在（美國）政府和共和黨上。」控方問黎訊息中的「功夫（effort）」是指什麼。黎指是游說以尋求對香港的支持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訊息顯示黎要求mark-simon趁未有隔離要求之前盡快安排訪美行程&quot;&gt;訊息顯示黎要求Mark Simon趁未有隔離要求之前盡快安排訪美行程&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年5月30日，黎向 Mark Simon 傳送訊息：「美國現時仍然未有隔離要求，我們要盡快安排午餐和其他行程。」Mark Simon 回覆：「美國沒有隔離要求，但是美國政府和國會有。任何在白宮的會議都需要符合規定，這代表有延遲和測試⋯⋯另外，有幾位國會議員在城內，希望我們可以在6月15日再見到他們。」Mark 其後向黎更新情況：「現時沒有國會成員在城內，但是所有資深職員都在那裡，還有國安委的人士，以及當然國務院。當我們有大概日子，我們便可以見彭斯，因此如果他們有會議的話，我們應該沒有問題。這是我星期三聽到的東西。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎當時正在計劃赴美國會見時任美國副總統彭斯、美國國務院和美國國家安全委員會。黎起初稱不肯定，但是在控方和法官的追問下，黎同意當時 Mark Simon 在美國嘗試安排他與不同人士見面。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The arrest of @JimmyLaiApple in Hong Kong is deeply offensive &amp;amp; an affront to freedom loving people around the world. When I met w/ Jimmy Lai @WhiteHouse, I was inspired by his stand for democracy &amp;amp; the rights &amp;amp; autonomy that were promised to the people of Hong Kong by Beijing. pic.twitter.com/ZwioCrvNb7 — Mike Pence (@Mike_Pence) August 10, 2020&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示訊息，2020年6月8日，黎的秘書將他的計劃訪美行程傳送給黎，黎其後轉發給 Mark Simon。訊息顯示，黎計劃在6月24日乘飛機前往洛杉機，翌日前往紐約，直至7月4日在水牛城尼亞加拉國際機場乘內陸飛機前往華盛頓。黎同意行程，亦同意當時正計劃會見美國的官員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指黎向高院申離港時僅稱探望孫女-從沒提及計劃會見彭斯等人&quot;&gt;控方指黎向高院申離港時僅稱探望孫女 從沒提及計劃會見彭斯等人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過控方提到，黎當時正面對一項刑事恐嚇罪。他在2020年5月5日被法庭施加擔保條件，包括不得離開香港。黎其後於6月12日到高等法院申請更改保釋條件，希望撤銷禁止離港的條件，惟當時遭法官李運騰拒絕。控方指，因此在黎計劃訪美行程的時候，已經知道保釋條件之一是不得離境。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問黎，為何在法庭施加保釋條件數個星期之後，黎仍計劃去美國？黎稱不知道。李官接著問黎，是否因為如此，黎才會向高院申請撤銷離港限制？黎則稱不知道，指是其代表律師處理相關申請。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方繼而提到，在黎向高院申請撤銷限制期間，從沒有提及他的美國行程。黎回應，因為他的女兒在美國誕下新生女兒，他記得當時是想去美國探望孫女。控方則指，根據法庭紀錄，黎只向法庭說離港目的是到美國探望紐約的女兒和孫女，以及商談生意計劃等，惟沒有提及打算到美國會見彭斯等人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方並展示5月30日的訊息，黎向 Mark Simon 說：「我正在等待孫女兒的出生證明，希望數日之內會有。」Mark 問到黎的日子，黎回答說：「我的日子是任何你給我的日子，或者他們給我的日子，儘管我很想見到我的孫女。（“My date is any date you set for me. Or they set for me, though I’m eager to see my granddaughter.”）」法官李運騰問黎，探望孫女是不是離港的主要目的，還是另有其他目的？黎堅稱探望孫女是主要目的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑黎利用孫女出生作為到訪美國的藉口&quot;&gt;控方質疑黎利用孫女出生作為到訪美國的藉口&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示2020年5月22日的訊息，黎向 Mark Simon 說：「我會嘗試。首先我要拿到孫女的出生證明，使我的申請具正當性。我希望我的女兒在未來數天分娩，這樣我就可以定下赴美的日子。（“OK. I’ll try. First I’ve to get my granddaughter’s birth certificate to make my application legitimate. I hope my daughter will give birth in the next few days so I can be sure of the date of my trip to US.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑黎利用女兒誕下孫女作為到訪美國的藉口。黎否認以此作為藉口，「我要去見她，無論如何我都想見她」，又指他與其他人見面，不代表是利用女兒分娩作為藉口。控方追問，但是黎在訊息中說「使我的申請具正當性」？黎則強調當時孫女已經出生了。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又展示2020年5月27日的訊息，黎向 Mark Simon 說：「Jade 昨日誕下了這個既美麗又肥白的女嬰。她的出生證明應該在大約一星期內就有。因此如果我飛去紐約並隔離14日的話，我應該可以在大概6月20日左右吃午餐。我希望可以恢復。在這個危難關頭，這是一個很好的保護。希望亦能見到大老闆。（“Jade gave to this beautiful fat baby girl yesterday. Her birth certificate should be here in a week or so. So if I fly to NY and spend 14 days quarantine I should be able to have lunch at around June 20 or so. I hope is reinstated. It’s a good protection at this time of crisis. Hopefully see the big boss, too.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑，黎訊息中提及「一個很好的保護」，顯示孫女出生是一個很好的掩飾，以讓他到訪美國，並且會見美國的議員。黎否認，指他訊息的意思是在香港的危機關頭對香港的保護。法官杜麗冰則質疑，訊息中「危機」的意思，是指就黎個人而言，他當時被檢控，並且被禁止離港。黎則否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭問黎為何不在高院申請離港的時候，提及計劃會見美國議員？黎反問：「為何我要提及？」，並堅稱他前往美國的主要原因是探望孫女。控方則指出，黎到美國的優先事項是會見美國政府官員。黎不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「大老闆」，黎相信是指彭斯，因他不可能會見到特朗普。控方問，彭斯是黎的「大老闆」嗎？黎否認，反問：「彭斯怎可能是我的大老闆？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認向法庭隱瞞-稱會見美國政府和議員不是一件大事&quot;&gt;黎否認向法庭隱瞞 稱會見美國政府和議員「不是一件大事」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方向黎指出，黎故意地向法庭隱瞞計劃會見美國官員和議員。黎則否認隱瞞，又指會見美國政府官員和議員「不是一件大事」，當時未有勾結外國勢力罪行，一直都有人在會見美國官員，反問：「有什麼大不了的事要隱瞞？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭其後追問，既然黎稱當時未有勾結外國勢力罪，會見官員不會觸犯法律，「那麼為何你覺得告訴法庭不恰當？」黎則稱當時對計劃沒有顧慮（carefree），「我只是不覺得這是一件大事。」法官李運騰追問：「見彭斯不是一件大事？」黎說因為這不是違法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認明知國安法將實施仍尋求赴美游說&quot;&gt;黎否認明知國安法將實施仍尋求赴美游說&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方再次展示6月8日，載有黎的計劃行程的訊息，並指黎當時已經知道人大通過「5.28決定」，香港將會實施《國安法》。惟黎稱，應該是他或 Mark Simon 一時大意，強調就算他能夠前往美國，上述行程都不可能發生。控方質疑，一時大意的說法與黎早前供稱對於《國安法》很謹慎的說法不符。黎則稱，他一時大意不代表行動方面不謹慎。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指出，黎當時明知《國安法》將會實施，但是仍然尋求赴美游說。黎則否認，並強調只是一時疏忽或大意，若然仍尋求會見彭斯是愚蠢的行為。控方又指出，黎蓄意繼續游說，請求外國實施制裁及敵對行為。黎則表示，即使他蓄意繼續游說，但他是一時大意而沒有為意《國安法》即將實施。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示2020年6月13日的訊息，前一天黎向高院申請更改保釋條件遭拒，Mark Simon 向黎稱，美國國安委的職員對於黎未能赴美感失望，但同時關注黎的福祉。控方指美國國安委的人明顯地期望黎到訪美國，黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指黎到訪美國的目的是尋求外國制裁和懲罰中港官員？黎不同意，並指目的是尋求對香港的支持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指國安法生效後-黎未要求mark-simon撤回制裁名單提議&quot;&gt;控方指國安法生效後 黎未要求Mark Simon撤回制裁名單提議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年6月23日的訊息，黎向 Mark Simon 說：「中國官員的制裁名單有汪洋（前全國政協主席）和韓正（時任國務院副總理、現任國家副主席），以及取回他們的貪污金錢，這是假新聞還是經證實的新聞？你可以查核嗎？」Mark Simon 其後回覆：「目前為止是假新聞。汪洋和韓正被列入數個由香港行動者群組呈交的名單上。但是我們在國務院的朋友表示她會查看名單變到有多窄。」Mark 又提到，上星期華盛頓有人討論名單，有人被要求叫國安委考慮中國官員，但是 Mark 提出只將香港官員列入名單。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，從訊息可見，黎當時關注中國官員有否被列入制裁名單。黎則否認關注，強調因為有假新聞，如果沒有假新聞的話，他不會問 Mark Simon 相關事宜。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎想阻止《國安法》實施，所以他想懲罰中國官員。黎則稱他沒有說「懲罰」，只是說要阻止《國安法》，但在控方追問下，黎承認他曾說過「制裁他們」。控方指，若是如此，黎理應關注哪些官員被列入制裁名單。黎否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭問及 Mark Simon 的工作是什麼。黎指 Mark 替他安排會議，又會代表他與其他人談話，包括向外國官員談論哪些官員應被制裁。李素蘭問黎有否就 Mark 可以說什麼說話設下界限？黎稱沒有，而 Mark 所說的話是出於自己意願，但是，「我會接受相關結果。」李素蘭追問，如果相關結果是將中國官員列入制裁名單的話，黎又會否接受？黎回答：「對，我會接受它。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，在2020年7月《國安法》生效之後，黎並未有要求 Mark Simon 撤回他向美國國安委所提議的制裁名單。黎反問：「為什麼我要要求？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在庭上要求控方讓他解釋為何當時未有叫 Mark Simon 撤回提議。惟法官杜麗冰指，如果有需要的話，辯方會在覆問階段就此提問。然而黎欲開口解釋原因，隨即遭杜官打斷，並嚴正表示：「我說了不要，你知道『不要』是什麼意思嗎？」黎則回應，因為控方太快轉換話題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;前美國國防部副部長與國安委討論將中國領導人列為制裁對象&quot;&gt;前美國國防部副部長與國安委討論將中國領導人列為制裁對象&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示2020年6月1日的訊息，Mark Simon 向黎說，前美國國防部副部長 Paul Wolfowiz 正嘗試在兩條戰線協助，其一是向不同報館投稿，另一方面，他正與美國國安委討論將中國領導人列為制裁對象，尤其是想徹查他們的銀行帳戶，研究有否涉及貪污罪行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/4un27qi.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ Paul Wolfowitz&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎，《國安法》實施後，有否叫 Mark Simon 或 Paul Wolfowiz 撤回他們的提議？黎則認為，在《國安法》實施之後，在《國安法》之前所做的事都會變為無效（obsolete），反問為何要做多餘的事情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎承認曾透過文章請求制裁-惟否認國安法生效之後繼續&quot;&gt;黎承認曾透過文章請求制裁 惟否認國安法生效之後繼續&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方總結有關黎的外國聯繫範疇，並指出黎透過 Mark Simon 與外國人聯繫，當中包括美國議員，並請求外國向中國實施制裁和敵對行動。黎否認。他其後稱，有時候會撰寫文章談及凍結貪污官員的戶口，除此之外便沒有提倡敵對行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/DmrWG1d.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
▲ Jack Keane&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指出，黎透過 Mark Simon 與數名外國人保持聯絡，包括前美國將領 Jack Keane、前美國國防部副部長 Paul Wolfowiz、前美國駐港澳總領事郭明瀚、前白宮資深顧問惠頓及蓬佩奧的助手 Mary Kissel。黎則否認與 Mary Kissel 保持聯絡，只是 Mark Simon 通知他有關 Mary 的工作。控方指上述人士均是「枱底人」。黎則不接受說法，反指他們是「枱面人」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/IrXSGx9.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
▲ James Cunningham 郭明瀚&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，在《國安法》生效之前，黎有透過上述外國聯繫，意圖請求外國對中國實施制裁和敵對行動；而《國安法》生效之後，黎繼續請求外國制裁。黎則承認有透過撰寫文章來請求制裁，但是沒有透過上述外國聯繫；他亦否認在《國安法》生效後繼續請求制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱未有詢問fight-for-freedom-group成員是誰行動關於什麼&quot;&gt;黎稱未有詢問「Fight For Freedom Group」成員是誰、行動關於什麼&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方繼而圍繞黎與另一名同案被告陳梓華的關係提問。2019年6月26日，Mark Simon 告訴黎將會向「G20登報計劃」提供500萬元過渡性貸款，而黎沒有爭議。直至同年8月12日，Mark Simon 向黎匯報：「我們上次幫助他們在國際登報廣告的 Fight For Freedom Group，已經全數歸還款項。（“the Fight For Freedom Group, ones we helped with international ads last time, has paid us back in full”）」，又提到該團體正在籌辦另一次登報行動，可能需要向黎借過渡性貸款。Mark 續指，「他們在少於兩小時內，已籌得88.4萬美元。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，當 Mark Simon 提及「Fight For Freedom Group」的時候，黎有否詢問成員是誰、行動是關於什麼？黎表示沒有，即使有問也不記得細節，而 Mark 當時只是說「國際行動（international campaign）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑，黎當時不會有興趣知道行動的內容嗎？黎表示沒有。控方追問，如果廣告含「香港獨立」的內容呢？黎則指，若果他們提倡港獨的話，Mark Simon 會提及，又指 Mark 一直都知道他反對港獨。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/M1k0eY3.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認知悉登報廣告關於制裁-稱一心只想提供過渡貸款&quot;&gt;黎否認知悉登報廣告關於制裁 稱一心只想提供過渡貸款&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年8月17日，黎向 Mark Simon 傳送訊息，問及：「他們眾籌的日子是什麼？他們登廣告的目的是什麼？」Mark 則回答，他們會把籌款用於在世界各地主要媒體刊登廣告，包括美國、日本、南韓、法國和西班牙等國家，相關理念純粹是請求世界支持香港。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎，當時會否視登報行動為「文宣」？黎則稱他並不關注，當時只是一心幫助他們提供過渡性貸款。控方追問黎是否知道登報是關於反《引渡條例》修訂？黎起初稱不知道，又稱對於登報內容不感興趣，但後來在控方和法官李素蘭的追問下，黎改稱知道是有關反修例，因當時社會上沒有其他運動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示刊登於《紐約時報》的廣告，標題為〈CATCH HONG KONG AS WE FALL〉，內文指海外人士可以聯絡當地的議員，成為《香港人權與民主法案》的共同動議人，並促請美國政府向香港警方禁售武器。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示2019年8月20日的《蘋果》報紙，標題為〈港人雞蛋抗子彈 10國見報〉，版面展示不同在國家登報的廣告。黎稱可能見過這篇報導及上述《紐約時報》廣告，但是很大機會未有閱讀內文。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方則指出，黎當時其實知悉登報廣告內容是關於制裁，他亦有參與在登報計劃之中。黎一概否認。但黎同意他知道登報行動與「Fight For Freedom Group」有關連。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱就報紙展覽費用簽支票時-不知道陳梓華是wayland全名&quot;&gt;黎稱就報紙展覽費用簽支票時 不知道陳梓華是Wayland全名&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在控方提問下，黎供稱當 Mark Simon 提及過渡性貸款時，並未有提及陳梓華或李宇軒。後來在2019年9月23日的訊息中，Mark 解釋陳是帶領國際登報計劃的人，黎當時才知道陳與「Fight For Freedom Group」有關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，根據早前證供，黎先後與陳梓華見面合共六次。首次見面是在中環的日本餐廳，當時李柱銘亦有出席飯局。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示支票副本，顯示2019年10月9日，黎簽發一張支票，抬頭為陳梓華，金額為144,100港元。黎則稱一直以 Wayland 聲稱陳，當時並不知道 Wayland 的全名就是陳梓華，只是 Mark Simon 要求他支付報紙展覽的費用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum technology represents a new frontier for innovation, and progress in quantum technologies is essential for U.S. leadership. This report discusses how to accelerate and reinforce U.S. leadership in quantum technologies through increasing research and development (R&amp;amp;D), strengthening the quantum industrial base, accelerating commercialization, increasing workforce development, and building international partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum technologies leverage the physics of quantum mechanics for computing, communications, and sensing. Progress is vital for national security and economic competitiveness. While many quantum technologies are in an early stage of development, they will become essential for maintaining the United States’ technological edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report is the product of more than a year of discussions, workshops, and consultations among members of the CSIS Commission on U.S. Quantum Leadership, a group composed of some of the leading figures in quantum science and industry in America. It presents a comprehensive set of recommendations to ensure U.S. leadership in quantum technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike other emerging technologies, many quantum technologies are too new and too experimental to solely rely on private investment. Private investment in quantum technology between 2019 and 2023 was approximately $8 billion, though this pales in comparison to the booming investment in AI, which has received estimated capital expenditure of over $200 billion based on reporting in 2024. Market forces alone may not ensure U.S. quantum leadership. This will change as quantum technologies mature, but for now federal spending on quantum technology represents an essential investment. Quantum technologies are a strategic outlay since they will reshape the economic and security landscape. Although they may not have the immediate effect of artificial intelligence (AI) or semiconductors, early investment in quantum technologies will pay off later, and as experience shows, it is risky and expensive to fall behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three case studies demonstrate the strategic importance of quantum technologies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quantum Navigation:&lt;/strong&gt; Electronic warfare (EW) is now central to combat. Quantum sensing remedies one of the greatest EW vulnerabilities: The Global Positioning System (GPS) is increasingly susceptible to jamming and spoofing by adversaries like Russia, China, and even Iran. Quantum sensing technologies offer a secure alternative for military and civilian navigation. These systems use quantum measurements of Earth’s gravitational and magnetic fields rather than satellite signals to provide jam-resistant positioning and navigation capabilities. Inertial quantum sensors can provide precise measurement of acceleration and velocity. This is important not only for location but also for precise timing, which is essential for business and finance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quantum as a Service (QaaS):&lt;/strong&gt; Quantum computing will be able to solve problems that conventional computers, no matter how powerful, cannot. Rather than compel individual organizations to build their own expensive quantum computers, QaaS provides cloud-based access to quantum computing resources (where computing resources are accessed remotely through the internet), allowing researchers to experiment and businesses to build the apps and software quantum computing requires. QaaS is the most practical path to near-term commercialization. The QaaS market was valued at approximately $2 billion in 2021, and the right blend of investment and incentives can lead to continued expansion for research and industrial growth.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post-Quantum Cryptography:&lt;/strong&gt; Quantum computers will eventually break current encryption methods, perhaps as early as the end of the decade. Whatever the timeline, the United States does not want a quantum decryption surprise from China, as this would be a major threat to both national security and commercial communication. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has developed quantum-resistant cryptography standards, but transitioning the economy to these new standards will require time and investment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quantum industrial base has six elements: research, workforce, materials, fabrication, software, and testing. The U.S. quantum industry consists of over 150 companies ranging from tech giants to start-ups (with perhaps another 400 companies around the world, including in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Israel, and the United Kingdom) working across computing, software, communications, and sensing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The are parallels between the development of quantum technologies and the development of high-performance computing (HPC) in the last century, where sustained federal investment was crucial before commercial applications had emerged. Like HPC, quantum technology requires sustained government support and market-strengthening measures to reach private sector viability and to strengthen national security in the face of technological and military rivalry with China and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum technologies may seem distant (and some are), but there are real security problems that the United States faces today that require quantum solutions. EW warfare has reshaped battlefields and targets GPS. Quantum sensing provides the best solutions to GPS vulnerability. The United States’ signals intelligence enterprise is at risk from both opponent decryption capabilities that allow them to read out traffic and opponent use of post-quantum encryption to keep the United States from reading their traffic. Making progress in developing and deploying quantum solutions for cryptography is essential, and both of these areas reflect immediate security problems that require quantum solutions and justify further investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To keep and expand the United States’ leadership in quantum technologies, the CSIS Commission on U.S. Quantum Leadership has developed the recommendations provided below. The chief conclusion from the report is that U.S. leadership in quantum technology requires taking advantage of the United States’ unique strengths in technology and innovation. Technological investments have paid dividends to the United States for decades. The United States cannot wait for a “Sputnik moment” (when the Soviet launch of the first satellite energized the United States in science and technology) to catalyze investment in quantum. This is not a competition that the United States can afford to lose. The right policies and investments today can ensure U.S. leadership now and into the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary-of-recommendations&quot;&gt;Summary of Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overarching recommendation of the commission is that Congress should double the funding levels for quantum R&amp;amp;D at the National Science Foundation (NSF), Department of Energy (DOE), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Department of Defense (DOD), and other executive departments and agencies, using a reauthorized National Quantum Initiative (NQI) as the coordinating vehicle (NQI reauthorization bills now call for $2.7 billion). The United States needs to significantly increase current spending to accelerate R&amp;amp;D and guarantee technological advantage over foreign competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;national-security&quot;&gt;National Security&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Establish a comprehensive quantum sensing initiative for strategic applications, with an early focus on positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) should strengthen efforts to speed federal agencies in adopting quantum-resistant encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Office of the National Cyber Director (ONCD) should collaborate with sector-specific regulatory agencies to update cybersecurity regulations and set compliance deadlines, beginning with industries most vulnerable to quantum threats, ensuring tailored solutions based on sector risks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By 2030, the United States should amend acquisition regulations to require quantum-safe encryption for critical systems in both the public and private sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Congress should fund a DOD program to ensure a secure supply chain for critical materials and components crucial to producing quantum technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States and its allies must take a coordinated approach to export controls to prevent leakage of U.S. and allied quantum technology to adversarial states. These protective measures should be clear, appropriately targeted, and compatible with the goal of accelerating progress in the United States and allied nations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Congress should authorize the use of appropriated funds for joint programs with allied nations to strengthen cross-border commercial and research partnerships in quantum.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NIST should develop shared-use quantum testing and metrology facilities, enabling quantum companies and researchers to access essential equipment and advance prototype development. This should be coordinated with the Microelectronics Commons hubs, which aim to provide quantum tech prototyping capabilities. The program should be adequately funded to ensure it meets the needs of the quantum developer community.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Congress should establish a comprehensive quantum sensing initiative focused on sectors like medical devices, semiconductors, autonomous vehicles, and electrical grid management, with efforts from various agencies working to advance quantum technologies for strategic applications and position the United States as a global leader.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) should initiate a “Grand Challenge” program to incentivize the development of utility-scale quantum computers, rewarding progress toward quantum advantage with milestone-based funding.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;research&quot;&gt;Research&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Funding to support R&amp;amp;D for quantum applications should be increased.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DOE, NSF, and Department of Commerce (DOC) should launch programs to make quantum computing resources available to a broader base of researchers, accompanied by increased funding for foundational research in quantum technology.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Congress should authorize the DOE to establish a program office with $500 million in funding to develop an advanced quantum computing facility and to integrate quantum systems with HPC for scientific and industrial applications.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;workforce&quot;&gt;Workforce&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Congress should fund the NSF to:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Support quantum workforce development programs, including for bachelor’s and master’s students, to address growing demand for quantum technicians and engineers to build and maintain quantum systems.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Develop and distribute a comprehensive undergraduate quantum science curriculum, enabling broader access to quantum education and preparing students for roles in quantum technology industries.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Congress should expand existing visa programs to bring foreign quantum talent to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previous technological investments have paid dividends for decades. Quantum offers the same opportunity. Policies that reinforce research, build the quantum industrial base, and promote commercialization are the best ways to ensure U.S. quantum leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;quantum-technology-is-the-next-frontier-for-technology&quot;&gt;Quantum Technology Is the Next Frontier for Technology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology is an arena for competition among countries and companies. The connection between technology and national power is complicated. Many elements must work together for successful outcomes. The connection between scientific research and technological strength is equally complicated, but the reason the United States needs to invest more in quantum technology is simple: Being on the cutting edge of technology makes the United States safer, richer, and stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum technology represents one of the most important frontiers for innovation, and continued progress is critical to maintaining U.S. technological leadership. This report provides a description of quantum technologies and recommends policies to build U.S. global leadership in quantum technology and ensure future leadership in the face of rising competition from adversarial nations. The key steps are increasing funding for research, accelerating the commercialization of quantum technologies, strengthening the quantum industrial base, creating programs to foster a quantum workforce, and creating mechanisms for international partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum is part of a larger story on the importance of research, innovation, and technology to economic growth, national power, and international competition. Investments in research, science, and technology helped make the United States a global power and remain foundational to U.S. global leadership. As the pace of change and innovation increases, the opportunities for growth also increase, and the consequences for countries that fall behind will be more severe.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Disruptions in financial markets&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Supply chain vulnerabilities for critical components&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While quantum’s full potential will take years to materialize, its strategic importance is clear today. The United States should pursue three broad goals for quantum policy: supporting R&amp;amp;D, building a quantum industrial base, and accelerating the commercialization of quantum technologies. First, the government must expand its support for research to accelerate the United States’ lead and to match and outperform foreign competitors. Research alone is not enough. Government intervention and support for the quantum industry is also necessary. The challenge for commercialization lies in linking quantum technology to the existing U.S. innovation ecosystem, with its successful blend of academic research, venture capital, and commercial markets. Entrepreneurial competition is central to the U.S. innovation advantage, and policies that reinforce research, build the quantum industrial base, and allow for commercializing quantum technology are the best ways to ensure U.S. quantum leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;quantum-technologies&quot;&gt;QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Quantum computing uses quantum properties to enable faster processing and solve complex problems beyond the reach of conventional computers. It could revolutionize fields like cryptography, optimization, and AI.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Quantum sensing uses quantum properties like superposition and entanglement to achieve ultra-high precision in measurements, offering breakthroughs in areas like medical imaging, navigation, and gravitational wave detection. Quantum sensors can measure exquisitely small signals with greater stability over long time frames, offering major end-use advantages.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Quantum communications use entanglement and quantum key distribution (QKD) to create highly secure communication channels that could revolutionize cybersecurity and data encryption.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum technologies exploit the properties of quantum mechanics to provide new capabilities in computing, communications, and sensing. These new capabilities provide advantages for economic competitiveness and national security, but some also create new risks. The United States has made good progress in quantum policymaking, but more needs to be done in light of growing competition. While they present different risks, both China and the European Union are investing heavily in quantum R&amp;amp;D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the challenges in these areas are not unique to quantum. Expanding the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce has been an issue for decades, and adding more visas or permanent residencies for STEM talent is a perennial request. Quantum is not the only priority, and others take precedence. The CHIPS and Science Act, for example, authorized support for quantum technology but did not appropriate funds. Instead, CHIPS money went to semiconductor production. This was the right decision, but funding for quantum technology research and work still needs to be expanded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reflects a broader strategic competition driven by critical and emerging technologies, the most important of which are AI and semiconductors. Many challenges facing the quantum sector mirror broader issues in U.S. science and technology policy. There are areas of overlap among the workforce, materials, and, in some instances, fabrication of these different technologies. The key difference is that AI and chips have immediate military and commercial applications, whereas quantum technologies, at this time, do not. This situation will change as quantum technologies mature and applications are created. For now, however, quantum applications remain further away than other emerging technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One question then is why the United States ought to spend more on quantum. Spending on quantum technologies is a strategic investment that keeps the United States at the frontier of critical and emerging technologies. The investment required is small compared to the future payoff. This report’s central recommendation is that spending a few billion dollars more on quantum technology out of the $1.7 trillion in federal discretionary spending (about 0.5 percent) is a wise investment for both national security and the future of U.S. competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;government-quantum-spending&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Government Quantum Spending&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;United States: $1.2 billion, National Quantum Initiative (2018–23)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China (exact figures uncertain due to limited transparency): $10 billion (estimated), National Laboratory for Quantum Information Sciences; $15 billion, quantum R&amp;amp;D&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;European Union: $1.1 billion, Quantum Flagship&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Germany: $2.2 billion&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;France: $2 billion&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Netherlands: $680 million&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;United Kingdom: $3 billion&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Israel: $350 million&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Japan: $206 million&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Australia: $650 million&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;India: $960 million&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Canada: $265 million&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;South Korea: $2.3 billion&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three examples of the use of quantum technology help explain why it is essential for the United States to stay competitive in quantum technology and ahead of its strategic competitors. Races are won by going faster, and while new technologies often come with big promises, there are tangible cases in security and business where quantum will make a crucial difference: cryptography, precision navigation and timing, and hybrid supercomputing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Case Study 1: Reinforcing Vulnerable GPS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the lessons of Russia’s war against Ukraine is that EW dominates the battlefield. Russia, whatever its other shortcomings, has excelled in EW, and it shares or sells its EW expertise to China, Iran, and North Korea. This puts U.S. communications and radars at risk, as well as the U.S. arsenal of precision-guided munitions (PGMs) and other systems that rely on GPS. Work by the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) is actively involved in developing quantum sensing technologies for the DOD. The DIU aims to develop mature quantum sensing technologies, including work on inertial sensing and magnetometers to demonstrate their operational utility. Quantum sensors offer significant improvements in precision and sensitivity, enabling enhanced capabilities for military operations. Quantum sensing technologies can be used for advanced anomaly detection for antisubmarine warfare (ASW) and aircraft and can address critical operational PNT gaps for the DOD for environments where GPS signals are unavailable or unreliable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia and China have developed the ability to jam GPS, which uses relatively weak radio signals from satellites located 12,000 miles away. Both nations have invested heavily for years to find ways to degrade GPS signals, advancing well beyond blunt force jamming, which uses a more powerful signal to drown out GPS. U.S. opponents can spoof GPS signals, create interference, and hack GPS systems. Russia is doing this now in Ukraine, and some U.S. weapons are at a disadvantage. In a war with the United States, China or Russia could even destroy GPS satellites. China and Russia are also not the only hostile countries likely to go after GPS: Iran may have used GPS spoofing to deceive an advanced U.S. drone into landing in its territory, and Syria and North Korea routinely interfere with the GPS systems used on commercial airliners. Aviation officials have expressed concern that this is extending beyond conflict zones, with estimates that up to 1,000 commercial flights a day were affected by GPS spoofing incidents in 2024. These losses can include commercial risks beyond navigation. For example, infrastructure like data centers and the power grid rely on GPS protocols for synchronization and timing that are increasingly vulnerable to even relatively amateur EW technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every year, GPS will become more vulnerable. Quantum sensing technologies offer a replacement. Quantum navigation systems do not rely on a radio signal; instead, they use quantum sensing technologies to better measure variations in Earth’s gravitational or magnetic fields. Highly accurate atomic clocks can improve inertial navigation systems, as can atom interferometers and optomechanical systems, and new algorithms can provide precise and jam-resistant navigation. Instead of using a GPS radio receiver, quantum navigation will use onboard systems small enough to fit in combat aircraft and munitions. There are even quantum technologies that the United States could use now to gain an advantage over its adversaries. But quantum navigation and timing have more than military applications. GPS is essential for finance, banking, mining, commercial transport, and logistics. The DOD is already investing in these systems, and there have been successful initial tests. Quantum sensing technologies will create the resilience needed for a world that depends on GPS. The benefits of secure navigation and timing, like cryptography, justify increased federal investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;quantum-leadership-and-the-united-states&quot;&gt;QUANTUM LEADERSHIP AND THE UNITED STATES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;where-does-the-united-states-stand&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Where Does the United States Stand?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The United States has strong academic institutions, national laboratories, and private companies. It leads in quantum computing and quantum sensing. U.S. researchers have made advances in developing quantum software and algorithms, crucial error correction techniques, and hardware platforms for quantum computers. Quantum sensors are being developed for applications in medicine, materials science, and navigation. To sustain its lead, the United States must continue to prioritize quantum research funding, strengthen collaboration between academia and industry, make production scalable, and invest in a skilled quantum workforce.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum R&amp;amp;D is often cast as a race among competing nations and companies. If there is a race, it is not just in research but in the adoption and use of quantum technologies. The United States, with its vibrant tech innovation system, has an advantage here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum research is conducted in more than a dozen countries, including China, and is an important area for cooperation between the United States and its allies. Some quantum technologies are already transitioning from research to practical applications. The number of companies offering quantum technologies and services is growing, and quantum applications in sensing are already entering commercial use. However, the “race” metaphor fails to capture the importance of collaboration among researchers in different countries. The ability to build partnerships with other countries, both governmental and private, is a key advantage for the United States. The recommendations in this report discuss how to manage risk and extend collaboration in light of this diffusion of research among many countries and how best to fashion international partnerships that serve the interests of the United States and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6oxPdfZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: National Quantum Strategies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quantum industry is global and evolving rapidly, and the number of companies fluctuates with investment and with mergers and acquisitions activity. Publicly available information suggests that over 150 U.S. companies are focused on quantum technologies, ranging from tech giants to start-ups. More than a third of these are in quantum computing, and another third are developing the software and algorithms needed for quantum applications. The remainder work in communications, sensing, and metrology (such as quantum sensors, atomic clocks, and precision measurement equipment) or specialized areas like the production of materials and other technologies needed for quantum devices. There are perhaps another 400 companies outside the United States, principally in Europe, the United Kingdom, Australia, Israel, Canada, and China, mainly focused on developing quantum computing and software or on quantum communications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many technology areas, such as AI, private sector spending outstrips federal investment. This is not yet the case for quantum technology. The U.S. government has made relatively significant investments in support of developing foundational research in quantum technologies. U.S. government support is coordinated under the National Quantum Initiative (NQI), established by the National Quantum Initiative Act of 2018. The NQI aims to ensure U.S. leadership in the field by supporting quantum research with funding and better coordination among federal agencies, including NIST, the NSF, the DOE, and the DOD. The National Quantum Coordination Office (NQCO) in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) has overseen these efforts and promotes public-private partnerships through initiatives like the NIST-funded Quantum Economic Development Consortium (QED-C). These initiatives aim to incentivize innovation and expand the United States’ quantum ecosystem. In December of 2024, the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation introduced the National Quantum Initiative Reauthorization Act (NQIRA), which builds on the National Quantum Initiative Act of 2018 and would authorize $2.7 billion in funding to further advance quantum R&amp;amp;D at federal agencies over the next five years. It would also place further emphasis on developing practical quantum applications. The NQIRA represents a vital step forward in advancing U.S. quantum leadership and ensuring the United States remains at the forefront of this technological revolution. Through reauthorization of the NQI, the United States will be able to reinvigorate federal funding and R&amp;amp;D in quantum technologies and advance toward a future of practical quantum applications.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;innovation-in-the-united-states&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Innovation in the United States&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;U.S. innovation is based on researchers, investors, companies, and entrepreneurs.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;U.S. soft infrastructure—culture, law, capital markets, and firms providing business and legal skills—gives the United States an advantage.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The five industry sectors that spend the most on R&amp;amp;D are aerospace, pharmaceuticals and biotech, computers, scientific instruments, and semiconductors and communications equipment. Quantum technology will affect all of these sectors, which, in combination with universities and start-ups, form the core of U.S. innovation.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;There are 945 research universities in the United States, 219 of which have high levels of research activity. Five of the world’s top ten research universities are in the United States. Federal support provides about 55 percent of the funding for academic research.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;University research is complemented by work at 17 national laboratories operated by the DOE, 42 federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs), and military-affiliated research labs.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;There has been a resurgence of research in quantum technology at major corporations, and there are roughly 50 venture capital firms focused on quantum technologies.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The tech workforce has seen persistent shortages, but the United States has an advantage in that its universities remain the most attractive global destination for graduate education.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NSF and DOE already make substantial investments in quantum infrastructure and research projects—including quantum computers and the specialized chips they use, new kinds of sensors, quantum communication devices, and unique software—since the hardware and software needed for quantum computing is very different from conventional computing software. The 2018 NQI nearly doubled federal spending on quantum research and catalyzed private sector investment. The NSF awarded nearly $20 million to support the construction of a nanoscale fabrication facility for quantum devices. The Commerce Department’s Economic Development Administration has designated two of its new tech hubs to focus on quantum information science (QIS). The Elevate Quantum Tech Hub in Colorado is set to receive approximately $41 million, and Illinois has made sizeable state-level contributions to its quantum ecosystem. These efforts create a robust foundation for quantum technology development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the NQI, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has funded a variety of quantum projects, including on benchmarking quantum algorithms and developing fault-tolerant prototypes. The U.S. intelligence community also spends substantial amounts on quantum technologies (principally in cryptography and communications), though the programs and amounts are not public. Future investments will begin with a strong base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;quantum-technology-materials-and-manufacturing&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Quantum Technology: Materials and Manufacturing&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Increased federal investment is essential in the following areas:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Materials science for developing new materials like superconductors&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Specialized raw materials such as niobium, tantalum, phosphorus, and gallium arsenide; rare earth elements like neodymium and yttrium, which are also critical for quantum technologies&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Material purification and quality control processes to ensure materials meet stringent standards for quantum computing and sensing&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Fabrication technologies for quantum hardware and devices for computing, sensors, and communications, including nanofabrication requiring advanced manufacturing techniques such as molecular beam epitaxy, chemical vapor deposition, or laser ablation in highly controlled “clean” environments&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Manufacturing and supply chains for component materials like lasers, cryostats, and semiconductors for quantum devices&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without these federal investments, progress in quantum R&amp;amp;D in the United States would slow dramatically, though one of the goals for national policy should also be to build a strong commercial sector. Leading tech companies have made substantial investments in quantum technology, and there is a flourishing network of quantum start-ups focused on different approaches to quantum hardware as well as the needed software and algorithm development. The quantum market, like the markets of most start-up technologies, remains highly competitive, and as quantum technologies are still in the early stages of commercialization, the investment risks are substantial. This means that there are areas where federal spending can reduce investment risk and encourage innovation. Overall, federal policy should support private investment and remedy market failure while continuing to commit adequate funding to public research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amount of private sector investment in quantum technology has fluctuated. In 2019, investment was relatively low. There was a significant increase in 2020 fueled by growing commercial interest. Investment peaked in 2021, with several funding rounds for quantum start-ups. In 2022, investment remained high but showed signs of slowing, declining from roughly $2.3 billion to $1.3 billion in 2023 due to various factors, including interest rate changes and a shift in investor attention to AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total private investment in quantum technology from 2019 to 2023 reached approximately $8 billion, though estimates vary. Although $8 billion sounds like a substantial amount, private sector investment in AI reached over $200 billion in 2024 alone. AI has immediate commercial applicability, whereas quantum technologies have longer timelines to full commercial adoption, making increased federal investment important to sustain the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How much is enough? The recommendations in this report identify areas in R&amp;amp;D, manufacturing, and testing where private investment is currently inadequate because of the level of investment required and the potential risk. As with earlier technologies such as semiconductors, HPC, and even aircraft, government spending is necessary to kickstart the industry; in the case of quantum, it is critical to accelerate the pace of development and in building the quantum industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Case Study 2: Quantum as a Service and the Hybrid Computing Environment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computers are tools that make people more productive, and quantum technology will create better tools. Quantum technologies, because of their close association with computing, could follow a similar path, with access to quantum computing services available on every internet-connected device. Cloud computing—the new face of computing, with computing resources that are accessed remotely—has led to computing as a service, including software as a service, infrastructure as a service, and now quantum as a service (QaaS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum computers are expensive to build and maintain. This may change as innovations lead to smaller, cheaper machines, but for now it is easier for many companies and institutions to access quantum resources as a service over the internet. Instead of buying quantum computers, companies and researchers can access quantum computing through the cloud, as they already do for many data and computational tasks in the conventional computing environment. Universities and some national programs, such as in Germany, already use QaaS for research. Today, QaaS offers the most likely path for greater commercial use of quantum computing. The QaaS market was valued at around $2 billion in 2021. This is a strong commercial market, and one way to expedite R&amp;amp;D is by expanding access to quantum resources and getting them into the hands of researchers. Some experts call for the NSF or DOE to expand access and offer quantum services to researchers, similar to how they offer HPC services now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum computers are expected to excel at certain types of problems, such as optimization, cryptography, and simulating quantum systems to provide insights into quantum physics. Many companies are exploring quantum computing’s potential and investing in R&amp;amp;D. Collaborations with quantum start-ups, research institutions, and QaaS providers can allow businesses to adopt and gain the benefits of quantum computing. Many researchers and companies have found that the most productive approach is to blend quantum and conventional computing resources—in other words, hybrid computing—letting each system work on the part of a problem where it has an advantage. Quantum computing may be years off, but the hybrid approach is already being explored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the twentieth century, federal investment created the computer technologies that gave U.S. companies a competitive advantage they would not otherwise have had. Businesses are starting to integrate quantum technology into their operations, and the number of companies offering quantum technologies and services continues to grow. Quantum computing will improve data analysis and the performance of AI and machine-learning algorithms. Over time, as in the case with classical computing, federal support could make up a smaller share of investment in quantum as the market and industry mature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-is-the-quantum-industrial-base&quot;&gt;WHAT IS THE QUANTUM INDUSTRIAL BASE?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quantum industrial base may be divided into segments. This report includes recommendations for each. The question is where to reinforce these segments through government action and where to rely on market forces. Building the industrial base needed for quantum leadership (the network of companies, research institutions, and government agencies driving the development of applications and commercial products) will require a policy that blends the traditional U.S. approach of using science to solve defense problems with the newer Silicon Valley approach, where venture capital and entrepreneurial firms develop products and markets. This has become one of the principal means for technological innovation and creating economic growth, making it a priority for quantum leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each segment requires a different mix of government action and market forces:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workforce:&lt;/strong&gt; Building a highly skilled quantum workforce is critical but reflects broader challenges in U.S. STEM education and talent development. Immigration policies, STEM education initiatives, and reskilling programs can help address this shortfall.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research:&lt;/strong&gt; Federal funding plays a pivotal role in advancing quantum research, which is still too risky and expensive for private industry to fully support. Programs through agencies like the NSF, DOE, and DOD can continue to provide foundational research support.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Materials:&lt;/strong&gt; Many quantum technologies depend on exotic materials that are costly or difficult to obtain. Addressing supply chain issues for these materials is essential not just for U.S. quantum competitiveness but for overall U.S. technological competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fabrication:&lt;/strong&gt; Developing fabrication infrastructure is vital for producing quantum devices at scale. This includes specialized quantum chips and components that require precision manufacturing capabilities far beyond traditional semiconductor fabrication and infrastructure software to increase the utility and performance of quantum hardware for a wide range of users.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Software and Algorithms:&lt;/strong&gt; Investments in software and algorithm development are necessary to unlock quantum computing’s potential. These efforts must focus on both developing quantum-specific tools and integrating quantum systems into hybrid environments with classical computers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing and Validation:&lt;/strong&gt; As quantum systems move from research to commercialization, testing facilities and standards are essential for ensuring reliability and performance. Federal programs can help establish these facilities and set benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Classical Control Technologies for Quantum Systems:&lt;/strong&gt; Quantum computers require advanced classical control systems. Advancing neutral atoms computing, for example, will require very high-speed cameras for fast readout and acousto-optical technologies for rapid atomic movement. The U.S. government can help develop these enabling technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expanding the quantum industrial base requires early investment. In the quantum sector, a combination of risk and limited demand inhibit early investment in the critical elements of the industrial base needed for future leadership. For comparison, spending on quantum products and services is less than $3 billion, whereas spending on AI is $200 billion and spending on semiconductors is $520 billion. Demand will strengthen over time as quantum technologies mature and commercially viable applications are created, with private investment following demand. Quantum technologies will create new tools that provide competitive advantage to the companies that use them, and sectors like pharmaceuticals, mineral and oil exploration, aerospace, automotive, and finance are adopting quantum sensing and computing. In the interim, federal investment is required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some segments—such as the workforce or the supply of necessary (and often exotic) materials needed for quantum production—reflect larger problems for national policy that are not unique to quantum technology. Quantum policy and investment are best seen as part of a larger approach to tech competitiveness. They can serve as a “poster child” for targeted government intervention at an early stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;high-performance-precedents&quot;&gt;HIGH-PERFORMANCE PRECEDENTS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is more to quantum technology than computing, but precedents for quantum policy may be drawn from decades of federal support for HPC. This support underpinned improved scientific R&amp;amp;D into new weapons. Once commercialized, HPC became an invaluable tool for business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like quantum technology policy, HPC policy is at the intersection of science, national security, and economic competitiveness. It began in the 1950s with U.S. investment in computers for nuclear weapons research at national laboratories. The 1960s saw the establishment of computing centers at national laboratories and major universities under DOE and NSF funding. The following decade saw the first coordinated national computing policy through programs like the NSF’s Office of Computing Activities. The United States introduced export controls on supercomputers to prevent the Soviet Union from acquiring advanced computing capabilities. In the 1980s, the United States established a special export control regime with Japan, the only other nation able to produce HPC at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time, international competition spurred HPC investment, and economic competition drove spending. The United States created the 1983 Strategic Computing Initiative in response to Japan’s Fifth Generation Computer Project and increased federal funding for computing research. The U.S. response to Japan also led to further increases in U.S. HPC funding and the creation of the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) program. The NITRD program was launched by the High-Performance Computing and Communication Act of 1991 and was reauthorized by Congress in the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act of 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 2010, the policy focus shifted to exceptionally powerful “exascale” computing initiatives, with the United States, China, the European Union, and Japan all announcing major programs. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the 2012 Advanced Computing Initiative (ACI) funded computing infrastructure. The 2015 National Strategic Computing Initiative established a coordinated federal strategy for HPC progress. There also has been increased attention on how quantum computing and AI fit with HPC and expand the scope of computing policy beyond supercomputing; the National Quantum Initiative Act (2018) and the American AI Initiative (2019), for example, contribute to these efforts to expand the scope of computing policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One lesson the United States can draw from the HPC experience is that progress and investment were driven initially by both security concerns and international competition before evolving into a commercial competition that drove improvement. Federal action for building and maintaining a leadership role for the United States provides important security and economic benefits, but there must be a transition to a greater private sector role and increased commercialization. The United Kingdom built the first supercomputer but kept it locked in a secret facility and classified the research; as a result, leadership in computing went elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Federal funding for HPC was crucial at the onset and continued to be critical throughout a decades-long process of development and improvement. But the ability to commercialize HPC was an equally important driver as markets and applications matured. HPC policy is not a perfect precedent because quantum technologies have many other important applications, chiefly in sensing, but the principal lesson from HPC is that federal action for building and maintaining a leadership role for the United States in quantum can provide important security and economic benefits. It will also require more spending if the United States is to be secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;china-and-quantum-competition&quot;&gt;CHINA AND QUANTUM COMPETITION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is the primary strategic competitor of the United States and sees leadership in quantum technologies as part of this competition. China declared quantum technology a key priority in its 14th five-year plan (approved in 2021). Even before this, the government announced the creation of a National Laboratory for Quantum Science for R&amp;amp;D initiatives in 2017. China has been making significant investments in quantum. While the exact figure is in dispute given China’s penchant for misrepresentation, China says that it spends eight times more than the U.S. government on quantum research. China may even lead in a few areas, such as quantum communications. While the exact figures are subject to debate, given the opacity of Chinese government spending, and regardless of who is spending more, China has likely made a large financial commitment to quantum technologies, and it has clearly defined its national goals for quantum leadership in ways that drive investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-lead-quantum-communications&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China’s Lead: Quantum Communications&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China has emerged as a global leader in quantum communications. In 2016, China launched the world’s first quantum communication satellite, Micius, which demonstrated secure quantum key distribution (QKD), a secure communication method, over long distances. This was a milestone in developing ultra-secure communication systems based on the principles of quantum mechanics, where information is transmitted in qubits, which are inherently more secure due to quantum entanglement. China has also built its own quantun encrypted network, connecting Beijing and Shanghai. It continues to deploy quantum communication infrastructure designed to secure sensitive communications. These successes are part of China’s broader effort to dominate the global quantum technology race, positioning itself as a leader in developing and applying quantum encryption for both civilian and military use.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most complex challenges for U.S. policymakers involves reshaping international collaboration in quantum research. An example is that the researcher who now heads China’s successful quantum satellite program was a classmate of the researcher who heads the quantum program of one of the largest U.S. tech companies. Both were fellow students at a European University and now are leaders in the quantum community. For decades, Chinese students and scientists played an important role in global collaboration, but this collaboration now comes with risks that the United States and its allies find unacceptable. There is still a Chinese quantum research presence in graduate schools in the United States and Europe, and there are benefits to continued openness (certainly in basic research, a tenet of U.S. policy since the Reagan administration). To restate the basic premise of this report, the United States does better by going faster in technology development and commercialization than its primary competitors, pointing again to the need for robust federal support and a supportive regulatory and business environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is developing quantum communications with projects like the Micius satellite program, initially undertaken in cooperation with an Austrian university. China launched Micius in 2016 and reported in 2017 that it had achieved the world’s first quantum-encrypted teleconference, held between China and Austria. China had security concerns with the satellite, but Chinese researchers announced in 2020 that they had resolved these problems, relying more on secure ground technology to communicate with Micius. Programs like Micius show China’s ability to combine domestic resources with international collaboration to achieve technological breakthroughs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managing technology transfer will be part of the challenge in structuring international cooperation. Trying to slow China in quantum technologies will be less effective than accelerating the United States’ own efforts in the area. That said, it is not in the United States’ interest to support or subsidize China’s quantum efforts, either directly or indirectly, through transfers from partners, such as in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While China’s government says it has invested more in quantum technologies, the United States has a much stronger overall position in terms of research talent and ability to innovate. It also has a strong private sector presence in quantum technologies that gives it an advantage that China’s state-directed economy finds difficult to match. This is, as in the case of other areas of tech competition with China, a contest between two different models for innovation and the role of government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although China is not the United States’ only competitor, it is the only competitor with hostile intent. The European Union and other European countries, like the United Kingdom, are also investing in quantum research. Likewise, Australia is a leader, as are Canada and Japan. One advantage for the United States is that it can more easily develop partnerships with these countries than China can, but partnerships do not happen automatically. This report recommends improving international cooperation using existing multilateral organizations, like NATO, the Quad, or AUKUS, and perhaps developing and strengthening new arrangements specifically for quantum cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Case Study 3: Post-Quantum Cryptography&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cryptography uses mathematical formulas to make data unreadable unless they are decoded. It is the backbone of online commerce and finance and has major applications in national security systems. In short, the internet depends on encryption. Currently, forcibly decrypting data can take centuries due to the immense computational demand and relative slow speed of conventional computers. But quantum computers, with their immensely greater speed, will be able to perform the calculations needed to rapidly decrypt data at will. While quantum decryption is not possible now, it is part of the strategic competition with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some advanced U.S. adversaries, such as China, are likely collecting and storing encrypted data obtained through signals intelligence or over the internet for decryption later, when quantum computers are available. The United States probably does this as well. Although it is a highly debated topic, the best current estimate of when quantum decryption could become available is in the next 6 to 10 years. Without adequate preparation, quantum decryption will reshape the security environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A well-known story illustrates this risk. In 1941, the British, using a combination of traditional espionage, the most advanced computing capabilities of the time, and sheer human talent, read the encrypted messages of the Nazi German high command without the Germans knowing. Some estimates say this shortened World War II by two to three years. Covert decryption was also central to improving U.S. fortunes in the Pacific War. If China makes breakthroughs in quantum technologies that give it a similar advantage (and it is working hard to do so), it will not announce them, but the United States will face unexpected setbacks and surprises as a result. The damage will extend well beyond the military realm, as intellectual property, commercial information, and financial data will all be vulnerable. The risk to cryptography alone justifies spending on quantum technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the risks, NIST led a process to create post-quantum cryptography (PQC) and in August 2024 published standards for quantum-resistant cryptography. The transition to PQC will not be the first time encryption standards have changed to adjust to better computing. In the late 1990s, NIST developed a replacement standard called the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). Changing encryption standards is a lengthy process since new products and standards must be created and then installed across the economy to replace older encryption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implementation of PQC will likely be more complicated than the previous transition to AES. The transition to AES took several years but was accelerated by a 2002 requirement for mandatory use by all federal agencies. NIST predicts that without large-scale implementation planning, the PQC transition will take years, during which the United States may be vulnerable. The National Security Agency has recommended using NIST’s PQC algorithms as the best way to secure against the quantum decryption threat, and with the release of the NIST standards, a strong market for post-quantum communications is emerging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;next-steps&quot;&gt;NEXT STEPS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These above cases help make the case for why increased federal spending is essential for technological leadership. They point to why, without increased federal investment, quantum technologies will not be built at the pace or scale needed for national security or commercial advantage. Policymakers do not need to be experts in quantum mechanics to make informed strategic decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The competition over quantum technology is not the first the United States has faced. One of the initial contests occurred after the Cold War launch of the Sputnik satellite, which energized the United States to fund its science and technology enterprise. The U.S. economy and military continue to reap the benefits of investments that began in the 1950s and those that followed them. In part, Sputnik motivated the United States to create its mix of strong research universities, flexible financial systems, competitive business focus on technology, and a fast-moving, risk-taking entrepreneurial culture. Other countries also have these strengths but not at the same scale or scope. The United States may not have something as dramatic as the Sputnik moment to energize investment this time, but with the right policies, quantum technology will be another U.S. success story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum technologies are best thought of as providing better tools for business and security. They create new tools that provide a competitive advantage to the companies that use them, and there is already widespread interest and exploration of both sensing and computing in sectors like pharmaceuticals, mineral and oil exploration, aerospace, automobiles, and finance. Quantum computing is an exciting technology with the potential to revolutionize industries and create new business opportunities. However, it also brings several challenges that need to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments can shape innovation and markets by lowering costs, changing rules, and providing resources. The United States can use government policy and federal investment to accelerate the development and use of quantum technologies, which are necessary for technological leadership and national security. These actions span increased funding, strengthened collaboration with allies, education and workforce development, infrastructure improvements, and development of an innovation-friendly regulatory environment. Recommendations for quantum leadership are provided in the following section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as the physics research of the twentieth century and the HPC investments of 60 years ago laid the foundation for today’s security and digital economy, quantum physics and the technologies that grow from it will shape the economy of the future, but this will not happen without supportive federal policies. While much progress in building quantum technologies has been made, more needs to be done. This report lays out what is required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;national-security-1&quot;&gt;NATIONAL SECURITY&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. Establish a quantum sensing initiative, with an early focus on PNT.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should mandate a comprehensive quantum sensing initiative to advance the development and deployment of quantum technologies for strategic applications. This will help pave the way for future applications for quantum sensors across government and industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Develop quantum navigation technologies. The DOD, in coordination with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), should accelerate the development of quantum inertial and magnetic anomaly–based navigation technologies to enable reliable navigation for military and civilian aircraft and ships, even in GPS-denied environments. While current military initiatives emphasize sensor quality and miniaturization, expanded efforts are needed to address the cost and manufacturability challenges faced by the civilian aviation industry.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create high-resolution mapping programs. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) should establish a comprehensive program to produce high-resolution magnetic anomaly maps and improved gravity maps of the United States. These maps are critical for the effective use of quantum navigation and resource mapping technologies. Without authoritative and precise mapping, the potential performance gains from quantum magnetic anomaly and quantum inertial navigation systems will remain limited, affecting their value for both civil and military applications.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pursue international collaboration for global mapping. Recognizing that navigation and resource mapping extend beyond U.S. borders, the U.S. government should engage in partnerships with allied nations to develop and share high-resolution magnetic and gravity maps. Such international cooperation enhances the utility of quantum technologies and contributes to global interoperability and strategic collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) should increase efforts to accelerate the adoption of quantum-resistant encryption by federal agencies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The OMB must not only direct the adoption of quantum-resistant encryption within government but also track compliance and progress. Transitioning to quantum-resistant encryption (also called post-quantum cryptography, or PQC) is essential to protect sensitive information from future quantum-based attacks. The OMB’s progress to date in directing agencies toward quantum transitions has been valuable, but follow-through is necessary to ensure agencies continue to prioritize encryption updates. The OMB can use its authority over budgets to make agency funding contingent on meeting defined benchmarks for the implementation of quantum-resistant encryption, such as requiring agencies to show progress in the completion of risk assessments, piloting quantum-resistant solutions, and fully implementing quantum-safe encryption standards. The OMB already requires federal agencies to report on their cybersecurity progress through the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA). This reporting could be expanded to include quantum-resistant encryption readiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3. The Office of the National Cyber Director (ONCD) should collaborate with sector-specific regulatory agencies to update cybersecurity regulations and set compliance deadlines for industries vulnerable to quantum threats, ensuring tailored solutions based on sector risks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could include new compliance deadlines for industries to adopt quantum-safe encryption and mandatory risk assessments for sectors that handle high volumes of sensitive data. Each industry has different requirements and risks, so tailored regulations are essential. A public process, led by the OMB and ONCD, should be developed to encourage private sector participation using financial incentives, such as tax credits, grants, and regulatory relief for companies that lead the way in adopting quantum-resistant technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;4. By 2030, acquisition regulations should be amended to require quantum-safe encryption for critical systems in both the public and private sectors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Federal information processing standards (FIPS) govern federal information security practices and private sector contracts with federal agencies. In 2024, NIST created three FIPS for PQC, which the secretary of commerce has approved, designed to resist potential attacks by future quantum computers. By 2030, NIST should amend the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) to require quantum-resistant encryption for critical public and private systems. Incorporating quantum-resistant algorithms ensures that systems managing classified information, healthcare records, energy grids, financial systems, and other sensitive public data are protected against quantum decryption attacks. It will also mitigate risks related to “harvest now, decrypt later” attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;5. The United States should create programs to ensure a robust supply chain for the raw and processed materials necessary for quantum technology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A secure supply chain promises independence from foreign adversaries, reducing reliance on materials that may be restricted by other countries, particularly China, which could use their control over critical resources for coercive purposes. Examples include helium-3 (used in cryogenic systems for cooling quantum computers and sensors), isotopically pure silicon (used in quantum processors for certain types of qubits, such as silicon-based spin qubits), lithium niobate (a widely used material for quantum photonics applications, such as modulators and waveguides in quantum communication systems), and nitrogen-vacancy diamonds (diamonds containing atomic-scale defects that can be manipulated for quantum sensing and quantum communication purposes). Ensuring access to these materials and the processes used to refine them will be of paramount importance in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;6. Congress should fund a DOD program to ensure a secure supply chain for critical materials crucial to producing quantum technologies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD should create forecasting systems to anticipate future needs based on expected advances in quantum technologies, allowing for proactive management of supply chains. The DOD’s Office of Strategic Capital (OSC) has already put out a notice of funding availability on a direct loan program supporting the purchase of manufacturing equipment. Quantum is one of the categories the OSC is investing in. The DOD, in collaboration with other agencies, could also establish strategic reserves of critical materials such as helium-3 and isotopically pure silicon to ensure the United States has secure access to materials even during global shortages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;7. Strengthen supply chain cooperation with allies and friendly nations that produce or refine critical materials.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could be achieved by establishing cooperative agreements with countries like Australia, Canada, Japan, and the members of the European Union that are rich in natural resources or have advanced material refinement capabilities. The United States should pursue agreements with these countries to facilitate preferential access to materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop a common approach to export controls.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;8. The United States and its allies must take a coordinated approach to export controls to limit leakage of U.S. and allied technology to adversarial nations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Common export control frameworks among the United States’ European and Asian allies can mitigate national security risks without greatly hindering commercial and academic collaboration. By harmonizing export policies, allied countries can ensure the technologies are shared among trusted partners while keeping sensitive technologies out of adversaries’ hands. The AUKUS agreement’s Pillar 2 outlines the need to align the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom on export control processes for strategic technologies, including quantum. This should be expanded to include other allied nations, and the United States should create a Quantum Technology Export Control Working Group to align export control policies and use this group to update the Wassenaar Arrangement to include quantum technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expand cooperation with allies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;9. Congress should authorize the use of appropriated funds for joint programs with allied nations to expand reciprocal cross-border partnerships.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the United States has made great strides in forging government-to-government relationships, signing 12 quantum cooperation agreements with allied nations, a significant gap remains in facilitating cross-border commercial and research partnerships. U.S. quantum companies still face challenges in securing R&amp;amp;D funding or commercial contracts in overseas markets, and foreign companies struggle with entering the U.S. market and accessing government funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Policies should emphasize commercialization and practical applications.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;10. The United States should reduce regulatory impediments to private quantum investment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The global quantum market is rapidly evolving, and mergers and acquisitions of quantum technology companies can strengthen expertise and drive commercialization. The Departments of Commerce and the Treasury should take a proactive approach and review existing regulations for export controls and foreign investment to streamline (consistent with national security concerns) approvals for friendly countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;11. NIST should develop shared-use quantum testing and metrology facilities, enabling quantum companies and researchers to access essential equipment and advance prototype development.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quantum industry is highly fragmented, with companies exploring diverse technical approaches. Each approach has unique testing and validation needs, but there are commonalities in the enabling technologies these require, such as cryogenics, radio frequency (RF) control electronics, and precision timing. Quantum technology companies often struggle to find commercial facilities with the capacity to test exotic materials, microelectronics, and other components. This is also true for quantum-adjacent companies, such as energy companies that wish to experiment with quantum computing but lack their own cryogenics facilities or other capabilities needed to validate that components work. Shared-use testing and metrology facilities allow quantum companies to access the expensive, specialized equipment they would otherwise struggle to acquire, enabling them to rapidly iterate on design and prototype new quantum technologies. Shared facilities should include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;shared cryogenics facilities, such as vacuum chambers and other essential equipment to maintain ultra-low temperature environments;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;shared metrology and calibration tools, including tools for quantum state tomography, noise characterization tools, and frequency signal analyzers to validate control electronics, particularly those operating in the microwave and RF spectrum;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;control electronics and microwave test beds, including high-speed arbitrary waveform generators, microwave signal generators, and RF amplifiers designed to work in the gigahertz regime;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;cleanrooms for nanofabrication and material characterization, including those equipped with electron beam lithography, atomic layer deposition, and etching tools; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;material characterization tools like scanning electron microscopes, atomic force microscopes, and X-ray diffraction systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In addition to national security applications, Congress should establish a quantum sensing initiative.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;12. Quantum sensing technologies can be used for antisubmarine warfare and aircraft detection. In addition to national security applications, Congress should establish a quantum sensing initiative focused on sectors like medical devices and semiconductors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Progress in quantum sensing applications will help position the United States as a global leader. As with other quantum efforts, NIST, DARPA, and the DOE should lead development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These technologies, which could include low-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetoencephalography, and magnetocardiography, promise significant improvements in diagnostic capabilities through enhanced sensitivity and noninvasive imaging techniques. Investing in quantum medical devices will improve health outcomes and maintain the United States’ position as a global leader in cutting-edge healthcare technology. Quantum sensing technology is also being developed for use in manufacturing, research, and security. It can be used in semiconductor manufacturing to detect defects at a nanoscale without significantly disrupting production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a quantum grand challenge.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;13. DARPA should initiate a grand challenge program to incentivize the development of utility-scale quantum computers, rewarding progress toward quantum advantage with milestone-based funding.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The competition should be modeled after the highly successful XPRIZE competition. It could include investment collaboration with the OSC. The original grand challenge cost around $50 million, with a $1 million prize. This commission estimates that a quantum challenge could cost over $2 billon. A quantum grand challenge would be more expensive, and DARPA may need to offer a substantial prize to incentivize researchers and companies. It might also need to fund associated quantum research efforts for participating teams. The R&amp;amp;D costs could be extensive, but a competition could be effective, as it rewards success and spurs private sector investment. Finding valuable applications for quantum computers requires time and great expense. This is too large a chasm to risk depending solely on private funding. Milestone payments from the challenge program could help bring the market forward to support private investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;research-1&quot;&gt;RESEARCH&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There needs to be significant increases in current spending to accelerate R&amp;amp;D and guarantee technological advantage over foreign competitors.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;14. Fund and expand DARPA benchmarking and quantum computing R&amp;amp;D programs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DARPA’s benchmarking and quantum computing R&amp;amp;D programs target significant defense applications of quantum computing and fund technology development for private companies to advance those applications. These programs should be extended and given the funding needed to sustain them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;15. Fund ARPA-E, ARPA-I, and ARPA-H to support quantum application R&amp;amp;D.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum computers are of little value without the algorithms and associated software. Progress in quantum algorithms is as critical as the hardware itself. Focusing on both algorithmic advancements and application benchmarking will help bridge the gap between theoretical quantum research and practical quantum applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each field—energy (ARPA-E), health (ARPA-H), and infrastructure (ARPA-I)—stands to benefit from quantum computing but requires domain-specific algorithms and performance metrics to determine when and where quantum computers will provide a tangible advantage over classical systems. The NSF, DARPA, DOE, ARPA-E, ARPA-H, and ARPA-I should fund academic and industry researchers through grants, competitions, and collaborative agreements to ensure the United States has the algorithms and software needed for quantum computing’s commercialization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum research programs would help align work with pressing needs in energy, healthcare, and infrastructure. For example, ARPA-E can explore quantum applications for the energy grid. ARPA-H can use quantum computing to explore drug discovery or genomics. ARPA-E, ARPA-H, and ARPA-I could run programs modeled on the DARPA Quantum Benchmarking program to identify valuable applications in their areas, estimate the quantum computer performance needed to achieve advantage, and focus on developing algorithms that address key challenges in sectors such as pharmaceuticals, energy optimization, finance, and logistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of this effort, the NSF, DOE, and NIST, in partnership with industry and academia, should work to develop collaborative quantum benchmarks. The NSF and DOE should collaborate with industry to establish benchmarking standards for quantum algorithms, ensuring that results are reproducible and comparable across different quantum hardware. These standards would provide a road map to identify when a quantum advantage has been achieved in a particular application to help guide the investment of resources in the most promising quantum technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;16. The Departments of Commerce and Energy and the NSF should launch programs to make quantum computing resources available to a broader base of researchers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite recent U.S. government efforts to provide researchers with access to quantum computing resources, the availability of quantum testbeds remains low, especially for researchers from industry and academia. Providing testbeds would allow for the steady advancement of quantum computing research, exploration, testing, education, and innovation. This would help subsidize private and public use-case development for quantum computers, the costs of which are often prohibitively expensive. Providing access to quantum resources could accelerate the development of applications. Subsidizing access to the latest generations of quantum computers would make it easier for private and public users to develop applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;17. Congress should authorize the DOE to establish a well-funded program office to develop a leadership-class quantum computing facility and integrate quantum systems with HPC for scientific and industrial applications.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While quantum computing is still in a nascent stage, the integration of quantum computers with a large-scale HPC system can dramatically accelerate certain types of computational tasks and accelerate the commercialization of quantum technologies. Quantum/HPC integration allows the United States to adopt hybrid computing models that could significantly advance scientific research and industrial applications before fault-tolerant quantum computers are available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOE has decades of experience managing large-scale scientific programs and HPC infrastructure. Its national labs have long been home to some of the world’s most powerful supercomputers, such as Summit and Frontier at the DOE’s Leadership Computing Facilities, which have been critical to scientific advancements, from physics and chemistry to biology and AI. This makes the DOE the logical choice for leading the integration of quantum computing capabilities with classical HPC. The DOE also has scientific applications where quantum computers will have meaningful impact. The DOE should have its own procurement program to acquire computers for its use in establishing a world-class quantum facility. This could enable the DOE to not only build the physical infrastructure for quantum computing but also invest in essential workforce development, software tools, and quantum/HPC integration frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;workforce-1&quot;&gt;WORKFORCE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;18. Congress should fund the NSF to support quantum workforce development programs for bachelor’s, master’s, and PhD programs, addressing the growing demand for quantum technicians and engineers to build and maintain quantum systems.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future of U.S. leadership in quantum technologies depends on having a highly skilled workforce capable of developing, operating, and maintaining these systems. While many quantum-related jobs require PhDs for research, demand is growing for technicians and engineers with specialized quantum skills at the bachelor’s or master’s levels. Doctoral-level experts will continue to be essential, but a robust quantum ecosystem requires practitioners. Investing in bachelor’s and master’s programs would create a pipeline of skilled individuals. Australia exemplifies this potential through the University of New South Wales, which has developed the world’s first quantum engineering program for undergraduates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;19. Congress should also appropriate additional funds for the NSF’s training programs, which provide grants to universities to support graduate-level training.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NRT supports traineeships across many scientific disciplines, and quantum science should be made a higher priority. Specific tracks should be created within the NRT to train students in the practical skills required for quantum technology. The NSF should also emphasize industry partnerships, allowing students to collaborate with companies during their studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Expanding the NSF Graduate Research Fellowships Program to include a focus on quantum technologies would help support master’s-level students who may not intend to pursue a PhD. This could incentivize more students to enter the field of quantum.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Department of Labor’s Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act programs could offer grants for workforce training in quantum technologies, specifically targeting apprenticeships, internships, and job-placement programs for workers at the bachelor’s and master’s levels.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The NSF could fund a national quantum apprenticeship and fellowship program, allowing students at the bachelor’s and master’s levels to gain real-world experience in labs and companies working on quantum technologies. Funding could be provided through the NSF with matching contributions from industry partners. This would give students hands-on exposure to quantum equipment and system maintenance in practical settings.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;20. Congress should fund the NSF to develop and distribute a comprehensive undergraduate quantum science curriculum, enabling broader access to quantum education and preparing students for roles in quantum technology industries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, most undergraduate physics, engineering, and computer science programs do not offer dedicated courses in quantum information science (QIS), the logic being that undergraduates need a foundation of classical and quantum physics before tackling QIS. Undergraduates are typically exposed to quantum mechanics in later stages of their degree program. As a result, undergraduates looking to enter the field have few options available other than entering through a PhD program. This lack of early exposure creates a barrier to students who might be interested in pursuing quantum computing, quantum communications, or quantum sensing careers but lack access to dedicated undergraduate programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quantum technology supply chain requires not just research scientists but also a large pool of quantum technicians, engineers, and programmers with a strong understanding of QIS principles. As quantum technologies move toward commercialization, demand for mid-level professionals will increase. Undergraduate training can provide the foundation for students to enter these roles directly or to transition into master’s programs or industry apprenticeships. Having a QIS curriculum at the undergraduate level can help build the practical skills needed for jobs in quantum hardware development, quantum programming, and system integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NSF already funds quantum research through programs such as the Quantum Leap Challenge Institutes (QLCI), and it could expand these efforts to include educational components focused on undergraduates. The NSF’s previous work in areas like cybersecurity and AI provides a model for how to structure a quantum science curriculum. Similar scholarship programs could be created for quantum science to encourage students to pursue QIS degrees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;21. Expand faculty training.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to developing the curriculum, the NSF should fund faculty training programs to ensure professors are equipped to teach quantum science at the undergraduate level. Workshops, online training resources, and professional development programs could be created to ensure faculty are up to date with the latest advancements in QIS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;22. Congress should consider expanding visa programs to bring foreign quantum experts to the United States.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The demand for highly skilled quantum professionals already exceeds the current supply of graduates from U.S. universities. While domestic education programs are essential for building a long-term workforce, it will take years to train new quantum experts. There are not enough experts to fill the talent gap. Attracting quantum expertise is essential. Other nations, including Australia, Canada, China, and Germany, are aggressively recruiting international quantum talent to accelerate their own quantum programs and build a quantum workforce. Without visa programs that prioritize quantum expertise, the United States risks losing out to competing countries on top international talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of State should work with the DOE, NSF, and DOD to identify key areas of quantum expertise that require foreign talent to ensure competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Congress should expand existing visa programs to attract foreign quantum experts to the United States. Quantum is not the only field facing a talent shortage, but quantum expertise should be targeted specifically due to its geopolitical importance. This could include creating a quantum-specific visa program under the existing O-1 or H-1B visa programs for highly skilled quantum professionals, including researchers, postdoctoral scholars, engineers, and entrepreneurs working in quantum-related fields.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States could increase the cap on H-1B visas, with specific allocations for quantum experts. Another option is expanding the O-1 visa, which is designed for individuals with extraordinary abilities in science, to explicitly include quantum expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, many quantum-related fields already fall under the STEM Optional Practical Training (OPT) program, which allows international students to work in the United States for an extended period after graduation. Expanding this to include quantum disciplines would provide additional opportunities for foreign graduates to remain in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

While it has played a role in shaping events, its long-term dominance remains uncertain amid shifting power dynamics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many observers and analysts portray Turkey as the primary winner of the Syrian war, with the greatest comparative ability to assert its influence during the post-Assad transition process. A central theme is that Russia and Iran’s declining influence would be compensated directly by Turkey as the emerging dominant power, despite the increasing engagement of global and regional powers with Syria. Observers also emphasise that Turkey has been the steadfast supporter of the Syrian opposition forces, with the strongest communication channels and enormous leverage mechanisms, without underlining the differences between Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and Turkey’s proxies like the Syrian National Army (SNA). Also, there is a common view that Turkey has led the initiative to end Assad’s rule throughout the 13-year war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the rapid fall of the regime was the culmination of regional-level developments, and Turkey’s changing policies played a complementary role. A closer look at the evolution of Turkey’s Syria policy reveals that Ankara has not shaped the course of developments after it lost the primary initiative to the US and Russian interventions in Syria. Since the mid-2010s, Turkey has played into the US-Russian competition to secure its military presence in Syria against non-state threats and the risk of another large influx of refugees. Turkey’s shifting alignments with these powers in the conflict field shaped the conditions amenable to the regime’s eventual fall. The HTS leadership, which will have closely monitored this process, will likely follow a similarly pragmatic approach toward foreign actors, potentially diminishing Turkey’s current influence in Syria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-background-of-turkeys-syria-policy&quot;&gt;The Background of Turkey’s Syria Policy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early years of the Syrian conflict, Turkey’s policy was aligned with the US and European governments declaring that Assad must go, although Ankara adopted a tougher approach by repeatedly calling for an international military intervention. Despite some disagreements on which groups to support, US–Turkey cooperation in Syria continued until early 2015, when the two states agreed to start a train-and-equip programme for the Syrian armed opposition. Some groups joining such US-led programmes defected to or were detained by more radical and jihadist forces like Jabhat Al-Nusra, the predecessor of HTS. Unlike the US – which shifted its focus to fighting radical Islamist groups – and Arab states increasingly preoccupied with their own regime security, Turkey maintained its anti-Assad policies and sustained support to the rebel groups including the SNA, its main proxy force. At first glance, then, it would appear that Ankara finally achieved its objective as rebels departing from Idlib – where Turkey has long provided a shield – subverted the Assad regime, boosting Turkey’s influence in Syria. The longer story is much more nuanced and complicated, just like Turkey’s shifting priorities concerning the Syrian battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Why did Russia give the green light to a Turkish military presence in Syria, which ultimately contributed to Assad’s fall – a serious blow to Russian regional influence?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-growing-deadlock&quot;&gt;A Growing Deadlock&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two pivotal developments in the mid-2010s shattered Turkish-US collaboration in the conflict zone and plunged Turkey’s Syria policy into disarray. The first was Islamic State’s rapid capture of Syrian territory, and the second was the start of Russia’s pro-Assad military intervention in September 2015. The US decided to rely on the Kurdish-led People’s Defense Units (YPG) by arming them in the growing fight against Islamic State, while this collaboration paved the way for building a US-controlled zone to the east of the Euphrates as a counterbalance against Russia’s military influence. The expansion of YPG-controlled areas in Northern Syria was accompanied by growing attacks by the PKK terrorist organisation inside Turkey’s borders, while Turkish officials complained that the US arms delivered to the YPG were later transferred to the PKK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, increasing violations of Turkey’s airspace by Russian air forces bombing Syria led to escalating tensions with Moscow, which culminated in November 2015 when Turkish air forces shot down a Russian SU-24 fighter jet. From then on, Turkey’s capacity to impact developments in Syria diminished as Moscow also increased its support to YPG forces, expanding its control along the Turkish-Syrian border. Furthermore, the Kremlin established a de-facto no-fly zone for Turkey’s air forces with the deployment of Russian air defence systems at the Khmeimim airbase in Northern Syria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rapprochement-with-russia-and-its-limitations&quot;&gt;Rapprochement with Russia and its Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After getting into such a deadlock over its policies in Syria, Turkey initiated a rapprochement with Russia in June 2016 when Erdogan wrote a letter to Putin signalling a readiness to resolve the jet crisis. This process cleared the path for Turkey’s military interventions in Jarablus in 2016 and Afrin, a region under YPG control, in 2018. These operations were made possible through coordination with Russia’s military, opening Syria’s air space to Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why did Russia give the green light to a Turkish military presence in Syria, which ultimately contributed to Assad’s fall – a serious blow to Russian regional influence? Firstly, Russia expected Turkey to soften its anti-regime policies in order to bring the conflict in Syria to a more manageable level, and to support Russian-led diplomatic initiatives. In December 2016, for example, Ankara remained silent on operations by the Assad regime and Russia to retake control of Aleppo, while the evacuation of thousands of civilians and fighters was implemented under a Russian-Turkish deal. Secondly, Russia sought to exploit Turkey’s rapprochement attempts to help meet its larger geopolitical objective of driving a wedge through NATO, as Ankara increasingly felt that the Alliance fell short of guaranteeing its security and that the US’s Syria policy contributed to the growth of transnational threats. Weeks before the Afrin operation, Russia and Turkey concluded a deal on the sale of S-400 air defence systems, which still represents a serious problem in Turkish-NATO relations. What Turkey expected from its rapprochement with Russia was to increase its bargaining power vis-á-vis the US and to secure a military presence in Syria that would be of benefit in an era of great power competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Astana peace process initiated in 2017 between Russia, Turkey and Iran established four de-escalation zones across Syria including the Idlib province bordering Turkey, where Ankara secured military observation points. According to the Sochi deal between Russia and Turkey, the latter committed to clear Idlib province of “radical” rebel forces and heavy arms, although it was questionable whether Ankara had the capacity to achieve this in an area not under its full military control, leaving aside its interests and preferences. Despite the de-escalation agreements, the regime supported by Russia and Iran captured the first three zones and some parts of Idlib, squeezing 4.5 million people including rebel fighters and displaced civilians into a narrow strip along Turkey’s border. Turkey was already hosting more than 3.5 million refugees, with growing social, political and economic repercussions. Turkish military forces resisted attacks by the regime on Idlib along with local rebel forces, sometimes at very high cost. On 27 February 2020, the Russian-backed Syrian air forces bombed a Turkish military position in Idlib causing at least 33 casualties, shortly after Turkish troops and proxies had captured the city of Seraqib at the junction of Syria’s two strategic highways. Following these developments, Turkey’s military presence in Syria faced a growing challenge given the asymmetrical nature of Russian-Turkish collaboration and Assad’s expanding control over the country, creating additional pressure on Turkey’s positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;unexpected-fall-of-the-regime&quot;&gt;Unexpected Fall of the Regime&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2023, Assad’s continued rule was increasingly accepted as a reality by regional actors, including Arab states, which allowed Syria’s re-entry into the Arab League to decrease its dependency on Iran. Meanwhile, facing domestic political pressure to address the refugee crisis, Erdogan began calling publicly for normalisation talkswith the Assad regime facilitated by Russia. Developments towards the end of 2024 rapidly changed all involved actors’ considerations and calculations concerning Syria. Advancing from Idlib, the HTS-led rebels faced little resistance as they swiftly captured Aleppo and other cities, and ultimately toppled the Assad regime in Damascus in less than two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rapid collapse of the regime revealed the extent of Israel’s destruction of Hezbollah and Iran’s proxy forces through its operations in Lebanon and Syria over the preceding months. In the past, these actors had played a key role in providing reinforcements to the regime’s army. Russia’s preoccupation with the Ukraine war and its inability to provide sufficient material support to Syria through its air force and navy also had a significant impact. Yet, Russia had never been a key factor in the ground fighting and could only resort to airstrikes on the HTS-controlled cities, leading to civilian casualties as seen in the last Idlib attacks which hit a hospital. Such costly moves would have further marginalised Russia concerning the future of Syria and the Middle East, with little chance of reversing the developments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that Assad’s rapid fall could not have been foreseen by many global and regional actors, including Turkey. Some reports suggest that Turkey was informed of the presence of an attack plan by HTS six months ago, but Ankara did not endorse it, fearing that such a move would re-escalate the war between the regime and rebel groups and lead to a growing refugee flow from Syria. According to the Associated Press, Turkish officials declared that the rebel advance starting in late November “was initially meant to be limited” but was expanded as “Syrian government forces began retreating from their positions”. After HTS captured Aleppo and Hama, Erdogan stated that he hoped Syrian rebel forces would advance further, but also added that the resistance of terrorist organisations was continuing and represented a “problematic advance” from Turkey’s point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the YPG, HTS is also included in Turkey’s official list of terrorist organizations. Although HTS’s existence as the strongest rebel group in Idlib has run parallel to Turkey’s pragmatic interest in preventing Assad’s military operations, the organisation has never fallen under Turkey’s authority. Indeed, Turkey tried to weaken HTS’s dominance by following a divide-and-rule policy between radical and more pragmatic factions. However, Muhammed al-Jolani, HTS’s leader, preserved the autonomy of the rebel group and continued to behave independently from Turkey and its proxy forces. By 2022, HTS had defeated or co-opted many groups in the armed opposition, and asserted its control over Idlib, with the aim of ensuring a military hegemony over different factions of the SNA. The HTS-led march towards Damascus did not include the SNA, Turkey’s key ally, which moved towards the east to seize territory from the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a Kurdish-led coalition including the YPG as its armed wing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The more instability that emerges in Syria as a result of renewed conflicts, the less capable Turkey will be of shaping developments in line with its priorities and interests.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-future-of-syria-and-turkeys-political-influence&quot;&gt;The Future of Syria and Turkey’s Political Influence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The history outlined above reveals how Turkey’s changing policies and positions in Syria – driven by its concerns about non-state threats and the refugee issue – shaped dynamics conducive to Assad’s eventual fall, rather than directly orchestrating it. Recognising this can also help us to make more accurate predictions about the future of Syria and Turkey’s political influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having captured Damascus and set up an interim government for Syria’s transformation, the HTS leadership will play a central role in the country’s future. Turkey has a great stake in limiting the radical Islamist tendencies of the group. HTS’s failure to lead an inclusive political transition accommodating Syria’s diverse religious, ethnic and ideological groups would risk the re-escalation of civil war, mirroring the destabilisation witnessed in post-Gaddafi Libya. Such a development would likely exacerbate the refugee crisis along Turkey’s borders and lead to heightened international support for the SDF/YPG forces against extremists, intensifying Turkey’s concerns over non-state threats. Therefore, the more instability that emerges in Syria as a result of renewed conflicts, the less capable Turkey will be of shaping developments in line with its priorities and interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkey might be considered to be in a relatively advantageous position that would allow it to have some impact on HTS’s decisions given the maintenance of contacts established in Idlib. The US and Western powers have already sought to leverage Turkey’s contacts with HTS to transmit their warnings and expectations concerning the transition process and the risk of extremist resurgence. However, the main initiative during the transition process will be in the hands of the HTS leadership. As the prime minister of the interim government, the HTS appointed Mohammed al-Bashir, previously the prime minister of HTS’s Salvation Government in Idlib. Almost all officials of the interim government are linked to HTS and its previous ruling body in Idlib. The interim government – which excludes members of other opposition groups including the pro-Turkish SNA – currently assumes all functions and responsibilities in the political transformation process, without any checks or balances. If there were to be a resurgence in HTS’s radical tendencies, it is not clear how Turkey could assert control over HTS’s course of action beyond providing advice and recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, HTS has adopted a pragmatic stance, showing signs of de-radicalisation and moderation since the advance towards Damascus, which have led to a favourable reception by Western powers and some regional actors. While these powers naturally seek to impact the developments in Syria, the HTS leadership needs to establish political, economic and diplomatic links with the world to remain in power. The US holds effective bargaining chips vis-á-vis HTS, as it could ease Syria’s isolation and remove sanctions on the condition that the HTS leadership takes constructive steps both domestically and internationally, particularly in its interactions with local US allies like Israel and the SDF. Although Arab states are concerned about HTS’s radical origins and the risks of extremism and instability in the region, they also have to engage with the de facto rulers to manage such risks and their interests. Likewise, HTS needs economic cooperation with regional actors for Syria’s reconstruction. Even Russia has moderated its stance towards HTS to avoid further marginalisation in Syria, with Russian state media beginning to refer to HTS as “armed opposition” instead of a “terrorist group”. Despite the background, HTS may also soften its approach towards Russia given its status as a permanent UN Security Council member with veto power on key decisions concerning international security and sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regional developments since the Arab Spring show the increasing flexibility of ad hoc and short-term alignments in the Middle East, as traditional military alliances remain too cumbersome to deal with transnational threats arising from regional conflicts and failed states. Since the mid-2010s, Turkey has efficiently played into the competition between the US and Russia to manage transnational threats and its refugee problem. The HTS leadership will have observed all these developments which have contributed to its rise to power more closely than international analysts and academics. Now, foreign powers are establishing contacts with the new regime in Damascus, marking a shift from the previous situation in Idlib where Turkey provided HTS’s sole opening to the world. If the HTS leadership is to survive in power, it must follow a similar pragmatic policy exploiting the regional interests of foreign actors and the competition between them. This will naturally pose a limit on Turkey’s influence in Syria in the longer term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. adversaries are developing capabilities and taking actions that pose a growing threat to the U.S. military and intelligence community across the globe. China, for example, is investing significantly in artificial intelligence (AI) such as DeepSeek, quantum computing, and other emerging technologies, as well as improving capabilities in areas such as information and influence operations, long-range strike, autonomous systems, cyber, and space. China can leverage an economy that has greater purchasing power parity ($31.2 trillion) than the United States ($24.7 trillion), a situation that the United States did not face with the Soviet Union during the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s military-civil fusion (军民融合) development strategy—also called national strategic integration—has created a way for the government to direct and facilitate cooperation with the commercial sector and fuse China’s defense industrial base with its civilian industrial base. China has also cooperated with Russia, Iran, North Korea, and other countries to develop greater military, intelligence, and dual-use capabilities that will complicate U.S. military and intelligence activities overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This analysis focuses on one specific area of competition: actions and capabilities below the threshold of conventional warfare, or what this analysis refers to as irregular warfare. As used here, irregular warfare refers to activities short of conventional and nuclear warfare that are designed to expand a country’s influence and legitimacy. These activities include information operations, cyber operations, support to state and non-state partners, covert action, and economic coercion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better understand the changing dynamics of great power competition and the implications for irregular warfare, this analysis asks several questions: How might U.S. adversaries evolve their capabilities in ways that impact the United States’ ability to conduct irregular warfare? What types of missions might U.S. military and intelligence units be asked to conduct, and what types of commercial capabilities will likely be required to conduct these missions? How can military forces and intelligence better leverage the commercial sector to develop and implement these capabilities?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In answering these questions, this analysis makes two main arguments. First, the United States is not adequately prepared for the evolving nature of irregular warfare. China, Russia, Iran, and other states are developing conventional and irregular capabilities that present serious challenges—and opportunities—for intelligence, special operations, and other military forces across the globe. U.S. military and intelligence units will require disruptive capabilities in multiple areas where the commercial sector has a comparative advantage: battlefield awareness; next-generation intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; unmanned and autonomous systems; influence operations; placement and access; and precision effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the U.S. military and intelligence communities need to fundamentally change the way they work with the commercial sector in order to compete more effectively in irregular warfare—both on offense and defense. Commercial innovation and production capacity in the commercial sector provides a major advantage for the United States and its allies and partners in irregular warfare, including for Title 10 and 50 activities. But the United States has not adequately leveraged these innovations because of risk aversion, slow and burdensome contracting and acquisitions regulations, and a failure to adequately understand viable options in the commercial sector. There is a significant need to rethink the framework of government collaboration with this sector and to treat commercial entities as partners serving a common goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of this analysis is divided into four sections. The first examines the growing importance of irregular warfare and some of the associated missions and capabilities. The second section argues that U.S. adversaries, such as China and Russia, possess significant capabilities that will likely pose challenges for U.S. military and intelligence operatives. The third section highlights the growing importance of the commercial sector to the development of innovative capabilities for competition in irregular warfare. And the fourth highlights challenges and opportunities for military and intelligence in irregular warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;irregular-warfare-in-great-power-competition&quot;&gt;Irregular Warfare in Great Power Competition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irregular warfare will likely be a major area of competition between the United States and China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, and other countries. It is critical for the United States to build conventional and nuclear capabilities to deter adversaries and—if deterrence fails—fight and win wars. But the financial, political, and military costs of conventional and nuclear war among major powers are high. During the Cold War, the most frequent type of competition between the Soviet Union and the United States was irregular warfare, as the two sides fought proxy wars in Latin America, Africa, Asia, and Europe. The same may be true over the next several years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irregular warfare involves activities short of conventional and nuclear warfare that are designed to expand a country’s influence and legitimacy, as well as coerce, deter, or weaken adversaries. It includes numerous tools of statecraft that governments can use to shift the balance of power in their favor without resorting to conventional conflict:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Information and influence operations, including public diplomacy and psychological warfare&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cyber operations, including offensive cyber operations&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Training, advice, and other assistance to state and non-state partners&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Covert action&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Economic coercion&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government officials and scholars have used different terms—such as political warfare, hybrid warfare, gray zone activity, asymmetric conflict, and the indirect approach—to capture some or all of these actions. Some might object to the term “warfare” to describe activities like economic coercion and information operations, but that is not how the United States’ competitors see it. China has used terms like “three warfares” (三战), which involves public opinion, legal, and psychological warfare—none of which include the direct use of violence. Iran has utilized such terms as “soft war” (جنگ نرم) to describe such activities as propaganda and information operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the increasingly competitive landscape, U.S. intelligence, special operations, and other military units are likely to conduct several types of missions as part of irregular warfare. The commercial sector plays—and should continue to play—an important role in helping to develop hardware and software capabilities in all of these areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foreign Internal Defense:&lt;/strong&gt; Build the capacity of foreign governments and their security and intelligence infrastructure. Examples include training, advising, assisting, accompanying, and equipping the military, law enforcement, and intelligence forces and institutions of partners.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unconventional Warfare:&lt;/strong&gt; Train, advise, assist, accompany, and equip non-state partners that are attempting to resist a hostile actor. Unconventional warfare can involve U.S. or partner forces working by, with, and through guerrillas, resistance organizations, militias, or other non-state organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information Operations:&lt;/strong&gt; Inform and influence foreign audiences or counter an adversary’s information, misinformation, and disinformation operations. Information and influence operations can be overt or covert. For U.S. military forces, including special operations forces, these types of missions generally come under the rubric of Military Information Support Operations (MISO).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Direct Action:&lt;/strong&gt; Strikes or other offensive actions employing specialized capabilities to seize, sabotage, destroy, capture, or recover designated targets. They can also include damaging or disrupting—or threatening to damage or disrupt—an adversary’s infrastructure, or weakening a foreign entity through individuals working secretly from within.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These missions can include overt and clandestine activities as well as covert action, as defined in 50 USC § 3093(e). There are other missions that military operations and intelligence units will need to perform, such as special reconnaissance, civil affairs operations, intelligence, crisis response, counterterrorism, counterproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, counterinsurgency, and hostage rescue and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These missions can include both defensive operations (protecting the United States and its partners from threats) and offensive operations (undermining an adversary’s power, influence, and legitimacy) as part of irregular warfare. Defensive operations generally involve developing resilient infrastructure, institutions, and systems that protect against adversary covert and overt activities. Offensive operations involve conducting missions that weaken China, Russia, Iran, and other adversaries—including within their homelands. Both defensive and offensive missions generally require the support of one or more allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on these missions, U.S. military and intelligence units will likely require capabilities in several areas where the commercial sector has a comparative advantage: battlefield awareness; placement and access; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; unmanned and autonomous systems; influence operations; and precision effects. In all of these areas, a growing number of commercial entities can work discretely in the field on a non-attribution basis, operate with flexibility and agility, deploy worldwide, and use secure communications systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Battlefield Awareness:&lt;/strong&gt; It is important to find and fix targets in contested environments and improve decisionmaking at the tactical level. Better technology from the commercial sector is necessary for developing sensors and fusing intelligence from multiple data sources to enhance the domain awareness of commanders engaging in irregular warfare at the tactical and operational levels. Better technology is also important to connecting warfighters and intelligence officers to manned and unmanned platforms and systems. Advances in AI could allow units in the field to simulate thousands of operational and tactical approaches, decreasing the time between preparation and execution of missions. In the cyber domain, this could mean integrating technology and tools to provide an open-architecture command system that is optimized for military and intelligence units deployed in the field. It could also mean leveraging open-source data to ensure forces can access timely, georectified, and accurate information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military and intelligence units need to continue to evolve their relationships with space organizations, such as the U.S. Space Force, to develop payloads that provide forces with space-based capabilities at the tactical level. In addition, military and intelligence units increasingly need redundant and secure communications; examples range from advancements in establishing a common operating picture to updated versions of combined joint all-domain command and control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Placement and Access:&lt;/strong&gt; In an increasingly competitive landscape, there will likely be a growing need to work with the commercial sector to modernize platforms in order to operate effectively in contested environments with partner forces. For example, existing aviation platforms need to be equipped with advanced infiltration and penetration capabilities, including terrain-following and terrain-avoidance radar. These capabilities provide rotary- and fixed-wing fleets with radio frequency countermeasures, including for MC-130 special mission aircraft. Other examples involve investing in modernized surface and subsurface maritime platforms, including unmanned and autonomous platforms. In addition, military and intelligence units will need to explore new types of fuel and power for vehicles, communications equipment, laptops that run backpack drones, and other equipment. Power is critical for intelligence. Miniaturized batteries can fuel communications or collections devices concealed in strategic locations. In addition, a push toward more unmanned systems with longer loitering requirements will require high-performance batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance:&lt;/strong&gt; There is a growing need to improve next-generation intelligence platforms, systems, and software that can quickly collect and analyze vast amounts of information on adversary activities for irregular warfare. Adversaries will likely attempt to hide their actions in a variety of terrains, from jungles and mountains to dense forests, subsurface locations, and tightly packed megacities. They will also attempt to use denial and deception tactics and techniques. These challenges will require overcoming the tyrannies of distance (operating over a significant area) and time (reacting quickly when necessary).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the help of the commercial sector, next-generation intelligence, reconnaissance, and surveillance systems and platforms should be designed to conduct long-range and long-endurance missions at high and low altitudes, often quickly. Systems and platforms also need to provide over-the-horizon detection, identification, and location of radar and communications signals. Figures 1a and 1b show satellite imagery analysis of a Russian private military company in Bamako, Mali, working with the Russian Ministry of Defense. The figures show an expansion of infrastructure, including new barracks, headquarters and administration buildings, revetment walls, and guard positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9sNL5yH.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/FlJ9tEV.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several types of commercial technologies that may be important for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions as part of irregular warfare. One is quantum technology, which can potentially break asymmetric encryption and allow the use of navigation systems that can operate in GPS-denied environments. Another is improved space-based technologies, including on-orbit refueling and on-orbit data processing. Hyperspectral and other sensors mounted on satellites could help identify important intelligence using AI and then downlink quickly to a ground-based network. More broadly, advances in AI will help analysts and warfighters scan data from a variety of sources, process it, provide indications and warning, and manage a multilayered battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unmanned and Autonomous Systems:&lt;/strong&gt; Collaborative and autonomous unmanned air, surface, subsurface, and land-based platforms produced by the commercial sector will be important for strike, intelligence, logistics, and other missions operating for longer periods of time, including inside anti-access and area-denial environments. These platforms offer some advantages over traditional irregular warfare weapons: they can be smaller and cheaper, offer unmatched surveillance capabilities, and reduce the risk to soldiers. For example, a special operations or covert intelligence unit could utilize an autonomous submarine that could quickly move supplies into contested waters or an autonomous truck that could potentially find the ideal route to carry weapons across dangerous terrain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, robots will likely provide support for logistics and sustainment operations. Ground robots, for instance, may increase the ability of units to engage in reconnaissance, conduct direct attacks, map battlefields, predict points of attack, evacuate wounded soldiers, and clear minefields. Unmanned systems may carry heavy equipment (like powerful batteries), explore disaster sites, and conduct battle damage assessments. Many jobs that are too strenuous or too dangerous for a soldier could become the responsibility of robots. In densely packed urban terrain, military and intelligence units may need to deploy small, maneuverable robots and drones—including swarms of drones—that are guided by algorithms and can process visual data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technological advances will also be important to counter unmanned air, surface, subsurface, and ground systems, including at relatively low costs. Improvements in electronic warfare to jam targeting and navigation systems can complicate efforts to counter unmanned systems. After all, several U.S. adversaries have achieved what some have called “precise mass,” or the ability to combine mass and precision. Military and intelligence units need to find ways to minimize the effects of large volumes of unmanned and manned systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Influence Operations:&lt;/strong&gt; Military operations and intelligence units will likely need to develop greater capabilities to compete in the information space, including for such activities as covert influence and counter-value operations (targeting an adversary’s civilian population). In cooperation with the commercial sector, AI and large language models have significant potential for irregular warfare applications. AI translation and message crafting can provide government officials with the ability to rapidly communicate in any language with anyone in the world. Advances in natural language processing will accelerate intelligence work, helping analysts to sort through reams of text and drawing connections a human brain might not notice. AI will be able to review terabytes of data for influence operations, including tipping and cueing for additional collection or human review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Precision Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States historically enjoyed an advantage in precision strike capabilities, thanks in part to the “second offset” from the late 1970s through the 1980s. But several countries—including China and Russia—have made significant improvements because of advancements in conventional munitions, sensors, and guidance systems. To keep up, military and intelligence units will likely need to improve precision-strike platforms that are scalable and, in some cases, “attritable”—meaning that their low cost makes losing any one system of little consequence. Examples include kinetic fires, cyber capabilities, and electromagnetic effects for striking targets or countering unmanned systems. Other examples include improvements in directed energy, including for electronic warfare and electronic attack. In addition, AI models may be increasingly useful in helping warfighters predict where to strike, as has occurred to some degree in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advances in bioengineering can also improve precision effects. The capabilities of CRISPR Cas-9—a technology that allows scientists to modify genetic material such as DNA—have created new possibilities. While scalability will be initially challenging, bioengineering can be used to create energetic materials such as explosives, plasticizers, and binders. New synthetic biological compounds can be helpful in creating stronger polymers for more effective protective gear, such as high-temperature composites, fire-resistant materials, coatings, fibers, fabrics, adhesives, and armor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are only a few potential areas in which the commercial sector can play a valuable role in research, development, and production for irregular warfare missions. Several other types of emerging technology—such as alternative power systems, hyperscale and edge computing and processing, alternative energy, digital signal processing, and additive manufacturing—may also be helpful for future missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-coalition-of-adversaries-military-civil-fusion&quot;&gt;A Coalition of Adversaries: Military-Civil Fusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, and other countries are developing capabilities and conducting activities that will increasingly impact the United States’ ability to conduct irregular warfare around the globe. China presents the most serious threat and has established a program of military-civil fusion—what some Chinese leaders have referred to as “national strategic integration”—that involves developing, producing, and acquiring dual-use technology for military purposes and strengthening the country’s national defense–related science and technology capabilities. In many ways, the concept of military-civil fusion is not new for China. Every leader since Mao has outlined the need to leverage commercial capabilities to support the PLA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Xi Jinping has elevated the concept of military-civil fusion as essential to developing military power. Military-civil fusion is motivated by the reality that the commercial sector is responsible for creating society’s most transformative technologies. It dovetails with such Chinese concepts as “intelligentized warfare,” which involves the use of AI, quantum computing, big data, and other advanced technologies at multiple levels of warfare. Military-civil fusion includes several efforts designed to amalgamate China’s commercial and defense industrial bases, which range from better integrating science and technology innovations to developing talent that is useful for both civilian and military purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Strengthen China’s national defense mobilization system to include relevant aspects of its society and economy for use in competition and war.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, China is developing capabilities—including AI, quantum computing, synthetic biology, automation, and new energy—that could make it difficult for the United States and its partners to conduct irregular warfare and operate in contested environments. Beijing has already deployed AI-powered surveillance and electronic warfare systems, and it has used AI and big data to enhance information operations such as deepfakes. Several Chinese government institutions—as well as companies such as Baidu, Alibaba, and Huawei—continue to develop generative AI technologies for text, image, audio, and video creation. In January 2025, the Chinese AI company DeepSeek launched an AI model called R1 at a fraction of the cost of U.S. companies and apparently using less-advanced chips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In cooperation with its commercial sector, China is developing an operational concept of “multi-domain precision warfare” that incorporates big data and AI into a broader command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) network. While China has made some technological advances because of espionage, Chinese companies have also been innovative in the research, development, and production of some emerging technologies, including AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is also making significant advancements in its cyber, space, air, maritime, and ground capabilities that will likely impact the United States’ ability to conduct irregular warfare. For example, China considers information operations an important way to achieve superiority early in a conflict as part of a broader strategy of “informatization.” For China, informatized warfare is the utilization of information technology—such as large language models—to establish a system that enables the PLA to acquire, transmit, and use information during a conflict to conduct integrated joint military operations. For example, senior researchers at PLA institutions have used the U.S. company Meta’s open-source Llama model to develop an AI tool for information operations. China is also exploring other capabilities, as a PLA Daily article summarized:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Compared with traditional models, ChatGPT applications can efficiently generate massive amounts of false news, false pictures, and even false videos to confuse the audience. They can even use the power of the platform to covertly output values through information products, influence the value orientation of the people of other countries, subtly interfere with the cognition of the other people, and guide their public opinion. Compared with humans, the information generation capabilities of large model technology applications have huge advantages in both quantity and time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, China is developing substantial space-based capabilities that could impact U.S. military and intelligence operatives overseas engaged in irregular warfare. In 2023 alone, China conducted 67 space launches—the most in its history. Working with its commercial sector, China is pushing forward in such areas as Long March rockets, global navigation satellite systems, satellite communications, missile warning, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. China continues to develop its counterspace capabilities. It has fielded jamming and directed-energy systems, demonstrated direct-ascent anti-satellite capabilities, and tested technologies relevant to on-orbit counterspace weapons systems. The PLA maintains both fixed and mobile electronic warfare systems that could interfere with satellite communications links, global navigation satellite system signals, and synthetic aperture radar intelligence-gathering satellites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is likely to use these and other capabilities to engage in offensive irregular campaigns designed to expand China’s power and influence across the globe, not just in the Indo-Pacific. As Xi Jinping has outlined, China must “adopt an asymmetrical strategy of catching up and overtaking” the United States and the West. China has multiple organizations that can conduct irregular warfare, such as PLA special operations forces, the Cyberspace Force, the Ministry of State Security, the Ministry of Public Security, the People’s Armed Police, the China Coast Guard, and the China Maritime Militia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/vBAWsP7.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next several years, Chinese actions will likely include offensive cyber operations, information and disinformation campaigns, economic coercion (including through the Belt and Road Initiative, the Digital Silk Road, and the Green Silk Road), and espionage against U.S. and other Western government agencies and corporations. As part of the Digital Silk Road, China has worked with companies to develop next-generation cellular networks, fiber-optic cables, undersea cables, and data centers throughout the Global South. In addition, China has used irregular means to expand its footprint and basing access in East African countries (e.g., Djibouti), the South China Sea (e.g., the Spratly Islands), the Taiwan Strait, and other places (e.g., the Solomon Islands).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia also presents a serious threat for U.S. military and intelligence units, as it is developing a range of capabilities to conduct irregular warfare and complicate the ability of U.S. special operations, intelligence, and other military forces to operate across the globe. In cooperation with its commercial sector and with the help of China, Iran, North Korea, and other countries, Russia has improved its capabilities in such areas as electronic warfare, autonomous and unmanned systems, precision strike, air and missile defense, cyber capabilities, and space systems. For example, the Russian government has relied on close collaboration with several companies, such as ZALA Aero Group, to produce unmanned systems. Russia has also developed significant space and counterspace capabilities, including a nuclear anti-satellite capability. These capabilities could present a serious challenge to the United States and its partners, as Moscow exports them to other countries where U.S. and partner military and intelligence units operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, Russia’s Main Directorate (GRU), Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), private military companies, and other state and non-state organizations are likely to continue utilizing these and other capabilities to perpetrate aggressive irregular warfare campaigns in Europe and other regions. Examples include assassinations, sabotage operations, offensive cyber campaigns, disinformation operations, intelligence collection, and other clandestine activities. The GRU’s Service for Special Activities is likely to be particularly active, including Unit 29155 (also known as the 161 Center or, more formally, the 161 Intelligence Specialists Training Center), Unit 54654, and the GRU’s headquarters and planning department. Russia will also likely continue to wage a disinformation campaign against the United States, conduct offensive cyber campaigns against U.S. and Western government agencies and companies, and engage in a range of other activities such as assassinations and sabotage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran will continue to wage an aggressive irregular campaign against the United States and its allies and partners across the Middle East using a range of partner forces such as the Houthis in Yemen, Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas and other groups in the Palestinian territories, and the Popular Mobilization Forces in Iraq. Iranian companies, such as the state-owned corporations HESA and Shahed Aviation Industries, will likely continue to play an important role in the research, development, and production of weapons systems to conduct irregular warfare and to counter U.S. government agencies engaged in irregular warfare. In addition, Iranian government agencies, such as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and their non-state partners will likely improve their offensive cyber capabilities and their ability to conduct attacks against the United States and its allies and partners at home and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, and other states will likely continue to provide military, technological, and economic aid to each other; share tactics, techniques, and procedures; and proliferate capabilities in ways that threaten U.S. special operations, intelligence, and other U.S. government actions across the globe. Starting in 2022, for example, China provided substantial aid to Russia’s full-scale war in Ukraine, including semiconductors and microelectronics for use in Russian weapons systems, precision machine tools, titanium and magnesium alloys, spare parts, drones, and military contractors. Chinese companies such as Xiamen Limbach helped design and develop Russia’s Garpiya series long-range attack unmanned aerial vehicle, in collaboration with Russian defense firms like JSC Aerospace Defense Concern Almaz-Antey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran has exported drones (including the Shahed-136) to Russia, as well as artillery shells, ammunition, and short-range ballistic missiles. Russia has potentially supplied—or may supply—Iran with Yak-130 pilot training aircraft, Su-35 multirole fighter jets, Mi-28 attack helicopters, and S-400 air defense systems, as well as aid to Iran’s space and missile programs. In addition, Russia has provided Iran and some of its partners with intelligence and targeting support. Finally, North Korea has provided artillery rounds (including 152 mm and 122 mm rounds); soldiers; rockets; KN-23, KN-24, and KN-25 solid propellant, short-range ballistic missiles; and other defense materiel to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cooperation will likely strengthen all four countries’ respective capabilities in ways that complicate the actions of U.S. military (including special operations) and intelligence units. Table 2 summarizes some of the main types of military and dual-use cooperation that has occurred between Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/nhOKLDi.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;commercial-sector-advantages&quot;&gt;Commercial Sector Advantages&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commercial sector is a hub for innovation and presents a significant opportunity for providing irregular warfare capabilities to be used against these and other adversaries. During the Cold War, much of the defense-related funding for the private sector—including companies based in Silicon Valley and along Route 128 in Massachusetts—came from the Department of Defense, especially from such organizations as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But funding changed dramatically beginning in the late 2010s. Venture capital and private equity firms poured billions of dollars into start-ups and other defense companies that developed space and cyber capabilities, AI, quantum computing, autonomous platforms, and a wide array of other hardware and software. Not to be outdone, a growing list of technology companies—such as Microsoft, Amazon Web Services, and Google—also entered the defense market and developed cutting-edge technologies and systems essential for military power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The venture capital space has seen a high volume of activity. In 2013, venture capital firms secured 184 deals in defense technology for a total value of $1.9 billion. In 2021, there were 848 deals (nearly five times as many) for a total value of $40.5 billion (more than 21 times as much). By 2023, venture capital investments in defense technology totaled $35 billion from 627 deals. The primary investment areas included advanced computing and software ($3.7 billion); sensing, connectivity, and security ($3.7 billion); and space technology ($3.5 billion). All of these areas have applications in irregular warfare. The trend lines show a steady increase in the deal count and deal value of venture capital defense investment as firms have become increasingly willing to invest in space technology, autonomous platforms, and other areas with commercial and defense applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/NjL2Plu.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Venture capital firms such as Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Lux Capital, General Catalyst, Shield Capital, Accel Partners, Razor’s Edge Ventures, and Founders Fund have invested in defense and intelligence start-ups. In addition, several big defense contractors have created their own venture capital funds: Lockheed Martin launched Lockheed Martin Ventures, and Raytheon established Raytheon Ventures. Some venture capital investments have been successful, such as SpaceX (which produces advanced rockets and spacecraft), Palantir (software), Anduril (autonomous platforms and advanced technology), Shield AI (AI-powered systems and technology), HawkEye 360 (geospatial analytics), Skydio (drones), Rebellion Defense (advanced software powered by AI and other emerging technology), and Epirus (electronic warfare and advanced electronics).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Europe, the European Investment Fund agreed to provide €175 million (approximately $182 million) to venture capital and private equity funds that invest in European companies conducting research and development of innovative technologies with both defense and commercial applications. The European Commission also launched a €95.5 billion (approximately $100 billion) Horizon Europe program to support companies conducting research and development on dual-use technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet venture capital is not the only area in which the private sector has made defense investments. Private equity is another. The modern private equity industry developed in the late 1970s and was pioneered by New York–based investment company Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp;amp; Company, or KKR. Unlike venture capital funds, which focus on start-ups, private equity firms raise funds from financial institutions, pension funds, insurance companies, endowments, and wealthy individuals to acquire and then sell established companies. Before 2000, private equity firms were relatively uninterested in the defense market, as they correctly perceived it as a closed shop dominated by a small number of defense primes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 2010s, however, private equity acquisitions of defense and intelligence firms significantly increased. Between 2004 and 2009, there was an average of 67 deals per year. But it doubled over the next decade, averaging 120 deals per year between 2015 and 2021. Investors also went after larger defense companies. Prior to 2010, private equity firms generally bought small or midsize defense companies. By 2021, however, firms were involved in deals for companies of all sizes. The median size of a deal in 2000 was $50 million; by 2021, that had jumped to nearly $350 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private equity firms gobbled up companies in such sectors as cyber, intelligence, additive manufacturing, defense electronics, space, drones, and sensors. Private equity firms remained active in the defense sector through 2025, including by acquiring companies that produced “disruptive” technologies (innovations that might change the way militaries operate) such as unmanned systems, AI, quantum computing, cyber, and hypersonics. Examples of private equity firms in the defense sector included Arlington Capital Partners, Carlyle Group, Cerberus Capital Management, McNally Capital, Stellex Capital Management, and Veritas Capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;challenges-and-opportunities&quot;&gt;Challenges and Opportunities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The budding commercial sector in the United States and other countries provides enormous opportunities for U.S. government agencies engaged in irregular warfare. Such organizations as In-Q-Tel and the Defense Innovation Unit have improved the government’s connection to the commercial sector. But there are still significant barriers to cooperation. This section identifies several challenges and opportunities for military and intelligence to more effectively work with the private sector on irregular warfare capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better Understanding the Commercial Sector:&lt;/strong&gt; There is still a lack of awareness and expertise among general officers, warfighters, and intelligence personnel about the types of capabilities and technologies that are available to help conduct irregular warfare. Indeed, military and intelligence leaders typically have a much better understanding of emerging technology and commercial sector opportunities after they retire. Some events—such as SOF Week, held each year in Tampa, Florida—have brought together special operations forces and the private sector. But more needs to be done. Military and intelligence leaders need to interact more routinely with industry leaders to better understand commercial sector innovations and communicate government needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One possible solution is to increase the opportunity for military and intelligence personnel to conduct “externships” with the private sector. Externships are typically short-term fellowships with companies for the purpose of better understanding commercial capabilities and practices. U.S. military services and the intelligence community have established fellowship programs with think tanks and academic institutions to improve their research, analytical, strategy, leadership, and critical-thinking skills. But externships with commercial companies are less common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another option to improve partnerships between the government and commercial sector is to establish or augment programs that help transition soldiers and intelligence operators from government service to the private sector. For example, SkillBridge is a Department of Defense program that gives service members the opportunity to conduct training, apprenticeships, and internships during the last 180 days of their military service. Retired military and intelligence personnel in the commercial sector can be critical conduits for the government. In addition, military and intelligence organizations should better leverage a range of organizations—such as the Defense Innovation Unit, In-Q-Tel, the CIA Transnational and Technology Mission Center, and the Office of Strategic Capital—that have established close connections with the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimizing Risk Aversion:&lt;/strong&gt; There is still far too much risk aversion in military and intelligence cultures regarding cooperation with the commercial sector. In some cases, government policies and regulations make it difficult for government personnel to meet with the commercial sector to better understand innovations and communicate government needs. Government lawyers are sometimes overly restrictive in allowing interaction with the commercial sector or have unnecessarily high barriers to taking even informational briefings from the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military and intelligence organizations at the Pentagon, CIA headquarters, and out in the field should reexamine and reevaluate their policies and procedures to distinguish between legal requirements and outdated policy impediments. General officers, flag officers, and senior intelligence service personnel should establish a culture that allows lower-level staff, where appropriate and legal, to better identify and understand emerging capabilities in the technology sector in such areas as battlefield awareness; placement and access; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; unmanned and autonomous systems; influence operations; and precision effects. Developing a strategy to promote leaders—and future leaders—who are willing to take calculated risks to understand emerging technologies is necessary to foster innovation and adaptability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conducting More Offensive Operations:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States needs to work more closely with the commercial sector to develop capabilities to wage offensive information operations against China, Russia, Iran, and other countries in ways that are consistent with U.S. laws and democratic ideals. Democracy, a free press, and open access to information are threats to authoritarian regimes. Their political systems and attempts to control access to information—including through state-run media—make them vulnerable to U.S. and Western information campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By leveraging commercial technologies, the United States and its partners should target the domestic populations of China, Russia, Iran, and other countries through covert, clandestine, and overt means, where appropriate. The commercial sector can be helpful in developing and utilizing AI, large language models, and software that directs information to specific audiences that Beijing, Moscow, Tehran, and other regimes are attempting to control. Offensive information operations could focus on a range of issues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Domestic grievances and societal divisions. Anti-regime riots, protests, and demonstrations highlight the weakness of the regimes in China, Russia, and Iran. All three of these countries have faced—and will likely face—protests from their local populations because of economic, political, cultural, health, and other grievances.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Human rights abuses, including the arrest, torture, and assassination of defectors, political opponents, and those investigating or prosecuting corruption and human rights abuses (such as journalists and lawyers).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Problems with regional economic campaigns—such as China’s Belt and Road Initiative—that sometimes place exorbitant debt on countries. Beijing, for instance, often relies on Chinese labor and companies overseas rather than on local workers and local companies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Corruption and cheating scandals, which are pervasive in China, Russia, and Iran. In China, for example, PLA officers have frequently paid bribes to get promoted. China’s defense industrial base has also been plagued by corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Economic problems, including high unemployment (particularly youth unemployment), rising government debt, low growth, high inflation, and massive income disparity, all of which these regimes may—and already do—try to hide from their populations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Espionage and clandestine influence overseas, including at universities, corporations, and government agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Cold War, irregular warfare involved taking risks. In some cases, as with the CIA’s covert action program to support Solidarity in the 1980s (codenamed QRHELPFUL), those risks paid off by weakening the Soviet Union and its partners. But in other cases significant mistakes were made, such as when U.S. officials during the Reagan administration illegally sold arms to Iran and used the proceeds to fund the Contras in Nicaragua.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of these risks, some officials will strongly resist engaging in offensive irregular warfare. But this would be a mistake. While it is important to weigh the pros and cons of specific actions, the United States would never have succeeded in undermining Soviet power and influence without taking risks that exploited Soviet vulnerabilities. The United States needs to be more risk-acceptant in conducting offensive information and other operations against China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, and other countries as part of irregular warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Streamlining Acquisition and Contracting:&lt;/strong&gt; Another challenge to working with the commercial sector is the acquisition process, which can be too slow, inflexible, and risk-averse. As one U.S. Department of Defense study bluntly warned, “Major defense programs continue to take ten years or more to deliver less capability than planned, often at two to three times the planned cost.” A 2024 Government Accountability Office study that reviewed 108 defense acquisition programs concluded that the Department of Defense “remains alarmingly slow in delivering new and innovative weapon system capabilities, even as national security threats continue to evolve.” While this prolonged schedule might be fine in peacetime, it is not sufficient for a wartime environment. Companies looking to deal with the Department of Defense too often must comply with the dizzying Federal Acquisition Regulation, or FAR, which includes rules regarding government procurement. They must also deal with the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), which includes rules and regulations established by the Department of Defense to ensure that contractors and subcontractors follow specific cybersecurity best practices to protect sensitive information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is no wonder that numerous companies in the commercial sector, including venture capital and private equity firms, have shied away from the defense sector. Many want to work with the Department of Defense or the U.S. intelligence community but have little interest in trekking through a byzantine contracting and acquisition system and are deterred by the heavy regulatory burden and limited financial upside. These companies often support the government’s mission and are patriotic, but they have little patience for a contracting and acquisition process that takes too long, is far too uncertain, and remains maddeningly opaque.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many are also concerned about the “Valley of Death,” a phenomenon faced by start-ups trying to do business with the Department of Defense. The Valley of Death refers to the precarious journey in which a company transitions from a prototype or commercially available product to a Department of Defense contract. Many start-ups trying to do business with the Pentagon never make it from prototype to contract because of the mismatch in timelines between raising capital and securing a contract. Start-ups typically raise venture funding on timelines of one to two years, while the Defense Department often operates on an acquisition cycle of three to five years. A few, such as Palantir and Anduril, have succeeded, but many fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commercial companies are also concerned that the Department of Defense will attempt to seize their intellectual property. Trae Stephens, one of Anduril’s founders, once quipped that far too often, the department asks companies to “turn over your source code.” He continued, “It’s crazy. We’re literally doing to our companies in America what we’re criticizing the Chinese for doing to their companies and to our companies when we enter that market.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outcome of such a convoluted contracting and acquisition process is that companies with broad commercial interests and expertise have not—yet—received significant Department of Defense funding, despite the explosion of venture capital and private equity investment. Companies with little or no commercial business accounted for 61 percent of the Department of Defense’s major programs by value in 2024—a major increase from 6 percent at the end of the Cold War. If one includes companies whose only commercial business was in aerospace, such as Boeing or Textron, the percentage jumped to 86 percent. That means that only 14 percent of the Department of Defense’s major programs went to commercial companies that served defense and other markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A defense industry operating in a wartime environment requires contracting and acquisitions processes that are faster, more flexible, and less risk-averse. The Department of Defense needs to cut the timelines for rewarding contracts using such options as Other Transaction Authorities, Rapid Acquisition Authority, and the Defense Production Act. Innovation generally occurs because of a synergy between the government and the commercial sector, making it important to find ways for imaginative commercial sector firms to more easily sell to the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improving Collaboration with Allies and Partners:&lt;/strong&gt; Throughout the history of the U.S. defense industrial base, allies and partners have played an important role in developing and buying military capabilities. As the 2024 U.S. Defense Innovation Board concluded:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Since World War II, the United States’ network of allies and partners has stood as the cornerstone of our global strength and the envy of our adversaries. . . . Yet, the Department of Defense (DoD) is failing to fully integrate allies and partners into a networked defense industrial base, and to modernize the concepts, systems, and processes that enable these relationships to flourish.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cooperation with allies and partners is particularly important for irregular warfare because of advances in defense-related hardware and software, such as AI, machine learning, quantum computing, autonomous systems, large language models, biotechnology, directed energy, electronic warfare, and other systems. U.S. allies in Europe and Asia have significant capabilities. Allies and partners also possess raw materials that are critical for the defense sector, such as South Africa’s chromium, rhodium, and platinum, and Australia’s lithium and zirconium. The reality is that modern weapons systems are products of a globalized market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States needs to facilitate technology sharing and defense exports to allies and partners through foreign military sales, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, and other processes and procedures. For foreign military sales, the Department of Defense should develop a more efficient review process for releasing technology, provide allies and partner nations with relevant priority capabilities, accelerate acquisition and contracting support, and ensure broad U.S. government support to improve the sales process. For technology cooperation, the United States should encourage more co-development, co-production, co-sustainment, and other arrangements with allies and partners. There have been several recent examples of co-production with allies and partners, such as the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) with Poland, the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) and the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) with Australia, the Naval Strike Missile with Norway, and the SM-6 components and Tomahawks with Japan and Australia. But these examples are the exception rather than the rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China, Russia, Iran, and other U.S. adversaries are developing capabilities that pose a growing threat to U.S. military forces and intelligence units below the threshold of conventional war. Indeed, irregular warfare will likely become an increasingly significant aspect of great power competition. Eric Schmidt, chair of the Special Competitive Studies Project and former CEO and chair of Google, warned that the United States is not adequately prepared for this future environment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The U.S. government will have to overcome its stultified bureaucratic impulses, create favorable conditions for innovation, and invest in the tools and talent needed to kick-start the virtuous cycle of technological advancement. It needs to commit itself to promoting innovation in the service of the country and in the service of democracy. At stake is nothing less than the future of free societies, open markets, democratic government, and the broader world order.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these challenges, there are opportunities. The commercial sector has substantial capabilities that can help the U.S. military and intelligence community more effectively conduct irregular warfare. Innovative companies give the United States and its partners a significant advantage over China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, and other countries in such areas as battlefield awareness, unmanned systems, influence operations, placement and access, precision effects, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As President Franklin D. Roosevelt explained in his fireside chat to the United States on December 29, 1940, a year before Pearl Harbor, the “American industrial genius, unmatched throughout all the world in the solution of production problems, has been called upon to bring its resources and its talents into action.” It is much the same today. The commercial sector is an important part of America’s “arsenal of democracy.” It needs to play that role again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The electrification of the battlefield to the point where every soldier carries electronic equipment has greatly improved the ability to coordinate land formations and situational awareness, and therefore the tempo and lethality of land forces. This has also created a pervasive presence within and dependency on the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS). A force’s competence in manoeuvring in the EMS and its ability to disrupt or deny enemy manoeuvre in the EMS are therefore determining factors in its competitiveness. This means that electronic warfare (EW) has shifted from being a niche force multiplier to become an all-arms concern. This paper outlines what has changed in EW operations and assesses how this should impact force design within NATO militaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EW performs three critical functions for the force:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electronic surveillance&lt;/strong&gt; allows the force to detect and track adversaries, understand friendly vulnerabilities, and collect and analyse adversary waveforms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electronic attack&lt;/strong&gt; can jam enemy communications and navigation, inflict permanent damage on enemy electronics, or provide a vector for the delivery of cyber payloads to corrupt adversary networks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electronic defence&lt;/strong&gt; disrupts enemy kill chains and interferes with enemy munitions to protect the force from precision strike. Capabilities for all three functions are now needed, covering all echelons.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the manner in which EW effects are fielded is changing in three ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;digitisation&lt;/strong&gt; of the battlefield reduces the requirement for bespoke EW systems, as EW software-defined radios (EWSDRs) can be programmed to perform a wide range of EW tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;miniaturisation&lt;/strong&gt; of EW systems (and of the batteries supporting them) allows these capabilities to be fielded much more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Algorithmic warfare&lt;/strong&gt; allows for the mass generation of bespoke EW payloads, reducing the power required for a given effect.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dealing with these changes is not an abstract question related to a notional future battlefield, but instead applies to the capabilities that are necessary to remain survivable today: in Ukraine, for example, EW has become a company-level asset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;preparing-the-british-army&quot;&gt;Preparing the British Army&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the British Army is to prepare effectively for the evolving threat landscape that these EW changes will bring, several measures are necessary:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Education on the EMS should be delivered to all arms. The key is not to make every soldier an EW operator, but rather to make all arms spectrum-aware, and to ensure that tactical commanders understand electromagnetic principles well enough to have conversations about planning and deconfliction with EW specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Training must allow for EW capabilities to be used routinely, so that soldiers become familiar with the procedures for identifying that they are under electronic attack and for resolving the ensuing frictions. Troops also need to be surveyed in the EMS by friendly EW teams so that they can learn how their electronic signatures appear to the adversary. In order to apply effects without revealing capabilities to the adversary, it may be necessary for some elements of EW to be applied in synthetic environments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A programme should be established for procuring EW equipment to make the capability available at echelon. At its most basic, this means providing EWSDRs and associated receive/transmit antennas at a rough density of one per platoon. This would be overly costly if attempted for the whole force, but should be rolled out brigade by brigade over time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Investing in the EW capability also requires a means of visualising the EMS within mission planning software so that battlespace management of EW effects can be brought down to the brigade and battalion level. There is an architecture and software requirement here, but also training of commanders in how to properly employ and command EW troops will be necessary. Furthermore, there is a need to examine the scaling of EW specialist signallers within existing formations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Land forces must understand EW in the context of the joint force, and plan and train to: receive effects from space, air and maritime forces; help deliver effects for cyber forces; contribute effects in support of air and maritime forces; and suppress enemy space-based capabilities. This joint awareness requires closer collaboration between the Air, Land and Maritime Warfare Centres to ensure the development of joint tactics and the representation of other domains in domain-specific exercises. Failure to implement these measures will see the force cede its competitiveness to adversaries that are investing heavily in EW as an effective counter to legacy NATO advantages of coordination and precision.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Excalibur precision artillery rounds were first deployed in Ukraine, they hit their intended target 70% of the time, with misreported coordinates by those calling for fire largely responsible for the 30% that missed. By August 2023, at the height of Ukraine’s offensive aimed at liberating its occupied territories, just 6% of Excalibur rounds landed on target. The cause of this precipitous decline in effectiveness was Russian electronic warfare (EW).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EW has been a key tool in warfare for more than a century. However, for most of this period the primary task of EW units within land forces has been the detection and interception of enemy communications. Although contemporary Russian forces have placed an emphasis on jamming as an enabler of manoeuvre, this activity has historically been confined to the denial of fixed bands of the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) for short periods, over a defined area. Generally, EW operators have been specialist force multipliers, with functions obscure to the majority of the force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the vast majority of military systems, down to those carried by the individual soldier, are electronically powered, while most modern force multipliers depend on the EMS. As forces become more integrated, they also become more vulnerable to electromagnetic interference, whether from the enemy or from friends. Mastery of EW determines a force’s efficiency and its cohesion at every echelon. While exquisite EW effects remain sensitive and specialist capabilities, EW is nevertheless the business of the whole force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper discusses how EW has evolved, its impact on modern land operations, and how it should be integrated into combined arms operations in the land domain by NATO forces. The paper is based on observations of the effects of EW between 2021 and 2024 in Ukraine, in Israel and on exercises in the US and elsewhere, as well as on interviews with engineers in communications companies and government laboratories, and with operators across several states, including the UK, the US, Ukraine, Israel, Finland, Norway, Sweden and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exact capabilities of specific EW systems remain highly sensitive, but the principles of what is possible are not. Moreover, as EW has become an intrinsic part of all combined arms operations, rather than a discrete force multiplier, it has become vital that its principles are more widely understood, so that it can be integrated into operations by non-specialists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;structure-and-focus&quot;&gt;Structure and Focus&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper is divided into three parts. As the paper is written for a non-EW-specialist military audience, Chapter I considers the principles of EW and how they relate to contemporary military operations. Chapter II examines what has changed about EW, and what is likely to become possible in the medium term, while Chapter III discusses how the force can best integrate these emerging capabilities into its structure – and the challenges this will create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The focus in this paper is the employment of EW by land forces. NATO air forces and navies are extensive users of EW, and their systems are already far in advance of what is generally fielded by land forces. However, these capabilities are hard to replicate for land forces, as aircraft and ships have access to power levels and angles of alignment, and can carry antennas. EW must be utilised differently in the land domain, and this paper is solely concerned with that domain. The impact of modern EW in the air and at sea, as well as in space, is a worthy subject of study, but is better dealt with separately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a separate question about how naval and air EW can support land operations, and how land EW can support operations across the other warfighting domains. The authors address this in a range of other studies relating to joint approaches to operational problems, but it is worth emphasising that, to be able to implement the approaches discussed in these studies, each domain must have its own robust EW capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-the-principles-of-ew&quot;&gt;I. The Principles of EW&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before discussing how EW is evolving and its impact on modern military operations, it is necessary to briefly describe the core principles of how EW works. This chapter discusses the electromagnetic environment (EME), which constitutes the EW battlespace, how effects move through this environment, the military functions of EW, and the principles of their coordination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-electromagnetic-environment&quot;&gt;The Electromagnetic Environment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EME comprises the distribution of electromagnetic energy that is transmitted across the full spectrum of frequencies, within a geographic area. For the purposes of this paper, the discussion is primarily concerned with radio frequencies and not the bands of the spectrum containing infrared, visible and ultraviolet light, X-rays and gamma-rays. There is always a level of background electromagnetic activity and radiation, and this varies in intensity and saturation from place to place. Natural electromagnetic energy includes the Earth’s magnetic field and the build-up of electrical charge in the atmosphere that becomes observable in lightning. Solar flares cause significant electromagnetic energy that affects the portion of the Earth facing the sun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to natural electromagnetic energy, other emissions and fields are created by conducted energy resulting from human activity. For much of the 20th century, and across most of the world, such human-created emissions were limited. Moreover, most of these emissions were regular – radio stations, for instance, emitted at a specified frequency from known locations at a consistent level of power. In any given area, therefore, an electromagnetic survey would indicate which parts of the spectrum were occupied, and these surveys would remain reasonably accurate over a sustained period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several technologies have disrupted this state of affairs. First, the proliferation of satellite-based communication and navigation, alongside cellular communication, means that there is almost nowhere on Earth that remains unaffected by human-caused electromagnetic emissions. For example, the premise of global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) – satellite constellations that transmit signals to receivers in order to provide positioning, navigation and timing services – is that the constellation is sufficiently dense to enable a receiver on any part of the Earth’s surface to have line-of-sight to three to four satellites, thus allowing the position of the receiver to be triangulated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the emergence of digital (rather than analogue) hardware means that systems can be tuned to multiple, precise frequencies, allowing many more systems to broadcast and communicate at any given time within the same area. To use a musical analogy, the piano – which is an analogue device – has 88 keys, allowing for 12 notes to be played across seven octaves (with four additional notes). These notes comprise, in total, 52 tones and 36 semitones. However, a digital synthesiser can dynamically retune an electric piano to play a piece of music with quarter tones or octo-tones, such that – within the same number of octaves – it is possible to have hundreds of notes. Moreover, whereas adjusting the tuning of a normal piano would need to be done manually, key by key, digitisation allows software to rapidly retune devices in real time. Similarly, within a given band of the EMS – analogous to an octave – a digital system can distinguish between a far greater number of frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the miniaturisation of computing owing to the microelectronic revolution means that there are now far more devices that emit and receive electromagnetic frequencies, and which are portable. The result is that the EME is becoming far denser all over the world, with more frequencies being used at any given time. Moreover, increased portability enables more devices to move in and out of a given geography, so that the EME is becoming less constant, and, because digital systems can be adjusted rapidly, there is less consistency as to what is emitting on a given frequency. Digitisation also allows specialist equipment such as military frequency-hopping radios to be drastically more complex in the patterns of emissions that it can generate. As a result, not only is the EME becoming denser, but finding the military signal of interest is also becoming increasingly difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To effectively operate in the EME, therefore, it is necessary to understand which frequencies are being used, which are not, and what any given frequency is being used for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;frequency-alignment-and-power&quot;&gt;Frequency, Alignment and Power&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mechanisms of EW revolve around the frequency, alignment and power of emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using light – the visible spectrum – as an analogy, frequency is comparable to shades of colour. Each colour, such as red, yellow and blue, has a range of shades, from lighter to darker. Similarly, each frequency band in the EMS encompasses a range of individual frequencies, from higher to lower. Emissions occur on a given frequency and can be distinguished from one another. However, it can be difficult to distinguish frequencies that are extremely close to one another, and even harder to distinguish different emitters on the same frequency. For example, while it might be difficult to track one orange dot amid 49 red dots, it is even more complicated to distinguish a red dot in the middle of a field of 49 other red dots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alignment characterises the direction in which an emission is travelling. To continue the analogy with light, if a laser pointer is shone onto the surface of the eye from the side, it is likely to be merely annoying. If it is shone directly into the pupil, however, it may be painful and prevent the person from seeing much else. If the laser pointer is shone onto the back of the person’s head, they will not see it at all. Alignment, therefore, can enable communications devices that operate on the same frequency to distinguish between different messages, because a receiver pointing in one direction will not track an emission on the same frequency coming from outside of its field of regard. Conversely, careful alignment of emitters can also prevent some receivers from detecting the emission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The power of an electromagnetic emission determines both how far it travels before dissipating, and how a signal interacts with other emissions of the same frequency. To continue the above analogy, imagine two widely separated lights of the same colour being turned on in front of your eyes: one is a low-wattage bulb, and the other is a high-energy LED. Now picture them being brought closer together: the likelihood is that as the difference in spacing (alignment) between these two light sources diminishes, at some point the low-wattage bulb will become essentially invisible, while the more powerful light will remain visible (although there may be some reduction in the clarity with which it can be seen). Similarly, a more powerful emitter may render a weaker emission on the same bearing and frequency invisible (although the weaker emitter may reduce the clarity of the stronger emitter’s signal).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important consideration as regards power is that electromagnetic emissions constitute the transfer of electrical energy – the power of emissions can reach a level that saturates the capacity of a receiver. This phenomenon makes it possible to use an emission on a different frequency to prevent other frequencies being detected, or even to cause permanent damage to the receiver. A good analogy would be to consider what happens if you are exposed to extremely loud noise: it will prevent you from hearing any other noises, and it may be painful or even damage the eardrum. Similarly, high-power output on a given frequency can saturate or even damage a receiver, while lower-power emissions could still be pushing out energy, even if they are not readily perceived. A regular challenge in EW is to detect those faint signals of interest amid much louder signals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EW therefore involves the detecting and mapping of the frequency, alignment and power of emissions, and emitting in such a way as to interfere with enemy systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;surveillance-attack-and-defence&quot;&gt;Surveillance, Attack and Defence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The functions of EW can be divided into three broad categories: surveillance, attack, and defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surveillance involves surveying the EMS to detect emissions and thus inform friendly forces about who is communicating, where they are, and, in some cases, what is being said. Electronic surveillance can range from simple identification and direction finding to the mapping of enemy tactics, techniques and procedures, thus providing the ability to anticipate enemy actions by building up catalogues of indicators and warnings. Another, more sensitive, function of electronic surveillance is to gather the waveforms of specific enemy emissions in order to assess how target systems might be affected at a technical level. Finally, surveillance is used in signals intelligence collection, which comprises the detection, identification, geolocation, decryption and demodulation, recording and dissemination of signals of interest to relevant parties either in real time or slow time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electronic attack (EA) is the creation of emissions to attack enemy systems. The most basic EA function is jamming, which is achieved by saturating the receiver of a target system by emitting on a particular frequency band, thereby preventing intended messages from reaching the recipient. High-power EA can physically damage target systems by overloading a receiver with electrical energy (note too that distance has a significant impact on the effectiveness of jamming). Jamming of this kind can also be directed at systems like radar to effectively degrade what they can see. The effect of much EA is to reduce the distance at which a radar can read returns, rather than preventing the radar from doing so entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EA can also be undertaken to provoke enemy systems in ways that will facilitate their electronic surveillance by one’s own forces. For example, some communications systems will have reversionary modes, or will mask as another system but unmask if denied the use of the system they are pretending to be. EA can therefore be used to trigger behaviours in the target system that would not have been observable if there was no interference. Understanding the tactics, techniques and procedures of a target in response to jamming also strengthens the ability to identify, discriminate and track targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar but distinct from jamming is spoofing, whereby an emission is targeted at a receiver such that the recipient believes they are receiving a signal from a friendly system, when they are in fact receiving a corrupted signal from an unfriendly system. An example of this is GNSS spoofing. Because GNSSs are very low-power systems, it is possible to direct a higher-power message on the same frequency within an area, making it impossible for the receiver to distinguish between the unfriendly spoofer and one of the real satellite’s emissions. The spoofer can then send a bogus location and timestamp, so that the receiver triangulates its position using false bearings and is therefore spoofed into believing the satellite is in one location when in fact it is in another. Navigational interference of this nature can cause ships or aircraft to lose their way – or even crash – if they are wholly reliant on GNSSs for navigation, and can cause guided munitions to miss their targets. For this reason, ships, aircraft and precision-guided munitions often use additional navigation capabilities (such as inertial navigation systems) to reduce the severity of any ill-effects stemming from interference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More sophisticated forms of EA include protocol-based EA and EA-delivered cyber attack. Protocol-based EA directs emissions at a target that cause it to respond in a manner that is either inappropriate or damaging to the target. Again, a musical analogy can illustrate the difference between jamming or simple spoofing and protocol-based EA. If a pianist close to you plays the chord of C major at high volume while another pianist, further away, plays C minor, you are unlikely to hear the latter chord; this effect is akin to jamming. Now imagine that the more distant pianist is playing a sonata, and that someone suddenly bangs on the keys of the piano that is closer to you, producing a discordant noise. Most people would flinch at such a disturbing noise and automatically turn towards the source of the encroaching sound: the combination of surprise and discomfort at the discordant notes, disrupting the sonata, is a predictable response. A protocol-based EA endeavours to produce similarly predictable results in the technical workings of a system by directing particular waveforms at it. In the most severe cases, a protocol-based EA may cause a system to react in a way that is physically harmful. It can also allow a receiver to be jammed while using a much lower power level, just as the playing of the discordant note may cause the listener to lose their concentration and awareness of the progression of the sonata, even though the latter is still audible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EA-delivered cyber attack is different from protocol-based EA in that it is not concerned with how the system reacts to the signal, but is instead the transmission of a message, the contents of which constitute a cyber payload. An attacker spoofing a GNSS, for example, substitutes the GNSS signal with a different message. In contrast, an EA-delivered cyber attack might, for example, replace the triangulation equation with an adjusted one, so that the system would henceforth always “correct” the actual GNSS signal by a specified distance and direction, even after it was no longer being engaged by the EA system; this effect would last until the software was patched or refreshed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also possible to sequence protocol-based EA and a cyber attack. For example, imagine an enemy camera that is receiving instructions from and streaming video to an enemy command post. It is possible to use protocol-based EA to convince the camera that the signal being emitted to it is on its control frequency, but to then transmit a cyber payload that causes the camera to broadcast an inserted video clip on a loop, or to send back the same five seconds of recorded video again and again, so that the command post sees no change in the observed environment, masking what is really happening in front of the camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it is worth briefly discussing EA that is specifically intended to do physical harm to a target. For example, directed-energy weapons like high-power microwaves are designed to saturate receivers and electronics with electrical energy such that they burn out. These weapons have significant potential to target and damage unhardened targets, such as many classes of drone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mechanisms of electronic defence are no different from those of EA, but are conversely directed to the protection of friendly forces. Electronic surveillance, for example, becomes electronic defence when it is used to monitor friendly forces’ emissions and then to provide warnings about what those emissions are revealing to the enemy. Likewise, jamming enemy radar is a form of EA, but may be used to protect a friendly aircraft if the radar is trying to guide a ground-to-air missile, at which point it becomes electronic defence. Another form of electronic defence is to spoof or otherwise disrupt a munition or targeting system such that a strike misses friendly forces. The capabilities required for electronic defence are therefore the same as those needed for attack and surveillance, but the placement of the systems on the battlefield may differ, because they need alignment with different targets. The importance of electronic defence has been significantly amplified by the pervasive threat from UAVs, which depend significantly on the EMS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;manoeuvre-in-the-ems&quot;&gt;Manoeuvre in the EMS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EW is often prone to collateral damage and fratricide. As civilian systems have populated more of the spectrum, the availability of frequencies for military use that will not interfere with civilian systems has become very constrained. Ruining a popular radio station’s signal may not be particularly consequential, but interrupting emergency services communications has legal and humanitarian implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, urbanisation has created complex environments with uneven line of sight, such that systems without dense and fixed infrastructure often have very uneven coverage, complicating the support of communications for military forces. Another issue is that friendly forces use and depend on access to the EMS for their own communications, and since jammers will often be closer to friendly receivers than their targets, it is easy to accidentally collapse friendly networks. Navigational interference may provide electronic defence for a friendly headquarters, but it may also prevent communication by desynchronising the precision-timing function of cryptographic systems, effectively constituting a protocol-based EA on the headquarters. (This is because frequency-hopping requires precise timing between the radios in a network, so that all radios remain tuned to the correct frequency.) Navigational interference could also interfere with the calibration of guns, causing friendly artillery to be spoofed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Successful employment of EW requires careful battlespace management. Historically, this has been relatively simple, because there have been small numbers of EW troops, whose effects have often been tightly bounded. As the EMS becomes increasingly crowded, however, even just preventing friendly communications from interfering with one another is made increasingly challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further challenge to discrimination in the EMS is shadowing and exploitation of civilian networks. Militaries are increasingly employing civilian cellular communications as reversionary communications bearers. Conversely, non-state groups in Syria, for example, use civilian navigation systems to coordinate strikes on the basis that they assume Western forces derive too much benefit from the civilian network to countenance denying access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to manoeuvre in the EMS not only requires solid data and an up-to-date electromagnetic survey, but also demands that manoeuvre warfare officers sufficiently understand the principles of EW and EA outlined above. Only then can they determine when they will be dependent on different parts of the spectrum and make trade-off decisions between their command-and-control (C2) requirements, electronic defence requirements, and deconfliction obligations over different geographies and at different times during an operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-emerging-ew-capabilities&quot;&gt;II. Emerging EW Capabilities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than cyber payloads and protocol-based EA, all the principles described in chapter I were essentially in place at the end of the Cold War. Nevertheless, there have been significant developments in EW over the past decade that have transformed both how it can be used by land forces and what is needed to remain competitive in modern combat. This chapter outlines these developments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;integrated-sensing&quot;&gt;Integrated Sensing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fielding of software-defined radios (SDRs) throughout the battlefield offers the possibility to transform both electronic reconnaissance and the data gathering necessary for EA. SDRs are not just communications devices – they are miniaturised computers that can dynamically program emissions for a wide range of purposes, from communications to EW.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, EW baselines have comprised groups of specialist EW operators working across three locations to be able to triangulate their detections, while deploying dedicated EW equipment. EW baselines have also provided the opportunity for signals intelligence collection, although this has required each team to record frequencies and then share these recordings with their supporting intelligence and analytical structure. The limitations of this system are obvious: EW operators are a valuable and scarce resource, limiting the number of baselines that can be fielded. The Armed Forces of Ukraine, for example, spent most of 2022 and early 2023 having to field baselines of two EW positions, giving less precise locations of detected emissions, because they had insufficient personnel and equipment to maintain the optimal three per sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, SDRs, attached to appropriate antennas, can enable a wide range of military vehicles to be turned into baseline positions, integrating a large number of sensors. Whereas an analogue device is necessarily tuned to one frequency, to the exclusion of others, a software-defined communications system can receive on multiple frequencies, and, while translating one to sound or data for the user, can simultaneously log the detection, bearing and strength of the others and – if part of a networked system – transmit these detections in very small data packages. In this way, every unit potentially contributes to the EW baseline. Not every unit will be drawn on in practice; often, units will not be in a suitable position to fulfil this role. However, when units are occupying appropriate ground, the opportunity exists. The possibilities of using a widely distributed network of sensors are expanding even further as SDRs become ubiquitous on uncrewed aircraft systems (UAS) that overfly the frontline, allowing EW collection to be extended into the enemy battlespace in order to catch relatively low-power transmissions and to reduce constraints on what can be detected because of the alignment of emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The capacity to disperse and expand the number of collection nodes means that they will often be closer to the point of emission, meaning that lower-power emissions will be practically detectable and improving the survivability of the EW teams. Erwin Rommel, for example, used an EW baseline to great effect in North Africa against the British. But he only had one such system, which was located and destroyed; he was unable to regenerate the capability until he was deployed to Normandy. By separating collection from analysis – with the latter function requiring specialists – it becomes possible to better preserve EW operators and maintain capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important advantage of dispersed yet integrated sensing is that it allows for a sustained presence across the front. The old task of recording specific waveforms to refine attacks or optimise tracking of key systems was often frustrated by the fact that a system might illuminate too far from an EW team to be recorded, and then displace before the EW team could reach the relevant location. If sensors are distributed, however, it is possible to program equipment to flag when a waveform of interest is detected, and to record it and prioritise its transmission rearwards. A centralised EW team can monitor these waveforms of interest across a wide area. Waveforms can also be studied from different sensors as they move around the battlefield, so that long-duration recordings of emitting systems can be built up to see not only how the system behaves over time but also how it reacts to effects that might cause interference, from either EA or fratricide with other systems in the opposing force. In any case, as frequency-hopping and other methods are used to improve the robustness of communications, building up recordings of the hop pattern allows for a more refined picture of which radio is communicating, or to predict where the pattern might be under varying conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A distributed EW capability allows for regular updates to the electromagnetic survey of the background environment. Collecting localised signals from many points increases the speed at which a picture of emissions patterns across the battlespace can be accumulated and disseminated. Furthermore, the accumulation of more data, with greater fidelity, is both exploitable by AI and allows analytical tools such as AI to have a better foundation with which to assess the environment. The ability to accumulate and assess regular EME surveys allows electronic surveillance to provide regular updates for planning in order to apply fires, plan routes for and launch UAS, or prepare a communications plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will remain necessary to field dedicated EW platforms, as some specific enemy systems may use low-probability-of-detection or -interception techniques that can only be captured by specialist equipment, or the distances involved may demand dedicated antenna arrays to pick up signals. It is also necessary to be able to draw on and contribute to joint EW capabilities and national technical means. But by narrowing the range of routine tasks that dedicated EW teams are assigned, the integration of sensors should allow for these assets to be used in a more targeted way, improving coverage and thereby reducing the periods when monitoring is not available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;adaptive-payloads&quot;&gt;Adaptive Payloads&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software-defined systems allow for the acceleration of bespoke attack payloads being used in EW as the standard form of attack. The ability to record waveforms allows them to be examined by software and, as long as the desired effect can be designed, for the most precise and effective countermeasure to be programmed. In some cases, this may be possible at the edge. A group of four SDRs, for example, may have one set to attack and three set to receive, and will thereby both monitor the bearing of the target – enabling proper alignment of the attacking antenna – and track the evolution of the emission pattern of the target system over time (and as it responds to stimuli from the attacking system). This creates a feedback loop that enables the attacking system to outperform the target system, sustaining the jamming even as the defensive system endeavours to evade the effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The distribution of attack systems is somewhat different from that for surveillance systems, because conducting a successful attack requires not only an appropriate antenna, but also an appropriate source of power. This may be less of an issue when the power source is vehicle-mounted, but dismounted units will need power sources, whether they are battery packs or a generator. EA also necessarily requires emission, making the emitting unit itself a target for enemy electronic surveillance and subsequently for fires. Distributing a greater number of points of attack allows signals to be generated closer to the target, potentially increasing effectiveness, while limiting the risk of the overall EA system. The point of attack can also be switched between positions, or the attacking antenna could be geographically separated from the SDR, operator and power source. This latter case would facilitate a counter-battery engagement at the loss of only a single antenna, in an ideal case. The more points an attack can originate from, the greater the number of tactical options there are for how it is managed. Opportunities in this space become even greater if the offset antenna is mounted on an uncrewed system and is thus mobile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since protocol-based EA requires an understanding of how a waveform is received and what subsequently happens to the hardware within a system, the distributed reconnaissance capability does not allow for dynamic generation of these payloads. However, the use of algorithms to rapidly exploit captured equipment and thereby generate payloads closer to the front – and faster – does offer the prospect of a highly responsive EW capability development cycle. A distribution of attacking EW nodes also makes it possible for a sensitive payload to be held back before being pushed forward to a specific system once a target is identified by reconnaissance. Once delivered by that EW node, the payload could then be wiped from the device without the user needing to know that they were holding a sensitive payload. This approach makes it possible to remotely generate effects while also reducing the information security issues associated with pushing EW platforms and operators forward into tactical formations. By using protocol-based EA, it is also possible to reduce the power demands for a given effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opportunity to deploy adaptive payloads against enemy communications is accompanied by the ability to provide agile electronic defence at echelon. For example, an enemy UAS may use a command link to receive instructions, and may offload live video to a base station. It may also rely on a GNSS for navigation. It can therefore be envisaged that distributed electronic surveillance may identify the pattern of traffic between the UAS and its base station, and that a counter-UAS system may identify the navigational pathway used by the UAS. At this point, it may be possible for the unit over which the enemy system is flying to jam the control frequencies used by the UAS, for an adjacent unit – noting the low power levels associated with a GNSS – to jam the navigational frequencies associated with the platform, and for a dedicated EW system with greater range (or a friendly unit in closer proximity) to jam the receiver of the video link in a synchronised manner. This would probably only be possible for a short period, but may provide the unit under observation with the time necessary to get a counter-UAS interceptor into position, or at the very least take appropriate measures to conceal critical systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also worth dwelling on the fact that while the distributed and dynamic payload-delivery capability described above offers advantages over past approaches to EA, the distribution of electronic defences across the force at all echelons is also essential for survivability, given the modern threat environment. Now that platoons can organically generate precise lethal effects out to 20 km, the ability to disrupt enemy kill chains is an essential capability for enabling manoeuvre without an unacceptable rate of attrition of personnel and materiel. As attacking systems use the same software-driven processes to rapidly update their navigational technique and communications protocols, the transition to a software-driven and dynamic EA architecture is not just a path towards advantage, but is vital for keeping pace with a rapidly evolving threat. Understanding that this process will be implemented by tactical echelons for their own preservation, even if it is not prepared before a conflict, shapes the command decision to erect such an architecture. The question is not whether such an approach should be attempted – for it is essential – but how well it is implemented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;dynamic-command-and-control&quot;&gt;Dynamic Command and Control&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The surveillance, attack and defence capability described above creates a chaotic and complex electromagnetic battlespace. If a communication system is dynamically hopping frequencies in response to targeted EA by an adversary, and these hops are being tracked by the adversary’s electronic surveillance so as to inform the EA that is following the hops, then there is no way for either side to know beforehand which parts of the spectrum will be covered by the engagement. This is because software that is reacting dynamically to EA is not displaced by the attack to a pre-agreed contingency frequency but instead generates frequencies of opportunity depending on which parts of the spectrum are available and which parts are denied. The risk is that as multiple systems engage in this process of attack and evasion, the spectrum becomes extremely congested such that it is either effectively unusable over a given area, or else is unreliable and therefore denies commanders the ability to plan effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that under these conditions commanders on both sides may choose to turn off their EA capabilities, and in the absence of interference, this may lead to stable frequencies becoming occupied by both sides’ communications. This is often the case in Ukraine, where both sides have a strong desire to deny one another the use of UAVs but there is also a demand from commanders to have access to UAV feeds. The result is that both sides tend to lower jamming for particular periods and to sit very close to one another in the frequencies they use to operate UAVs, thereby preventing the other side from jamming them without also causing problems for their own ISR feeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If both communications and EW are being executed by the same SDRs, there are opportunities for the behaviour of the systems to be deconflicted technically. First, if EA and communications protocols are updated through software injections, then it is theoretically possible for the effects to avoid overlap. The deployment of algorithms to the edge or near-edge on individual platforms could increase the speed of real-time deconfliction in response to battlefield inputs while further reducing the cognitive burden on EW operators. Power level, alignment and range are also important. If EA nodes can be directed on the correct bearing – triangulated by the surveillance baseline – this can reduce or avoid the effects on the receivers of friendly communications systems. It is also only necessary for EA and communications to be deconflicted within the range parameters of the given EA effector. This means that deconfliction within a friendly tactical network will probably be necessary, and also eminently achievable. Scaling this manner of deconfliction across the force would be drastically more difficult, but is unlikely to be required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the relationship between geography and emissions therefore becomes a critical consideration in how commanders draw their unit boundaries, with the potential requirement to draw a unit’s physical boundary of responsibility and area of interest separately from drawing its electronic boundary. This would thereby allow – for instance – seams in friendly electronic defences to be used to route UAS through areas with less electronic interference, thereby avoiding having to turn off electronic protection to push forward surveillance assets. This would also conveniently address the need to warn friendly units of impending overflight in order to avoid fratricide, by confining overflight to established routes that had been identified during the allocation of battlespace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also important to note that modern technology alters some of the requirements for when units communicate. For example, the usual view is that once a unit is in contact, it should communicate freely, as its position is known to the enemy, and it needs the ability to coordinate its movement and fires. The need to coordinate movement laterally within the echelon in contact persists. However, with overhead observation, it becomes possible for higher echelons to observe the progress of the fighting and thereby organically generate fire support with very little communication with the echelon in contact. There is certainly no need for forward controllers to talk guns onto target. The result is that while a force may avoid jamming tactical communications frequencies in contact, it may continue to try to deny enemy artillery through GNSS jamming, and use EA to try to break inter-echelon communication, accepting that this may conflict with its own ability to call for fires in support of the manoeuvre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present, EW is largely managed at the divisional level in US doctrine and in British practice. The UK in particular has a history of fielding small EW teams that operate more independently, but the allocation and exploitation of product from these teams is often managed at a national level, making them a strategic asset. What is described above, as regards C2, would not be feasible within this structure. Put simply, a small EW cell at division would be saturated by the complexity and speed at which EW effects would need to be sequenced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with endeavouring to conduct EW battle management at a lower echelon has generally been the scarcity of operators and assets. However, while the scale of coordination is increasing, the provision of more intuitive decision support tools and the ability to display the EMS in a manner that can be visualised should reduce the training burden for some aspects of EW C2 and allow it to be carried out in a more distributed manner. The best current example of this kind of technology exists in air forces, where the need for pilots to conduct mission planning at speed has created a range of ways to display EW laydowns in relation to geography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge is not so much making the EME comprehensible to non-specialists as it is integrating this picture as a layer into other C2 tools used to plan and execute traditional manoeuvre. This represents a software integration challenge, but is achievable. The use of algorithmic tools can also help to show the interdependencies of activity, so that a change to one variable in a planning tool automatically adjusts the electromagnetic scheme of manoeuvre. Nascent tools like this are already in use by the US military, such as the Electronic Warfare Planning and Management Tool, which should become more effective as it becomes cross-referenced with other C2 applications through the US Army’s C2-Next programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;multi-domain-effects&quot;&gt;Multi-Domain Effects&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to briefly discuss how the changes outlined above relate to the multi-domain fight, since the EME is a plane of manoeuvre which intersects all domains. Although this paper focuses on land operations, these are unavoidably effected by EW from other domains and vice versa, as the EME is a shared manoeuvre space for all domains. For example, ground force GNSS-denial routinely affects civilian and military aircraft operating in the vicinity, while a GNSS is itself a communications link emitting from space to the terrestrial domains. This section is concerned less about how EW is used in other domains than it is with how EW from other domains will impact ground operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Space&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most significant domain for the future of EMS operations is space. We may presume that unless an area of space is mutually denied by space debris, both sides will, in any peer or near-peer conflict, have access to dense constellations of satellites able to detect electromagnetic emissions. This does not necessarily allow tactical echelons to obtain this data in time for their fight, and therefore does not replace the need for electronic surveillance in ground units. However, it does mean that there is a reduced requirement for tactical units to share their picture of the EME up-echelon, because, from division and above, it is probably possible to provide regular and rapid electromagnetic surveys taken from space. It also means that tactical echelons will be persistently exposed to space-based observation from higher echelons, meaning that targets which stand out as high value or have unique signatures are likely to be found and struck. This increases the value in distributing EW capabilities and confusing the picture by making it flatter and more homogenous, with emissions continuously varying and locally unpredictable. This ability to track identified targets into operational depth from space also significantly increases the value in obtaining high-quality recordings for emissions signatures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space also offers the opportunity for EA. While this activity can be conducted against a very wide geography, tasking satellites in this way will only be possible against high-priority targets, such that while it remains an option, it does not reduce the requirement for EA at echelon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Air&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The air domain is the domain in which EW is probably most mature. EW has been critical to air forces ever since radar became the primary means for air defenders to track aircraft. The ability to locate and target defensive radar, to disrupt the accurate tracking of aircraft and to reduce the engagement ranges of surface-to-air missiles has been fundamental to an effective ability to penetrate and prosecute attacks into enemy airspace on a sustained basis and at scale. The successful use of each of these capabilities routinely leads to tactical or operational effects on land. Moreover, the ability of aircraft to carry electronic countermeasures (ECMs) to protect themselves from missiles – irrespective of the domain from which they were launched – is also central to any modern combat air capability. Air battlespace management – being dependent on radio frequency communications and radar – is also a key target for EW as a means of degrading the scale and synchronisation of enemy air activity. The emergence of precision strike, meanwhile, means that radar and electronic surveillance are core components of how aircraft engage in effective close air support. The development of stand-off munitions has not reduced the importance of EW, requiring the fielding of both penetration aides and decoys, and making navigation a contested capability critical to mission success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The maturity of air EW capabilities means that land forces can be fast learners, as some of the same dynamics emerge in land warfare. There is also the opportunity, however, for land forces to better assist the air domain by conducting EA against both enemy air defences and enemy aircraft. The threat from the air also makes EA against air targets a highly useful capability in protecting land forces. However, aircraft can carry large and exquisite antennas, have access to abundant power, and can assume line of sight over very significant ranges out to 400 km, so many effects against air targets will need dedicated generators and antennas if land forces are to be effective. However, the software determining the emissions pattern may still be routed through the same EW SDRs. Land forces, unlike aerial EW, have the advantage of a persistent presence, whereas air effects are necessarily periodic, constrained by fuel and threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maritime&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maritime EW remains a viable means of tracking enemy vessels, while radar and its defeat remains critical to tracking surface targets for the use of anti-ship cruise missiles. The primary means by which Russia tracks Ukrainian uncrewed surface vessels (USVs), for example, is through their electronic emissions, allowing the Black Sea Fleet to intercept most Ukrainian USVs using helicopter guided to the intercept point by EW capabilities. Ships also depend on EW as a means of disrupting one another’s missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spatial separation of land and maritime forces means that there is likely to be limited EW interaction between the two, other than in the context of coastal defence missile complexes, where land-based capabilities threaten shipping. However, whereas pervasive space-based observation poses a manageable risk for land forces that can distribute and flatten their emissions profile, space-based tracking of a surface action group through its emissions is harder to passively counter. As satellites become critical for the guidance of anti-ship ballistic missiles, navies will have to take a more aggressive approach to counter-space operations. Naval vessels have the antennas and power to conduct effective EW targeting space-based assets, and we may therefore presume that navies will routinely use EA against satellites. This is not a trivial task, as it requires highly calibrated alignment. Range also imposes constraints on what can be achieved given energy dissipation, making protocol-based effects critical. Nevertheless, navies will have to invest heavily in this area. This is likely to have an indirect effect on land forces by reducing the reliability and the availability of space-based communications and other capabilities when operating in a littoral environment. Given that navies are likely to possess this capability, land forces need to determine both how they can mitigate disruption to space-based assets, and where they may draw upon naval capabilities to protect themselves from enemy space-based observation, or even attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyber&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an intersection between EW and cyber activities. Cyber attacks are distinct in their operational tempo and logic compared with EA. Whereas EA is immediate, cyber attacks require a protracted period of reconnaissance, penetration, payload design, emplacement and trigger architecture to generate. They are also unpredictable insofar as patches of the target system can either invalidate a payload or alter how it will impact the system within which it is embedded. However, EA is a means to both infiltrate cyber payloads and trigger them. The critical intersection here, therefore, is in planning, designing and building a pathway to distribute payloads to EW elements. There is also the fact that as the battlefield becomes widely connected by software-defined systems, the attack surface increases, such that cyber defence becomes an integral and critical function, which, from a task management point of view, will necessarily interface with the signals organisations that run EW.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-fielding-competitive-ew&quot;&gt;III. Fielding Competitive EW&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having surveyed the basic principles of EW and how their application is evolving, this chapter turns to how these capabilities are best distributed and fielded in a modern land force. Although it could be argued that any SDR may now be used to conduct EW (given enough power and the right antenna), that does not mean that every radio should be employed in this way. This chapter therefore seeks to address several practical questions: What is the appropriate density of systems? Where are there requirements to retain bespoke EW platforms? And, in a context where there are many more EW systems than expert EW operators, where should these personnel be distributed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;distributed-effectors-and-networked-operators-at-echelon&quot;&gt;Distributed Effectors and Networked Operators at Echelon&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of distributed effectors has been described above. Making this a reality, however, requires a detailed answer to the question of how many EW systems can and should be fielded across a force at each echelon. If we begin with the logic that each independent element of the force requires organic electronic defence to be survivable, then this means that any combat grouping must have an EW capability. We may consider a combat grouping to comprise a platoon or troop, made up of four vehicles or three squads/sections of soldiers and a command team. This is the minimal practical force element likely to occupy a piece of terrain. It is also worth noting that while the distribution of ECMs to defeat IEDs has been practised below platoon, this led to platoons fielding two multiples, rather than three sections, as the weight of these ECMs required additional soldiers in each section to carry the requisite equipment. While this was feasible in a counterinsurgency context, it would be overly disruptive to platoon tactics in a peer conflict, and so retaining the three-section structure means that managing EW systems at the platoon level as the lowest echelon appears reasonable. For vehicles, the weight constraint is not a factor, so the density of systems can be higher. If we therefore envisage the basic EW kit as comprising an SDR capable of either electronic surveillance, attack or defence, a suitable antenna for either receipt or transmission, and a power source, this produces a reasonable planning assumption for the density of these systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Platoon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The infantry platoon may be envisaged as having one such EWSDR and a power source, but with each section carrying antennas capable of both defensive and offensive functioning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The laydown of the platoon’s EW capability, therefore, may be framed as follows. On the offence, one section may carry the EWSDR with antenna set to receive, contributing a single point for an EW baseline in electronic surveillance. Upon contact, or coming under observation, the platoon could set the antenna to transmit and maintain an area electronic defence against UASs or GNSSs while conducting offensive manoeuvres. Alternatively, the platoon could ground-base the EWSDR with a power source and have a series of networked antennas provide defence during an offensive action. Connecting four antennas to it, three would form a reconnaissance baseline and one an attack function, or all four an attack function, over the depth of a platoon attack. On the defence, each section might mount its receiving and transmitting antennas around its dugouts and connect these by cable to the EWSDR, connected to a dug-in power source, so that the platoon can have a defensive perimeter of jamming, as well as an organic EW baseline. The EWSDR, connected to an appropriate dedicated bearer network or Starlink terminal, or exploiting other bearers of opportunity, could then transmit the data and receive direction from higher echelon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a vehicle platoon, the density of systems would comprise one EWSDR, with a receiving and transmitting antenna on each vehicle, so that the platoon has an effective means of protecting itself, or else forms a baseline of up to four nodes. The functionality of the EWSDR would be very limited for the echelon, with options for a surveillance function, radio frequency (RF) jamming or GNSS jamming to be on or off. RF jamming could either feed off the detections from the surveillance function or be on specified frequencies determined by higher echelon, with instructions from higher echelon adjusting the frequencies being jammed. For EA, there is also the opportunity to mount the antenna and EWSDR on an uncrewed platform to offset the emissions from the actual vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Company&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The requirement at company level would be minimal as regards additional capability, since the company commander’s main task would be to issue instructions as to the disposition of the antennas fielded by the company’s subordinate platoons. However, there would be value in an EWSDR being held by the company command group, with a display terminal allowing the company signaller to monitor the aggregated electromagnetic picture built up by the company’s distributed sensors. This could be achieved by the EWSDR allowing the aggregate picture across its associated tactical communications and information systems to be accessed via authenticated laptops connected to the EWSDR by cable. Thus, if required, any unit with an EWSDR could monitor the company electromagnetic picture, although this situation would not generally be the case. The company command post, if it is connected to higher echelons via SATCOM or another higher-bandwidth system, may also be the routing point for sharing the aggregated electromagnetic picture with higher echelons. Android Team Awareness Kit and other existing C2 tools already have the functionality to display the electromagnetic picture, if it can be transmitted. The priority is to expand the availability of this picture for systems like ZODIAC without duplicating pathways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battalion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is at battalion level that the need for a dedicated EW section as part of a signals platoon becomes critical. Put simply, the number of EWSDRs distributed across a battalion means that the unit must have the ability to maintain their functionality in peacetime, necessitating a team with the relevant expertise. From the point of view of efficiency, possessing this EW logistics function at battalion is most desirable, as it represents an economy of scale between fielded systems and maintainers, while still being close enough to the user to be responsive to tactical demands and engaged with the tactical outcomes. In combat, this section would have wider utility. First, the section would be using the collected electronic surveillance picture to advise the battalion commander and support the battalion intelligence officer. Second, this section could possess the expertise to distribute updates to the battalion EW baselines in order to ensure that jamming was targeting frequencies in use by enemy UAS and other systems. The section could also determine which recorded signals deserved transmission to higher echelons for analysis. Third, as part of the planning process, this section could liaise with higher echelons to receive effects to be transmitted to platoon EWSDRs and thereafter turned on by the platoon under the conditions determined by battalion and company plans. This section, therefore, would be the nexus for integrating tactical EW with the company schemes of manoeuvre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brigade&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brigade is the echelon at which two factors critically intersect. First, as the echelon able to generate full combined arms groupings to successfully execute individual tactical actions, brigade is the echelon best placed to manage the deconfliction of EW effects between those arms. A battalion needs to deconflict, but owns its core assets under permanent command. A brigade integrates functions that train and are generated separately. As multiple kill chains and coordination mechanisms must intersect at brigade, this is the echelon that is appropriate for making sure that battalion EW assets do not threaten the efficiency of brigade fires or air defence. Second, brigades are the appropriate echelon to have dedicated EW capabilities to deliver bespoke effects or effects at greater range against higher-value targets. To achieve this, a realistic scaling appears to be the fielding of an EW company with a troop supporting the brigade headquarters with battlespace management, and troops crewing dedicated vehicles with larger EW antennas, generators and their own SDRs. It is likely that one of these troops would be primarily responsible for the electronic defence of brigade assets and enablers, especially logistics elements. The other troop would be dedicated to EA against priority targets, used proactively to shape and disrupt the enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Division&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At division, responsibility would therefore pivot from its current position of planning and deconflicting the employment of EW to acting at the boundary between tactical EW and national technical means. First, there is the provision of collection from the division’s subordinate elements to national technical means for analysis, and second, there is the drawing on national technical means to push bespoke payloads to subordinate elements. The division is likely the echelon best able to receive the surveillance picture from its subordinate elements, and to have the analytical capacity to analyse it. It is also likely to be able to receive this picture from the joint force and so compare the joint picture with that generated by its subordinate echelons. Further, the division likely has the ability to direct the assets of its subordinate brigades to assist with joint operations, or to field requests from the brigades to use higher-echelon EW to enable tactical actions. It is equally arguable that this function should sit at the corps level, with the division primarily concerned with the electronic defence of its rear area and critical sites using dedicated EW troops. The purist’s solution would likely be the latter one, but as few NATO forces operate at the corps level, most are more likely to find it necessary to field this function at the division level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyber Security&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final consideration is the responsibility – likely concentrated at division – for assuring the cyber security of the networks across the formation, which must include the networks supporting the C2 of EW. This same element may also be responsible for the planning and distribution of cyber payloads where the EW enterprise is the delivery mechanism. Given the security classification of these capabilities and therefore the challenges in executing this planning, the division is likely to be the most realistic echelon at which a presence of appropriate personnel can be maintained. Nevertheless, it is necessary for the EW enterprise below the division to understand how to receive and execute capabilities generated from within the cyber function of the divisional headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overcoming-challenges&quot;&gt;Overcoming Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many respects, there already exists a scalable industrial base for the manufacture and procurement of the SDRs outlined above, their associated antennas, and even the C2 software for managing these assets. The network underpinning the C2 model is also deliverable with existing technology. The main barriers to fielding such capability are organisational and bureaucratic, rather than being related to development of/access to technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Procurement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military C2 functions have historically been distributed by warfighting function, and therefore locked in with different companies that have a limited interest in integrating with the C2 tools of others. The drive towards open architectures has reduced this as a structural problem, though procurement processes lag behind institutional intent. Although industry incentives and therefore behaviour are changing, the process of breaking down these barriers is often prohibitively expensive at the whole-of-force level, resulting in only isolated pockets of integration existing in cross-domain functions. Such silos impede the integration of multiple specialised domain-specific functions, leading to delays and the further breaching of budgets. Similar dynamics apply for communication equipment procurement. Although domain integration has fewer requirements at the tactical radio level, it remains critical to combined operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wider concerns about procurement strategies aligning more closely with platform-centric approaches further inhibit the ability to field competitive EW. Software-defined systems, whether tactical SDRs or higher-echelon capabilities, require constant software injections both to continue basic functionality and to respond to rapid battlefield changes. Shifting to software-as-a-service approaches permits greater long-term flexibility in the industrial relationship to maintain the delivery of such updates, but can exacerbate reliance on a small number of software vendors. Open Architecture standards provide the opportunity to expand the number of vendors able to contribute to a given system. Broader discussions of whether to mandate vendor-agnostic systems or establish the defence estate as the software owner fall outside the remit of this paper, but decisions in these areas will certainly affect the agility of EW capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Integration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when procurement of discrete systems is possible, the question of integration with existing capabilities persists. Unless it is possible to replace entire systems simultaneously, a degree of effort will be required to enhance backward compatibility when integrating legacy systems with new capabilities and enablers. A high-intensity war could also see a piecemeal procurement process where forces field a mosaic of EW equipment, requiring some level of interoperability. Software-defined systems can mitigate the burden of the legacy equipment, but reliance upon strategies of spiral development, or re-engineering architectures for greater openness, may also be necessary. This is already the practice in a wide range of industries, but is not yet fully realised in the way defence manages programmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The integrated sensing across the force described earlier requires continuous deconfliction and redelegation of assets at echelon to maintain functionality, yet bandwidth limitations and latency constrain the amount of raw data that edge sensors can transmit to higher levels for processing. As such, greater processing and compute capabilities will need to be delegated to tactical levels not only to process and retask SDRs, but also to filter the data that can – and must – be transmitted to command levels. Latency-sensitive intelligence would take priority for edge processing, while other data could be transmitted upwards, either to other edge or near-edge processors or to cloud-hosted applications. Relatively unsophisticated algorithms can accomplish some of the basic processing functions at platoon level, with compute increasing in correlation with command size and distance from the edge. Technically integrating such a model is feasible, although it would require both the EW architecture to maintain strict data standards (to ensure integration between platforms and systems) and for operators to be knowledgeable about data functionality. All this can be resolved, but managing the hardware and software changes across the existing force in a fiscally constrained environment is not programmatically simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;assuring-the-force&quot;&gt;Assuring the Force&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is one thing to conceptualise a software-defined EW enterprise for ground forces, but quite another to field one that can operate effectively. Even successful procurement and technical integration of the equipment would not create a fieldable capability. EW capabilities are far too often trained in their silo, rather than as part of a combined arms exercise. This prevents commanders from being exposed to the capability and from becoming familiar with how to plan and integrate it into operations, thereby producing serious friction in real-world combat scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The starting point, therefore, is that the basic principles of EW need to be a component of low-level all-arms training. Officers do not need to be technical experts, but they do need to understand the concepts of application, so that they can ask the right questions of their EW operators and make reasonable planning assumptions about how to integrate EW into their scheme of manoeuvre. All ranks also need to be made aware of what is (and what is not) possible with EW, so that they practise effective discipline in managing their emissions. As EW becomes a core combined arms function, it must be demystified. Training which does not address EW risks teaching units false lessons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Training the force is complicated by four factors. First, EW introduces significant uncertainty into how systems perform, which raises safety risks during training, as imprecise navigation, for example, can disrupt safety measures to deconflict forces. Second, electronic defeat of a force may significantly disrupt the training of other arms, because important exercise opportunities will be wasted while most parts of an all-arms force wait for a small cadre of signallers to resolve connectivity issues. Addressing this issue is partly about redefining it from being an opportunity cost to being a wider training opportunity related to something that could occur frequently on operations. Third, live EW can affect civilian systems, including aircraft navigation, so finding areas where there is the opportunity to both manoeuvre forces and emit without posing a risk to civilians can be a challenge. Fourth, there are security concerns associated with EW related to the fact that if forces emit their attack frequencies, these can be recorded by enemy space-based electronic surveillance and so countered. (This concern does not apply to using electronic surveillance to train friendly forces on their own emissions.) In general, these four factors combine to prevent realistic training. Nevertheless, combined arms training utilising EW is critical to assuring the readiness of the force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These issues can be resolved in a number of ways. Many of the process challenges and much of the uncertainty imposed by EW on commanders can be replicated in synthetic environments supporting command post exercises. It is therefore possible to effectively train officers in the battlespace management and deconfliction challenges that emerge from EW without jamming during live exercises. Accurate simulation of EW effects against synthetic systems can also be used to reduce the problems associated with emitting under observation and thereby exposing waveforms and capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electronic surveillance, meanwhile, can be integrated into live exercises. This is routinely done at the US National Training Center, but is less common in Europe. Giving commanders an understanding of their own signature in the spectrum is an effective means of convincing them that the capability can have utility for them. Training officers to become familiar with when and where to establish EW baselines and how to erect these capabilities is best done during battalion exercises rather than in simulated environments, as synthetic environments will not create an intuitive feel for causes of friction and for the time and effort involved in carrying out the task properly. In most European militaries, the shortage of EW personnel is a major barrier to being able to integrate capabilities into exercises in this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, as EW becomes a core component of combined arms manoeuvre, forces need to appreciate that many tactical effects are no longer especially sensitive. For example, the update cycle on UAV techniques and communications means that exposing the ability to jam a system is to cede a couple of weeks of development at most. When it comes to tactical UAVs, it is far more important that troops know how to detect and protect themselves from UAVs, and that the EW personnel know how to update their jammers, than it is to assure day-one jamming against a specific UAV type. In any case, it is likely that the UAV in question, if used at large scale in the enemy force, will have already been adapted by the time a conflict breaks out. It is also critical that friendly UAV operators are familiar with adapting their platforms and using tactics to get around EW systems. There is therefore considerable utility and limited risk in having live exercises in which UAV teams seek to fly through/around defences erected by EW troops. This would need to be done at a location where the permissions and regulatory environment are favourable to flying UAVs that may not be under control. Having such a site, however, is vital for assuring the readiness of the force, and with the right control measures, the exercises there can be conducted safely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The digitisation of the battlefield has seen the electrification of every aspect of warfare, down to the equipment of an individual dismounted soldier. This has vastly increased the situational awareness available at all echelons, the lethality and precision of weapons, and the scale and complexity of what can be planned and coordinated. However, it also means that the force is pervasively present in the EMS and therefore potentially vulnerable. Effectively exploiting this threat surface offers myriad tactical opportunities. Neglecting the preparation of forces for an intensely contested EMS is to risk having one’s forces found, struck and disrupted throughout their operational depth. This paper has sought to outline how EW can be fielded to ensure that forces are competitive on current and future battlefields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The capabilities described in this paper represent a step-change in what current military forces routinely field and deploy across NATO. All the constituent technologies already exist, however, and are fielded – in isolation – across the force. Moreover, while NATO forces have not prioritised EW, adversaries and partners certainly have. EW is a brigade asset in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, while Russia has gone beyond fielding EW companies at brigade to also issue “trench EW” systems routinely fielded at company level. Russia has also made significant progress in integrating these capabilities and centralising the accumulation of electronic reconnaissance to accelerate their kill chains. In short, the capabilities advocated for in this paper not only offer opportunities to the force, but also can be considered to be the basic requirement to remain competitive against pacing threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EW systems can be expensive, and as NATO forces try to regenerate combat power there is a significant opportunity cost in prioritising spending on force multipliers – like EW – without sufficient forces to be multiplied. Fundamentals must come first. Nevertheless, an examination of the rate of attrition from precision fires a force will face if it lacks electronic defence shows that fielding appropriate EW capabilities at echelon significantly improves the survivability and resilience of the force. Furthermore, the software and programmable systems that allow sophisticated EW effects to be generated are now fieldable using comparatively cheap components. The multifunctionality of software-defined systems also reduces the need to have fleets comprising multiple different capabilities aimed at different targets. Perhaps the biggest challenge in getting EW prioritised correctly is culture, as it remains a small specialism that much of the force finds hard to visualise. This must change, because EW is now an all-arms business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If British land forces are to field competitive EW systems, professional military education needs to create a cadre of junior and field-grade leaders to understand how to think about the EMS and plan operations that manoeuvre through it. It is also imperative that all soldiers are “spectrum-minded”, such that they have a basic understanding of why the spectrum is vital, how it enables effects and manoeuvre, and how their own presence within it creates potential vulnerabilities. Further, it is necessary to create synthetic and real-world training environments where forces can experiment with EW capabilities. The force needs to receive the SDRs and associated antennas so that they can practice, adapt and learn to use them as a routine aspect of operations. It may not be possible under current budgetary conditions to fund such a high density of systems across the whole force, but iteratively rolling out capabilities within units would allow the relevant tactics and distribution of capabilities to be refined without massively increasing in-year spending. Regardless of the roll-out mode that is employed, the end result must be that British forces are competitive in the EMS if they are committed into action.&lt;/p&gt;

Now is the time to match rhetoric with action to make sure it is integrated and used at scale in the joint force.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A steady cadence of speeches, strategies, reports, and recommendations from senior defense officials and experts extol the virtues of commercial space and urge increased use of commercial space services and products for national security. Yet the rhetoric does not match reality, in spite of meaningful progress made at the Pentagon, as commercial space is not being integrated and used at the scale needed to maximize its contribution to operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department of Defense (DOD) is making it easier to buy commercial space, creating contracts and developing new frameworks, but sorting out how to acquire commercial solutions is only part of the problem. The military needs a process to validate when commercial products and services meet operational requirements. There is also currently no formal service-level guidance on accepting commercial space services into operational use from the Space Force or any other service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though policymakers recognize the need to modernize requirements processes, there has been much less attention paid to operationalization challenges, including the unique difficulties of operationalizing a commercial service. Unlike commercial products, which mostly fit into current processes, commercial space services are incompatible with Space Force system acceptance procedures for operational capabilities. As such, the military risks fielding commercial services that have neither undergone the vetting as other systems presented to combatant commanders nor the same rigorous process to ensure they fit into the joint force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full integration and maximized use of commercial space services only happens when commercial services can be operationalized like any other warfighting capability—i.e., included in readiness and sustainment activities, budgeted in operations and maintenance accounts, allocated and presented to combatant commanders for operational use, and considered in future force planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;assumptions-and-definitions&quot;&gt;Assumptions and Definitions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper uses the definition of a commercial product and service found in Title 41 of the U.S. Code. Thus, when the government purchases a commercial space product it is purchasing a tangible item, which upon delivery, becomes the government’s property and can be stored, transported, and operated at the sole discretion of the government. On the other hand, when the government purchases a commercial space service, it is not buying a tangible item but rather a commitment from a provider for an agreed-to result, outcome, or task. The provision of a commercial service is intrinsically linked to an ongoing relationship with the provider, whereas the relationship with a vendor can be separated upon delivery of the product to the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report focuses on commercial space services—also called the space-as-a-service model—for two reasons: the growing prevalence of this business model in the space industry and the unique challenges associated with operationalizing a commercial service. There is neither an acquisition pathway in the DOD’s Adaptive Acquisition Framework (AAF) nor Space Force service-level guidance for operationalizing commercial services. Though both the AAF and Space Force instructions include guidance on using commercial services, neither set of guidelines provides a clear path to operations and sustainment for services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No similar barriers exist to operationalize commercial space products, because in the AAF and Space Force system acceptance framework, commercial products look no different than custom-built capabilities. Both commercial products and traditional systems—like an F-35 fighter or Ford-class aircraft carrier—are handed over to the military as the new owner and operator. The military almost certainly maintains a relationship with the vendor of these capabilities, but it is for acquiring parts and upgrades, for example, and not part and parcel of the day-to-day operation of the weapon system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this paper focuses on the integration and use of commercial space products and services, it will primarily focus on Space Force processes, without taking a wider view as to how processes in other services may impact the integration and use of commercial solutions writ large. However, the integration and use of all commercial technologies and solutions in military operations requires a focus on the same three elements—requirements, acquisition, and operationalization—herein examined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background-on-government-use-of-commercial-solutions&quot;&gt;Background on Government Use of Commercial Solutions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Integrating and using commercial space solutions is just the latest chapter in a long story about the role of the private sector in supporting the U.S. military. Until the twentieth century, military officials believed that only government-run arsenals should produce military munitions and weapons. As a result, at the onset of World War I, the U.S. military was not prepared to manufacture artillery, tanks, munitions, and aircraft at the needed scale, having to rely instead on industry in Great Britain and France throughout the war. Learning from this lesson, the U.S. government contracted with the private sector to build and deliver munitions, ships, aircraft, tanks, and other warfighting equipment during World War II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even so, the United States did not have a statutory definition of what functions had to be done by the federal government, and not private companies, until the Federal Activities Inventory Reform (FAIR) Act of 1998. Reflecting bipartisan consensus and public opinion, which did not support the government developing products and services that competed with the private sector, the law sought to narrowly define what only the government could do. Government leaders believed that using commercial services could save the taxpayer money, presenting an opportunity to help reign in growing federal spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following enactment of the FAIR Act, officials provided further guidance on the use of commercial solutions in Office of Budget Management Circular No. A-76 and Federal Acquisition Regulation subpart 7.5, making clear that the government should buy and use commercial services when they meet government needs and not automatically seek to build a government-specific solution. Though these rules apply to DOD acquisitions just as much as they do to any other federal agency, lawmakers amended Title 10 as part of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA) of 1994 to require a DOD preference for commercial solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2016, tech startup Palantir successfully sued the U.S. government to be included as a bidder for work on the Army’s next-generation intelligence processing and dissemination system. Palantir argued in court, and a federal judge agreed, that the U.S. Army violated FASA because it did not conduct market research to determine when commercial solutions could meet military requirements and instead unlawfully favored the acquisition of a non-commercial solution from a traditional defense contractor. Proponents for the Army’s approach said that the Palantir commercial solution could not meet all requirements, though the then–Army Chief of Staff somewhat undermined that position when he came out as lukewarm about the program’s capabilities. SpaceX similarly sued the Air Force in 2014 over its noncompetitive launch services procurement process, eventually settling when the Air Force agreed to offer more launches for competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last several years, DOD has opened the aperture to look at a wide variety of commercial space solutions, including remote sensing, in-space servicing, space domain awareness, and debris removal, continuing also to acquire launch and satellite communications as commercial services. The release of two related commercial space strategy documents in April 2024—the DOD Commercial Space Integration Strategy and Space Force Commercial Space Strategy—reflect a growing urgency by DOD leaders to figure out how to better use this cornucopia of commercial space solutions. On the heels of the strategies’ release, the Defense Science Board published a report in May 2024 with recommendations for improving the use and integration of commercial space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;acquiring-commercial-space&quot;&gt;Acquiring Commercial Space&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years, DOD has worked to create several procurement frameworks to get commercial space solutions quickly on contract. The Space Force is finalizing the Commercial Augmentation Space Reserve program, which would set up a contractual framework to seamlessly tap into commercial space capabilities during peacetime, crisis, and war. Additionally, a joint effort between the Defense Information Systems Agency and Space Force has created a marketplace populated by low Earth orbit commercial space offerings so that they can be easily acquired by different DOD components. Finally, Space Systems Command (SSC) stood up the Global Data Marketplace to provide space-based surveillance, reconnaissance and tracking solutions to military commanders. For several years, SSC has also managed a space domain awareness (SDA) contract, which has been used by the U.S. Space Command to acquire commercial SDA data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these initiatives create mechanisms through which the Space Force, combatant commands, and other possible users of commercial space can quickly buy commercial space products and services. These procurement mechanisms are designed to make it easy for a potential user of commercial space to buy what is needed on a timeline that is relevant to the warfighter. But these contracts alone neither clarify how commercial space solutions meet military requirements nor ensure they were subjected to formalized system acceptance processes for operationalizing new capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-to-validate-commercial-space-solutions-meet-operational-requirements&quot;&gt;How to Validate Commercial Space Solutions Meet Operational Requirements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past several years, defense experts, lawmakers, and policymakers have increasingly emphasized the need to modernize requirements processes, in part to better take advantage of commercial products and services. Other experts have provided recommendations on ways to improve the military’s requirements process, called the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS), aiming to address concerns about its timeliness and lack of focus on joint capabilities, as well as recommendations on how modernizing JCIDS can enhance DOD’s ability to incorporate innovation and new technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper will not specifically examine or offer ideas to improve the JCIDS process, primarily because doing so would involve issues much broader than integrating and using commercial space. However, the paper’s author echoes sentiments expressed in the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2024 that called for the establishment of a process within the requirements system to “rapidly validate the ability of commercial products and services to meet capability needs or opportunities.” Establishing such a process would markedly improve DOD’s ability to integrate and use commercial space solutions, as it would help acquisition officials pair requirements (i.e., officially validated warfighter needs) with commercial offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of this process, before selecting an acquisition path to deliver a new space capability, the DOD and Space Force should take formal steps to conduct thorough market surveys, assessing whether commercial space products and services already exist to meet an operational requirement. That mechanism should also be sufficiently nuanced to identify commercial space options that meet most, but perhaps not all, operational requirements. But rather than being automatically excluded, such options should be considered, since it might make sense to accept a less-capable solution if it could be delivered sooner or modified to meet all requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the preference in the U.S. Code afforded to commercial solutions, held up in court through the Palantir lawsuit in 2016, in virtually every case that a commercial space solution can meet an operational requirement, the Space Force should favor that commercial option over one developed from scratch for the government. Though DOD has a habit of creating requirements that seem designed to eliminate commercial options, commercial solutions that do not meet 100 percent of a military requirement should not automatically be ruled out of consideration. In many cases, modifying a commercial space solution rather than developing a noncommercial system from the ground up can save time and money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creation of a repeatable process to assess and validate whether commercial solutions meet operational requirements should be paired with a modification to the AAF acquisition pathways, because there is no current path for commercial services intended for operations and sustainment. Relatedly, it is not clear how commercial space products that can be purchased for warfighter use without any modifications—such as SDA data or analytical insights—fit into the AAF. For either a commercial service or product, some type of effort might also be required to modify, tailor, or enhance the commercial option to meet warfighting needs. The AAF should better delineate a pathway designed for modifying a commercial space product or service—or any commercial solution, for that matter—to meet operational requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to deciding which current commercial solutions meet requirements, DOD should develop a way to look to the horizon, identifying and potentially shaping commercial space solutions that, when brought to market, will meet future needs. Military officials will also need adequate situational awareness of the commercial space market, relationships with space companies developing commercial services and products, and forecasting of what could be coming down the pike to help manage the balance between functions, missions, and tasks that could or might be performed commercially and those which need a government-operated capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having such situational awareness is important not only for identifying new commercial solutions, but also to keep tabs on which ones become obsolete or unavailable. For example, a company providing a commercial space service used for military operations could go out of business. In such a case, the military would want as much notice as possible that it would be required to build its own capacity to provide a capability that had heretofore acquired commercially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;operationalizing-commercial-space-solutions&quot;&gt;Operationalizing Commercial Space Solutions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A successful acquisition program produces a system that is accepted by a service branch before it enters operational use. Presumably, the Space Force would be the service operationalizing a commercial space solution, so this paper examines Space Force rules for system acceptance. According to those rules, a system effectively means a product that the Space Force acquires and owns, ensuring its fully-burdened life-cycle costs and readiness to contribute to the joint fight. The Space Force presents a fully accepted operational system to a combatant command, part of its core mission to train, equip, and organize forces for use in joint operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though more often than not the Space Force is accepting systems specifically designed for the military, the existing system acceptance process also works for commercial space products. But there is no clear, formally documented Space Force acceptance guidance that covers the use of a commercial space service for operational use. Operationalizing commercial services requires accepting an ongoing relationship with the commercial provider—not just for buying spare parts, but for the day-to-day use of the service, in peacetime and conflict—for the entire life of a warfighting capability. A company would be providing a warfighting capability as a service to a combatant commander and would play an ongoing role in ensuring the readiness and sustainment of a military capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acceptance processes support the use of commercial services for institutional use—but not operations. In many cases, this is a distinction without a difference, since institutional uses of commercial services, such as use of commercial cloud for information technology needs, directly impact the ability of military leaders to conduct operations. Beyond providing information technology services, other commercial services including satellite communications are already used in operations today. In these cases, commercial services end up being treated like commodities, available whenever needed and in whatever quantities are required by commanders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one in the Space Force is responsible for readiness and sustainment of commercial satellite communications. Unlike with traditional systems, the Space Force has no formal, documented role in presenting commercial space services to combatant commands. There is no application of an official, rigorous acceptance process before a commercial service is used in operations, since there is no equivalent to a systems acceptance process for a commercial service. While the Commercial Space Office (COMSO) in the Space Force has money to buy and facilitate the use of commercial space solutions, and is working with Space Command’s Joint Commercial Operations (JCO) cell on ways to help integrate and use commercial space solutions in the joint force, it currently has no institutionalized role in operationalizing commercial services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without a Space Force process for operationalizing commercial services, full integration of commercial space into joint operations is a dangerous illusion. Without that process, no one is formally responsible for ensuring full consideration of doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel, facilities, and policy issues—known officially in DOD as DOTMLPF-P analysis and documentation—related to commercial space capabilities. Though the Space Force’s COMSO and Space Command’s JCO are folding commercial space services into training exercises and wargaming, there are no formal mechanisms to ensure the consistent inclusion of commercial services in readiness and sustainment activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of those concerns, without a military service agreeing to operationalize a commercial service, there will remain some ambiguity about how exactly that commercial service fits into joint operations, force management and generation, and force planning efforts. Commercial services will remain orphaned from those processes, treated as something that can be purchased off-the-shelf at whatever time and in whatever quantity is needed. So long as commercial space services are treated like commodities, commercial providers have no specific direction on how much capacity will be needed where and when, making it difficult for companies to adequately build out networks and systems to seamlessly meet warfighter needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treating commercial space services as a commodity also limits DOD’s role in shaping developments of commercial space services—it is left stuck with what it gets. On the contrary, DOD can influence the direction of commercial services and would be best prepared to do so if it accounts for commercial services in future force planning activities. Including providers of commercial space services in such activities can help both the military and companies better plan for next-generation services, most importantly helping companies develop services that are fully informed by the expectations of military planners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, creating a path for a service branch to certify that a commercial space solution meets a military requirement not only opens the door to operationalizing that solution but also clarifies how the military pays for operational use of commercial space—it means a service branch pays. A combatant command should not be responsible for paying, since commercial solutions should be presented to combatant commands just like any other operational capability. Operationalizing commercial space also signals to industry that recurring revenue is on the table, giving space executives confidence to make investments into commercial space capabilities with the warfighter in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modernizing requirements processes and creating procurement frameworks and contracts are not enough to ensure the full integration and use of commercial space. A third critical, and less discussed, step is figuring out how the Space Force operationalizes commercial services. Not doing so casts doubt on how commercial solutions could fit into readiness and sustainment activities, as well as force management and future planning. Clarifying how commercial space solutions are accepted into the Space Force also determining who should be paying (hint: Space Force and not the combatant commands).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Failure to develop a path to transition commercial space to operational use also means companies may doubt the long-term commitment of the military to buy commercial space solutions. Without that certainty, shareholders and investors may grow tired of their companies making bold, expensive bets on new solutions that can help advance U.S. national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, military leaders see the revolutionary potential of commercial space. Now is the time to match rhetoric with action and continue taking measures to lay the foundation for the successful integration and use of commercial space in the national security enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ongoing war in Ukraine has placed significant pressure on allied nations to enforce sanctions that limit Russia’s ability to fund and resource its military in the invasion. As a G7 member – and with an eye on the need for reciprocal allied unity in the face of any future potential “Taiwan crisis” – Japan has implemented measures to align with allied sanctions regimes, including restrictions targeting critical sectors of the Russian economy. However, Japan’s unique position as a major importer of Russian energy, coupled with its geographic proximity to nations facilitating sanctions circumvention, presents distinct challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To further explore national efforts to implement and enforce sanctions against Russia, RUSI’s Centre for Finance and Security (CFS), in collaboration with the Japan Institute of International Affairs, convened a roundtable discussion with government officials, academics and representatives from the Japanese business community in Tokyo in November 2024. This event is part of the in-country engagements conducted by the CFS-led Sanctions and Illicit Finance Monitoring and Analysis Network (SIFMANet), supported by the National Endowment for Democracy. The event was supplemented by a series of one-on-one meetings in Tokyo during the visit. None of the discussions from the event or meetings are attributable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;overview-of-japans-sanctions-legislative-frameworks&quot;&gt;Overview of Japan’s Sanctions Legislative Frameworks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roundtable opened with an overview of the existing legislative and operational frameworks related to sanctions in Japan. Government representatives described how Japan has introduced substantial measures to enforce sanctions against Russia under the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act (FEFTA), legislation dating from 1949. These efforts include restrictions on specific sectors such as high-tech exports, financial transactions and energy imports. Taking these actions under FEFTA has allowed Japan to align with G7 sanctions while introducing domestic enforcement mechanisms, despite FEFTA not being specifically designed with its current use in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under FEFTA, Japan has a dual enforcement regime, encompassing both criminal and administrative measures. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) can also conduct post-event reviews and on-site investigations to identify violations, with penalties ranging from fines to a one-year export ban for companies that breach sanctions. Participants noted that such measures are particularly punitive for firms reliant on Russian markets, as they risk significant financial losses or insolvency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, given that FEFTA was not designed with sanctions implementation in mind, participants highlighted that FEFTA is insufficiently equipped to address the specific challenges of circumvention and transhipment through third countries posed by Russia. FETFA does not include any provisions related to circumvention but the Japanese government has explicitly stated that it interprets FEFTA to also apply to cases involving sanctions circumvention. In June 2024, the government announced additional export bans targeting entities in China, India, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan suspected of participating in sanctions circumvention, underlining its commitment to countering circumvention. In recent actions, the government further clarified that regarding payment and capital transaction restrictions, “the applicability of the regulations will be determined not by the formal name of the party, but by comprehensively considering the actual parties and the decision-makers of payments and capital transactions, and the beneficiaries”. Participants agreed that this extends the regulations to cases of circumvention where a third party’s name is used. Similarly, for export controls, the government has affirmed that “the act of exporting items designated as prohibited for export to Russia through countries or regions other than Russia (circumventing exports) is a violation of the export ban measures under the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act”. This clarifies that restricted exports routed through third countries to reach Russia are also violations of the export ban.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under FEFTA, the government can issue cabinet orders to specify the items to be controlled, which provides a degree of flexibility in interpreting and implementing the law. Despite this flexibility, participants agreed that the lack of explicit provisions to address circumvention and transhipment creates enforcement gaps and confusion among private sector actors. Moreover, enforcement capacity remains limited. METI, which oversees sanctions compliance, has limited personnel dedicated to Russia-related sanctions enforcement. Participants further indicated that Japan’s judicial and law enforcement agencies also face considerable challenges in achieving convictions, primarily due to high evidentiary standards and difficulties in proving that exporters knowingly violated sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government representatives at the roundtable did note that Japan has successfully achieved its first conviction related to a violation of Russian sanctions. In July 2024, the Osaka Prefectural Police arrested the representative director of a trading company, a Russian national, accused of illegally exporting one marine engine, four jet skis, boat trailers and motorcycles. The goods were allegedly exported to Russia from Osaka in January 2023 without obtaining the required government approval and routed through South Korea. The individual was convicted in October 2024 and sentenced to three years in prison and a ¥5-million fine. Participants described this as an exemplary case of Japan’s increasing determination to enforce sanctions against Russia, including its willingness to pursue and penalise circumvention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;persisting-challenges-in-sanctions-implementation&quot;&gt;Persisting Challenges in Sanctions Implementation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Japan has demonstrated a strong commitment to implementing sanctions against Russia, enforcement remains hindered by more than just resource limitations within the government. Additional challenges, including regulatory gaps, limited understanding of circumvention risks, and international alignment among sanctioning countries, further complicate efforts to ensure the effective implementation of sanctions in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;opacity-of-beneficial-ownership-in-japan&quot;&gt;Opacity of Beneficial Ownership in Japan&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advancing the transparency of beneficial ownership in Japan has been a focal point in the country’s efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has conducted evaluations to assess Japan’s compliance with international standards in this area. In its 2021 Mutual Evaluation Report, FATF identified significant deficiencies in Japan’s framework for transparency and beneficial ownership of legal persons and arrangements. The report highlighted that the mechanisms in place were insufficient to ensure that accurate and up-to-date beneficial ownership information was available to competent authorities in a timely manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2024 Follow-up Report by the FATF acknowledged that Japan has made progress in strengthening its framework, but challenges remain. In the SIFMANet series of country workshops, participants repeatedly note the importance of accurate and accessible beneficial ownership information. This shortcoming in Japan continues to pose challenges for effective enforcement of sanctions and the prevention of illicit financial activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;private-sector-awareness-of-circumvention-risks&quot;&gt;Private Sector Awareness of Circumvention Risks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sanctions circumvention remains a significant challenge for Japan, with restricted goods exported from Japan often finding their way to Russia via third countries. Participants highlighted that Southeast Asia and the UAE have become key transit points for Japanese goods, with Malaysia standing out as a major hub for re-exports. They added that exports to Mongolia have also doubled, raising concerns about the potential for these goods to be redirected to Russia. Despite the risks, many participants noted that there is limited awareness among Japanese businesses, particularly non-financial corporations, about the complexities and consequences of sanctions compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government representatives stated that they conduct numerous outreach initiatives to the private sector, targeting machine tools manufacturers, the automobile industry, and trading companies, among others. The aforementioned case marking the first conviction for sanctions violations in Japan was regarded as a warning to businesses that indirect violations such as diverting goods through third countries can result in severe legal and reputational consequences. However, challenges persist. METI has implemented measures to identify high-risk activities by monitoring customs clearing data and promoting internal investigations within companies. Yet, proving the origin of goods exported to Russia from third countries and evidencing the exporter’s knowledge of circumvention pose significant challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants further highlighted that many Japanese companies lack a full understanding of the risks associated with US secondary sanctions, which can have financial repercussions for Japanese businesses. Past incidents, such as Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ’s $250-million fine for breaching US sanctions against Iran, underscore the potential penalties for non-compliance. Recognising these gaps, METI has prioritised providing guidance to businesses, encouraging enhanced due diligence and promoting internal compliance mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, representatives from the private sector emphasised that the complexity of overlapping sanctions regimes continues to create confusion for businesses, often leading to overcompliance. This trend is exemplified by Uniqlo’s decision to suspend operations in Russia in March 2022, despite not being directly affected by sanctions. Such overcompliance highlights the reputational risks that drive many companies to operate with caution, even when legal frameworks do not explicitly require them to withdraw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;japans-restrictions-on-car-exports-to-russia&quot;&gt;Japan’s Restrictions on Car Exports to Russia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s sanctions against Russia have notably impacted the automotive sector, an area highlighted by some participants. In April 2022, Japan banned the export of luxury cars valued over ¥6 million to Russia, including all hybrids, plug-in hybrids and electric models, as well as petrol and diesel vehicles with an engine size exceeding 1,900cc. These restrictions significantly reduced Japanese car exports to Russia, which totalled approximately ¥600 billion in 2022, declining 30% from the year before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late 2024, Japan adjusted its policy, permitting the export of “mild hybrid vehicles”, which use electric motors to assist petrol engines but cannot operate solely on electric power. This move allowed Japanese manufacturers such as Honda, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, and Suzuki to resume limited exports, addressing domestic economic concerns while maintaining alignment with broader sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants noted that with this policy shift, Japan seeks to balance its commitment to international sanctions with the economic and influential interests of its automotive industry. Core restrictions on vehicles with larger engine capacities and fully electric or plug-in hybrid systems remain in place, underscoring Japan’s commitment to limiting goods that could support Russia’s industrial or military sectors. This partial relaxation of automotive export controls also allows Japan to somewhat counteract the growing dominance of Chinese car brands in the Russian market, which have risen from a 9% to a 57% market share following Western sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s evolving automotive sanctions highlight the complexities of balancing geopolitical objectives with economic considerations, demonstrating the careful navigation required to enforce effective sanctions while minimising unintended domestic impacts – and potentially negative political consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;japanese-piano-exports-to-russia&quot;&gt;Japanese Piano Exports to Russia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The export of Japanese pianos to Russia has drawn attention as an example of sanctions evasion through transhipment and re-export routes. While Japan imposed export bans on luxury goods, including grand pianos over ¥200,000, Japanese pianos have been identified in the Russian market, often reaching their destination through intermediaries in third countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants found that the trade in pianos highlights the challenges Japan faces in enforcing sanctions in the context of complex global supply chains. Pianos exported from Japan are often routed through third countries where they are re-exported to Russia. These intermediaries exploit gaps in enforcement and regulatory oversight, making it difficult to trace the origin of goods and establish clear links to Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the restrictions, some companies have continued to engage in trade indirectly, highlighting the lack of explicit legal prohibitions on transhipments through third countries. This has prompted calls for stronger legislative measures to address the gaps in Japan’s sanctions framework and enhance enforcement capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;energy-security-the-central-challenge&quot;&gt;Energy Security: The Central Challenge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Energy has been a focal point in Japan’s approach to sanctions against Russia, highlighting the complex interplay between national security, international alignment and economic stability. Japan imports almost 90% of its energy. Limited domestic gas resources mean that Japan relies on imported liquified natural gas (LNG) for nearly all of its gas requirements, making it the second-largest global LNG buyer after China, with 8.8% of its LNG need coming from Russia. Japan’s reliance on Russian energy presents unique challenges in balancing its commitments to international sanctions regimes with the need to ensure uninterrupted energy supplies. This dependency is further amplified by Japan’s participation in the Sakhalin II project, a vital source of LNG for the Japanese market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Japan has imposed an oil import ban as part of its sanctions against Russia, LNG imports have been excluded from these sanctions, reflecting Japan’s concern over energy security and the tight global LNG market. Participants noted that unlike countries such as the US, the UK, Australia and Canada, which have reduced their reliance on Russian LNG, Japan faces strategic challenges similar to the EU, given its higher dependency. Private sector participants from the energy industry justified this position by emphasising that restricting LNG imports would likely lead to significant price hikes and market volatility, further straining Japan’s economy and affecting global energy markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge is exacerbated by Russia’s strategic manipulation of energy exports. Representatives from the energy sector noted that under the currently tight global LNG market, limiting supply would drive up global prices, which would benefit Russia financially, even as volumes decline. Japan thus faces the dual challenge of supporting international sanctions while ensuring that its actions do not inadvertently strengthen Russia’s revenue streams through price inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To mitigate its energy security risks, Japan has taken steps to diversify its energy portfolio. Efforts include increasing imports from other regions, such as Australia and the Middle East, and investing in renewable energy sources to reduce overall dependency on fossil fuels. However, a growing dependence on Middle Eastern oil, transported through the highly sensitive Hormuz Strait, exposes Japan to significant geopolitical risks. Any deterioration in relations with Iran, or instability in the region, could severely impact Japan’s energy supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, these strategies will take time to implement and may not immediately offset Japan’s reliance on Russian energy. For the foreseeable future, Japan remains vulnerable to fluctuations in global energy markets and geopolitical risks. This dependence complicates its ability to fully align with sanctions regimes, as seen in the continued participation in Sakhalin II, which has been excluded from international sanctions regimes, including the recent US sanctions against Gazprombank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants also highlighted the potential risks of future sanctions on China. As a major trading partner and key energy supplier, sanctions on China would pose significant economic challenges to Japan. This consideration further complicates Japan’s energy and sanctions policies, as it must navigate a complex web of international alliances and dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a G7 member, Japan is committed to implementing sanctions on Russia in response to its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, yet notable shortcomings exist in Japan’s ability to contribute fully to restricting the funding and resourcing of the Kremlin’s illegal war. To bolster its capacity, Japan should consider the following recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthen legislative frameworks:&lt;/strong&gt; Japan should amend FEFTA to explicitly address circumvention tactics and transhipment through third countries. Establishing these provisions would clarify compliance obligations in the private sector and enhance enforcement capabilities by reducing reliance on interpretative measures. Legislative advances should integrate specific clauses to tackle opacity in beneficial ownership to aid in tracing and countering sanctions violations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhance resources for enforcement agencies:&lt;/strong&gt; Key agencies such as METI should be supported by increasing its staffing and resources to strengthen oversight, enable more investigations and support compliance outreach. This would enable the development of specialised teams dedicated to monitoring high-risk trade flows, particularly in sectors such as automotive, machine tools and energy exports.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Target circumvention networks:&lt;/strong&gt; Japan should strengthen international cooperation to address sanctions circumvention, particularly in Southeast Asia. This includes focused outreach to high-risk countries in the region, where goods such as machine tools and precision motors are being re-exported to Russia. This approach should include enhancing intelligence-sharing mechanisms among G7 nations to identify and disrupt trade networks supporting sanctions evasion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promote private sector awareness:&lt;/strong&gt; National authorities should continue to provide targeted guidance and educational programmes for industries at risk of sanctions violations, including car manufacturers, machine-tool exporters and precision instrument suppliers. This outreach should highlight the risks of US secondary sanctions and promote the adoption of robust internal compliance systems across Japanese companies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Address energy security while maintaining sanctions:&lt;/strong&gt; Japan should develop a long-term strategic plan to diversify energy imports, reducing reliance on Russian LNG. The government should collaborate with international partners to stabilise global LNG markets, mitigating price hikes and ensuring energy security without undermining the international sanctions regimes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s sanctions against Russia demonstrate its commitment to international security and alignment with G7 priorities, yet there is a sense that the country is “muddling through”, confronted as it is by a series of legislative and capacity shortcomings. Furthermore, the challenges posed by its prioritisation of energy security and the complexities of circumvention highlight the need for Japan to further its efforts. Strengthening legislative frameworks, enhancing enforcement capabilities and fostering international collaboration will be crucial in ensuring that Japan’s sanctions regime achieves its intended objectives while maintaining economic resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

Throughout a 20-year period, a corpus of reports has been delivered that outline standards of behaviour. Taken together, this is referred to as the “UN framework of responsible state behaviour” and includes an acceptance that international law applies to state conduct in cyberspace and a commitment to observe a set of norms (see Figure 1).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5AsUpfn.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: UN Norms of Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These international norms are generally considered the benchmark for the notion of “responsibility” in cyberspace, and one of the components of this “framework”. However, the UN framework is fraught for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It suffers from a narrow application. The UN framework relates principally to cyber issues that affect international peace and security. This sets a high-security threshold for what should be considered part of the responsible cyber agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The UN framework focuses—almost exclusively—on the obligations of states under international law.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It largely applies to externalities as it directs how states ought to behave towards each other, and not to how states should act domestically.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The UN framework amplifies a perspective on responsible behaviour that’s been spearheaded by the earliest and most mature cyber nations, in particular the P5 members of the UN Security Council.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has resulted in a lopsided but dominant perspective on responsible cyber behaviour—one that overlooks states’ domestic responsibilities in terms of the use of cyberspace for domestic and internal security purposes; practices of good governance for cyber capabilities and operational controls; and one that has overlooked perspectives from developing and emerging economies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-the-solution&quot;&gt;What’s the solution?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As cyberspace has become a ubiquitous dimension of social, economic, political and military activities, there’s a need to expand the notion of responsibility in cyberspace. While this has become common language in national and international cybersecurity strategies and practices in Australia, Europe, the UK and the US, it’s less evidently articulated in most other parts of the world, including in most of the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report introduces a more comprehensive framework to explore the concept of responsible cyber behaviour and additionally offers perspectives from seven Indo-Pacific countries on what constitutes “responsible” cyber behaviour. The selected countries are less represented and examined in global and regional cyber policy conversations, in both Track 1 and Track 2 settings. These countries vary in size, economic development, systems of government and strategic outlook—and so provide much-needed validation and challenge to established thinking and norms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The insights presented in this report should provide policymakers, negotiators, civil society and researchers in the fields of cyber policy, cyber diplomacy and the non-proliferation of dual-use technologies with a better understanding of various national perspectives. In doing so, it will help to inform the scope of work for the next chapter of international cyber negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-framework-for-responsible-cyber-behaviour&quot;&gt;A framework for responsible cyber behaviour&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UN framework for responsible state behaviour has set a crucial baseline for including the notion of “responsibility” into international cyber policy discussions and agreements. But, as mentioned, it’s presently lopsided in its focus. It may also no longer adequately reflect countries’ greatest concerns in relation to cyber matters. In the past decade alone, the cybersecurity threat landscape has changed radically. Phenomena such as ransomware, spyware and artificial‑intelligence (AI)‑enabled cyber intrusions jeopardise national security and regional stability, and it’s now recognised that most state‑sponsored cyber campaigns involve acts of intelligence‑gathering and espionage. Furthermore, more states are engaging with, and outsourcing to, criminal actors to secure economic and strategic advantage via cyber means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To account for these developments in the understanding of the notion of responsibility, we propose to look at three dimensions: national, operational, and international levels of responsibility. We provide coverage of “national dimensions” first in each instance to highlight expectations by each government of what it means to be a responsible actor in cyberspace. This is followed by consideration of the “operational dimension”—that is, how each government regulates the export and use of cyber and ICT capabilities—and finally the “international dimension”—that is, respective expectations of good international behaviour in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The national dimension assesses how countries “regulate” their cyber power by looking at the policies, legislation, regulations, guidelines and standards that governments apply at home, the institutions responsible use of cyberspace and with cyber‑related capabilities, as well as countries’ diplomatic engagement and their national positions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The operational dimension assesses how countries justify developing capacities and capabilities to act in cyberspace. Those considerations range from establishing institutions to combat cybercrime, to offensive or defensive cyber operations, and acquiring technologies to support domestic capacities to respond to incidents and emerging cyber threats.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The international dimension assesses how countries perceive international legal and normative debates and efforts at international cooperation. It touches on statements and commitments in relation to “responsibility” in cyberspace, and further draws from memorandums of understanding, bi‑, tri‑ and multilateral agreements and other foreign relations arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These dimensions can be applied universally, but, in this report, we apply them to analyse the state of play in seven Indo‑Pacific countries: Cambodia, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Japan, Pakistan and Taiwan. All chapters follow a similar structure and are presented according to the three dimensions of responsible cyber behaviour—national, operational, and international. Each dimension is given different weightings in each profile, reflecting country‑specific cultural, economic and political settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All chapters rely on a mix of primary sources (official government documents, white papers, speeches, legislation) and secondary sources (media coverage, reports, research papers). The chapter authors are experts in their respective countries and mostly native speakers. That’s important, as it allows them to analyse various sources, including local media sources and interpret government documents. Inevitably, research limitations exist. Even with a greater diversity of sources, public information on many aspects of responsible cyber behaviour is scarce. Areas such as “operational responsibility” are particularly challenging due to the varying degrees of transparency with which countries disclose capabilities and report on public spending, export controls and the acquisition of dual‑use technologies. That lack of public data highlights gaps in research and public debate on responsible cyber behaviour. Each chapter identifies those gaps, offering valuable indicators for future research in the Indo‑Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-geopolitics-of-cyberspace-in-the-indopacific&quot;&gt;The geopolitics of cyberspace in the Indo‑Pacific&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand responsible cyber behaviour, we must consider the broader global and regional dynamics and how they shape how individual countries pursue their interests in cyberspace. In the Indo‑Pacific, this includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the geostrategic context of the region, where great‑power rivalry is intensifying&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;how geopolitical tensions and geo‑economic relations shape perceptions of risk and mitigation&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;diverse levels of cyber maturity and enabling cybersecurity capabilities across the region.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Indo‑Pacific encompasses more than 40 countries, it is home to nearly half of the world’s population and generates approximately US$50 trillion in economic activity annually. The region is a stage for US–China strategic competition, as both powers advance their interests through diplomatic, economic, military and cyber means. In fact, the Indo‑Pacific is also home to some of the most sophisticated and persistent cyber threat actors, including state‑sponsored criminal actors and threats that are used for a range of ends—from cyber espionage to intellectual property theft, critical‑infrastructure disruption and financial crime. Cyber activities also enable regional conflicts and acts of foreign interference that are playing out across the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As threats evolve and countries build their capacities (sometimes in distinct ways), it’s crucial to understand how those countries internalise their obligations and commitments under international law and existing norms; which direction their cyber strategies take; and which justifications they have for developing cybersecurity capabilities within their security sector institutions. Analysing those elements is essential to forming a more comprehensive understanding of how responsible cyber behaviour is practised, despite the use of different terminology or diverging interpretations of “responsibility”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;responsible-cyber-behaviour-in-the-indopacific&quot;&gt;Responsible cyber behaviour in the Indo‑Pacific&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The national perceptions and approaches to responsible cyber behaviour of the seven selected countries reflect the region’s historical, cultural, economic and political diversity, and contrast with those of the region’s major partners, such as the US and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, however, the following common observations relating to responsible cyber behaviour across the Indo‑Pacific can be made:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Responsible cyber behaviour is not a generally recognised concept; even the commitments made on responsible state behaviour in the context of the UN remain ambiguous and ill‑understood and require more effort in terms of implementation. Also, the acceptance that international law applies to state conduct in cyberspace isn’t yet an embraced feature of domestic policy and regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To date, responsible cyber behaviour is seen to deal with external threat actors—state and non‑state, including criminal groups—and their misbehaviour for reasons including the misuse of cyber and strategic technologies (Japan, Taiwan); engagement in criminal activities (Cambodia); ICT security (Fiji, Indonesia); violation of data sovereignty and personal data protection (India); and terrorist use of the internet (Pakistan). The fact that few countries explicitly reference UN norms in their national strategies casts doubt over whether states (and their respective government departments) consider or are aware of international commitments when establishing domestic cyber policies and practices. Internally, few countries have developed guidelines or mechanisms to prevent the use of ICT for malign purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For most of the Indo‑Pacific stakeholders, responsible cyber behaviour starts with accepting—and reaffirming—the principle of state sovereignty in cyberspace. As a consequence, states are entitled to establish cyber functions within their security apparatuses for purposes of national security and defence, although there’s no expectation that they should do so. Secrecy around any of these capabilities and activities is considered acceptable, even when it’s recognised that this complicates oversight. In cases where regulations exist, enforcement remains inconsistent and ill‑resourced. Continued reports of misuse of cybertools by state agencies against domestic and foreign constituencies highlight this challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Economic imperatives are often central to all policies, including on cybersecurity. Whereas the UN framework has concentrated on the impact of cyberspace on international peace and security, most Indo‑Pacific countries are predominantly concerned with socio‑economic development, digitalisation and connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given that most Indo‑Pacific countries lack sovereign cyber and digital capabilities, responsible cyber behaviour is about the opportunity to freely choose their strategic partners and seek investments, technical support and equipment, and capacity building that could strengthen the stability of the state, advance socio‑economic development, or both.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, responsible cyber behaviour is a concept that allows countries to legitimately pursue and advocate for their own cyber priorities, such as combating cybercrime, seeking data sovereignty and securing affordable and reliable connectivity, and to expect recognition of those priorities by other states as well as multinational technology companies and their host‑nation jurisdictions. For India and Taiwan, their democratic predispositions fuel civil‑society efforts to limit cyber‑enabled surveillance. Fiji, which is vulnerable to natural disasters, views climate‑resilience cooperation as part of responsible behaviour, including in relation to digital cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Responsible cyber behaviour in the Indo‑Pacific may involve the recognition that it’s equally important to protect physical infrastructure as it is to protect and secure the information environment. At the moment, many Indo‑Pacific countries’ response to cyber‑enabled threats is to over‑regulate, introducing a slew of legislation and regulations that focus on criminalising certain behaviours. There’s also been an increase in their reliance on surveillance technologies, content controls and other restrictive policies on freedoms of information, speech and expression.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For most Indo‑Pacific stakeholders, responsible cyber behaviour is about the nurturing of expertise within government and non‑government (Track 2) sectors, and their (ease of) access to most relevant and impactful international platforms, such as the UN OEWG.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Responsible cyber behaviour may involve the need for guidelines for the purchase, selling and use of dual‑use technologies. Four of the seven countries reviewed—Fiji, Cambodia, Indonesia and Pakistan—lack such guidelines, do not have strong safeguards or haven’t clearly or publicly elaborated them. Meanwhile, India, Japan and Taiwan have specific controls in place and adhere to international frameworks such as the Wassenaar Arrangement. Japan’s guiding principle for weapons and military technology exports is to trade with friendly nations only; Taiwan maintains similar controls. The existence of that legislation and those regulations, however, may not be enough to effectively curtail the unwanted proliferation of dual‑use technologies. Parliamentary or public oversight of governments’ and industries’ compliance is currently lacking.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a time when international discussions on security and collaboration in cyberspace are under pressure from deepening strategic competition, there’s a serious need to develop a deeper understanding of how other states understand what it means to be a responsible cyber actor. This report contributes to that conversation by presenting viewpoints from often under‑analysed state‑based perspectives across the Indo‑Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our analysis shows that domestic and operational cyber policies, practices and capabilities lack the agreed standards, principles or norms that allow a notion of “responsibility” to be internalised. It’s unlikely that most Indo‑Pacific governments will exercise greater transparency and accountability in their own right, instead pointing to principles of state sovereignty (and non‑interference) and the need to first address capacity shortfalls. Nonetheless, the international community, Tracks 1 and 2, should advance the broadening of the notion of responsible cyber behaviour on the premise that it’s grounded in the existing UN framework. To better understand how states conceive of what it means to be a responsible actor in cyberspace, we must consider how governments and non‑government actors reconcile domestic interests and international commitments. From there, additional standards, principles and guidelines could be developed to address states’ internal and operational responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyber‑enabled threats have emerged as a security concern in Cambodia, given increasing cyber attacks against Cambodian organisations and the proliferation of cyber‑scam compounds in the country. While Cambodia has laid legal and institutional foundations to defend its cyberspace, such as the Cybercrime Law and Cybersecurity Law, much of the responsibility for protecting systems is left to individual operators, and overall enforcement at the national level remains weak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cambodia’s focus on regime stability and sovereignty shapes its approach to responsible cyber behaviour. Domestically, the government aims to strengthen cybersecurity infrastructure, promote public and private awareness, and legislate against cybercrimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internationally, Cambodia advocates for multilateral cooperation on cybersecurity, supporting capacity‑building initiatives so long as they’re done without political conditions. It prefers a collaborative approach in forums such as ASEAN and the UN, where it encourages the development of binding rules to limit the misuse of ICTs by state actors. Cambodia’s stance emphasises the importance of national sovereignty and mutual respect in cyberspace. However, challenges remain in fully aligning domestic actions with international positions. Cambodia struggles to balance its focus on regime security with human rights considerations, and its cybersecurity efforts are still evolving. Despite advocating for responsible behaviour globally, Cambodia faces internal inconsistencies in implementing those principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;national-dimensions&quot;&gt;National dimensions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Institutions and accountability&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cambodian Government’s understanding of “responsibility” in cyberspace stems from its threat environment and constrained capacity to secure cyberspace. Cambodia remains vulnerable to transnational crime, and its security forces struggle to combat cyber‑enabled crimes. Transnational criminal organisations, for example, run online scam compounds using forced labour. In 2023, the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights reported that approximately 100,000 people were forced to work in such scam compounds. Cambodia also faces state‑sponsored cyberattacks, notably from Vietnam and China, which target Cambodian Government agencies and private entities. Faced with such challenges, Cambodia has, for the first time, included cyber defence as a priority in its 2022 National Defence Policy. This reflects the growth in threats emanating from cyberspace and a recognition that Cambodia needs to prepare to face those challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Respect for national sovereignty, which includes refraining from cyber operations that violate the sovereignty of other nations and engaging in capacity‑building efforts without political conditions, is a key message that Cambodia expresses internationally. The drivers of those views are deeply rooted in Cambodia’s historical experiences, political landscape and cultural values. Cambodia’s dark period under the Khmer Rouge and subsequent recovery have fostered a strong emphasis on sovereignty and national security. Politically, the government’s focus on maintaining peace and stability shapes its cybersecurity policies. Culturally, there’s a collective understanding of the importance of community protection and mutual respect, translating into expectations of responsible behaviour in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Cambodia’s views have been influenced and internalised through participation in international discussions and frameworks on cyber norms, particularly those advocated by the UN and ASEAN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domestically, the government signals its responsibility through efforts that improve cybersecurity standards in government and promote cybersecurity awareness among the private sector and individuals. The Cambodia ICT Masterplan 2020 emphasises developing robust legal and institutional frameworks to ensure cybersecurity. Meanwhile, the Cybercrime Law aims to combat cyber offences. The Cambodian Government has also engaged with industry to encourage responsible behaviour. The National Bank of Cambodia, for example, has specifically engaged with the banking sector through the Technology Risk Management Guidelines, which underscore the importance of ongoing risk management in identifying, assessing and responding to cyber risks. However, efforts to enforce those laws and guidelines are patchy, given constraints in financial and human resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;operational-dimensions&quot;&gt;Operational dimensions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsible use and acquisition of technologies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cambodia lacks specific laws or guidelines on the responsible use and acquisition of technologies. The Telecommunications Law of 2015 is the primary legislation addressing telecommunications and related activities in Cambodia. The law emphasises the safety and development of telecommunications infrastructure but falls short of detailing specific cybersecurity requirements for protecting data and network security. The lack of specific cybersecurity standards in these laws creates several constraints. Firstly, the lack of detailed regulations leaves government and private entities without clear guidelines for implementing robust cybersecurity measures. That is regulatory vacuum increases the risk of cyber threats and data breaches, as entities might not have standardised practices to follow. Secondly, the weak enforcement provisions mean that even the existing broad guidelines might not be effectively implemented, leading to inconsistent cybersecurity practices across different sectors. Finally, the general nature of these laws may inadvertently enable excessive surveillance and monitoring by authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Law enforcement has procured and employed ICT tools for surveillance without clear regulatory restrictions. Cambodia has cooperated extensively with Chinese firms, which provide spyware, surveillance, and DNA screening equipment. Open‑source reports also indicate that Cambodian authorities have utilised spyware and surveillance technologies to monitor political dissidents, activists, and journalists. Associated procurement processes are opaque, with minimal public disclosure or oversight, further fuelling fears of abuse. Human rights organisations and international bodies have criticised Cambodia for using cyber‑enabled technologies to suppress dissent and infringe on privacy rights. This lack of regulatory transparency underscores the urgent need for stronger frameworks and increased transparency in technology acquisition and use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsible cyber operations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cambodia’s Ministry of National Defense (MND) and the General Commissariat of National Police under the Ministry of Interior are the primary agencies involved in cybersecurity operations. Since 2022, the MND and Royal Cambodian Armed Forces have built cyber‑defence capabilities to safeguard the military’s networks and critical national infrastructure. Initial efforts have focused on developing legal frameworks, organisational structures and interagency cooperation mechanisms to address cyber threats. There are no clear restrictions or constraints on what the government, the military, or law enforcement can and can’t do in cyberspace domestically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MND’s Cyber Warfare Unit operates under the directives of the MND, focusing on military cybersecurity policies and strategic defence against cyber threats. Similarly, the General Commissariat of National Police follows the procedural guidelines outlined by the Ministry of Interior, which include cybercrime prevention, investigation and collaboration with international law‑enforcement agencies. Those units also gather cyber intelligence and share information with national and international bodies. However, these cyber units’ auditing, reporting, and accountability mechanisms aren’t well ‑publicised, and their operations have limited transparency. While there might be internal oversight and reporting structures within the respective ministries, there’s a lack of publicly available information on formal auditing processes or external accountability measures. That lack of transparency underscores concerns about the potential misuse of power and the need for stronger governance frameworks to ensure that cybersecurity operations are conducted responsibly and ethically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;international-dimensions&quot;&gt;International dimensions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;International law and cyber norms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cambodian Government supports the application of international law in cyberspace and adheres to the UN norms of responsible state behaviour. Even though it hasn’t published its interpretation, regional bodies such as ASEAN have been the closest to rehearsing and indicating what responsible state behaviour in cyberspace means for the region. That was the case for the statement provided by Cambodia, on behalf of ASEAN countries, at the UN OEWG, which noted that “ASEAN reaffirms the need to enhance cooperation to promote an open, secure, stable, accessible, and interoperable, and peaceful ICT environment and prevent the risk of misperception and miscalculation by developing trust and confidence.” Cambodia hasn’t elaborated on how it might seek international law to apply in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Cambodia wants to see the international community “develop rules, norms, principles within a framework of binding obligations”. Officials believe binding rules would help to constrain state actors’ potential misuse of ICTs against other states while encouraging cooperation under commonly agreed‑upon terms. For that reason, in 2019, Cambodia joined 12 other countries—including China, Russia and Venezuela—to advocate for the establishment of an international convention to combat cybercrime. The Cambodian Government believes that such a convention could strengthen international legal mechanisms to ensure that states behave responsibly in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Foreign policy and international cooperation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A commitment to international cooperation, capacity building and respect for state sovereignty informs the government’s pursuit of good international behaviour. Fundamentally, Cambodia also insists that any support must be provided “without prejudice to the sovereignty of states, the confidentiality of national policies and plans, respect for partnership and human rights and freedom, as well as apolitical and non‑discriminatory [sic]”. This statement was probably in response to a perception that development support by donor countries privileges democratic countries over others. Few government documents explicitly reference the global framework for responsible state behaviour in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cambodian Government demonstrates responsibility in cyberspace by participating in regional cooperation efforts. Cambodia has actively participated in initiatives such as the Singapore Cooperation Programme’s “Governing Cybersecurity: Policies, Practices, and Processes”, where officials from Southeast Asian states received training on cybersecurity policies based on Singapore’s experience. Additionally, Cambodia has been involved in technical cooperation projects to improve cyber resilience, such as the Project for Improvement of Cyber Resilience with Japan’s International Cooperation Agency and the Cambodia National Computer Incident Response Team Assessment funded by the International Telecommunication Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cambodia’s approach also underscores the significance of regional solidarity and collective security in addressing cyber threats. The Ministry of Post and Telecommunications and Ministry of Interior affirmed Cambodia’s commitment to collaborate with ASEAN member states towards an open, inclusive, safe and secure cyberspace during the ASEAN Ministerial Conference on Cybersecurity, Singapore International Cyber Week, and ASEAN Senior Officials Roundtable on Cybercrime, where discussions centred on building trust and security in the emerging digital order. Those cybersecurity forums allow Cambodia to learn from different nations’ best practices and share a local perspective that’s often under‑represented internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fiji&quot;&gt;Fiji&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overview-1&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fiji, an archipelago with nearly 1 million people, has 95% of its population online. Cyber threats have emerged as a growing concern, especially in the light of major cyberattacks. For instance, in 2021, a cyberattack on the Fiji Government’s ICT services took systems offline for two weeks. The country’s vulnerability to the effects of climate change imposes further risks that telecommunications infrastructure can be threatened by natural disasters and rising sea levels. Fiji’s perception of responsible cyber behaviour is, thus, shaped by its limited cyber capacity, geographical vulnerability as a small island nation, and role as a regional hub for digital connectivity. As the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) host nation, Fiji played a key role in the 2018 Boe Declaration on Regional Security, which identified cybersecurity as a regional priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fiji views responsible cyber behaviour through the lens of cooperation. Internationally, it’s committed to adhering to global standards, sharing information on cyber threats and participating in cyber capacity‑building (CCB) initiatives. Fiji often seeks external support to strengthen its resilience against cyberattacks, recognising that its modest cyber workforce and infrastructure require ongoing development. Cooperation with more cyber‑mature countries is a cornerstone of Fiji’s strategy, together with its active participation in multilateral forums such as the UN and the PIF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domestically, Fiji strives to build internal cybersecurity capacity by establishing institutions, laws and regulations, such as the Online Safety Act and the Online Safety Commission. Those initiatives highlight Fiji’s commitment to promoting responsible behaviour at the governmental and individual levels as part of a culture of online safety and accountability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Fiji, responsible state behaviour means conforming to internationally agreed norms and ensuring that its cyber capabilities are used for defensive purposes, such as combating transnational crime. Fiji lacks offensive cyber capabilities and specific regulations for dual‑use technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;national-dimensions-1&quot;&gt;National dimensions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Institutions and accountability&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fiji’s structural factors, as outlined, drive a consistent approach to training, sustainability and national policy‑development partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerned about the impact of natural disasters on ICT infrastructure, Fiji joined other Pacific nations in the 2018 Boe Declaration to broaden the concept of security to include cybersecurity and a commitment to “maximising protections and opportunities for Pacific infrastructure and peoples in the digital age”. Fiji’s cybersecurity policies consistently underline the need for international cooperation to secure cyberspace and develop national capacities. The government participates in CCB activities, recognising its lack of resources—financial and human—to manage an active cybersecurity centre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fiji Government and Fijian civil society further emphasise the need for climate‑resilient support in CCB. The Boe Declaration declared climate change the top security challenge for Pacific island states. In its 2022 submission to the UN OEWG on ICT, Fiji highlighted the importance of “climate‑resilient” cybersecurity infrastructure and called on international efforts to support that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internally, the government aims to be a responsible cyber actor by improving its cybersecurity capacity. Key legal foundations include the Criminal Act 2009, Online Safety Act 2018 and Cybercrime Act 2021. The Cybercrime Act addresses offences against computer systems and content‑related offences. Despite the Online Safety Act focusing on deterring offensive or harmful content—and thus being arguably “different” in scope from what had been agreed in the framework for responsible behaviour in cyberspace—one of its objectives is to “promote responsible online behaviour and online safety” and do so in tandem with promoting a safe online culture and environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, the Ministry of Home Affairs and Immigration and the ministry responsible for communications initiated consultations to develop the National Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity Incident Response and Recovery Framework and establish a Critical Infrastructure Computer Emergency Response Team (CI‑CERT) and national CERT. That same year, Fiji participated in regional workshops, such as the Asia Pacific Network Information Centre, to develop draft versions of the National Cybersecurity Incident Response and Recovery Framework. In 2024, Fiji and Australia signed a memorandum of understanding on cybersecurity to develop the national CERT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fiji has structured a strategic vision for domestic cybersecurity governance, drafting the National Security Strategy (NSS) in 2016, covering all aspects of national security, including critical‑infrastructure security and cybersecurity. Despite multiple revisions, the Cabinet hasn’t yet endorsed the NSS. In December 2023, the government committed to reviewing the NSS in 2024. However, no document has yet been published at the time of writing. Fiji is also undergoing a second Cyber Maturity Model review to inform the national cybersecurity strategy’s development. Despite recognising the need for a strategy, it remains a medium‑level priority on the political agenda. Essentially, private companies are responsible for managing their information security with little government assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those initiatives highlight Fiji’s view that responsible cyber behaviour intersects with international security, trade and economic development. However, cybersecurity and cybercrime remain challenging due to resource limitations and competing agendas. Support from neighbouring countries and non‑government organisations can help to prioritise and consolidate responsible cyber behaviour through institutional developments and policy updates. Notably, Fiji’s accession to the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime signals a step towards legal harmonisation and enhanced cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;operational-dimensions-1&quot;&gt;Operational dimensions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsible use and acquisition of technologies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fiji lacks direct guidelines or regulations on the responsible use and acquisition of technologies, including controls for dual‑use exports. The central Fiji Procurement Office under the Ministry of Finance coordinates all government technology procurements, but public information on usage guidelines or restrictions is unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2021, Fiji passed the Cybercrime Act, inspired by its ratification of the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime. The Act criminalises cyber‑enabled crimes such as unauthorised access to computer systems and interceptions of data. However, Fiji doesn’t mandate the reporting of cyber incidents. The banking and financial services sectors maintain the highest cybersecurity standards, as they’re prime targets for cyberattacks. In March 2023, the Reserve Bank of Fiji imposed minimum cybersecurity standards for those sectors through the Prudential Supervision Policy Statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All ICT network infrastructure in Fiji is owned by private companies (Telecom Fiji Limited and mobile operators Vodafone Fiji and Digicel Fiji), which aren’t required to adhere to government policies on acquiring technologies or equipment. For instance, unlike in many Western states, there are no regulations restricting the use of Chinese devices for both core network equipment and customers’ digital devices. Practical economic and developmental considerations drive the procurement of ICT equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fiji benefits from six submarine cables providing connectivity and emerging players that are expanding infrastructure projects. In 2023, Starlink received a licence to deliver broadband internet services, and, in 2024, Starlink services were expanded to more than 300 Fijian islands. The Deputy Prime Minister noted in the announcement that “licensing of Starlink for commercial use is a game changer for Fiji as it strengthens our resilience in providing connectivity during natural disasters—this also serves the purpose of the Fiji Government’s efforts in connecting the unconnected population.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsible cyber operations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fiji has no known offensive cyber capabilities and lacks guidelines for cyber operations. Cybertools are primarily used for countering transnational crime (such as drug trafficking, money laundering and terrorism). The Fiji Police Force has the primary power to intercept information online and for the enforcement of cybercrime legislation. The 2021 Cybercrime Act has provisions that allow the police to issue warrants for subscriber data and communications content. However, the procedure for lawful online interception by the Fiji Police isn’t publicly available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no specific parliamentary unit tasked with the oversight of cybersecurity. However, the parliamentary standing committees on foreign affairs and defence, justice, law and human rights could function as platforms for parliamentarians to highlight issues in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;international-dimensions-1&quot;&gt;International dimensions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;International law and cyber norms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the then‑chair of the PIF, Fiji released a statement to the UN OEWG on ICT on 30 March 2022. It committed to the applicability of international law, the UN Charter, and the UN’s eleven norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace. However, Fiji hasn’t detailed how international law specifically applies in cyberspace. Fiji’s support for international law and norms is likely to reflect its vulnerability to foreign cyberattacks. The global framework for responsible state behaviour encourages international cooperation to prevent the misuse of ICTs, supporting Fiji’s development needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fiji’s 2022 statement also emphasised critical information infrastructure security. It highlighted two key areas: the need to identify critical infrastructure in cyberspace and the unique contribution from Pacific island countries, which emphasised capacity building for climate‑resilient ICT infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fiji’s government has been consistently active in its engagement with the UN OEWG process. That includes contributions to joint papers on CCB measures, a proposal for a UN Cyber Points of Contact Directory, and the Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model as part of the assessment and development of national strategies. For example, the joint submission for the UN Cyber Points of Contact Directory sought to support communication checks and information‑sharing during cyber incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Foreign policy and international cooperation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fiji has long advocated for international CCB, primarily through regional efforts and bilateral agreements with Indo‑Pacific countries. Fiji’s foreign policy and international partnerships strongly connect its development and cybersecurity agendas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regional cooperation has been key to advancing shared cybersecurity goals among Pacific island countries. The Boe Declaration’s action plan included supporting forum members’ accession to the Budapest Convention, developing national cybersecurity policies, providing education and training on responsible cyber behaviour, and strengthening CERTs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Boe Declaration’s action plan explicitly mentions responsible cyber behaviour and has guided broader collaboration with Indo‑Pacific countries. They include the Partners in the Blue Pacific, a group composed of Australia, Japan, New Zealand, the UK and the US. Set up in 2022 to economically support Pacific island nations, it has incorporated cybersecurity as an area for prospective collaboration. In 2023, it participated in the Pacific Cyber Capacity Building and Coordination Conference as a potential annual forum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia and New Zealand play important roles in Fiji’s cybersecurity governance. In February 2024, Fiji established the Vuvale Partnership with Australia, which includes cybersecurity cooperation. That was followed by a cybersecurity memorandum of understanding in May 2024, focusing on critical infrastructure and CERT development and promoting international cyber norms. Similarly, the 2022 Duavata Partnership with New Zealand underscores cybersecurity and intelligence as priority areas of cooperation. Beyond bilateral and multilateral arrangements, the country is also part of technical cooperation networks such as the Pacific Cyber Security Operational Network (PaCSON), which is a regional network of cybersecurity experts in the Pacific dedicated to coordinating and supporting incident‑response activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fiji is also working to improve its capacity to combat cybercrime. In 2024, it acceded to the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, aligning its domestic laws with international standards. That enables Fiji to enhance international cooperation in cybercrime investigations with other signatories and benefit from initiatives such as the GLACY+ project, which is a resource for technical assistance in fighting cross‑border cybercrime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;india&quot;&gt;India&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overview-2&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India’s perception of responsible cyber behaviour reflects the country’s view of digital technology as a key driver of economic growth and social development. However, India’s complex cyber threat landscape includes threats from cybercriminals, terrorist organisations and state actors involved in cyber espionage. That includes the use of cyber means to spread disinformation that risks social unrest, particularly on sensitive political and religious matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India has no official document defining “responsible cyber behaviour”, but its policies and laws provide insights into its approach. Two dimensions shape India’s perspective. First, India stresses international cooperation and adherence to norms that prevent the misuse of ICTs for malign purposes. Given the transnational nature of cyber threats, Indian officials believe that collaboration between states is essential. Second, India defines responsible behaviour domestically by regulating irresponsible cyber activities, such as cyberterrorism and data breaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India’s top‑down approach to cybersecurity focuses on regulatory interventions in which the government plays a central role in guiding private‑sector and civil‑society efforts to protect cyberspace. That approach includes a broad mandate for public authorities, from enforcing punitive measures against noncompliance to conducting surveillance and offensive countermeasures against cyber threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although India is still developing its doctrine on responsible technology use, key pillars are emerging in AI and drones, where privacy and ethical standards are key considerations. In the military domain, cyber‑linked technologies are used for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance and offensive countermeasures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internationally, India advocates for states to refrain from cyber operations that violate norms, such as state‑sponsored cyberterrorism. As a leader of the Global South, India strongly supports CCB. It seeks to create mechanisms such as the UN Cyber Points of Contact Directory to strengthen cooperation and mitigate cyber vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;national-dimensions-2&quot;&gt;National dimensions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Institutions and accountability&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India is the world’s second most “connected” country, with more than 800 million active internet users. The 2022 annual report by CERT‑In highlighted 1,180 cyber threat alerts and vulnerabilities—a 12% increase from 2021. Data breaches pose a major threat to Indian IT infrastructure, especially government servers. India has also been facing significant threats by foreign state and non‑state actors targeting its critical national‑security infrastructure. One example is the threat posed by Chinese cyber actors, which can be placed in the context of the larger, strategically competitive, relationship between India and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India’s perspectives on responsibility can be interpreted from its legislation and government documents. It lacks a unified national cybersecurity policy but relies on several laws to address cyber threats. The Information Technology Act 2000 defines responsible cyber behaviour by mandating “reasonable security practices” to protect sensitive data from unauthorised access and misuse. While the Act doesn’t explicitly refer to “responsible cyber behaviour”, it frames breaches of personal data as irresponsible, requiring strict legal consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2013, India introduced the National Cybersecurity Policy, which promotes cyber hygiene, user responsibility and secure information flows. The policy offers insights into India’s view of cyber responsibility. One objective is to foster a “culture of cybersecurity and privacy enabling responsible user behaviour”. That includes promoting cyber hygiene practices, cooperating with government actors to prevent and prosecute cybercrime, and establishing internal guidelines for secure information flow and crisis management in businesses. The policy encourages businesses to adopt internal security guidelines but has been criticised for imposing rigid requirements, such as the controversial six‑hour cyber incident reporting rule mandated by CERT‑In in 2022. Although intended to enhance security, the rule faced criticism for being unrealistic and having excessive data‑retention mandates. The 2013 policy isn’t binding, and many elements are too broad for targeted action. However, progress has been made on some strategies, such as operating the 24/7 National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre for reporting cybersecurity incidents and establishing a regulatory framework for critical information infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government also views responsible behaviour as ensuring content security, particularly in managing online hate speech and offensive material. The government uses articles 69A, 69B and 79A of the IT Act 2008 (amended) to block content on platforms such as Facebook (Meta) and Twitter (X) when necessary for national security and public order. In 2021, it introduced new intermediary guidelines to enforce technology companies’ cooperation with law enforcement. In February 2021, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology introduced the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, requiring tech companies to cooperate with law enforcement to track users spreading information against the national interest. Those measures aim to “institutionalise social media” as part of the government’s top‑down cyber and IT security approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India’s approach combines domestic cybersecurity governance and content regulation, highlighting its emphasis on national security. However, it faces criticism for impinging on free speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;operational-dimensions-2&quot;&gt;Operational dimensions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsible use of technologies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a hub for ICT services, India governs the acquisition of cyber‑linked technologies through certain regulations targeting the private sector and civilians. The 2023 Telecommunications Act, for instance, requires telecom networks and service providers to comply with cybersecurity standards set by the central government or the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI). The Act mandates secure storage of traffic data and proper management of encryption. It also empowers the government to temporarily take control of telecom services or intercept communications if national security or foreign relations are threatened. The Telecom Regulatory Authority regularly updates the cybersecurity standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no ethics, privacy and cybersecurity guidelines on AI‑based technologies. Instead, AI regulations in India are currently focused on building capacity, developing an indigenous computer cluster and enabling research and innovation in the field. However, the 2023 India AI report, which lists the priorities of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology concerning AI, highlights the risk of generative AI in enabling cybercrime and lists 10 guidelines to build “responsible AI”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;responsible-cyber-operations&quot;&gt;Responsible cyber operations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India has built institutional capacity for offensive cyber operations. In 2018, the Defence Cyber Agency (DCA) and the cyber groups for the Indian Armed Forces were established to empower the military’s cyber capabilities and conduct cyberwarfare. The DCA conducts those operations, which may involve network hacking, surveillance, data recovery and encrypted communication infiltration. The DCA collaborates with CERT‑In and the National Cybersecurity Coordination Centre, which track and report cybersecurity threats. However, the DCA’s activities, budget and operations remain undisclosed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Technical Research Organisation, reporting directly to the Prime Minister’s office, probably oversees offensive operations against cyber aggression, such as data breaches or attacks on critical infrastructure. Such acts of “aggression” may comprise breaches of sensitive data and uploads of critical national‑security information to the dark web, attacks on critical information infrastructure and cyberterrorism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domestic surveillance operations are important to the Indian Government’s policy to address irresponsible cyber behaviour. Under section 69 of the IT Act 2008 (amended), the central and state governments can intercept, monitor or decrypt any information in a computer resource to protect “sovereignty, national security, friendly relations with international governments, [and] integrating public order”. India views responsible cyber behaviour and ICT use as activities that don’t undermine those priorities, authorising all levels of government to tackle threats through surveillance. The Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre under the Ministry of Home Affairs also enables citizens to register as “unlawful content flaggers” to report online content for removal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although oversight mechanisms mandate regular reviews of surveillance operations, parliamentary requests often run up against the inherent secrecy of intelligence operations. The 2021 Pegasus spyware scandal, in which journalists, politicians and activists were surveilled, highlights enduring concerns about unchecked surveillance practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;international-dimensions-2&quot;&gt;International dimensions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;International law and cyber norms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While India supports the global framework for responsible state behaviour in cyberspace, it hasn’t outlined a specific interpretation of how international law applies. One principle that India strongly champions is that state sovereignty and territorial integrity should extend to cyberspace. Officials have emphasised that a state aware of harmful cyber activities originating from, or routed through, its territory must take reasonable steps to stop them, reflecting India’s approach to quasi‑state actors (QSAs) conducting cross‑border cyber operations and the issue of state responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India prioritises countering cyber terrorism. Its contribution to the 2022 OEWG Annual progress report called for strengthened law‑enforcement cooperation to prevent cyberspace from being used for terrorist purposes. At the OEWG’s fifth substantive session in 2023, India highlighted the threat posed by QSAs and state‑sponsored cybercriminals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having been the target of state‑sponsored cyber operations, India has called on international partners to develop joint accountability mechanisms for QSAs’ irresponsible cyber behaviour. Examples include signing a memorandum of understanding between CERT‑In and its Japanese counterpart in 2015 for information‑sharing on cyber threats and vulnerabilities, and the US–India Cyber Relationship Framework, which enables cybersecurity‑related cooperation between law‑enforcement agencies in both countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From India’s perspective, multilateral regulation of QSAs’ activities and the formulation of clear norms of state responsibility for the cyber activities of QSAs operating within states’ territory are important legal principles. India has subsequently argued at the OEWG that “QSAs exploit a legal gap in our understanding that allows them some of the advantages of sovereignty without corresponding obligations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this regard, India has pushed for seamless threat‑intelligence sharing by establishing a global Point of Contact Directory, wherein countries must assign a diplomatic and technical liaison during deliberations on specific cyber/ICT security areas. Beyond just threat‑intelligence sharing, this enables cyber‑related conflict de‑escalation through confidence‑building measures, such as establishing national points of contact. This proposal is part of India’s broader goal to enhance capacity‑building among its key national ICT security stakeholders, such as CERT‑In and the Telecom Cyber Security Incident Response Team. India’s push for a Global Cyber Security Cooperation Portal reflects its commitment to joint capacity building despite enduring constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India lacks a public cyber attribution policy. In response to incidents such as the ShadowPad malware attacks from China, India focuses on building resilience, investing in chief information security officers, formulating cyber crisis management plans, and monitoring threats through the National Cyber Coordination Centre. That reflects India’s reactive approach to cybersecurity, prioritising post‑incident responses over the proactive enforcement of responsible behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Foreign policy and international cooperation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Indian Government’s vision of itself as a leader of the Global South shapes its international cyber engagement. Amid deepening strategic competition between states, India seeks to project its desired leadership role by advocating CCB, especially for less cyber‑mature countries in the Global South. It has signed more than 30 cyber agreements with Global South countries, focusing on dialogue and technical training. Additionally, India exports indigenous technologies, such as the Unified Payment Interface and India Stack, to offer cost‑effective solutions to ICT‑related challenges in developing countries. Those efforts extend to regional organisations such as ASEAN and the IBSA (India, Brazil, South Africa) Dialogue Forum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To a lesser extent, India leverages the Quad partnership with Australia, Japan and the US to advance its cyber and technology interests. While the Quad promotes collaboration in cybersecurity, critical‑infrastructure protection and emerging technologies, India opposes using coordinated countermeasures or joint attribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its global ambitions, India’s top‑down, government‑led approach to cyber governance limits engagement with the private sector and civil society. India’s delegations at the OEWG have excluded private‑sector and civil‑society participation, and its cybersecurity regulations involve minimal consultation with businesses. Although India nominally supports “multistakeholderism”, it hasn’t signed the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace, despite calls by several key Indian non‑government stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;indonesia&quot;&gt;Indonesia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overview-3&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indonesia perceives responsible behaviour in cyberspace as requiring countries to take three main actions: refrain from misusing cybertools to violate another country’s sovereignty; commit to international cooperation; and engage in CCB. That perspective stems from Indonesia’s view of cyberspace as a key vulnerability, and by its limited capacity to enforce laws and investigate cyber incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internationally, Indonesia advocates multilateral cooperation to impose legal and normative constraints on powerful states’ misuse of ICTs. It uses diplomacy to advocate for the peaceful use of ICTs, seek support for capacity‑building and ensure that sovereignty and multilateralism are upheld in international cyber norms. Its approach to international issues in cyberspace is shaped by its commitment to multilateralism, its status as a developing economy with growing cyber capacity, and its insistence on sovereignty as the foundation of international relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it maintains legal and institutional instruments to respond to cyber threats, Indonesia’s capability is hampered by a lack of resources. It maintains cyber capabilities for defensive purposes, though there are insufficient checks to prevent the misuse of ICTs by authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;national-dimensions-3&quot;&gt;National dimensions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Institutions and accountability&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Indonesian Government recognises the transformative powers of digital technology but also acknowledges the risks emanating from cyberspace. The National Cyber and Crypto Agency (Badan Siber dan Sandi Negara, BSSN) reported more than 1 billion “traffic anomalies” in 2022, underscoring the country’s vulnerability to cyber threats, including ransomware and cyber terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indonesia’s approach to cybersecurity crystalised throughout the 2010s. The BSSN, established in 2017 and empowered by a 2021 presidential mandate, is the primary agency responsible for developing, implementing and evaluating cybersecurity policies. Many other government agencies, including the National Police and the Ministry of Communication and Informatics, are also responsible for various aspects of law enforcement and cyber and information security policy formulation. Those agencies maintain international communication channels, which they may use to share information about cyber incidents and coordinate capacity‑building initiatives. BSSN collaborates with civil society and experts to monitor the cyber threat environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indonesia’s legal framework requires organisations to secure their systems. The Personal Data Protection Bill mandates minimum cybersecurity standards, and noncompliance is punishable by fines and imprisonment. The bill was passed in October 2022 and is effective as of October 2024. Nonetheless, exactly how the law will be implemented remains uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internationally, Indonesian officials recognise that international cooperation is another dimension of responsible cyber behaviour. The country’s international cyber engagements emphasise collaboration on CCB, information/intelligence sharing, and strengthening law‑enforcement networks. The government expects cyber‑mature countries to assist less‑developed countries in building the capacity to respond to challenges in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indonesia’s submissions to the ASEAN Regional Forum express concerns that cyberspace is being “misused” by state actors in a manner that “poses risks to international peace and security as well as stability of national political, economic and social [sic] domain”. In response, Indonesia calls on states to “promote the use of ICTs for peaceful purposes”—in particular, with “respect for sovereignty, human rights, fundamental freedoms, as well as sustainable and digital development”. Indonesia has, through the UN OEWG process, called for the international community to pursue a “collective declaration of all states to refrain from militarisation of cyberspace that may undermine international peace and security”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;operational-dimensions-3&quot;&gt;Operational dimensions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsible use and acquisition of technologies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To prevent the misuse of cyberspace, Indonesia has sought to demonstrate greater government control over ICTs through several legislative and regulatory instruments, particularly the 2008 Information and Electronic Transaction (ITE) Law. The law, along with its subsequent revisions (2016 and 2023) and other operational regulations, establishes the legal framework outlining the responsibilities of electronic service operators in Indonesia. Under the ITE Law, hacking and the private possession of hardware, software or other tools used to commit cybercrime are criminal offences. While no specific legal framework regulates the infection of IT systems with malware, under the ITE Law that action can be classified as system interference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the BSSN, the Indonesian Government continuously publishes guidelines and organises practical awareness‑building exercises to build community readiness for cybersecurity incidents. The agency has also published standards and regulations concerning the security of ICT products. However, the BSSN’s capacity to review and audit the technologies used by the government is constrained by under‑resourcing, poor institutional communication about ICT use and limited human capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domestically, Indonesia has no standing government policy on coordinated vulnerability disclosure. However, the Personal Data Protection Bill, strongly modelled on the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, requires organisations affected by data breaches to submit written notifications to the BSSN. While the BSSN and the National Police engage industry and experts to map the cyber threat environment and offer support, the absence of a disclosure requirement limits the government’s capacity to fully grapple with Indonesia’s cyber threat landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsible cyber operations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Indonesian Armed Forces (Tentara Nasional Indonesia, TNI) is responsible for cyber defence. In 2017, the TNI established a cyber unit (Satuan Siber, Satsiber) responsible for developing doctrine, policy and procedures to respond to cyber threats, particularly those targeting defence‑related critical infrastructure. Each branch of the armed services has subordinate cyber units under Satsiber, supported by the Cyber Defence Centre, which operates under the command of the Defence Intelligence Agency within the Ministry of Defence. Discussions are ongoing about creating a “cyber force”, although its shape and purpose haven’t yet been elaborated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this force structure, Indonesia’s cyber defence lacks a formal doctrine. Internal military documents focus on organisational and resource matters, such as coordination, staffing and infrastructure, rather than specifying when and how cybertools should be deployed. Indonesia has no stated policy on offensive cyber operations. Consistent with its largely defensive strategic culture, Indonesia’s cyber capabilities are defensive and don’t serve a purpose beyond protecting national security, fighting cybercrime and cyberterrorism and addressing other domestic challenges. Diplomacy and multilateralism remain key to Indonesia’s approach to addressing external cyber threats. Although long‑term plans to establish offensive cyber capabilities exist, those capabilities haven’t yet materialised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to internal security challenges (particularly terrorism), the Indonesian security apparatus maintains well‑developed capabilities for domestic surveillance. There are publicly known cases of surveillance equipment being used against citizens for purposes other than national security. There’s no single rule for interception, and there are no known guidelines on what is and isn’t permissible. Rather, a series of ministerial and agency regulations provide certain individuals with the authority to conduct cyber‑enabled interceptions. For instance, police surveillance requires the approval of the head of the Criminal Investigation Agency of the National Police (Bareskrim). Those investigations must also, in principle, be based on serious considerations of privacy and human rights. However, existing policy documents don’t clarify the guardrails that would prevent misuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;international-dimensions-3&quot;&gt;International dimensions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;International law and cyber norms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indonesia endorses the global framework of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace and has participated in the UN Group of Governmental Experts (UN GGE). Indonesia has endorsed that international law, particularly the UN Charter, is essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, stable, accessible and peaceful ICT environment. However, the government prefers separate legal arrangements regarding international laws governing cyberspace. Indonesia has specifically argued against the “automatic application of existing laws without examining the context and unique nature of activities in cyberspace” and suggested that “practical adjustment and possible new interpretations are needed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an October 2021 submission to the Ad Hoc Committee on Cybercrime, Indonesia emphasised the wide‑ranging implications of cybercrime. It called for a cybercrime treaty to be mindful of those implications and to reflect the principles of sovereign equality and non‑interference in states’ domestic affairs. It preferred that this treaty considers content‑related crimes, including disinformation and copyright infringement. Consistent with its preference for multilateralism, Indonesia prefers that the treaty promotes cooperation on cybercrime through information sharing and best‑practice exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indonesia is particularly concerned about developing offensive cyber capabilities, fearing they could lead to the militarisation of cyberspace. Its 2015 Defence White Paper noted that “scientific and technological development” will make future wars more likely to be defined by “information superiority”, “cyber‑attacks”, and the misuse of technologies such as “genetic engineering, biotechnology, and nanotechnology”. Indonesia is particularly concerned about threats targeted at critical infrastructure, such as health and information facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Foreign policy and international cooperation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of Indonesia’s leading role in the Non‑Aligned Movement and its embeddedness in ASEAN political culture, public attributions of ICT incidents to other states are unlikely. The government hasn’t politically attributed a cyber‑enabled attack to a state actor. The ITE Law includes provisions on extraterritorial jurisdiction but doesn’t address attribution issues or state‑to‑state activities. Rather, the focus is on encouraging more capacity‑building to help less cyber‑mature countries address cyber challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In pursuing those goals, Indonesia has supported regional cooperation at the ASEAN level, especially in increasing human resource capacity to minimise the capability gap among ASEAN member states. Indonesia has bilateral memorandums of understanding on cyber cooperation with China, the UK, Australia, South Korea, the EU, the US and Russia. Those agreements, which involve the BSSN, cover multiple areas of cooperation, including CCB, establishing points of contact for incident handling, cooperation on cybercrime/cyberterrorism, and spreading radical online content. International cooperation and CCB are perceived as pathways to support Indonesia’s relatively weak capacity in responding to challenges in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indonesia actively advocates for CCB and encourages collaboration with various domestic and international stakeholders. Furthermore, Indonesia has also advocated information‑sharing between states through institutionalised dialogues at the multilateral, regional and bilateral levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A core issue for Indonesia is combating terrorist organisations’ use of digital technology. Faced with challenges such as the spread of Islamic fundamentalism and hate crimes online, government documents highlight the threat of cyberspace being hijacked to “spread hatred and racial ideology”. Demonstrating its commitment to combating cyber terrorism, Indonesia signed up for the 2019 Christchurch Call initiative, which encouraged governments and online service providers to make voluntary commitments aimed at stopping terrorist and other violent content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the threat of terrorism, Indonesia is concerned about the use of cyberspace as an avenue for “disrupt[ing] public order”—a broad term that human rights activists have pointed out could be easily misused. In particular, the ITE Law is frequently weaponised by both authorities and members of the public; reports of defamation, religious blasphemy and disrupting social order frequently dominate cases of cybercrime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;japan&quot;&gt;Japan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overview-4&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s 2021 Cybersecurity Strategy highlights the importance of the rule of law in cyberspace, prioritising norms of responsible state behaviour. The strategy outlines measures to deter irresponsible cyber activities through coordination with allies and comprehensive responses across political, economic, technological, legal and diplomatic spheres. Japan also emphasises confidence‑building measures between states to prevent instability in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A significant part of Japan’s cyber strategy includes capacity‑building initiatives in the Indo‑Pacific, promoting responsible behaviour through public–private collaboration and international cooperation. Japan stresses the importance of multistakeholder engagement in establishing global norms in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan maintains strict constitutional norms, such as the secrecy of communications, and engages in extensive public–private consultations regarding cyberspace and regulating dual‑use technologies. Those legal norms, rooted in its postwar history, are an important tool of its soft power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government plays a central role in protecting critical infrastructure, investigating cyber incidents and regulating the export of dual‑use technologies. Japan’s commitment to international law and norms is reflected in its active participation in shaping global cyber norms through forums such as the UN GGE and OEWG. Japan’s focus on strengthening cybersecurity capabilities, enhancing international cooperation and fostering an open cyberspace reflects its ambition to be a model for responsible cyber behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;national-dimensions-4&quot;&gt;National dimensions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Institutions and accountability&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan seeks a free, fair and secure cyberspace to support economic development and a stable international order. Responsible behaviour in cyberspace involves protecting critical infrastructure, promoting public–private partnerships and fostering international cooperation. The government supports UN norms to promote stability and security. Japan also emphasises cooperation in cybercrime prevention and CCB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan expects public and private entities to implement robust cybersecurity measures to protect ICT infrastructure from malicious actors. Private companies work with government agencies like the National Center of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), and the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications in multistakeholder forums. That collaboration improves practical measures to counter cyber risks. The government aims to set an example by adhering to responsible behaviour norms and encouraging other nations to adopt similar practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;METI plays a key role in regulating technology that could be used for cyberattacks and collaborates with private companies on IT infrastructure security, training and data protection. It’s also one of the core government institutions that cooperates with private companies in strengthening the security of their IT infrastructure, training qualified personnel, building capacity and raising awareness about the required handling of data and protecting privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s Public Security Intelligence Agency (PSIA) publishes annual reports on cyberattacks and attribution. When cyberattacks involve foreign governments or actors, the PSIA coordinates with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defence. Japan uses joint public attribution with partner countries to strengthen responsible behaviour in cyberspace. Those statements, published by the Foreign Ministry, are intended to serve as a disincentive for state actors to use cyberspace maliciously. Japan has recently become more active in joint public attributions, although it remains cautious, particularly with China and Russia. For example, Japan supported the US attribution of the 2017 WannaCry attack to North Korea but remains hesitant to attribute attacks involving China. Japan attributed only six in a 2023 comparative analysis of 164 official public political attribution cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;operational-dimensions-4&quot;&gt;Operational dimensions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsible use and acquisition of technologies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a major electronic equipment exporter, Japan has seen that role diminish, but a select group of Japanese IT and chip manufacturers remain competitive in global markets. Japan’s military and dual‑use technology exports began in 2015, guided by non‑proliferation treaties, including the International Atomic Energy Agency Safeguards and the Wassenaar Arrangement for conventional weapons. It also participates in export‑control frameworks to regulate technologies with potential cybersurveillance applications. In December 2021, Japan began considering stricter domestic measures to regulate the sale of cybersurveillance technologies to countries that violate human rights, in response to the Biden administration’s announcement of a multilateral framework to regulate exports of surveillance technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To limit the export of technologies that can be used for cyber‑enabled attacks, Japanese export regulations cover a range of telecommunication equipment, including fibre‑optic cables and wireless communication wiretapping devices. Japan’s principle guiding weapons and military‑technology exports limits them to friendly countries. Every six months, it updates its End User List, which “provides exporters with referential information on foreign entities for which concern cannot be eliminated regarding involvement in activities such as the development of WMDs or other items”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government has also taken action to manage the expanded role of dual‑use technologies. In December 2022, it issued its revised National Security Strategy, National Defence Strategy and Defence Buildup Program. In the section on “Capabilities in the cyber domain”, the Defence Buildup Program sets out to enhance the cybersecurity capabilities of Japan’s Ministry of Defense and Japan’s Self‑Defense Forces. It will work more closely with critical infrastructure providers and the defence industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, Japan has fallen behind in IT and cybersecurity. It’s placed 32nd out of 64 countries ranked in the 2023 International Institute for Management Development’s World Digital Competitiveness rankings—an index measuring how states adopt digital technologies. This is a drop from its 29th place in 2022 and its peak of 22nd in 2018. In the light of this and in an effort to bolster cybersecurity, the government is working to establish secure command‑and‑control capabilities in high‑priority equipment systems based on a “zero trust” concept. Japan’s Risk Management Framework, introduced in 2023 by the Ministry of Defense and the Self‑Defense Forces, emphasises continuous risk assessment for IT systems and cutting‑edge technology. Since 2015, METI has issued Cybersecurity Management Guidelines for private companies. The guidelines require companies to recognise and report cybersecurity risks and implement organisational cybersecurity measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2022, the US–Japan Economic Policy Consultative Committee published its Plan of Action to strengthen the rules‑based economic order, among other things, by better securing critical and emerging technologies and strengthening supply‑chain resilience. Central to the responsible use of cyberspace were efforts to impose export controls and cybersurveillance systems to counter their misuse by malicious actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s 2022 Cybersecurity Strategy included plans to extend its active cyber‑defence capabilities, improve cyber situational awareness and human capital, and coordinate across ministries to respond to cyber threats. However, it isn’t very detailed regarding what technologies Japanese Government institutions intend to acquire to respond to hacking, surveillance or other invasive technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2024, Japan supported a White House statement to deepen cooperation to counter the proliferation and misuse of spyware. Soon after, METI published an interim report on its policy for revising the export‑control system, which included stronger advance reporting requirements for overseas dual‑use technology transfers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsible cyber operations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operationally, responsible cyber behaviour involves proper authorisation for conducting cyber operations. In Japan, the core institutions that collect cyber intelligence are the Cabinet Intelligence and Research Office and the PSIA, which cooperate with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Defense and the National Police Agency. Each body advises the Cabinet Intelligence Committee and the National Security Council. The PSIA contributes to cyber‑intelligence countermeasures, collecting and analysing HUMINT information. Japan has also taken other steps to enhance its operational capacity, such as joining NATO’s Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite that, Japan has yet to emerge as a leader in government or military cyber operations, both defensive and offensive. Although Japan’s 2018 and 2021 cybersecurity strategies mention “active cyber defence” (ACD), they lack detail. The 2022 National Security Strategy provides more specificity, calling for the “penetrat[ion] and neutralis[ation] of the servers of potential attackers”. However, beyond that, no concrete decisions on ACD activities have been finalised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To strengthen the responsible use of cyberspace, Japan aims to be a model for other countries by ensuring that certain principles, such as data privacy or the secrecy of private communications, are still observed. The most important legal instruments in this regard are article 21 of the Japanese Constitution and article 4 of the Telecommunication Business Act, which guarantee the privacy of communications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reconciling the twin imperatives of maintaining the highest standards of privacy and establishing an effective cyber defence hasn’t been easy. As of November 2024, the Japanese Diet was still debating whether the ACD mentioned in the 2022 National Security Strategy is constitutional. Some politicians and commentators have argued that Japan’s official adoption of ACD would be considered irresponsible. While other countries in the same situation would be more likely to argue that national‑security considerations trump domestic laws, Japan’s calculus is somewhat different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;international-dimensions-4&quot;&gt;International dimensions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;International law and cyber norms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan accepts the UN’s eleven norms of responsible state behaviour as guiding principles of state actions in cyberspace. It’s also committed to confidence‑building measures to increase transparency, predictability and mutual understanding in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2021, Japan issued its Basic Position of the Government of Japan on International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, clarifying how international law applies to cyberspace, identifying violations and outlining tools for states affected by cyber operations. Japan also promotes the Data Free Flow with Trust principles under the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans‑Pacific Partnership and the Japan–US Digital Trade Agreement, advocating for the free flow of information, the rule of law, internet openness, autonomy from malicious control, and multistakeholder governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above all, Japan asserts that states must not violate another state’s sovereignty or intervene in domestic matters. Cyber operations causing physical damage or compromising functionality, especially against critical infrastructure, may constitute violations of sovereignty. Japan supports the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts principle, emphasising the need to attribute cyberattacks, hold states accountable, prevent recurrence and allow countermeasures against enabling states. Japan advocates for peaceful dispute resolution and opposes using force unless cyber operations constitute an armed attack under article 51 of the UN Charter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Foreign policy and international cooperation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan is active in cyber diplomacy through bilateral, regional and global exchanges and cyber‑focused dialogues. Its bilateral dialogues with partners such as the US, the UK and the EU focus on collaborations on regional and global cyber governance. Japan also regularly conducts exchanges and confidence‑building measures with India and ASEAN member states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan has had a few notable successes. Globally, it spearheaded the adoption of the Ise‑Shima G7 Principles and Actions on Cyber for responsible behaviour in cyberspace. Those principles call for closer cooperation between governments, businesses and non‑state actors to uphold rules and laws in cyberspace. Regionally, Japan has led the ASEAN–Japan Cybersecurity Capacity Building Centre, a Japanese partnership with Thailand’s Electronic Transactions Development Agency, which opened in Bangkok in 2018. The centre has trained hundreds of civil servants from ASEAN member states to make government IT systems more resilient against cyberattacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan also supports CCB initiatives through the Japan International Cooperation Agency and partnerships with European counterparts, combining cybersecurity training with broader economic and social development efforts. Addressing cybercrime and intellectual property theft is central to Japan’s agenda, and it argues that trust in the security of IT systems, data privacy and government oversight are crucial for fostering economic growth and innovation. To strengthen domestic political support for those cyber norms, Japan often argues that public trust in the security of information held on IT platforms, data privacy and government oversight of the integrity of IT systems is a core condition for reliance on ICT systems and greater future investment in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pakistan&quot;&gt;Pakistan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;rabia-akhtar&quot;&gt;Rabia Akhtar&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overview-5&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s approach to responsible cyber behaviour combines efforts to create a resilient digital environment at home with a strong stance on global cyber governance. However, Pakistan faces credibility issues. While it promotes responsible behaviour globally, its domestic actions, including using advanced surveillance tools, have raised privacy concerns and accusations of government overreach. That inconsistency creates a gap between Pakistan’s international advocacy and its internal practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pakistan seeks to establish itself as a responsible cyber actor by focusing on domestic security and advocating for the peaceful use of cyberspace. Domestically, the government has taken steps to build a secure and inclusive cyber environment, most notably through the National Cyber Security Policy of 2021. The policy aims to protect critical infrastructure, secure digital assets and safeguard daily activities such as banking and health care. However, despite the policy’s potential benefits, its implementation is hampered by limited resources and institutional capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internationally, Pakistan views the internet as a shared global resource, similar to the oceans or outer space. It actively supports the global framework for responsible state behaviour in cyberspace. It has advocated for a legally binding instrument to regulate cyber actions, including a ban on offensive cyberweapons, reflecting concerns about cyberspace becoming a domain of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;national-dimensions-5&quot;&gt;National dimensions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Institutions and accountability mechanisms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Pakistan, being a responsible state actor in cyberspace means securing its digital landscape and promoting peaceful internet use globally. It supports the UN‑led global framework on responsible state behaviour in cyberspace and advocates for global cooperation to combat cyber threats and share intelligence and best practices. Pakistan recognises collaboration as crucial for building resilience against cyberattacks, especially given its limited cyber capabilities. Pakistan further emphasises equitable internet access, viewing it as a global common. Politically, protecting national sovereignty and critical infrastructure from cyber threats drives the agenda towards robust cybersecurity measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domestically, the government encourages companies and individuals to meet basic cybersecurity standards. The National Cyber Security Policy 2021 mandates appointing chief information security officers and complying with national security standards. The government also encourages incident reporting to the National Cyber Emergency Response Team and prioritises digital literacy to promote safe online practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While progress is underway, Pakistan faces challenges in applying national cybersecurity standards and lacks accredited experts, leaving systems vulnerable to attacks. However, after cyber incidents targeting its ICT infrastructure, Pakistan’s Economic Coordination Committee approved a US$36 million investment to enhance technical capabilities in 2024. That followed the launch of the 2021 cybersecurity policy, which identified 11 cybersecurity risks and challenges, including phishing campaigns and for‑hire hacker services. The policy was the culmination of a series of government discussions and initiatives that were initially triggered by the 2013 Snowden revelations, which exposed the UK’s surveillance of Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s cybersecurity policy explicitly states that cyberattacks on Pakistan’s critical infrastructure or critical information infrastructure are acts of aggression against national sovereignty. The policy reinforces the notion that other states are expected to behave responsibly. The policy also mandates that organisations in critical sectors adhere to national cybersecurity standards and appoint qualified cybersecurity professionals. The CERT Rules of 2023 further promote incident reporting, while the Cyber Patriot Program incentivises public involvement in identifying vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The policy further emphasises international cooperation to protect Pakistani citizens from cyberattacks. Pakistan recognises that cyber threats can emerge from poorly protected systems outside its borders. The policy emphasises cooperation with international law‑enforcement and cybersecurity organisations, sharing threat information, coordinating responses and taking proactive measures to protect its digital systems and citizens’ data from external threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;operational-dimensions-5&quot;&gt;Operational dimensions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsible use and acquisition of technologies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to acute internal security concerns, the Pakistan Government and some private entities have obtained various advanced surveillance tools. For example, since 2012, the Federal Investigation Agency has used advanced phone‑hacking tools from Cellebrite, an Israeli digital intelligence company, acquired through a third party in Singapore. Meanwhile, in 2015, several Pakistani contractors with alleged ties to state institutions attempted to procure a software suite from the Italian firm Hacking Team, which would allow for discreet monitoring of computers and mobile devices. There are no specific rules or transparency requirements for procuring and selling those technologies, raising concerns about the legitimacy of their use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite those technological procurements, Pakistan still lacks comprehensive cybersecurity standards. The government has struggled to properly implement legislation and regulations on data security, supply‑chain security, vulnerability management and data‑breach reporting. That oversight leaves the country vulnerable to cyber threats and fails to allay ethical concerns regarding the use of surveillance technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, a closer look at Pakistan’s practices reveals a troubling pattern of irresponsibly using technology to monitor its own citizens. The lack of transparency and control over those powerful tools has led to overreach and potential violations of privacy. For instance, Human Rights Watch reports that non‑government organisations in Pakistan have faced intimidation, harassment and surveillance by government authorities, highlighting a misuse of surveillance technologies. Digital authoritarianism is also on the rise in Pakistan: one study has revealed that the government uses advanced surveillance technology and strict digital laws to monitor and control online activities. That control includes internet shutdowns, censorship and the targeting of dissidents. State agencies often collaborate with technology companies to enforce those measures under the guise of protecting national security and public order. However, activists and civil‑society groups do push back against those restrictions. Despite harassment and legal challenges, they continue to advocate publicly for protecting internet freedom in Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsible cyber operations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Response Center for Cyber Crimes, a law enforcement agency under the Federal Investigation Agency, specialises in addressing cybercrime. Beyond that, understanding the operations of Pakistan’s national security, defence and intelligence agencies’ cyber units is challenging due to a lack of publicly accessible data. Pakistan doesn’t publicly disclose its offensive cyber capabilities, but the country does advocate for a prohibition on developing offensive cyberweapons. However, the Cyber Operations Tracker by the Council on Foreign Relations has recorded at least 13 reported cyber operations allegedly sponsored by Pakistan since 2020. Accusations have been made regarding the alleged involvement of Pakistan’s Inter‑Services Intelligence, the country’s principal intelligence agency, in supervising or supporting various hacking groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;international-dimensions-5&quot;&gt;International dimensions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;International law and cyber norms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pakistan believes that established principles of non‑use of force, sovereign equality, peaceful dispute resolution and non‑interventionism apply to cyberspace. Officials have highlighted the grave risk of a “cyber arms race” and the potential unintended consequences of developing and using such technologies. In the light of this, Pakistan has called for an “outright ban on the development of offensive cyber weapons”, which could cause widespread disruption to critical infrastructure and have wider political ramifications. The country has also called for an inclusive and transparent dialogue to address the issue of cyber arms control and to establish norms and rules of behaviour in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acknowledging definitional challenges in the international law, Pakistan has stressed the need to more concretely define key terms such as “cyber attack” and “cyber terrorism”. It supports legally binding instruments to regulate state behaviour and promote the responsible use of digital technologies. It also supports international cooperation as necessary to develop an effective framework to promote responsible state behaviour in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pakistan faces credibility issues in its stance on cyber norms. Domestically, it’s been criticised for using surveillance technologies to monitor its citizens under the guise of national security. Internationally, it promotes responsible behaviour in cyberspace, creating a contradiction between its actions at home and abroad. To resolve that, Pakistan must align its domestic practices with its international commitments, enhancing trust and reputation at home and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;foreign-policy-and-international-cooperation&quot;&gt;Foreign policy and international cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s foreign policy approach regarding cybersecurity seeks to ensure its continued influence in shaping global and regional initiatives. To that end, Pakistan engages internationally in various cyber‑related forums, including UN OEWG, the International Telecommunication Union and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. That approach also emphasises the need for trusted information exchange about cyber threats with public, intergovernmental and non‑governmental bodies, including liaison and coordination with national and international cybercrime agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of its advocacy against the proliferation of “offensive cyber weapons”, the Pakistan Government has also advocated bridging the digital divide between developed and developing countries. Pakistan believes that the internet is a precious “common heritage of mankind”, as are other global commons such as space and oceans—a reference explicitly outlined in its position on the applicability of international law in cyberspace. At its core, Pakistan envisions a world in which the benefits and opportunities of the internet are accessible to all, ensuring equitable distribution for the progress of humanity. That vision has informed its preference to see international cooperation for capacity building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;taiwan&quot;&gt;Taiwan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;yisuo-tzeng-and-louise-marie-hurel&quot;&gt;Yisuo Tzeng and Louise Marie Hurel&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overview-6&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan doesn’t explicitly use the term “responsible cyber behaviour”. However, its perception of state responsibility is tightly interlinked with having the capacity to build economic and security resilience in the face of tensions with China. For Taiwan, the concept of responsible cyber behaviour encompasses three core (if implicit) elements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;responsibility as the willingness to refrain from interfering in the domestic affairs of other states&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;responsibility as the domestic capacity to respond to and protect against such interference&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;responsibility as the commitment to maintaining a free and open internet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those views of responsibility take shape in the unique context of cross‑strait relations. The oscillating temperature of those relations has often meant that Taiwan must balance its approach in reactive and preventive ways across all three dimensions of responsible cyber behaviour: international, domestic and operational.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan has continually ramped up its domestic cybersecurity institutions, especially since 2016, when Tsai Ing‑wen assumed the presidency. Legislative efforts have also sought to establish clearer roles and responsibilities domestically for baseline cyber and data security measures. Political leadership and oversight on the use of cyber capabilities and ICTs by the military mean that their use is largely restricted to defensive purposes. Despite its non‑recognition at the UN and absence in different multilateral forums, Taiwan does adhere to the norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;national-dimensions-6&quot;&gt;National dimensions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Institutions and accountability&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s view of responsible cyber behaviour is substantively informed by national security considerations, primarily due to ongoing cyber‑enabled threats from the People’s Republic of China. Taiwan’s government has upheld the cardinal principle that “cyber security is national security” since the publication of the 2017 National Cyber Security Program of Taiwan. That document outlined primarily what the government needs to do to improve cybersecurity to forestall foreign adversarial malign infiltration/influence. For instance, Taiwan deems it vital to protect critical information infrastructure from sabotage by hackers sponsored by the Chinese Government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to the mounting cyberattacks and influence operations from China, Taiwan’s 2018 Cyber Security Management Act established standards for the public and private sectors, requiring chief information security officers, cybersecurity training and incident‑response mechanisms. Noncompliance leads to penalties, reflecting Taiwan’s strong stance on cybersecurity accountability. The Act establishes baseline standards for public‑ and private‑sector accountability in cybersecurity. It designates the Executive Yuan as the competent authority stipulating “cyber security responsibility levels” for government and “specific non‑government agencies” (critical infrastructure providers, government‑owned enterprises and government‑endowed foundations). The Act also supports establishing a particular domestic understanding of responsibility through “negative measures”. The Act designates penalties for specific non‑governmental agencies that fail to comply with the regulation (that is, develop, amend or implement a cybersecurity maintenance plan, submit a report on implementation and improvement of a plan, establish an incident‑response mechanism and/or report a cybersecurity incident).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond national‑security concerns, Taiwan’s attitude to responsible cyber behaviour is also informed by public apprehensions over privacy—which, given concerns about espionage and insider threats, can be a fine balance. Taiwan maintains laws and regulations that monitor property rights infringements, child abuse, hate speech and disinformation. The legislation on personal data protection goes way back to the Personal Data Protection Act of 2015, which stipulates only the responsibility to protect personal data collected by necessary, appropriate means. That said, organisations responsible for personal data leaks bear the responsibility to cover the tangible and intangible losses and, in certain cases, can even face criminal prosecutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disinformation campaigns, often linked to Chinese influence operations, are treated as national‑security threats in Taiwan. Espionage, cognitive warfare and subversion have become regular tactics used by China to destabilise Taiwan, influence public opinion and disrupt Taiwan’s relations with key allies such as the US. Taiwan’s legal amendments target disinformation for undermining social order and national security and demonstrate its approach to responsible cyber behaviour by criminalising harmful activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed expansion of Taiwan’s domestic intelligence apparatus sparked opposition concerns over political surveillance and fears of excessive government surveillance. In response, the government adopted a “patch management” approach, amending existing laws rather than drafting a new overarching cybersecurity act. Amendments to laws such as the Criminal Code and the National Security Act target those spreading disinformation or harming social order and national security. By criminalising harmful conduct and unauthorised data access, Taiwan primarily addresses individual and organisational actions rather than broader geopolitical issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;operational-dimensions-6&quot;&gt;Operational dimensions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsible use and acquisition of technologies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to its broader diplomatic isolation, Taiwan remains excluded from most multilateral organisations. However, it still adheres to many international norms and resolutions approved by the UN and multistakeholder agreements. In the cyber domain, Taiwan’s Ministry of Economic Affairs and the newly established Ministry of Digital Affairs promote the growth of its cybersecurity industry while upholding non‑invasive, democratic, rules‑based frameworks such as the Wassenaar Arrangement. For example, acquisitions or exports of cyber‑related technologies must be checked against the Wassenaar control list of cyber‑intrusive tools. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Taiwan followed the US’s path by imposing export controls on chips, cybersecurity software and servers destined for Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan also closely follows the US Bureau of Industry and Security regulatory list to align with the US’s decoupling and de‑risking from China. Taiwanese Government agencies, including the ministries of Justice and National Defense, call for the cybersecurity industry to avoid buying or selling banned Chinese surveillance technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Taiwan lacks specific regulations for supply‑chain cybersecurity, its public and private sectors closely follow the US Department of Defense’s Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) to safeguard the flow of controlled unclassified information. Taiwan’s Ministry of Digital Affairs, not the Ministry of National Defence, oversees efforts to implement CMMC certification, given historical sensitivities regarding military involvement in business affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Taiwan’s armed forces depend on the supply of US weapons, Taiwan has also cultivated a defence industrial base mostly composed of small to medium‑sized enterprises, including some cybersecurity capabilities. To encourage defence industrial base enterprises to further invest in improved cybersecurity, many seek to achieve CMMC certification and join the US defence industrial base supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsible cyber operations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several government agencies, each with specific cyber operations capabilities, handle cyber threats. The Cyber Command (Information, Communications and Electronic Force Command), established in 2017, leads those efforts. Before its formation, Taiwan’s intelligence apparatus had already developed cyber operations units. The National Security Bureau leads the intelligence community with two cyber operations units and one for countering disinformation. The Military Intelligence Agency of the Ministry of Defense focuses on cyber espionage, while the Psychological Operations Platoon of the Political Warfare Department oversees influence campaigns and counters malign influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its inauguration, then President Tsai Ing‑wen emphasised the Cyber Command’s defensive nature, noting that its primary mission is to protect military ICT infrastructure and national critical information systems. However, Taiwan’s defence posture is evolving. The latest defence reports show a shift towards “defending forward”—a concept modelled after US and UK active cyber defence strategies. The 2023 Annual defense report acknowledged that cyber and electronic warfare tactics have become essential for modern battlefields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan faces significant challenges in recruiting and retaining cybersecurity talent, which hinders the growth of its military cyber capabilities. Efforts to collaborate with “white‑hat” hackers remain contentious due to trust and reliability concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the counterintelligence and criminal investigation front, the Investigative Bureau of the Ministry of Justice and the National Policy Agency of the Ministry of Interior have long been experienced in digital crime investigations. Law enforcement requires a warrant for any cyber‑intrusive actions, and intelligence operations must follow clear orders and rules of engagement, ensuring legality and oversight in Taiwan’s cybersecurity efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;international-dimensions-6&quot;&gt;International dimensions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;International law and cyber norms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite challenges, the Taiwanese Government remains committed to the application of international law in cyberspace, although it hasn’t elaborated on how it applies. In particular, questions remain about how international law, specifically international humanitarian law, would apply in an armed conflict between Taiwan and China, given the contested views regarding Taiwan’s status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Foreign policy and international cooperation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Taiwan largely isolated from the institutions of global governance, the country has instead sought participation in alternative multistakeholder and technical forums. Those include the Asia Pacific Regional Internet Governance Forum (held in Taipei in 2024), the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers and the Forum on Incident Response Teams. The Taiwan Internet Governance Forum has become iconic for connecting Taiwan to the global discourse on cyber governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, such experiences also speak to the core principles of Taiwan’s approach to cyber diplomacy: the commitment to a free, open internet—which equally underpins international initiatives such as the UN Global Digital Compact and the Freedom Online Coalition. Demonstrating Taiwan’s commitment to that principle—and rejecting those that don’t commit—Taiwanese MP Audrey Tang (now Digital Affairs Minister) delivered a tele‑speech at the UN Internet Governance Forum in 2017 to break through China’s attempts to block Taiwan’s participation in international forums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International cooperation can be framed in different ways. In 2023, lawmakers in the US introduced the Taiwan Cybersecurity Resiliency Act, “which would require the US Department of Defense to expand cybersecurity cooperation with Taiwan to help it counter cyber threats from China”. Other types of cooperation have included joint cyber exercises. That was the case, for example, for a Taiwan–US cybersecurity offensive and defensive exercise led by the Department of Cyber Security of the Executive Yuan.&lt;/p&gt;

In practice, however, intelligence sharing is beset with difficulties, including limited trust, poor bureaucratic procedures, and under-resourcing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intelligence sharing is vital to America’s security. Through it, the United States has gained information about security threats, identified opportunities to counter them, and provided similar benefits to allies—all at a relatively low cost. In addition, intelligence sharing has helped the United States and its allies form closer relationships overall, improving military, economic, and diplomatic ties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite many joint collection and assessment successes, intelligence sharing sometimes fails to live up to its promise. As Sean Corbett and James Danoy—former senior British and U.S. intelligence officials, respectively—have written, “With few exceptions, and despite the best of intentions, intelligence sharing is uneven, remains the exception rather than the norm, and the prospect of simultaneity at the point of need is remote.” Because of its secretive nature, intelligence sharing generates fewer headlines and open complaints than other forms of cooperation; but in behind-the-scenes discussions with U.S. and allied officials and experts, frustration has been as common as praise. Although intelligence sharing has bolstered overall relations in many cases, systems of sharing frequently lack the bureaucratic foundations needed to enable smooth relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of sharing failures, though hard to measure, can be felt in several pernicious ways. Allies and partners may be slow to realize dangers posed by revisionist powers such as China, Russia, and Iran. Advanced planning based on varied intelligence assessments can hinder cooperation in a crisis. An ineffective division of labor may cause collection and analysis to suffer from both gaps and overlap. Intelligence sharing can bolster overall diplomacy between allies; without it, an important pillar of that relationship is weakened. But intelligence sharing problems may prove especially costly in an era of renewed great power competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been many instances in which intelligence sharing has produced impressive successes. The “Five Eyes” (FVEY) partnership—a longstanding intelligence sharing arrangement between the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Britain, and New Zealand—has resulted in improved collection, better analysis, and greater burden sharing for its members. Outside of this longstanding partnership, the United States and its allies successfully expanded intelligence sharing after 9/11 and after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, suggesting that barriers can be overcome in moments of crisis. Even so, significant intelligence sharing can be slow, as well as incomplete in its scope and scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although allies and partners share the blame, the United States often makes it harder for well-meaning allies to cooperate with its intelligence services. This essay contends that U.S. intelligence sharing suffers in the following ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trust problems, often originating outside of intelligence circles and ranging from perceived interest differences to fears that the United States will use intelligence to manipulate decisionmaking&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Diplomatic and political costs to allies and partners should their relationship with U.S. intelligence become public&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A U.S. release system that emphasizes security over sharing, which often results in complex procedures and a default to Not Releasable to Foreign Nationals (NOFORN) even when the information does not involve highly sensitive sources and methods&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Difficulties in interfacing with allied services for resource, bureaucratic, and technical reasons&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unclear prioritization, which results in insufficient incentives for mission-driven sharing&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An under-resourced bureaucratic system that at times undervalues intelligence sharing, allows different agencies to apply different standards, defaults to NOFORN, and imposes harsh penalties on individual officers for potential mistakes, creating strong incentives against sharing&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remedy these problems, the United States should take the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Improve prioritization of intelligence sharing with key allies and encourage those allies to improve their technical systems and overall intelligence resourcing&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Relax some security requirements with allies and help them improve their own procedures, recognizing that intelligence sharing must be mission-driven and that security violations are likely as allies make these improvements&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alter U.S. procedures so that NOFORN is used less frequently with non-Five Eyes allies, thus enhancing mission effectiveness&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Share more information in low-risk areas—such as climate security—in order to develop procedures and trust for higher-risk cooperation&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dedicate more resources and personnel to increase the speed and scale of intelligence sharing within existing agencies&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Expand high-level sharing beyond the Five Eyes partnership on a finite set of issues (approved at the policy level), with particular emphasis on important partnerships in Asia (e.g., South Korea and Japan) and Europe (e.g., Germany and Poland)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In drawing these findings and making these recommendations, this report examines a range of academic, think tank, and government writings on intelligence. In addition, over 35 interviews were held with current and former U.S. and allied security experts, diplomats, and intelligence officials of varying ranks and seniority. Given the nature of the subject, the interviews were conducted off the record. No questions on collection, sources, methods, or other sensitive areas were asked or discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report consists of four sections. The first describes the importance of intelligence sharing for U.S. security. The second section describes current models of intelligence sharing, such as bilateral cooperation and the Five Eyes arrangement. The third section details a range of problems that plague current intelligence sharing efforts, using examples primarily from five countries: Australia, Japan, Poland, South Korea, and the United Kingdom. Drawing on this analysis, the essay’s fourth section offers recommendations for improving intelligence sharing and notes factors that are unlikely to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chapter-01-the-importance-of-intelligence-sharing&quot;&gt;CHAPTER 01 The Importance of Intelligence Sharing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharing intelligence with the right partners offers many potential benefits. No intelligence service knows everything, and even small nations have valuable human sources or other assets in their own neighborhoods. As a former head of the UK Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) put it, intelligence is “a team sport.” As scholar Jennifer Sims points out, intelligence liaison can lower overall collection costs, improve timeliness, and facilitate effective joint operations. Intelligence partners may also have advantages in language skills (a particular U.S. weakness), historical relationships, and access. Estonia, for example, has a superb service with many Russian speakers and a longtime Russian focus. Some allies have an official presence in places like Iran and North Korea, where direct U.S. access is limited to nonexistent. Allied access is also vital in places like China, where any American—especially an American official—is constantly monitored. Some intelligence services, such as those of the United Kingdom, have global reach. In addition, access and capabilities can take years to build, so it is often vital to draw on partners with preexisting assets in a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The counterterrorism era yielded numerous instances of successful intelligence sharing that made the United States and its partners safer. Allies generated intelligence and often served as the tip of the spear, arresting or otherwise disrupting suspected terrorists. The capture of terrorists such as David Headley and Najibullah Zazi relied heavily on British intelligence, and Saudi Arabia played an important role in preventing terrorist attacks from Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intelligence sharing is also vital for effective coalition military operations. U.S. military campaigns against the Islamic State and Al Qaeda have demonstrated the value of such sharing for counterterrorism purposes. The U.S.-Poland ballistic missile defense agreement, for example, requires intelligence cooperation to ensure the security of U.S. installations, launchers, and technical data. Similarly, the United States and South Korea share intelligence on space as part of a broader effort that includes training and exercises. Beyond tactical sharing of battlefield information, intelligence exchanges also facilitate joint planning. As one European official put it, “All plans depend on intelligence. Bad intelligence means bad plans.” U.S. deployments related to Russia and China often depend on effective intelligence relationships with regional states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such relationships can also bolster overall diplomacy and alliance strength. One former allied official noted that U.S. assessments shaped their own country’s worldview in dozens of small ways that, over time, brought the two into greater alignment. Intelligence relationships facilitate trust that can be useful for negotiations on more traditional foreign policy issues such as peace talks between belligerents. Polish officials noted in interviews that intelligence cooperation was an important part of their country’s overall relationship with the United States. Over time, shared intelligence also contributes to a shared worldview and set of threat perceptions. As former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld once noted, “To the extent we are all working off the same set of facts, or roughly the same set of facts, the people from our respective countries tend to come to roughly the same conclusions, and to the extent we’re not working off the same set of facts, we tend not to.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;great-power-competition-and-intelligence-sharing&quot;&gt;Great Power Competition and Intelligence Sharing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 9/11 attacks led to a massive change in intelligence liaison, with terrorism-related intelligence coming to the fore. Attention focused on improving liaison with countries that had a jihadist presence or were otherwise on the front line of the struggle against terrorism. In contrast to the Soviet Union in the Cold War–era, Al Qaeda, the Islamic State, and other jihadist movements had little in the way of sophisticated counterintelligence: Information might be revealed to an adversary through leaks, but the odds of an Al Qaeda penetration of U.S. or other allied services were low. Jihadist signals intelligence (SIGINT) collection was also limited, especially when compared to great power adversaries’ capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great power competition, however, poses a new set of intelligence challenges. Multiple U.S. administrations have tried, not always successfully, to reduce focus on the greater Middle East. As in the Cold War, Russia has been an area of increased emphasis, with allies in Europe posed to play a critical role in confronting Moscow. Strong bilateral relationships, robust alliance structures like NATO, and other arrangements that involve intelligence—many of which were developed during the Cold War—will serve the United States well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China, however, is a far bigger long-term concern, and one that Cold War structures will not meet. Many European allies and partners have shared intelligence with the United States and each other for decades. East Asian allies and partners, in contrast, have limited collection capabilities; they have not had robust sharing relationships with the United States for long periods of time and share even less intelligence among themselves. Asian allies also have complicated relationships with China, given its economic importance and its increasingly dominant position regionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security risks are also much greater than they were in the post-9/11 era. China and Russia both have effective intelligence and counterintelligence services. They guard their information more effectively than the post-9/11 jihadist movements did, which creates a need for more sophisticated collection efforts. In addition, they are aggressively trying to penetrate U.S. services, as well as those of U.S. allies and partners. As a result, the risk of U.S. information ending up in adversaries’ hands is much greater now than in the era when counterterrorism was the priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-turning-point-for-intelligence-cooperation&quot;&gt;A Turning Point for Intelligence Cooperation?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as the start of the Cold War and the events of 9/11 led to significant intelligence liaison changes, recent international turmoil and changing U.S. priorities offer opportunities for the restructuring and improvement of intelligence sharing. The Ukraine war has highlighted the Russian threat, energizing European states and increasing their day-to-day security cooperation with both the United States and one another. In Asia, the rise of China has alarmed states as diverse as Australia, Japan, the Philippines, South Korea, and Taiwan, creating the potential for greater cooperation against a shared threat. The signing of the Australia-United Kingdom-United States (AUKUS) agreement in 2021 is one sign of how regional relationships are being reordered and institutionalized. However, as one official involved in AUKUS noted, even as arms sales and defense cooperation have improved dramatically, “intelligence has not kept pace.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-scale-of-intelligence-sharing-and-us-commitment&quot;&gt;The Scale of Intelligence Sharing and U.S. Commitment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although this paper focuses primarily on ways to bolster intelligence sharing, it is important to acknowledge the considerable and usually fruitful sharing that already exists with partners. The United States regularly engages with numerous civilian and military partners abroad, sharing finished human, signals, geospatial, and other intelligence on a daily basis. This sharing often increases in response to crises, such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, or to growing threats, such as Iran’s malign adventurism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intelligence community is aware of the depth of the challenge. Within the U.S. system, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) were created to overcome internal stovepiping, while combatant commands have created fusion cells with partners to ensure information flows during war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intelligence community members often have a strong understanding of partner needs. Country teams focus on how to manage liaison relationships, a process augmented by liaison visits and analytic exchanges. Senior officials regularly discuss what to share and what not to share, making decisions based on their own impressive backgrounds in the countries and issues in question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because this paper focuses on ways to improve sharing, interview questions often zeroed in on problems. However, the vast majority of the interviewees stressed the value of U.S. intelligence sharing and noted that many officials were highly committed to a strong relationship between the United States and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chapter-02-intelligence-sharing-structures&quot;&gt;CHAPTER 02 Intelligence Sharing Structures&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intelligence scholar H. Bradford Westerfield notes that the particulars of intelligence liaison vary considerably and can include sharing information, working together on operations, and full-fledged joint collection. Liaison may also involve training, financial support, and providing technical or other supplies. Sometimes arrangements are institutionalized via a memorandum of understanding or similar means; sometimes they are informal. At times agencies exchange finished assessments; but one former intelligence official interviewed stressed the value of sharing raw intelligence, which enables agencies to “check each other’s homework” and even source knowledge. In other cases, sharing may involve requests for political support, military equipment, or other non-intelligence benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;bilateral-structures&quot;&gt;Bilateral Structures&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bilateral cooperation is usually the preferred form of intelligence liaison. This is primarily for security reasons, though it also proves convenient at times for two countries to unite on a particular issue of mutual concern. The more widely information is disseminated, the more likely it is to be revealed through spying, media leaks, or other unauthorized disclosures. Historically, many U.S. intelligence engagements in Asia have been bilateral. The United States has long had strong relations with Japan and South Korea, but information has largely been shared directly, rather than as part of a larger grouping. For example, the United States gives South Korea the critical signals intelligence it lacks, while South Korea provides human intelligence in exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;multilateral-structures&quot;&gt;Multilateral Structures&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has multilateral exchanges via alliances such as NATO. Similarly, Europe has arrangements like the Berne Group for sharing intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some U.S. multilateral sharing relations are stunted due to limited trust in allied security systems and procedures, fears of adversary penetration, or concerns that allies’ different interests might lead them to disclose information to adversaries. Often these arrangements facilitate the exchange of overly broad reports that do not offer detailed intelligence, for fear of information being compromised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, because of information security concerns, larger circles tend to lead to weaker cooperation. As Sims contends, “The quality of the exchange will generally be determined by the least trusted (most suspect) member of the group.” As a result, multilateral liaison often leads nowhere, with members fearing that the weak security of one participant will compromise the entire group. This is particularly true of more sensitive collection and sourcing discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-five-eyes&quot;&gt;The Five Eyes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are, however, impressive exceptions to the general dominance of the bilateral sharing model. The Five Eyes alliance, which grew out of the U.S.-UK World War II partnership and has been around for over 70 years, is often held up as the gold standard for intelligence sharing. As scholars have noted, the Five Eyes “is unique in the combination of its longevity, its resilience to changing global circumstances, and its ability to survive periodic tensions as well as maintain an ongoing similarity in the worldviews of its membership.” The countries involved share intelligence related to foreign communications and methods of collection. They also share finished intelligence products. A senior British intelligence official pointed out that the U.S.-UK SIGINT relationship is so strong that “customers in both capitals seldom know which country generated either the access or the product itself.” Although the historical emphasis on signals intelligence remains important today, Five Eyes members also share assessments, as well as procedures and terms for classifying information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Five Eyes alliance has achieved these successes for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Five Eyes countries share values, interests, and language; longstanding institutionalization has further strengthened bonds. The United Kingdom helped establish U.S. and other allied intelligence organizations during and after World War II, often using British models, and this shared foundation has made later cooperation easier.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The division of labor is meaningful among Five Eyes members, with different countries having responsibility for different parts of the world. For example, according to intelligence historian Corey Pfluke, Australia monitors South and East Asian communication, while New Zealand covers the South Pacific and Southeast Asia. An Australian Department of Defense study found that “the US looks to Australia for all SIGINT in our region of principal coverage and does not duplicate the effort,” citing Islamic extremism as an example. Partners respond to each other’s needs when they do not have their own reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Five Eyes share exchange liaison officers, do joint operations, have joint communication channels, and jointly staff many important facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Five Eyes can “follow the sun,” passing off a task from one partner to another for around-the-clock operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over time, the Five Eyes’ shared activities, personnel swaps, and institutionalization have generated personal relationships, which in turn have led to greater trust among institutions, understanding of different systems, and opportunities for bureaucratic work arounds.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Five Eyes nations have reportedly agreed not to spy on one another. This “no-spy” pact further bolsters confidence that intelligence officers from Five Eyes countries are there to help with common problems, not to secretly collect intelligence of their own.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Five Eyes nations respect each other’s areas of influence. For instance, one U.S. official noted that a decision in Indonesia would never be made without input from Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note, however, that the Five Eyes relationship has endured many problems over the years. During World War II, the United Kingdom had security concerns about passing analysis to the United States. Simultaneously, both the United States and the United Kingdom had concerns about sharing SIGINT with Australia due to lax security procedures there. As a result, they restricted access, excluding much of Australia’s cabinet. Political differences also shaped the early relationship. London did not circulate Joint Intelligence Committee papers on Palestine during partition because of perceived “Jewish sympathies” in Washington. Over the years, all five countries have had serious security lapses that have compromised sources. Such lapses have included the “Cambridge Five” in the United Kingdom, Aldrich Ames and Ana Montes in the United States, the Soviet mole Ian George Peacock in Australia, a 2021 Chinese cyberattack that infiltrated New Zealand government systems, and the connections of numerous Canadian politicians to Chinese intelligence officers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relative importance of some Five Eyes members may shift with the rise of China. One expert noted that concerns about China have already “turbocharged” the Five Eyes, with Australia in particular playing an unprecedented role. New Zealand, a less important player in the Cold War and post–Cold War eras, given its distance from the Soviet Union, is now situated to be an important intelligence partner in the South Pacific, Antarctica, and various parts of Asia, although resources remain an issue for Wellington. Conversely, Canada’s importance may decrease relative to that of other members given its distance from Asia. As existing relations change, more complaints are likely. With new priorities and additional points of contact emerging, new points of friction will arise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;other-sharing-arrangements&quot;&gt;Other Sharing Arrangements&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the Five Eyes, press reporting indicates that the United States has other circles of information sharing. The so-called “Nine Eyes” partnership includes Denmark, France, the Netherlands, and Norway, in addition to the Five Eyes countries. The “Fourteen Eyes” adds Belgium, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Sweden. These relationships, however, are not as institutionalized as the Five Eyes. The United States also recently organized the Framework Intelligence Group to facilitate the release of Secret-level information to 14 member states: the Five Eyes, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, and Spain. Many instances of multilateral sharing are ad hoc and occur during crises. U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) shared information related to Iranian ballistic missiles in order to help Israel defeat Iran’s attacks in April and October 2024. The United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Jordan all provided capabilities to assist Israeli air defense, which in turn required intelligence sharing among these countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has also tried to foster intelligence relationships among and between its partners. Historically, Japan and South Korea have each had bilateral intelligence relationships with the United States, with any information relevant to the other shared only via transmission through Washington. In 2016, the two Asian countries agreed to the General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA), allowing them to share intelligence on North Korean military and nuclear activities with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allies often have important relationships of their own. Taiwan and Japan have long had a strong bilateral intelligence relationship. Similarly, although the United Kingdom’s military capacity has declined, it maintains a strong intelligence capacity, which it uses in bilateral relationships to advance its interests. Five Eyes partners also have their own liaison partners: Canada and Australia, for example, each have relationships with over 100 countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chapter-03-common-intelligence-cooperation-problems&quot;&gt;CHAPTER 03 Common Intelligence Cooperation Problems&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and its allies and partners suffer from numerous problems in intelligence relationships. Some of these are structural, involving different interests and cultures, and are difficult or impossible to overcome. Still other problems—notably those regarding security procedures—involve tradeoffs, with greater sharing leading to higher chances of valuable human sources and sophisticated and expensive technical methods being lost. In other cases, however, the problems are own goals, with procedural or bureaucratic issues causing numerous complications. These issues, detailed below, can be grouped into five categories: trust concerns, autonomy concerns, security barriers, incompatible interfaces, and bureaucratic barriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section expands upon those problems and tensions, using the experiences of Australia, Japan, Poland, South Korea, and the United Kingdom. These countries were chosen for several reasons. Two of them—Australia and the United Kingdom—are long-standing Five Eyes partners. The issues they experience suggest how problems can endure even within the closest intelligence relationships. Japan and South Korea also have a close relationship, but one in which intelligence sharing is less institutionalized, even as the threat of China grows. Finally, Poland is a relatively new ally, but its intelligence importance has increased considerably as the United States has renewed its attention on the Russian security threat. Many of these countries have significant problems of their own that raise legitimate complications for intelligence sharing, but this paper focuses primarily on issues that affect how the United States might improve sharing on its end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;obstacle-1-trust-concerns&quot;&gt;Obstacle 1: Trust Concerns&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While even close allies often have trouble fully trusting one another, the issue of trust is more significant between countries with histories of animosity. Common problems in this area include general mistrust due to different histories and perceived interests; concerns about U.S. arrogance and potential to use intelligence to manipulate; and concerns that the United States will spy on the partner country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;General Mistrust&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allies have their own interests, and even when these interests align with the United States’, they are rarely identical. One former allied official put it succinctly: “Alliance is not allegiance.” Henry Kissinger also once touched upon this point, remarking that “there is no such thing as friendly intelligence agencies. There are only the intelligence agencies of friendly powers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one Asian government official noted wryly, “Few countries are so unmolested by thoughts of history as the United States.” U.S. dignitaries, the official noted, often say, “That was so long ago,” or “But now we have shared interests.” Yet this rhetoric is not enough to underpin alliances. Radek Sikorski, Poland’s former secretary of defense, wrote in 2007 that “just as the Holocaust is the formative experience even for Jews who are too young to remember it, so Poland is haunted by the memory of fighting Hitler alone in 1939 while our allies stood by.” Such historical imprints can sometimes be unwittingly overlooked by the United States: one Polish official, for example, recalled that the United States canceled its missile defense plans with Poland on September 17, 2009, the 70th anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Poland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the disconnect is simply due to the global nature of U.S. interests, as contrasted with the regional views of most other allies. One South Korean official noted that “the United States will be distracted” from its current focus on China because of its interests in Europe and the Middle East. Conversely, Polish officials worry that U.S. focus on China will leave Poland vulnerable to Russian aggression, while British officials are concerned that a China emphasis will diminish their value relative to U.S. allies in Asia. Middle Eastern governments, for their part, worry that Russia and China will lead to U.S. neglect of their region. A former South Korean official, meanwhile, noted that U.S. efforts to de-escalate in Ukraine and the Middle East raised concerns that the United States would not give South Korea full support in a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different interests, of course, are not new. The Five Eyes, rightly touted as a landmark intelligence sharing success, involves countries with varied interests. The United States and the United Kingdom, for example, have had different views on trade, human rights, and conflicts like Vietnam, yet the intelligence relationship endured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mistrust is often most pronounced when partners consider other U.S. allies. In general, many countries do not see eye to eye with their neighbors and thus are more willing to share with the United States than with one another. A South Korean official noted that his country is afraid of “all of the countries in the region.” In general, Asian countries all have different views of Japan, for example—views shaped by geography, interests, and history. In the case of South Korea, the country has long harbored hostility toward Japan due to its World War II brutalities and prewar colonialism; this has made security cooperation with Japan a politically sensitive issue, made worse by a sense in South Korea that Japan has not fully renounced its past imperialism. One South Korean expert noted that this concern was “nonsense,” but that its impact was nevertheless real. As a result, the staying power of the U.S.-backed GSOMIA is uncertain. One analyst called these ups and downs a “‘one step forward, two steps back’ situation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Concerns About Arrogance and Manipulation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One former U.S. official noted that the United States often believes it understands the interests of allies better than they themselves do—even as U.S. policies and priorities regularly flip flop. U.S. stances are, or can be perceived as, arrogant and uninformed at times: a “Daddy knows best” approach, as the official described it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet it behooves the United States to listen to allies. U.S. and former Australian officials noted that Australia was often ahead of the United States in recognizing the growing China threat. A Polish official recalled that under President Trump, the United States regularly emphasized the hybrid threat from Russia even as Poland urged more focus on the conventional military threat. A South Korean official pointed out that North Korea, not China, is usually Seoul’s top concern, despite U.S. efforts to shift the country’s perceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some allies worry that the United States selectively shares only the intelligence that supports preferred U.S. policies. South Korean analysts, for instance, fear that the United States has misrepresented its intelligence to slant Seoul’s policy decisions on North Korea. South Korea has limited satellite imagery and SIGINT, and thus finds it hard to challenge U.S. intelligence findings that draw on these sources. Some in South Korea claim that the United States knowingly shared false information that North Korea sold nuclear materials to Libya (when the true culprit was Pakistan) because Washington wanted to shore up Seoul’s fears of its northern neighbor. Conversely, South Korean reporting claims that in 1996, when North Korea sent commandos into South Korea using a submarine, Washington did not provide Seoul with detailed intelligence to avoid escalating tensions. This concern contributed to South Korea’s decision to develop its own SIGINT capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fear of Spying&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. spying on allies raises another security complication. In 2013, leaks indicated that the United States was monitoring the phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. In 2023, the Korea Herald, drawing on Discord leaks, revealed information that indicated that Washington was spying on South Korea—a concern that exacerbated South Korean fears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liaison itself can facilitate spying. Liaison services can use their access to another country’s intelligence personnel to try to recruit them as spies. This complication can go both ways: a South Korean official, for instance, noted that Seoul also tries to spy on and influence the United States. However, the U.S. “no spy” pledge with the Five Eyes helps offset this concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharing also creates a risk of losing spies. One non-U.S. officer noted that smaller nations feared that revealing their sources to the United States might open the door for Washington to recruit them, outbidding their original affiliates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;obstacle-2-autonomy-concerns&quot;&gt;Obstacle 2: Autonomy Concerns&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. intelligence community commands vast resources in comparison to its partners. A senior UK intelligence official noted that U.S. intelligence has a bigger budget “than the UK Ministry of Defence, armed forces, aid budget, Foreign Office and intelligence agencies combined.” A 2017 report on the Five Eyes indicated that the United States provided 90 percent of the intelligence shared with Australia in that alliance. One study from 2016 found that 85 percent of South Korea’s SIGINT and IMINT on North Korea came from the United States. Similarly, Japan has significant weaknesses in its SIGINT and cyber capabilities, which are offset by U.S. support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, the United States collects, analyzes, and disseminates far more intelligence than its allies, which makes it a highly desirable partner. A downside of this, however, is that allies fear becoming too dependent on U.S. intelligence. In response to concerns about intelligence autonomy vis-à-vis North Korea and China, South Korea has tried to develop its own intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities, overlapping those of the United States. Some Australian analysts fear that they are losing autonomy in intelligence and policy, citing their government’s decision to go to war in Iraq based on incorrect U.S. intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fear has precedent. During World War II, for example, Australia focused on Japanese traffic analysis; when the United States temporarily pulled back from the Pacific after the war, Australia was left with little capacity for the SIGINT tasks, such as cryptanalysis, that the United States had handled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;obstacle-3-security-barriers&quot;&gt;Obstacle 3: Security Barriers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When sharing intelligence, U.S. officials rightly worry that partner nations may have security lapses that lead to adversary penetration, leaks to the media, or both. In the end, security and intelligence sharing involves a risk-reward trade-off. Even if allies exercise careful information security, counterintelligence concerns remain a harsh reality. By sharing more, the United States increases the risks both to the lives of sources and to the value of a multibillion-dollar technical system. As such, a security mindset often dominates intelligence sharing. The more sensitive the intelligence platform or method, the greater the concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many partner countries have weak counterintelligence, leaving them vulnerable to adversary intelligence services. Because many important countries are frontline states, they are often especially vulnerable to adversary penetration. Post–Cold War Poland, for example, has had numerous Russian penetrations of its intelligence services and security establishment. Some allies vital to the struggle against China also have weak security. One foreign official noted that their service would be reluctant to share with the Philippines, given Chinese penetration there. Questions about sharing sensitive information with Taiwan at times produced laughter from interviewees. Within NATO, both Turkey and Hungary have cooperated with Russia diplomatically and, at times, on security, making other countries reluctant to share information for fear of it being passed to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States, too, has counterintelligence problems that pose dilemmas for allies: U.S. leaks are a periodic problem, both in the intelligence community and at political levels. When information regarding secret U.S. detention sites in Poland leaked in 2005, Poland denied this (helpfully, from a U.S. point of view). Yet later revelations of Polish involvement led to concerns in Poland about the security of Polish troops operating in support of U.S.-led missions in the Middle East. The 2010 WikiLeaks publication of massive amounts of U.S. intelligence related to Iraq and Afghanistan and Edward Snowden’s 2013 leak of volumes of highly classified data are among the many examples of information from allies becoming public. In the Snowden case, some of the information allegedly came from Five Eyes sources, and the leaks hurt allies’ intelligence output. Similarly, the 2017 leaks to U.S. media of sensitive British intelligence and President Trump’s leak of Israeli information related to Syria both angered partners and raised questions about U.S. reliability. Reports that the National Security Agency (NSA) had shared the personal information of Canadians citizens led Canada to put data sharing on hold with Five Eyes partners. In almost all of these cases, however, the impact of the leaks were short (term and cooperation resumed in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaks also feed conspiracy theories, which are only exacerbated by “no comment” responses. Even worse, as one foreign official noted, “Security leaks from U.S. sources lead to a clamp down on what can be shared with foreign partners.” These situations can lead to a general tightening of all information sharing, even to partners who are not responsible for the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States also has far more legislative oversight of its intelligence agencies than other allies do. This often raises fears among partners that Congress will reveal information they provide or otherwise compromise security—a fear that is magnified by the executive branch’s frequent blaming of Congress for leaks, many of which actually stem from the executive branch itself. In addition, Congress often wants to have it both ways, pushing cooperation while also blaming the intelligence community when such cooperation leads to security lapses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In rarer cases, foreign intelligence may also be revealed in court cases if it is considered by the court to be legitimately relevant to a trial. Often this is related to counterterrorism or counterintelligence allegations against a citizen of another country, when the defendant’s right to a fair trial trumps security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;obstacle-4-incompatible-interfaces&quot;&gt;Obstacle 4: Incompatible Interfaces&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when both sides are committed to sharing information, doing so can be difficult in practice. Common problems include a lack of secure technical systems, incongruence in counterpart organizations, differing political and legal mandates among organizations, and diverging modes of collection, analysis, and information storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lack of Secure Technical Systems&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For intelligence to be shared, computer and other information systems must be able to connect in a sufficiently secure manner. Some allies, such as the United Kingdom and Australia, have special access to the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet), a secure network for conveying classified material. There is now also a SIPRNet option to quickly label information as releasable to Japan as part of a dropdown menu, an important step that puts it more on par with the Five Eyes. Taiwan has reportedly upgraded its computer system to exchange real-time intelligence with Five Eyes. NATO allies, on the other hand, use the Battlefield Information Collection and Exploitation System (BICES).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite such measures, the incompatibility of different technology systems is a major obstacle to intelligence cooperation, hindering both the speed and scale of information sharing. As one Five Eyes official noted, “Just because we have an intelligence sharing agreement doesn’t mean we have intelligence sharing systems.” Usually the problem is a “multitude of mini-problems,” another official noted. Some information systems have drop-down menus that easily allow sharing with various allies, while others do not. One U.S. official noted that the systems are hard to use for sharing, and it is often difficult to know how to get information. The same official also noted that while the system works half of the time, requests are automatically rejected the other half of the time for unexplained classification reasons. Indeed, one Five Eyes official noted that information sharing is often better at the Top Secret level than at the Secret level because of the historical sharing of SIGINT. Information often cannot go from one country’s system to another’s, even when both sides want to share. In some cases, certain forms of sharing do function well, such as email, but other forms, such as shared drives, aren’t present. Problems still occur, even with close allies on time-sensitive issues, because systems do not align. Japan, for instance, has few intelligence sharing terminals in contrast to other allies, because many such terminals are allocated via NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, complexity grows when information is shared with more than one national actor. Countries may have sharing agreements with the United States, but often do not have them with each other. As such, they must frequently send information to the United States for transmission to a third country, rather than work directly with that country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost of this communication problem is likely to increase as the role of technology in information processing grows. Manual disclosure to foreign partners, for example, works poorly when there are vast amounts of information, much of which is now processed by artificial intelligence (AI). As many U.S. allies under-invest in technology systems, these gaps are likely to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lack of Bureaucratic Congruence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is variation in bureaucratic congruence among U.S. partnerships, often depending on levels of historical cooperation. Cooperation between the NSA and its British counterpart, the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), is excellent; Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) cooperation with their UK counterparts is strong; CIA cooperation with MI-6 is solid; FBI cooperation with the Security Service is relatively weak, however, as the two agencies have had fewer reasons to connect over the years. Not surprisingly, the technically oriented collection agencies have the most sophisticated and seamless systems for information sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many allies have balkanized intelligence services. Although some, like Australia, have the equivalent of a DNI, there is no South Korean administrator who acts as a central coordinating authority between intelligence agencies. As such, the DNI in Washington has no counterpart in Seoul with whom he or she can meet to discuss and negotiate the intelligence relationship. Successive U.S. DNIs have only publicly met with the South Korean president during their visits to the country, but a country’s president is not focused on intelligence coordination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organizational incongruency extends to individual intelligence agencies. The director of the NSA is a four-star general; meanwhile, a two-star general heads the Defense Security Agency (DSA), the South Korean SIGINT body. There has been no public interaction between the respective heads of the NSA and DSA. Instead, the special United States liaison advisor Korea, an NSA contingent in the country, has facilitated SIGINT cooperation since the end of the Korean War. While the technical capacity to share large volumes of collected intelligence exists, organizational differences create issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lack of internal integration can also create difficulties for external sharing. Countries often do not share information well internally, which makes it harder for them to share information with the United States. (The reverse is also true, and this problem applies just as much to the United States in its attempts to share information with other nations). At least several U.S. partners have had to better integrate their own intelligence and threat assessments in order to share more effectively with partners. When a fusion center or similar location exists to centralize information, sharing becomes easier because there are fewer actors with whom to coordinate, as well as a common set of security procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan, for example, is highly siloed, with five major intelligence agencies. These often do not share with one another, and thus it is not surprising that they often do not share with the United States—or that when they do, each has its own independent relationship. Poland, too, lacks a clearinghouse for much of its information. As a result, collection from separate services is often duplicative, and the information collected is often not shared internally or with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this technical and procedural complexity, personal relationships matter tremendously, as they help ensure coordination through bureaucratic work-arounds. As one former senior U.S. official declared, “So much is personality based.” In U.S.-Australia collaboration, Pine Gap is a key location for joint collection; it also serves as a space for American and Australian intelligence personnel to form trusting professional relationships. Foreign military and intelligence officials play vital roles in explaining their countries’ perspectives to U.S. personnel. On the other side, the host country’s knowledge of local U.S. chiefs of station is often vital, as is the knowledge of other leading defense and intelligence officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many cases, however, U.S. officials deployed to foreign countries do not speak the language, which limits the creation of personal relationships, and overall communication. Language facility also demonstrates respect for host cultures. Local familiarity can often vary by service: One interviewee noted that U.S. Navy officers and Marines know Japan’s history and interests well, for example, while the knowledge of Army officers is more limited because the historical relationship is not as strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Different Political Mandates Among Organizations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of why the Five Eyes works well is that intelligence agencies play similar roles in member governments, in which intelligence is both regularly used and largely depoliticized. In other partner countries, including many democracies, intelligence services are more politicized and thus more likely to change course with political winds. This has led to concerns in the United States about sharing information with these partners, and especially about bolstering their capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In South Korea, the transition to democracy has led to more oversight and restrictions on domestic spying. Despite these restrictions, South Korean intelligence has been involved in illegal wiretapping and disinformation operations in presidential and other elections. One 2018 study found that almost all presidents of South Korea have not permitted the country’s intelligence apparatus “to adhere strictly to its legal mandate of non-intervention in domestic politics.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some important countries concerned about Russian and Chinese aggression are themselves autocracies, while others have political systems that, while democratic, are more prone to abuse of power and human rights violations, often with intelligence services implicated. In Poland, when the Law and Justice Party (PiS) arose in the early 2000s, it made claims that the secret services had penetrated the country’s economic and political systems and were often in league with Russia. When the PiS won elections, it argued that cleaning house required a purge of the intelligence agencies, with one leading PiS critic of the services claiming that the services’ main purpose was as “a lever for pursuit of party politics and informal power networks that managed to capture the Polish state.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Different Modes of Collecting, Analyzing, and Storing Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different intelligence services have different historical traditions, and these can make coordination with other services difficult. Sir Stephen Lander, the former director general of the UK Security Service, remarked in 2004 that some countries “collect haystacks and store them, while others collect hay and store needles, while others again only ever collect needles and not very many of them. The risk of sharing haystacks with needle keepers is that they would not be able to use the material effectively or would be swamped.” Another challenge is between states that divide domestic and foreign intelligence, such as Canada, and those that do not, which creates collection and dissemination restraints for both partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;obstacle-5-bureaucratic-barriers&quot;&gt;Obstacle 5: Bureaucratic Barriers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. information-sharing procedures also create additional—and at times unintended—barriers to intelligence cooperation. Problems include strong incentives to classify information as NOFORN, overall system complexities, and the proliferation of veto players in the U.S. system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOFORN Incentives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has created a labyrinthine set of rules that govern the sharing of information, imposing severe limits within broader policy guidance from senior U.S. officials (who, as one official noted, often create or endorse many of these rules). The United States, as one U.S. official put it, “does not have any info sharing policies at all. It has information security policies and information sharing exceptions to these policies.” As Corbett and Danoy argue, “The policy as it stands can be interpreted to support a default setting to NOFORN.” As a result, important information regularly is not shared or, almost as bad, takes far too long to be shared, which greatly reduces its value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, as a former senior U.S. official put it, there is “wild overclassification” in the United States, and the tremendous complexity of rules governing information sharing adds to this problem. The official went on to note that the United States “no longer knows what its intelligence crown jewels are.” This has become more and more true as the amount of classified information has ballooned, with far more personnel seeking access to it at their jobs, thus increasing the risk of compromise. As journalist Patrick Radden Keefe contends, “For any government officer making a quick decision in the course of a busy workday, the penalties for underclassifying are quite salient, whereas penalties for overclassifying do not exist.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often, bureaucratic incentives for working-level officials are the problem. “A Four Star can say ‘release everything,’ but some guy in tennis shoes [in a different bureaucracy] sees a missing label and kills it,” said one foreign intelligence officer. Another foreign intelligence officer noted that senior U.S. officials regularly send out directives calling for more sharing with allies, but in practice little changes: “The bureaucratic reluctance is in stark contrast to the strategic guidance. The people who manage risk emphasize security, not sharing.” An allied official put it this way: “It’s NOFORN, and it has always been that way.” The official went on to warn of the difficulty of change, noting that a sentiment of “this is the way we’ve always done it” governs most procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internally, all U.S. government agencies have significant punishments for sharing information improperly and few rewards for doing so well. Indeed, punishment is often at the individual level: if a well-meaning junior official makes a sharing decision that is later deemed a mistake, the junior official is at risk of punishment and even (though rare) prosecution. (“The O-4 might not get cover,” one foreign official put it.) Indeed, the United States has a long history of aggressively prosecuting low-level leakers while being less aggressive toward senior officials when they leak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are, however, potential work-arounds. Removing NOFORN designations can be done, but it is bureaucratically difficult for some agencies. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, for example, can direct DIA to remove a NOFORN label on occasion, but doing so on a routine basis is hard. In general, when a request to downgrade highly classified information to a more releasable level is eventually approved, or when a “tearline”—which eliminates some information, giving an ally only a partial picture—is created, some useful information can be transmitted. This process, however, is often lengthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proliferation of Veto Players&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. intelligence sharing is governed by several guidelines. Most notable is Intelligence Community Directive 403, which covers “Foreign Disclosure and Release of Classified National Intelligence.” Other guidelines deal with areas including more general classification and tearlines for intelligence sharing. Directive 403 declares, “It is the policy of the U.S. Government to share intelligence with foreign governments whenever it is consistent with U.S. law and clearly in the national interest to do so, and when it is intended for a specific purpose and generally limited in duration.” The directive also notes that the intelligence community “shall limit the use of restrictive dissemination control markings to the minimum necessary.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although these guidelines offer a degree of consistency, they also illustrate several limits and potential problems. First, although ODNI provides overall guidance, it does not control or direct sharing with allies. The system is decentralized, and the intelligence community personnel representing the agencies from which the information originates are responsible for approving release to foreign governments, as these personnel are usually best placed to know the cost if the information and associated sources and methods were to be lost. Given the United States’ numerous collection entities, there is often considerable variation in how guidance is interpreted. In addition, the guidance is unclear as to what role the intelligence community should play in building partner capacity to better enable sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problems within the Department of Defense, where half of the 18 U.S. intelligence entities reside, are particularly complex. DOD has its own policies for releasing classified information to foreign governments. These policies are opaque overall, leaving decisions up to various agencies or, at times, individual personnel. Often those tasked with foreign disclosure are analysts with minimal training and many other responsibilities. Even sharing with Five Eyes requires additional permissions. As a result, per Corbett and Danoy, “The busy analyst is therefore more likely to opt for the safe option of defaulting to NOFORN.” Indeed, one foreign intelligence official wryly noted that information their service provided to the Five Eyes later received a NOFORN label. Another noted that they have seen Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) information show up as NOFORN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, some post-9/11 measures to improve internal U.S. sharing have hindered sharing with foreign partners. After 9/11, there were efforts to bring various intelligence agencies together, such as the creation of more fusion cells. As a result, where once one agency might have allowed a cleared foreign official to be in the room or to read intelligence, now all agencies get a say; some invariably have stricter rules than others, resulting in a lowest-common-denominator effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These problems vary depending on which U.S. agencies are involved. Often, collectors of the same type of intelligence (e.g., SIGINT) find it easier to share information with foreign partners than to do so domestically, due to cultural and technical system compatibilities. The FBI, in contrast, faces steep difficulties in foreign sharing, a fact that hampers its potentially important role against Russian and Chinese subversion at the domestic level, among other things. Because FBI information concerns U.S. citizens, sharing is often difficult for legal and political reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is often worse in the United States than outside of it, which demonstrates the importance of both bureaucratic compatibility and trust. U.S. and joint facilities outside the United States tend to have fewer bureaucratic players, “and they are more at the pointy end,” as one foreign intelligence official put it. These countries are more aware of the risks of not sharing—the sense of which gets “diluted in the safety of D.C,” in the words of one official—and more attuned to how information might be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At times, the problems that result from overly vigilant security can lead to small indignities. Even Five Eyes–affiliated individuals embedded in U.S. agencies must often work in physically separate parts of offices, which further reduces intelligence sharing and decreases personal bonds. According to one official, cleared foreign officials can escort guests from their own governments and militaries at DIA, NGA, and NSA, but not at the Pentagon. As a result, there is significant paperwork for both U.S. and foreign officials when allied officers and officials visit. In addition to wasting time, this state of affairs signals a lack of faith: “They don’t trust us to go to the bathroom,” sighed one official.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cost of the Failure to Share&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost of these problems is high. Measuring their direct impact, however, is difficult, as the counterfactual—what would improve with more sharing?—is impossible to gauge. As one former allied intelligence official put it, “It’s hard to know what you don’t know.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the very least, some valuable information fails to reach allies. One non-U.S. intelligence official noted that they rarely see U.S. information in their day-to-day work. This, in turn, affects threat perceptions and attitudes toward the United States. Allies may prove slower to recognize aggression from Beijing, Moscow, or other revisionist powers in the absence of salient U.S. intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cooperation is likely to suffer both before and during a crisis, even if more information is eventually shared. Allied military forces may have sub-optimal postures, fail to be prepared for a confrontation, or lack effective cooperation during a crisis: as one official put it, key figures may be exchanging business cards as they meet for the first time rather than rolling up their sleeves to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lack of intelligence sharing can mean that an important tool for building overall relationships is not being fully employed. Though it usually takes place behind the scenes, such sharing can help a relationship endure even as public relations become fraught.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States sets its own collection requirements, as do most allies; this can make resource issues more pronounced. Because collection is not coordinated, the United States often does not know what information allies—even Five Eyes countries—already have, thus reducing the economy of efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Timeliness is another problem. U.S. guidance calls for responses to sharing requests to be made within seven working days, a frame that only works if information is not time sensitive. As one U.S. official noted, “the [foreign disclosure officer] process can be a day, it can be a month.” Much depends on the degree to which information must go back to originating agencies, and how many agencies are involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States can and does alter how it shares intelligence when a crisis or other priority change occurs: U.S. sharing with Ukraine and other European countries, for example, increased significantly after the 2022 Russian invasion. This both improved threat assessments and operational coordination. Allies are aware that such sharing can change dramatically, but the conditions under which this might occur are not always clear. Future-oriented intelligence, including some long-term assessments, is often NOFORN. One allied intelligence officer noted that their country enjoyed good cooperation with U.S. intelligence services during Operation Prosperity Guardian, which countered Houthi aggression in the Red Sea, but that such cooperation had been lacking before the crisis. As one allied defense leader noted, “We seek both predictability and speed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharing information at the strategic level, although usually less immediate, is vital for long-term alignment. As one intelligence officer noted, “For our country to change its policies, we need intelligence at the policy level.” The officer went on to note that this was particularly important because great power competition, unlike counterterrorism, involves more diffuse problems and many tradeoffs, all of which causes policies to be in flux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chapter-04-recommendations-for-improving-intelligence-sharing&quot;&gt;CHAPTER 04 Recommendations for Improving Intelligence Sharing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing the status quo by reducing barriers to intelligence sharing is an urgent task. However, many of the barriers to effective sharing cannot be changed or would be very difficult to alter. Varied interests are an inherent part of international relations, and the United States and its allies should not expect to always agree on the nature of threats and how to meet them. In addition, U.S. and allied cultures and political systems change slowly at best—and when they do, the drivers have little to do with intelligence sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Significant progress can be made, however, if the United States is willing to take action to change its approach to sharing and bureaucratic procedures. The necessary steps are both difficult and painful, and many come with genuine tradeoffs. They are necessary, however, if the United States is to work more closely with allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;prioritization-and-diplomacy&quot;&gt;Prioritization and Diplomacy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The approach of “need to know” should be followed when applied with common sense, but it is currently used to justify overclassification. Some goals are worth the counterintelligence risk inherent in greater sharing; in other cases, it is worth denying potential partners information in the name of protecting sources and methods. One official noted that they were constantly bombarded with requests for sharing by individuals who had little need to know. The intelligence office at the National Security Council should approach this prioritization via an interagency process and enforce it with various agencies, both in situations where more sharing is required and at times when it is not necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although this report focuses on U.S. problems, many of the sharing issues are on the partner side, and improved intelligence should also be a diplomatic priority. The United States should encourage allies to invest more in their intelligence services, improve their sharing internally, strengthen their counterintelligence, and upgrade their technical systems to ensure compatibility and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-revamped-security-culture&quot;&gt;A Revamped Security Culture&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the biggest challenges to improved sharing involve revising security protocols and changing internal incentives. The skill of Chinese and Russian intelligence agencies makes this a difficult and evolving challenge. Revising security protocols will entail assuming more risk: The more intelligence shared with allies, the more likely adversaries are to gain access to secret information via leaks and security lapses, which can have costly consequences. The current approach, however, involves the opposite form of risk—a form that is harder to observe but likely more costly, as under sharing results in missed opportunities to improve U.S. and allied security. The personal connections, knowledge of allies’ intelligence cultures and political realities, and other intangibles will grow if cooperation grows, further enhancing security. Indeed, one senior U.S. official noted that joint operations can build trust, which leads to better operations. Better training would also make sharing more effective and would help change culture in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A culture shift of this magnitude will require allies to make security improvements, and the United States should encourage and at times help devote resources to these improvements. At the same time, imperfections in allies’ intelligence systems should not be excuses for inaction. The United Kingdom was initially (and rightly) skeptical of U.S. security procedures at the onset of Five Eye cooperation after World War II and worked with the United States to improve its counterintelligence. The United Kingdom took a gamble in sharing information with the United States in the early days of the Cold War—but over time, a robust relationship developed that led to considerable trust. Australia, to give another example, has had to upgrade its facilities and counterintelligence to expand sharing with the United States. Similarly, Japan has improved its counterintelligence to gain better access to sensitive U.S. equipment like satellite tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is vital that the incentives for individuals involved in declassification are changed. This would involve increasing training, reducing the risk of individual punishment, and providing incentives for sharing. The risk for individuals of allowing a security breach is high, but there is little payoff for successful sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reducing-noforn&quot;&gt;Reducing NOFORN&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security fears have led to the NOFORN designation being used too frequently, according to this paper’s interviewees, to the point that it is essentially the default rather than a deliberate decision. As one former U.S. intelligence official put it, the goal should be to go from NOFORN to “YESFORN”: The default should be sharing, and collectors or security officers should have to prove that sharing should not occur, especially with Five Eyes and other highly trusted allies. This would considerably reduce the friction in the process. Below are several useful steps that could be implemented to enable this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Five Eyes representatives who work in U.S. intelligence agencies, the NOFORN caveat should be removed for nearly everything.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ODNI and the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security should have greater power to increase intelligence sharing across the agencies they coordinate and should push to make “Releasable to FVEY” a more common classification.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NOFORN should be removed from most finished intelligence for trusted partners after source references are eliminated. As Corbett and Danoy note, “Finished intelligence, by definition, has been through a rigorous editing and approval process, and the chances of a serious disclosure breach are minimal.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Establishing procedures for automatic release if a formal decision is not forthcoming by a certain deadline. It is often bureaucratically easier to delay information releases and, even if the information is approved for sharing eventually, this delay reduces the information’s value. These procedures would apply to NOFORN documents without significant additional codewords.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;expanding-low-risk-sharing&quot;&gt;Expanding Low-Risk Sharing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even as the United States considers changing its procedures, experimentation in more aggressive sharing should begin in low-risk areas. Corbett and Danoy suggest climate change as one area where information is both valuable and rarely highly classified. With successful pilots in these areas, sharing could be expanded to more sensitive spheres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the use of AI expands, sharing via algorithm should also be explored—again, with low-risk areas as a starting point. Because the use of AI is steadily growing, it will be essential to understand the conditions under which AI can expedite sharing in order to improve future cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open-source information (OSINT), which is increasing in quality and quantity, can usually be shared with ease. Directing countries in which sharing is harder for security reasons—such as the Philippines and Taiwan—to reliable OSINT can provide a common threat picture at a basic level. For example, data from commercial satellites has helped the Quad (the United States, Australia, India, and Japan) track China’s maritime smuggling and maritime militia. Unclassified information provided to India by the United States after the signing of the Basic Exchange Cooperation Agreement on Geospatial Intelligence in 2020 helped India repel a Chinese incursion along the contested border in the Himalayas. Similarly, some aspects of space awareness are also unclassified. The OSINT community should work to produce more finished intelligence on demand, which could then be incorporated easily into information shared with partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advances in commercial technology will also require revisiting the sensitivity of classified collection and analysis. Commercial geospatial capabilities, for example, have improved dramatically in recent years, surpassing older systems whose capabilities were extraordinarily secret. This shift allows greater sharing of information in a realm that was once highly classified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;resourcing-and-personnel&quot;&gt;Resourcing and Personnel&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some agencies, it is often difficult for busy intelligence officers to declassify information in a timely way. This is particularly the case when analysts do not fully understand classification rules (some of which are contradictory) and the penalties for security violations are high. Allowing more foreign access would require some originating organizations to further develop their own disclosure expertise and clearance procedures, which would mean a significant resource investment. This would require new foreign disclosure officers and similar personnel to receive more training. It would also require training for analysts and collectors to write products that both allow for greater sharing and protect sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improving cooperation will also require helping partner governments improve their security, invest in new technology for information sharing systems, and take on more personnel to manage relationships. Buying more communications systems and ensuring compatibility will be expensive and will require major investments. The rewards usually outweigh the costs, however, especially over time and during crises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improved language skills will also be vital. U.S. intelligence agencies’ problems with foreign languages are well documented. It is not a coincidence that the most successful sharing alliance, the Five Eyes, involves a common language. The United States at times deploys military and intelligence officers to foreign agencies with the expectation that foreign personnel should operate in English. “Imagine how much better relations would be,” one official commented, if U.S. officials could operate in allies’ languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Longer tours for liaison officers would be helpful. This could be difficult for hardship tours and, bureaucratically, could put intelligence officers out of sync with the State Department; however, it would greatly help build expertise and personal connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;expanding-the-circle&quot;&gt;Expanding the Circle&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been many calls to expand the Five Eyes, with proposals for the inclusion of countries such as France, Germany, Japan, and South Korea, although a British report noted that “there is little prospect of expansion, at least in the medium term” due to the high levels of trust needed to enter this exclusive club. These nations already have significant intelligence cooperation with the United States, as well as common interests. Germany has a strong space presence, proximity to Russia, careful SIGINT procedures, and even an embassy in Pyongyang that might allow greater access to North Korea. France also has a large space presence, excellent SIGINT, and a presence in Africa and South America through its overseas territories, including islands like Mayotte and Réunion. South Korea, of course, boasts impressive collection and analysis on North Korea, as well as access to information on China. These countries would need to resolve their own balkanization problems and properly resource their services as conditions for significantly closer sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some countries that are ideal partners in efforts against China and Russia have significant security problems, limiting cooperation. India is a useful strategic partner, but it has numerous ties to Russia. Taiwan, while useful, is a place where China has an extensive intelligence presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A valuable alternative to expanding the Five Eyes, especially given the high trust barrier, would be to develop smaller alternative groups that are focused on particular targets and on sharing a narrow scope of information. For example, the United States has expanded intelligence liaison relationships with Quad countries. A China-focused group would be an obvious step and could consist of existing Five Eyes partners like Australia and New Zealand, with additions like Japan and South Korea; Taiwan and the Philippines could also play roles, albeit lesser ones, given their security weaknesses. There is danger, however, in forming clubs, which creates new haves and have-nots, potentially generating resentment and reducing trust. Nevertheless, alliances can also create incentives for the improvement of security procedures, the forming of common protocols, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When expanding circles of intelligence sharing, there will inevitably be mistakes—possibly grievous ones. As it is, however, the United States is paying the cost of insufficient sharing on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intelligence sharing, while fraught with challenges, is indispensable to enhancing U.S. security. The imperfections of intelligence sharing demand an aggressive approach to reform. The United States must foster a more agile and inclusive environment for intelligence collaboration. This endeavor should not merely be about refining tactics or expanding networks, but about strategically rethinking the foundational aspects of security collaboration to better address the threats of today and tomorrow. By taking on this challenge, the United States and its allies can enhance their strategic foresight, operational efficiency, and collective response capabilities, ultimately ensuring improved security for all participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, and the ongoing war that has followed, have dramatically shifted the strategic landscape in Europe, triggering the most devastating war on the continent since World War II. More Russian soldiers have died in Ukraine than in all previous Soviet and Russian wars since World War II combined, including Russia’s bloody wars in Afghanistan and Chechnya. The Ukraine war has caused the most significant refugee crisis in Europe since World War II, driving over 6 million Ukrainian refugees to Poland, Germany, the Czech Republic, and other countries. The war has also had substantial humanitarian implications, causing widespread civilian deaths and destruction in Ukraine and disrupting public access to water, electricity, heating, health care, and education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite Russian aggression in Ukraine and increase in gray zone activity across Europe, there has been a robust debate about whether the United States should focus its defense priorities and military posture on the Indo-Pacific to counter China. While the Indo-Pacific is a strategically important region, the United States needs to be prepared to deter two major theater wars—one in Europe and the other in the Indo-Pacific—as well as ensure readiness for contingencies elsewhere, such as in the Middle East and Korean Peninsula. After all, Russia has invaded one country (Ukraine) and waged war in several others, such as Syria. China has not—at least not yet. In its approach to defense planning, the Trump administration should ensure that the allocation of limited forces between the two theaters is tailored to match the unique demands of each region while carefully managing risks and trade-offs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In examining U.S. posture in Europe, this analysis asks three main questions. What are the main security threats in Europe for the United States and its allies? What are U.S. interests in Europe? What is the appropriate U.S. force posture in Europe? In answering these questions, this analysis comes to several broad conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the United States needs a long-term military presence in Europe focused on NATO’s eastern flank to deter Russian aggression. But the United States should reduce its military footprint in Europe from today’s 5+2 posture to a 4+2 posture with four brigade combat teams (BCTs) and two regional headquarters. Even if there is a successful ceasefire in Ukraine, Russia will likely remain a serious threat to the United States and Europe over the next several years. Russian president Vladimir Putin retains the political will and intentions to expand Russian power abroad, and Russia is reconstituting its military capabilities with help from China, Iran, and North Korea. While the United States may adjust its current posture in Europe, which was dramatically increased following Russia’s invasion, a significant downsizing of U.S. forces in Europe for redeployment to other regions could severely weaken deterrence and embolden a revanchist Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the United States should permanently station a U.S. Army armored brigade combat team (ABCT) in Poland to strengthen deterrence, reassure the United States’ Eastern European allies, and pursue a more sustainable posture. Shifting the current rotational ABCT from Operation Atlantic Resolve to a permanent presence in Poland should be part of a 4+2 posture in Europe. This setup would include four U.S. BCTs—three forward-stationed BCTs in Poland, Italy, and Germany, along with one rotational BCT in Romania—and two divisional headquarters, in Germany and Poland. Moreover, a permanent forward-stationed ABCT in Europe would be less costly from both a fiscal and readiness perspective than the current rotational deployment model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the United States needs to continue pressing European militaries to increase their own capabilities to deter Russia and—if deterrence fails—to help fight and win a major power war, particularly given U.S. interests and defense objectives in the Indo-Pacific. As it currently stands, European militaries would likely have difficulty conducting operations at the high end of the conflict continuum without significant assistance from the United States. European states still lack sufficient capabilities in such areas as combat support, including short-range air defense and long-range indirect fires; airlift and other logistical means of transporting troops and material; quantity, quality, and capabilities of ground forces, especially heavy maneuver forces; and sufficient quantities of long-range precision strike munitions, such as the Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of this brief is divided into five sections. The first outlines historical trends in U.S. force posture in Europe. The second section assesses the future threat landscape. The third summarizes U.S. interests and defense objectives in Europe. The fourth section details the primary components of a robust force posture in Europe. The fifth provides a brief conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;historical-trends-and-current-posture&quot;&gt;Historical Trends and Current Posture&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States’ military posture in Europe has evolved considerably from the end of World War II to the present. Changes to the number and types of capabilities of U.S. forces in Europe have been driven by several factors, including the perception of the threat posed by the Soviet Union and Russia to the United States and its European allies, the relative balance of military capabilities between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, the evolution of U.S. strategy and political considerations, and the relationship between the United States and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following World War II, total U.S. end strength fell from over 12 million personnel in 1945 to just 1.4 million by 1948, despite rising tensions between the West and Soviet Union. U.S. end strength in Europe meanwhile fell to approximately 150,000 by the late 1940s. The adoption of NSC-68 under the Truman administration following the Korean War had the practical effect of waking the United States and Europe up to the military dimensions of the Cold War as the United States and NATO took steps to significantly increase their military presence. However, NATO members failed to meet the ambitious goals agreed to in Lisbon in 1952. During this period, the U.S. military pushed for the creation of an integrated NATO command structure and took on critical NATO staff roles, including a U.S. general as the supreme allied commander, Europe (SACEUR). The United States also established U.S. European Command (EUCOM) in August 1952.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/zEmoSA3.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under President Eisenhower’s New Look strategy, the United States reduced the role of conventional forces in Europe to a “tripwire” and “delaying force” as deterrence relied on massive retaliation. The Kennedy administration’s “flexible response” strategy sought a more “balanced” approach in the belief that massive retaliation was no longer credible given advances in Soviet nuclear capabilities. The Soviet Union’s 1976 deployment of SS-20 intermediate-range missiles led the Carter administration to pursue its dual-track strategy, which called for deploying additional missiles in Europe—specifically, Pershing 2 ballistic missiles and ground-launched cruise missiles—while simultaneously pursuing arms control talks. Ronald Reagan continued with the deployment of the Pershing 2 missiles in 1983, while also building up U.S. forces in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the end of the Cold War, the United States significantly reduced its military presence in Europe. The Clinton administration planned for a final end strength of 100,000 personnel by 1996, but only reached a low of 113,000 in 1997 due to involvement in the Balkan Wars. The Bush administration sought further cuts to U.S. posture as the number of U.S. service members in Europe fell to 66,000 in 2008, and end strength reached a post–World War II low of 63,000 in 2013 under the Obama administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s seizure of Crimea and its related military operations in western Ukraine in 2014, along with its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, prompted the United States to bolster its military presence in Europe. In 2017, the U.S. Department of Defense announced the beginning of a continuous armored brigade combat team (ABCT) rotational presence in Europe and back-to-back rotations of U.S. troops and equipment to Europe. By 2023, the 7,000-person rotational force included four elements: a division headquarters located in Poznan, Poland; a combat aviation brigade; an ABCT; and a sustainment task force. Following Russia’s 2022 invasion, U.S. end strength in Europe grew significantly to over 100,000 personnel as additional forces were deployed, including another ABCT, a High-Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) battalion, and KC-135 refueling aircraft, among other forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of ground forces, the United States currently maintains a 5+2 posture consisting of five brigade combat teams—two IBCTs (one permanent and one rotational), one permanent SBCT, and two rotational ABCTs—and two headquarters. This represents an increase from the previous 3+1 model—one permanent IBCT, one permanent SBCT, and one rotational ABCT plus one headquarters in place prior to Russia’s 2022 invasion. The permanent units include the 2nd Cavalry Regiment Stryker brigade combat team (SBCT) headquartered in Vilseck, Germany, and the 173rd Airborne Brigade stationed across Vincenza, Italy, and Grafenwoehr, Germany, as well as the forward-stationed 12th Combat Aviation Brigade. The rotational ABCT, established in the wake of Russia’s 2014 invasion of Ukraine, serves as part of Operation Atlantic Resolve, which deploys approximately 7,000 U.S. Army personnel (including the ABCT, plus a combat aviation brigade, sustainment task force, and forward division headquarters) to Europe on nine-month rotations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. air capabilities include fighter, attack, rotary-wing, tanker, and transport aircraft that perform close air support, air interdiction, air defense, in-flight refueling, long-range transport, and support of maritime operations. These forces include seven squadrons of fighter aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/4YRfUm7.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-evolving-threat-landscape&quot;&gt;The Evolving Threat Landscape&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking forward, Russia will remain the most significant threat to Europe. Today, NATO enjoys a strong conventional and nuclear deterrent. In the event of a potential near-term Russian attack against NATO’s eastern flank, however unlikely, there are several factors in NATO’s favor: the inherent advantage of the defense, the force-to-space ratio problem for Russia, the limited avenues of approach from Russia into Eastern Europe, and the qualitative superiority of NATO forces. In addition, NATO retains a robust nuclear deterrent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Russia has the will and intentions to threaten one or more NATO countries, and it is steadily rebuilding its military capabilities thanks, in part, to aid from China, Iran, and North Korea. Russian military thinking is dominated by a view that the United States is—and will remain—Moscow’s main enemy (главный враг) for the foreseeable future. This view of the United States as the primary adversary has increased since the 2022 invasion. Russian political and military leaders assess that Russia’s struggles in Ukraine have been largely due to aid from the United States and the broader NATO alliance, which Russian leaders interpret as direct participation in the war. In addition, Russian leaders likely believe that the United States is attempting to expand its power, further encircle Russia, and weaken Russia militarily, politically, and economically. These sentiments will make Russia a dangerous enemy over the next several years and will likely further drive Moscow’s desire to reconstitute its military as rapidly as possible, prepare to fight the West if deterrence fails, and engage in irregular and hybrid activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, at least four factors could change the military balance in Europe over the next decade. First, the United States could become overstretched due to a major theater war in another region, such as against China in the Indo-Pacific. European conventional and logistical capabilities are limited—particularly for high-end war—creating potential vulnerabilities if the United States were to withdraw significant air, naval, and ground forces from the region. Second, Russia could continue to rebuild its military capabilities over the next several years with additional help from China, Iran, North Korea, and other countries. Third, there could be a significant decline in U.S. or European political will to build the military capabilities sufficient to deter Russia and a decrease in commitment to NATO. The drop in political will could be caused by a change in political leaders, domestic priorities, financial constraints, or other factors. Fourth, there are other potential wildcards that could impact the threat environment, such as a Russian leadership change or Russian use of a nuclear weapon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European military capabilities remain concerning. European states still lack sufficient heavy maneuver forces, airlift, naval combatants, and support capabilities, such as logistics and fire support. Although European allies and partners of the United States plan to improve these capabilities by 2030 as part of a greater NATO-agreed initiative, it is unclear whether they will be successful. European challenges are particularly notable when considering a large-scale, high-end conflict at short notice given most European countries’ persistent readiness challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, several European countries will likely struggle to field units because of manpower shortages. For example, the shrinking forces of both the United Kingdom and Germany reflect an overall trend affecting not only Europe but also the United States and Canada in trying to recruit and retain an all-volunteer, professional armed force. This is a challenge that needs to be addressed by all Western nations. Without adequate active-duty volunteers, many national leaders will need to consider whether a greater reliance on reservists will be needed to meet force goals and operational requirements. Additionally, consideration may need to be given to reinstitute conscription in some form—like Finland has done—to have a minimally trained reserve force capable of being called up and deployed if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these wildcards, Russia will likely constitute a serious threat to the United States and Europe for the foreseeable future. Russian president Vladimir Putin retains the political will and intentions to expand Russian power abroad, and Russia is reconstituting its military capabilities with help from China, Iran, and North Korea. The key takeaway is that neither today’s military balance nor deterrence is guaranteed to hold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;us-interests-and-defense-objectives&quot;&gt;U.S. Interests and Defense Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. interests in Europe are significant, and U.S. allies and partners in Europe share the United States’ democratic values and account for significant military, economic, and technological power. Since its establishment in the 1949 Washington Treaty, NATO has been the lynchpin of U.S. security in Europe. The bedrock of NATO is a collective defense provision—an attack on one is an attack on all—that was codified in Article V of the Washington Treaty. During the Cold War, the alliance served as the primary bulwark against the expansion of the Soviet Union. Following the Soviet Union’s collapse, NATO became the major framework for organizing transatlantic efforts on collective security matters, including military interventions in the Balkans, Afghanistan, and Libya. In addition, several former Soviet republics (such as Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania) and members of the Soviet-aligned Warsaw Pact (such as Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia) later became NATO members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These treaty relationships have benefited the United States in several ways. One is supporting U.S. leadership. As a result of the United States’ central role in transatlantic and international relations that, in many ways, NATO has cemented, Americans have enjoyed unprecedented economic prosperity and freedom. Successive U.S. governments have been afforded both de facto and de jure privileged status related to such issues as trade partnerships and access to bases in large part because of the outsized role that the country plays in the defense of its allies. For example, the United States would not have been able to prosecute expeditionary and counterterrorism operations in the Middle East and Africa were it not for the bases and prepositioned equipment that the United States has been able to maintain on allied soil in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another long-standing reason for U.S. engagement in Europe is to enable U.S. strategic depth. The United States’ geographic location, protected by both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, no longer provides the same security as in previous decades because of advances in long-range strike, cyber operations, space, and other technological developments. As a result, it is prudent to station U.S. forces overseas to contend with adversary aggression—if not outright conflict—far from the U.S. homeland. Not only does this make the U.S. homeland less vulnerable to outright war, but forward presence is also relatively cost effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the NATO alliance today affords the United States strategic flexibility. Most of the United States’ main security challenges—from China and Russia to Iran and terrorism—cannot be tackled by one state alone, not even the United States. Allies are critical. They enable flexible cooperation and consultation on any number of strategic issues as they arise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has interests elsewhere in the world. In particular, China will likely be the United States’ main global competitor. China poses a challenge to the United States around the globe because of its expanding conventional and nuclear capabilities, irregular warfare and gray zone activities, technological and economic competitiveness, and “wolf warrior” diplomacy. The United States has important interests in other regions as well, including in the Middle East, Asia, Africa, and Latin America. But it is a false dichotomy to argue that the United States needs to choose between these interests—especially between China and Russia. Both are authoritarian regimes cooperating with each other on two major axes. Beijing and Moscow have deepened their military, economic, and diplomatic ties since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The United States should develop a two-front strategy that works with allies and partners to counter China and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the United States currently has several broad security interests in Europe, which will likely persist over the next decade:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Protect the U.S. homeland and the security of the American people, including from threats emanating from Europe;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Promote and expand U.S. economic prosperity and opportunity;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Realize and defend the democratic values at the heart of the American way of life; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Defend and support the United States’ European allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on these interests, the United States has several defense objectives in Europe:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deter and defeat conventional and nuclear-armed conflict directed against the U.S. homeland and U.S. allies, as well as coerce, persuade, and influence adversary behavior;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Counter irregular and gray zone activities, as well as compete effectively below the threshold of conventional conflict using both defensive and offensive means;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Counter terrorist and other transnational threats;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deter and prevent state and non-state actors from acquiring, proliferating, or using weapons of mass destruction; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maintain access to trade routes and global commons.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-posture-of-forward-defense&quot;&gt;A Posture of Forward Defense&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on these interests and objectives, this section examines potential changes to U.S. military posture in Europe over the next five years. The recommendations outlined below seek to enhance U.S. military posture from its levels before the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. The benefits of this strategy are twofold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, this posture strengthens the ability of the United States and NATO to deter and repel Russian aggression on the continent. Second, this strategy pursues more sustainable policies by shifting the presence of U.S. ground forces from rotational deployments to permanent, forward-stationed forces and articulating trade-offs and limitations with other strategic priorities, such as competition with China in the Indo-Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ard8cfB.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ground-forces&quot;&gt;Ground Forces&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nature of operations in Ukraine and the threat from Russia illustrate the continued significance of ground forces in combat in the European theater for deterrence and warfighting. There are several types of capabilities important for achieving U.S. defense objectives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Army units, including ABCTs;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Main battle tanks, armored personnel carriers, and infantry fighting vehicles;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Integrated air and missile defense systems;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Long-range fires;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Manned and unmanned aircraft;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multi-domain command and control; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additional investments and equipment—including logistics—such as munitions stockpiles, spare parts, hardened facilities, and improved lines of communication.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on Russia’s efforts to revitalize its military capabilities, the United States should consequently take steps to strengthen its presence from pre-February 2022 levels by increasing the number of permanent forward-stationed maneuver forces to deter and effectively respond to Russian aggression. That increase entails shifting the rotational ABCT associated with Operation Atlantic Resolve (along with the associated combat aviation brigade) to a permanent, forward-stationed ABCT headquartered in Poland. The United States should also maintain its current rotational infantry brigade combat team (IBCT) presence in Romania, as well as rotational deployments to the Baltic states in the near term and incorporate them into Operation Atlantic Resolve under the command of the V Corps headquarters. However, the requirement for these rotational forces may shift depending on changes to the threat environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These changes to the posture of U.S. ground forces would shift the U.S. Army to a posture model of four total brigade combat teams in Europe (three permanent, forward-stationed BCTs and one rotational BCT) plus two headquarters in Germany and Poland—a four BCTs + two headquarters model—and away from both the 3+1 model in place prior to the war in Ukraine and the current 5+2 model. The 4+2 model would also include the permanent forward-basing of two combat aviation brigades (the existing 12th Combat Aviation Brigade plus another). Prior to Russia’s February 2022 invasion, the United States maintained two permanent, forward-stationed BCTs in Europe plus one rotational BCT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recommended changes in this analysis for a 4+2 model would maintain the permanent SBCT in Germany and IBCT in Italy and Germany; create a permanent, forward-stationed ABCT at a new base in Poland; maintain the rotational IBCT in Romania; and maintain two permanent headquarters in Germany and Poland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forward-stationing an ABCT in Poland offers several benefits to maintaining U.S. interests and achieving objectives in Europe, including (1) providing a credible force to swiftly respond to acts of Russian aggression against NATO partners; (2) reassuring allies of U.S. commitment while building interoperability with partner forces; and (3) enhancing the general readiness of U.S. forces at large and reducing costs in the long run. Poland would provide the most practical and beneficial location to establish a new military base for an ABCT from both operational and political perspectives as it already hosts the V Corps Forward Command Post Headquarters, an Army garrison, and sufficient sustainment capabilities—the “first permanent stationing of U.S. forces on NATO’s eastern flank.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More critically, forward-stationing U.S. units in Poland would facilitate the speed of assembly and movement for U.S. operations in Europe, providing a combat-credible ABCT force to quickly counter Russian aggression. This capability would play a particularly major role in deterring or responding to a contingency in the Baltic states, where Russian forces could threaten to cut off or slow the access of U.S. and NATO forces by closing the Suwalki Gap—the 40-mile gap between Kaliningrad and Belarus where Lithuania borders Poland. Poland also offers greater strategic depth than alternative locations, such as the Baltic states, and possesses interconnected rail lines with the rest of Europe that would ease resupply and reinforcement efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forward-stationing additional U.S. forces would also enhance interoperability with allied forces and society, while lowering costs from a force planning and budgetary perspective. In terms of force-generation, an enduring and constant rotational ABCT presence in Europe for a nine-month deployment requires three total ABCTs. As an illustrative example, U.S.-based ABCT-1 must be training and preparing to deploy to replace ABCT-2 currently in Europe. ABCT-3, also U.S.-based, after recently ending its nine-month deployment, must then recover and begin training to deploy following ABCT-1’s tour overseas. This rotational model eats up more of the Army’s force structure and long-term readiness than one forward-stationed unit would.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a fiscal cost perspective, establishing a new base in Poland would initially have high budgetary costs and take roughly seven years to put in place. However, operation and sustainment costs would be significantly lower than those of a rotational force. A forward-stationed ABCT incurs 75 percent of the additional operational tempo (OPTEMPO) costs that a rotationally deployed ABCT would, and it also generates savings over time. Moreover, given the cost of moving their equipment, ABCTs are the most expensive unit to rotationally deploy, suggesting that IBCTs or SBCTs are better suited to the rotational deployment model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;air-combat-forces&quot;&gt;Air Combat Forces&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of air combat capabilities, a forward defense posture includes maintaining all seven forward-deployed fighter squadrons currently based in Europe and adding an additional F-16 squadron to Spangdahlem Air Base. Four squadrons are already based at RAF Lakenheath in the United Kingdom under the 48th Fighter Air Wing, including two squadrons of F-35A aircraft and two F-15E squadrons. Two squadrons of F-16 aircraft are stationed at Aviano Air Base in Italy under the 31st Fighter Wing, and one additional F-16 squadron is currently stationed at Spangdahlem Air Base in Germany under the 52nd Fighter Wing. While stationed out of their respective bases, these units have often been forward deployed to NATO’s eastern flank to provide additional posture amid the war in Ukraine. Forward-stationed forces are supplemented by deployments of U.S.-based fighter aircraft—including active-duty, reserve, and Air National Guard assets—to enhance posture; such deployments have increased in the lead-up to and throughout the Ukraine conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forward-deployed F-35 squadrons enhance the capabilities of U.S. and allied forces to establish air superiority against robust and experienced Russian integrated air defense systems (IADS). F-35 aircraft can also collect electronic signals from and compile a picture of hostile and friendly forces in an area. However, given requirements for the Indo-Pacific region, adding another F-35 squadron to the two currently stationed at RAF Lakenheath is not optimal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, forward stationing an additional F-16 squadron at Spangdahlem Air Base would provide greater short-term combat capacity as allied F-35 squadrons come online. Additional permanently based fifth-generation squadrons in Europe may be more likely to come as future replacements for the Air Force’s F-15E squadrons, which the service plans to cut by more than half by 2028. However, U.S. Air Forces Europe should supplement these aircraft with deployments of U.S.-based fifth-generation squadrons of fighter aircraft—either F-35 or F-22 aircraft—as demanded by the threat environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To further maximize flexibility, U.S. air combat forces based in or deployed to Europe should also be prepared to surge to the Indo-Pacific in the event of a contingency. The Air Force has already leveraged EUCOM assets to fill capability gaps in the Indo-Pacific with the temporary transfer of F-16 aircraft from the 52nd Fighter Wing at Spangdahlem Air Base to Kadena Air Base in Japan amid the return of its F-15C/D fighter aircraft to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;naval-forces&quot;&gt;Naval Forces&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve a posture of forward defense, the United States should enhance its naval presence in the Baltic Sea region with small surface combatants and unmanned vessels through 2030 to improve interoperability with allies and partners and to deter Russian aggression. Russia still maintains a sizeable presence in the region. U.S. ships should conduct more frequent port visits, including both FDNF-E patrols and deployments of U.S.-based assets, as well as bilateral and multilateral exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should also act in coordination with its NATO allies to tackle several mission sets, including anti-submarine warfare in the Baltic and North Seas, which have been much neglected. NATO has increased its joint anti-submarine warfare exercises among allied forces, including Operation Dynamic Mongoose in the North Atlantic in 2022 and Dynamic Manta off the coast of Italy in 2023. The United States could also pursue greater coordination with allies’ carrier and amphibious capabilities to bolster presence among competing demands from other theaters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Navy could supplement existing NATO anti-submarine warfare capabilities by developing and deploying additional systems to the region. One option is homeporting the U.S. Navy’s Littoral Combat Ship, which has anti-submarine warfare capabilities, in German ports to provide improved situational awareness in the Baltics, or alternatively deploying Constellation-class frigates, which also have anti-submarine warfare capabilities, once they are operational. However, the operational requirements for the presence of surface ships and submarines in the Indo-Pacific should take priority over Baltic deployments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given Indo-Pacific demand for naval forces, the Navy could leverage its developing unmanned surface and undersea vessels for anti-submarine warfare and additional missions in the Baltic Sea. Pioneered under the Fifth Fleet’s Task Force 59 in U.S. Central Command, the Navy recently announced its intention to deploy these capabilities to the broader fleet beginning with the Fourth Fleet under U.S. Southern Command in the summer of 2023. The United States and partners should also increase their number of sonobuoys and static hydrophone networks to track subsurface threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Baltic region, the U.S. Navy and NATO allies should prioritize three additional missions. They should develop a plan to tackle hybrid gray zone threats to undersea cables and pipelines and other infrastructure that Russia may target to disrupt the flow of commerce, energy, and information. Furthermore, the United States and NATO should plan to leverage the extensive mining and demining capabilities of new members Finland and Sweden in the event of a possible conflict with Russia that threatens naval deployments and the commercial shipping of partners and allies. Finally, the United States and NATO should anticipate the use of anti-ship cruise missiles in a conflict with Russia and seek to neutralize this threat through the coordination of the Baltic Air Policing mission and Allied Maritime Command as part of the missile defense and suppression mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Black Sea, the United States should work with its regional NATO allies and partners to enhance its maritime domain awareness. The United States and the NATO alliance should encourage regional partners to cooperate and modernize their military capabilities, including by strengthening sea power in ways that are consistent with the Montreux Convention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Arctic represents another vital region for U.S. maritime interests. The United States should expand its capabilities and posture in the Arctic, particularly through the U.S. Coast Guard. The expansion of the United States’ Arctic posture and capabilities should be pursued as rapidly as possible to counter Russian and Chinese security interests in the region. As the Coast Guard awaits delivery of new icebreakers, the military more broadly should seek to enhance cooperation with Arctic allies through joint operations and combined exercises and training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;logistics-and-enablers&quot;&gt;Logistics and Enablers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section examines several types of logistics and enablers, including prepositioned equipment and munitions stockpiles; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; integrated air and missile defense; and infrastructure and mobility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prepositioned Equipment and Munitions Stockpiles:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States should take steps to bolster its prepositioned equipment and munitions stocks in Europe to enhance the readiness of U.S. forces in the event of a contingency with Russia. The Army currently maintains its Army Prepositioned Stock-2 (APS-2) across four sites in three different countries (Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands) with enough material to equip two ABCTs; a fifth APS-2 site is planned for Poland. In March 2022, the Army issued some of this stock to the 1st ABCT, 3rd Infantry Division in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. While APS-2 stocks have been bolstered by funding from the European Deterrence Initiative, the Army should take additional steps to improve the readiness of this equipment and the forces overseeing it to ensure that U.S. forces arriving in theater will rapidly receive capable equipment. A DOD inspector general investigation found that some materiel provided from APS-2 was “non-fully mission capable” and that “maintenance and coordination shortfalls occurred.” The Marine Corps also maintains prepositioned equipment in central Norway under the Marine Corps Prepositioning Program-Norway (MCPP-N).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to enhancing prepositioned equipment, the DOD should ensure that EUCOM has the appropriate inventories of munitions in the region. The war in Ukraine has demonstrated the importance of long-range artillery, and U.S. and NATO forces must have enough missiles and munitions in theater to contend with and counter Russian forces. That includes munitions for the Air Force, which should develop plans to maintain weapons for aircraft operating under the agile combat employment (ACE) concept at forward locations, and the Army’s EUCOM munitions starter stocks, which preposition key munitions—including Patriot Missile Segment Enhancement—in Europe for use in the event of a contingency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR):&lt;/strong&gt; The demand for U.S. ISR assets will only increase as the U.S. military expands its missions and operations in the Indo-Pacific and as the Russian military reconstitutes its capabilities on NATO’s eastern flank. While the United States should prioritize the Indo-Pacific, the DOD should maximize its available ISR assets for use by both EUCOM and U.S. Indo-Pacific Command. The DOD is currently seeking to modernize its ISR capabilities, with plans to retire the RQ-4 by fiscal year (FY) 2027 and the MQ-9 by FY 2035. However, the DOD and the services should ensure that any gaps in ISR coverage are limited. The DOD should also leverage commercial capabilities to cover any gaps until requirements are established and new platforms are deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space-based ISR assets will play a major role in both covering gaps and supplementing ISR provided by traditional airborne assets. Commercial satellite imagery has already been used by NATO to fill gaps in coverage and has played a major role in identifying Russian military movements in the lead-up to the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. In the next few years, the United States should further leverage commercial satellite imagery to bolster its ISR capabilities in Europe. Over the long term, however, the DOD should ultimately determine the appropriate balance between leasing commercial services and establishing its own systems to ensure sustainable and reliable coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrated Air and Missile Defense:&lt;/strong&gt; The adoption of some of the recommendations here will necessitate changes to the U.S. air and missile defense posture, including the permanent basing of an ABCT in Poland, which would require an investment in air and missile defense capabilities given its proximity to Russia. If a new base is established, the United States should consider shifting the headquarters of the 10th Army Air and Missile Defense Command from Rhine Ordnance Barracks in Germany eastward. If the Army chooses not to move the entire command to Poland, it should prioritize shifting the battalion headquarters of the 5th Battalion, 7th Air Defense Artillery Regiment—which provides command and control operations of Patriot batteries—and the 5th Battalion, 4th Air Defense Artillery Regiment with its short-range air defense capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a broader force-planning perspective, the Army should prioritize the development of additional Patriot battalions, which operate at the highest OPTEMPO of all Army units and are in high demand from multiple combatant commands. Given their value in potential conflicts with China and Russia, the Army should create additional units to limit the stress on and the degradation of the readiness of existing units, particularly given the lack of European capabilities in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of ballistic missile defense, the United States should maintain its current posture and force structure in line with Operation Atlantic Sentry. Relevant units include the five Aegis destroyers homeported in Rota, Spain (with a sixth planned to arrive in 2026), along with the two Aegis Ashore sites based in Romania and Poland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infrastructure, Mobility, and Access:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States, in partnership with host nations and other NATO allies, should take steps to improve military infrastructure and mobility to ensure ease of access, transportation, and reliable communications throughout the European theater. These include enhancements to infrastructure on both U.S. bases and in partner countries, such as the installation of fiber-optic cables and improvements to railways, road networks, and bridges. The DOD and the European Defence Agency (EDA) have identified military mobility as one area of collaboration under an administrative arrangement reached in April 2023 (see security cooperation section below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the United States should continue to update its security and defense cooperation agreements with its partners and allies to ensure ease of access throughout the European theater. In December 2023, the United States reached new agreements with Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Sweden that provided U.S. forces with access to bases and other infrastructure in those countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nuclear-posture&quot;&gt;Nuclear Posture&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should continue with planned nuclear modernization efforts, exercises, and scheduled deployments of assets to the European theater to bolster its deterrent capabilities and reassure allies. The United States currently deploys 100 tactical bombs—the B61-3 and B61-4 gravity bombs—in air bases across five countries in Europe. Under current U.S. nuclear-sharing policy, control over those bombs is maintained by the U.S. Air Force, but seven countries contribute dual-capable aircraft to the mission (Belgium, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Turkey, and the United States) and four air forces (from Belgium, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands) are assigned an active nuclear strike role with those weapons in the event that a nuclear mission is approved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States is currently in the process of modernizing its gravity bombs, with the new B61-12 having begun full-scale production in 2022; deployment originally was planned for the spring of 2023 but has been delayed. NATO is also modernizing its nuclear weapons storage facilities, including making upgrades to command and control structures and base security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. military and NATO should also continue to conduct exercises with nuclear-capable platforms, including Bomber Task Force missions, to enhance readiness and assure allies of U.S. support. These include the annual NATO Steadfast Noon exercise, which practices nuclear sharing. However, such exercises should occur on a regularly scheduled timeline to ensure consistency and to limit the potential for escalation with or misinterpretation by Russia. There is no evidence that unscheduled Bomber Task Force deployments conducted under the dynamic force employment model offered additional deterrent value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cyber-and-space&quot;&gt;Cyber and Space&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the cyber and space domains, U.S. forces should take steps to enhance the security and resilience of their own systems and networks while simultaneously assisting European partners and allies in securing their own capabilities. U.S. Cyber Command should deploy additional “hunt forward” teams to Europe in line with its “defend forward” strategy to counter threats to U.S. forces and allies from Russia and Russian-backed groups. The United States should further define its authorities for and consider expanding its conduct of offensive cyber operations against Russian forces, particularly in the event that the conflict in Ukraine and Russian cyberattacks continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should also expand deployments of U.S. Space Force units and personnel to Europe and define their role within NATO. The service is currently standing up its own component to operate in EUCOM. Space Force units can play a major role in supporting forward-deployed U.S. forces by preventing enemy interference and maintaining open lines of satellite communication. Additionally, space-based ISR assets will continue to play a major role in the European theater, and the U.S. military should further leverage commercial capabilities to fill gaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, U.S. forces should enhance redundancy, in addition to improving the resilience of U.S. assets and networks in terms of both software and hardware. Establishing clear fallback options for communications and ISR in the event of a contingency is vital to ensuring the survivability of networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;security-cooperation&quot;&gt;Security Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to maintaining and bolstering traditional partner capacity-building efforts, the DOD, in tandem with EUCOM and the U.S. Department of State, should adopt a broader approach to security cooperation in the region that supports NATO allies and other European partners in developing and acquiring advanced military capabilities to increase their national and collective NATO force posture and lessen their reliance on U.S. units and platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD should consider standing up a new organization within EUCOM to coordinate broader U.S. security cooperation efforts in Europe and to help close quantitative and qualitative gaps within European militaries that drive their reliance on U.S. forces in some areas. This organization—with representation from the services, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, and the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, and in coordination with the State Department—would directly interface with NATO headquarters and allied militaries to manage requests for security assistance and arms sales, as well as to provide guidance on the development of new capabilities and coordinate information sharing, as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD has already taken some steps to bolster cooperation efforts and information sharing with its April 2023 administrative arrangement with the EDA, which provides a framework for the United States and the EDA to “exchange information and explore collaborative activities falling within the scope of the [EDA’s] mission,” with a focus on areas including supply chain issues, military mobility, and the impact of climate change on defense activities. However, the terms of the agreement specifically preclude “research and technology” from the scope of the arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. military presence in Europe will likely remain contentious for several reasons. Numerous U.S. policymakers and analysts assess China to be the most significant threat to the United States for the foreseeable future and argue that the United States should focus the bulk of its military posture and attention—including its military air, naval, and maritime forces—toward and into the Indo-Pacific. In addition, some policymakers and analysts support decreasing the U.S. presence in Europe because some European governments have generally failed to increase their defense budgets or focus on high-end military capabilities. Finally, some contend that the United States should focus on problems at home, such as combatting immigration, improving health care, and stemming the production, trafficking, and use of such drugs as fentanyl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is some validity in all of these points. China is a major threat, European governments need to spend more (and spend more effectively) on defense, and the United States needs to better address a wide range of challenges at home. Yet, as this analysis maintains, the United States has significant and enduring interests in Europe that will require a force posture of forward defense. A notable decline in the United States’ force posture in Europe would likely be significant and dangerous for U.S. national security in several ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, it would embolden a revanchist Moscow and undermine deterrence in Europe. President Vladimir Putin and other Russian leaders would likely see a declining U.S. force posture in Europe as a sign of weakening U.S. resolve and potentially declining power. The United States’ limited response following Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and military action in eastern Ukraine later that year likely encouraged Russia to take future action. Second, a deteriorating U.S. posture would likely embolden other U.S. adversaries, such as China, and heighten concerns among U.S. allies and partners in Asia about U.S. resolve. The views in Taipei, the most likely flashpoint with China, are striking. Some of Taiwan’s national security leaders have warned that a reduced U.S. commitment to Europe—including aid to Ukraine—would heighten Taiwanese concerns about U.S. resolve. Only 34 percent of those in Taiwan in 2023 believed that the United States is a trustworthy country, a decline of more than 11 percentage points from 2021. Researchers concluded that the drop was partly caused by a perception that U.S. resolve is weakening in Europe, including in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe remains a vital region for the United States. The last two U.S. national security and national defense strategies have prioritized China as the main global threat. But Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine, its continuing aggression, and its growing cooperation with China are stark reminders that the United States has significant and enduring interests in Europe as well.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;前白宮顧問提議制裁駱惠寧 黎智英稱凍結中國官員貪污帳戶最有效&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/AW0oSnU.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，周五（24日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第125日審訊，黎智英第33日作供，控方繼續盤問黎。《香港人權與民主法案》於2019年11月獲美國參議院通過，控方庭上展示2020年4至7月的電郵紀錄，顯示前美國國防部副部長 Paul Wolfowitz 向黎等人表示，受到「公然偏袒的香港法官郭偉健啟發」，故查問法案有否在香港執行，前白宮資深顧問惠頓則提議制裁中聯辦主任駱惠寧，黎則稱：「最有效的方法是凍結中國官員在美國和西方銀行的貪污帳戶。」另外，黎以電郵向美國退休將領 Jack Keane 說：「當美國有更大的軍事支援，人們更安心地在台灣居住和投資。」控方質疑黎目的想向 Jack Keane 重申美國應向台灣提供更多軍事支援。黎否認，強調他只是談論移民議題。黎一度向控方說：「真相似乎未能打動到你（Truth seems to have no bearing on you.）」，接著譏諷道：「你真有創意！（You’re so creative!）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎與美議員合照時拿光時t恤-黎稱沒留意口號遭官質疑&quot;&gt;黎與美議員合照時拿「光時」T恤 黎稱沒留意口號遭官質疑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行繼續圍繞2019年10月的訪美之行提問。控方指，在2019年10月期間，黎會見了數名人士，包括時任美國眾議院議長佩洛西、美國共和黨參議員斯科特（Rick Scott）和楊恩（Todd Young）。昨日訊息顯示黎的私人助手 Mark Simon 嘗試安排黎與時任美國總統特朗普見面，控方問黎最終有否見到特朗普，黎稱沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示黎與斯科特的合照，二人一同手持印有「Stand with Hong Kong，光復香港，時代革命」的T恤拍照。黎稱因為斯科特手持T恤，所以出於禮貌也拿著T恤，堅稱當時沒有留意T恤上面印有什麼。杜官質疑黎不知道？如果T恤上印著的是一個裸女，黎又會否拿著它拍照？黎稱：「我不會回答假設性問題。」他又指，他只是拿著T恤拍照，反問：「有什麼特別的呢？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎特朗普簽署法案顯示支持香港-香港會有更多資本去反抗&quot;&gt;黎：特朗普簽署法案顯示支持香港 香港會有更多「資本」去反抗&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年10月28日，黎向成員包括郭明瀚、李柱銘和 Mark Simon 的群組發送訊息：「Trump knows how powerful HK is as a leverage for his trade deal and beyond. He’s determined it’s a long fight with China. The new Cold War has just unfolded officially. HK has gathered more wherewithal for its resistance. The world is standing closer to us.（特朗普知道香港作為貿易談判的一個籌碼，有多強大，他堅持這是一個對中國的長久戰。新冷戰已非正式地展開。香港已集合更多反抗的資本。世界正在與我們站得更近。）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎之所以傳送上述訊息，是因為《香港人權與民主法案》剛剛獲表決通過。黎否認。控方又問訊息中的「反抗的資本」是什麼。黎回答，如果特朗普簽署了法案，代表他支持香港，那麼香港會有更多「資本」，去反抗中國對自由的侵害、爭取自由。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;曾先後會見兩美國安顧問-黎稱純粹朋友見面&quot;&gt;曾先後會見兩美國安顧問 黎稱純粹朋友見面&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方亦問及黎與美國國家安全委員會的關係。在10月訪美之行前，Mark Simon 告訴黎：「WHNSC say they would be happy to see you/ Martin（白宮國家安全委員會說他們會很高興見到你和李柱銘）」。控方指，美國安委期待黎到訪？黎表示：「你可以這樣說。」可是他最終未有會見美國安委，不知道原因，上述訊息之後，美國安委便沒有再被提起。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎過去有否見過任何美國安委職員？黎指他見過前美國副國家安全顧問博明（Matt Pottinger）及其助理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰提及前美國國家安全顧問博爾頓（John Bolton），問他在任時，是否屬於國安委的一份子？或是領導？黎表示不肯定。但他確認曾與他見面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指國家安全顧問負責就國家安全、軍事和外交政策，向美國總統提供意見，問黎在會見博明的時候是否知道。黎稱不知道，又強調博明是他的朋友，他純粹在那裡與對方見面，而不關注對方職能。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭重提 Mark Simon 的訊息，指9月時白宮國家安全委員會說他們會很高興見到黎，因此國安委的職能必會引起黎的關注。黎則稱：「我見他們，不代表他們關注我。」法官李運騰法官問，當黎得悉美國安委說他們會很高興見到他，黎不會為會面作準備嗎，例如了解對方背景、思考說什麼說話？法官杜麗冰提到，黎在會見斯科特之前，向 Mark Simon 查詢法案名稱。黎稱他只是忘記了法案名稱，因而查詢，不代表他為會面作準備。他又指：「我沒有為會面準備任何事，這不是我的做事方式。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著指，黎在會見時任美國國務卿蓬佩奧之前，有作過準備。黎則稱，那只是蓬佩奧的助手 Mary Kissel 傳送訊息給他，否認他有準備會面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李素蘭又問黎，知不知道為什麼美國安委說很高興見到黎？黎稱不知道，也對於背後原因不感到好奇。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;早前證供提及黎於2019年7月的訪美行程中，曾會見博爾頓。被問到當時為何與博爾頓見面，黎僅指：「他想與我談天，我想與他談天，他是我的朋友。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎同意知悉馬格尼茨基法案是關於制裁-乃懲罰性措施&quot;&gt;黎同意知悉馬格尼茨基法案是關於制裁 乃懲罰性措施&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示一連串電郵。2020年4月24日，美國國防部前副部長 Paul Wolfowitz 向黎智英、Mark Simon 和退休美國將領 Jack Keane 發送電郵，標題為「Magnitsky Act」。Paul 寫道：「Has anything been done about Magnitsky Act in HK（關於馬格尼茨基法案，在香港有沒有做過任何事）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在控方提問下，黎同意當時知悉馬格尼茨基法案是關於制裁，除此之外便什麼也不知道。法官李素蘭問黎，那他知什麼是制裁嗎？黎指制裁對象可以是一個國家，或者一個人。控方又問黎是否同意制裁是一個懲罰性的措施？黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示電郵，Mark Simon 回覆稱沒有，又表示上周與美國參議員的職員討論過，除非見到定罪或實質情況改變，否則「什麼事也不會發生」，Mark 本人認為這不是差的主意，因單是拘捕是不足夠。他表示：「我知道美國國安委有很好的想法，關於他們不會反對誰人遭到馬格尼茨基制裁懲處。（With all that said I know the NSC does have a pretty good idea of who they would not object to being hit with the Magnitsky sanction.）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎庭上稱沒有參與相關討論，按他理解「定罪」即是法庭上的定罪。控方指，此電郵再度顯示 Mark Simon 知道一些內幕消息，問黎知不知道為何 Mark 會談及馬格尼茨基制裁。黎稱不知道，也從沒過問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，當外界與 Mark Simon 溝通的時候，對方知不知道 Mark 是黎的助手，而 Mark 是否代黎行事？黎同意 Mark 代他行事，以他的利益為依歸，但是 Mark 的人脈僅屬於其本人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱美國是唯一救星-因除美國之外沒人關心香港&quot;&gt;黎稱美國是「唯一救星」 因除美國之外沒人關心香港&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，不爭議的是，美國政府在2020年8月7日首次宣布制裁11名損害香港自治的中港官員。控方指，這是發生在上述電郵對話約4個月之後。黎同意。控方再度問黎是否同意Mark Simon與美國政府關係密切，才會知道內幕消息。黎僅稱：「我不知道他是否有緊密聯繫。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，前白宮資深顧問惠頓亦發送電郵回應及提供意見，問黎是否同意惠頓密切跟進香港情況？黎稱不知道惠頓跟進得有多密切，但是同意他知道香港發生的事情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎曾回覆電郵，稱：「美國現在是我們的唯一救星。如果美國不行動的話我們便會很快完蛋。（America is our only savior left now. If America doesn’t act we will be done very soon.）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問為何說美國是「唯一救星」？黎稱：「因為沒有人關心香港」，又稱：「我看不到任何人關心香港，除了美國之外。」控方追問：「所以你想有馬格尼茨基法案？」黎稱：「我沒有這樣說。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;前白宮資深顧問向黎等人提議制裁駱惠寧&quot;&gt;前白宮資深顧問向黎等人提議制裁駱惠寧&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，2020年5月3日，惠頓發送電郵回應 Paul Wolfowitz，副本抄送給黎、Mark Simon 等人。惠頓提議，基於中聯辦主任駱惠寧是政府的「代理人」，牽涉「對國際間認可的人權進行差劣的侵害（gross violations of internationally recognised human rights）」，而制裁駱。電郵附件為一份文件，載有馬格尼茨基法案的資料。黎同日回覆電郵：「很棒的主意。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎庭上指，他早前聘請惠頓協助介紹美國議員給他認識，而非聘請惠頓作為說客，而惠頓當時是主動在電郵上提供策略方面的意見。法官李運騰提及黎回覆：「很棒的主意」；黎則解釋，惠頓提供意見，因此便說是很好的主意，就如表達感謝。李素蘭問黎，惠頓是純粹自願（pure voluntary）提供意見？黎回答：「一定是。（Definitely）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;paul-wolfowitz-稱受法官郭偉健啟發而問及馬格尼茨基法案&quot;&gt;Paul Wolfowitz 稱受法官郭偉健「啟發」而問及馬格尼茨基法案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul Wolfowitz 其後回覆電郵，表示他原本問有關馬格尼茨基法案，是因為「受到這個公然偏袒的香港法官郭偉健啟發（inspired by this blatantly biased Hong Kong judge, WK Kwok）」，又指「即使他好像是小人物（Even though he may seem like small fry）」，但是跟進那些執行指令的人，可能更有效。Paul 稱他亦會跟進退休警官，並提到時任新疆維吾爾自治區黨委書記陳全國「必定是一個制裁對象（should clearly be a candidate for sanctions.）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;電郵並引用黃之鋒社交媒體帖文，以英語指法官郭偉健就連儂牆斬人案判刑時，稱讚被告為「高尚情操」，並作出評論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，Paul 在電郵中上述人士需受制裁，問黎是否同意。黎則稱他沒有表達過任何意見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年5月27日，Jack Keane 向黎傳送電郵，稱讚黎在《霍士新聞》訪問中的言論很好。控方提及黎於5月26日曾接受《霍士新聞》訪問，稱美國應對中國官員實施制裁、凍結銀行帳戶，以及停止向中國輸出技術等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提議，黎所要求的「幫助」，其實是要求美國實施制裁。黎則否認，強調自己只是要求「一般的幫助」，而未有要求他們做什麼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎電郵曾談及凍結官員帳戶-承認期望特朗普作出行動和懲罰&quot;&gt;黎電郵曾談及凍結官員帳戶 承認期望特朗普作出行動和懲罰&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年5月27日，Jack Keane 向黎、Mark Simon 等人轉發《彭博》文章「U.S. Weighs Sanctions on Chinese Officials, Firms Over Hong Kong」。黎發送電郵回覆：「我認為終止《香港人權與民主法案》只會傷害香港的剩餘價值，而且對於阻礙他們行動效果很小。最有效的方法是凍結中國官員在美國和西方銀行的貪污帳戶。所有高級官員都會害怕到可能嘗試延遲頒布國安法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同日，Mark Simon 在電郵中表示曾與美國國安委的人溝通，並談論特朗普與拜登之間的選戰。2020年5月28日即翌日，黎發送電郵指：「這會推動到特朗普做實事，不像拜登的辭藻。當拜登只有空談的時候，特朗普可以用一系列對於中國的制裁和懲罰，帶動選舉的討論。這樣可以創造不同。」控方問黎是否期望特朗普作出行動和懲罰？黎同意，並指他在電郵已經說得很清楚。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎批控方真相似乎未能打動到你&quot;&gt;黎批控方：真相似乎未能打動到你&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年7月9日，Jack Keane 向眾人傳送電郵，內容乃轉發新聞「Hong Kongers say Taiwan is their first choice as exile looms（當流亡逼近，香港人說台灣是首選）」；5月31日，黎以電郵回覆：「That’s true.（這是對的。）」、「With US greater military support, people feel more secure to live and invest in Taiwan. Things are looking up.（當美國有更大的軍事支援，人們更安心地在台灣居住和投資。情況開始好轉。）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑黎提及美國的軍事支援，目的是想向 Jack Keane 重申美國應向台灣提供更多軍事支援。黎否認，強調他只是談論移民議題，若果美國提供更多軍事支援的話，在台灣的人便會更安心居住和投資。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑黎「突然之間（out of the blue）」提起軍事支援。黎堅稱不是「突然之間」，他說出這番言論是因為若有美國支援，人們便會更安心地定居台灣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指，黎的電郵說法，與2017年7月黎替博爾頓準備的筆記，當中所談及美國增加在台灣的軍事存在（military presence）的說法一致。黎則稱相關事件已經發生了。控方指黎希望相關情況持續；黎則稱他沒有這樣說過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎突向控方說：「真相似乎未能打動到你（Truth seems to have no bearing on you.）」，接著譏諷道：「你真不受拘束！（You’re so free!）」、「你真有創意！（You’re so creative!）」、「你是一個很棒的檢控官！（You’re great as a prosecutor.）」法官杜麗冰則打斷黎，叫黎只需要回答問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至2020年7月27日，黎再度以電郵向 Jack Keane 說：「台灣的投資需要美國更大的軍事支援，使它更加出眾。我們見到更多投資者近來湧進台灣，因為美國的更多軍事支援。台灣的投資界對於美國的軍事支援是很敏感⋯⋯」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎庭上解釋，上述電郵是說若果美國增加軍事支援，台灣人會更安心地居住和投資。控方質疑，黎在較早前的說法，卻是指美國的軍事存在可以制衡中國的好戰態度（belligerence）？黎僅回應：「當你將說話塞進我的口，我是不會回答你。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;人大528決定之後-黎訊息稱懲罰中國是制止危機的唯一方法&quot;&gt;人大5.28決定之後 黎訊息稱：「懲罰中國是制止危機的唯一方法」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，Mark Simon 於2020年5月29日創立WhatsApp 群組「DC Dems」，成員包括他、黎、郭明瀚和 Paul Wolfowitz。同日，Mark Simon 向群組發送訊息，稱在美國國務院向 David Feith 打聽到數項消息，包括香港不會再維持特殊地位、「在簽證、官員家人、接觸大學方面強烈同意」等。Mark Simon 另一則訊息指蓬佩奧昨日的記者會「全都關於中國如何侵害香港自治」，又指「今晚6時有記者會，有多一些中層人士講及制裁。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同日，Mark Simon 另傳送訊息，就美國是否應該有「非常寬容的移民政策」，讓香港人來美國定居，冀向郭明瀚和 Paul Wolfowitz 徵詢意見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同日，黎向群組傳送訊息，重申在現階段最強的制裁是凍結中國官員的貪污帳戶，又指廢除香港法案會損害香港的剩餘價值，只會傷害香港人，因為明顯地習近平為了他一個人而放棄了香港。黎另一則訊息提到：「懲罰中國是制止危機的唯一方法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指稱，從上述訊息可見，黎智英當時已經知悉全國人大常委會有關制訂國安法的「5.28決定」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑黎為了滿足美國的需求-不介意犧牲香港的利益&quot;&gt;控方質疑黎為了滿足美國的需求 不介意犧牲香港的利益&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年5月29日，黎向群組傳送另一則訊息，說：「我同意懲罰中國而非傷害香港。香港愈受到傷害，它對於中國來說便愈少剩餘價值，中國更容易放棄香港。在中國經濟最差的時候，中國需要香港作為通往外界的渠道。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，黎當時的想法仍然是不希望傷害香港、想香港維持有特殊地位？黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，可是黎的想法在國安法生效之後改變了，他希望取消香港特殊地位。黎指想法「類似」，因為如果香港因為國安法實施而「完蛋了」，便什麼也沒有所謂了。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方重提早前主問證供，2020年7月15日，蓬佩奧助手 Mary Kissel 經 Mark Simon 詢問黎對於撤銷香港特殊地位的立場，黎當時回覆：「我是說撤銷香港特殊地位是不需要的，因為在國安法下，香港怎樣也好都會完蛋。重點不在於香港而在於中國。制裁中國以阻止她打壓香港。但是就此思考後，我認為他們撤回香港特殊地位是正確的，因為一旦美國和中國之間脫鈎，香港會是中國的出口。若然關閉這個中國的出口的話，會更輕易地迫使中國回應美國的要求。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指黎的立場變得更加「進取（aggressive）」。黎回應：「不，我只是採取悲觀的想法。」他解釋：「如果香港完蛋了，什麼也沒有所謂了。」控方問黎，他的證供一直說要爭取香港的利益。惟黎指因為香港怎樣也好已經完蛋，反問：「還有什麼可以爭取？」控方問黎，所以他不介意取消特殊地位？黎同意，又指沒有東西可以再失去。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎否認其說法屬「攬炒」：「香港不是因為我們而被犧牲，而是因為國安法實施而被犧牲。」控方最後指出，黎為了滿足美國的需求，不介意犧牲香港的利益。黎不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;因農曆新年關係，下星期不會開庭，案件將於2月3日續審，屆時控方繼續盤問黎。法官杜麗冰祝大家新年快樂。周天行亦回應：「祝法庭來年健康及繁榮。」&lt;/p&gt;

In late 2024, a group of U.S. technology policy and national security scholars, including the four authors of this paper, traveled to the UAE to understand the country’s AI strategy, its position amid U.S.-China competition, and Microsoft’s $1.5 billion deal with Emirati national AI champion Group 42 Holding Ltd. (G42). The visit combined meetings arranged through the authors’ existing networks with those suggested and facilitated by the UAE embassy in Washington, D.C. This paper presents the authors’ following eight assessments about the opportunities and risks of U.S.-UAE cooperation in AI:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The UAE’s commitment to AI represents a genuine national priority with broad leadership support and ambitious economic targets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Emirati officials claim to be “decoupling” from China in AI while acknowledging that they are trying to maintain broader economic ties with both China and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite the UAE’s stated commitment to U.S. partnership in AI, China is exerting significant pressure to reinforce its technological influence in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While Emirati officials accept the national security justification for U.S. export controls, they express frustration with the United States’ implementation of these controls and the UAE’s country classification.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s $1.5 billion investment in G42 reflects its strategy to secure leadership in global AI cloud infrastructure and expand its AI applications portfolio worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;G42’s ambitions extend far beyond its Microsoft partnership. The company desires to build 10 to 100 times more data center capacity (independently or with additional partners) than outlined in its current Microsoft agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to G42 and Microsoft representatives, the security controls at the G42 data center the authors toured match typical U.S. commercial standards. While the authors did not find evidence to dispute these claims, the broader question remains whether such commercial-grade controls—whether in the United States or UAE—will prove sufficient as AI capabilities advance and state-sponsored threats evolve.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States faces two key questions: how to engage with “swing states” in the U.S.-China technology competition, and specifically how to approach the UAE’s ambitious AI aspirations. While the immediate decision centers on AI chip exports, this choice will inform the broader strategy of how to diffuse U.S. technology—from AI chips to cloud services—globally.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global leadership in AI remains the United States’ to lose, but continued U.S. leadership is by no means assured. The United States can support Microsoft-led projects in the UAE while remaining cautious of endorsing the UAE’s broader AI ambitions. U.S. policymakers and AI executives should maintain a healthy realism about the UAE’s vested interests in hedging its bets between the United States and China. They should ask tough questions—such as what the Emirati government is doing to ensure decoupling from China in AI by tech companies other than G42—and scrutinize the UAE’s answers. For now, however, proceed with caution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) in recent years have sparked a global race to develop and control the next generation of AI models, which a large and influential group of senior AI executives and leading researchers believe will be a meaningful step toward human-level intelligence. If they are correct, such technology would have transformative implications for both U.S. national security and the global economy. Leading U.S. companies are making extraordinary and unprecedented investments, reflecting their belief that such a technological revolution is nearly at hand. For instance, according to October 2024 financial disclosures, tech giants Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta are expected to surpass $300 billion in 2025 capital expenditures on AI—a projected 25 percent increase from 2024 and nearly double the 2023 figure. These four companies are hardly alone; in November 2024, Elon Musk’s xAI reportedly raised $6 billion to purchase 100,000 Nvidia H100 graphics processing units (GPUs, also known as AI chips) for the company’s Colossus supercomputer. In December 2024, xAI announced plans to expand the facility to 1 million chips, which could require another $54 billion (assuming consistent chip models and pricing). Meanwhile, the United States and China are locked in a fierce struggle over critical elements of the AI and semiconductor supply chain and are accordingly investing tens of billions annually in building domestic AI capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, the wealthy and increasingly influential UAE has inserted itself into the global AI race. The UAE government has identified AI as a critical opportunity to diversify its economy for a post-oil future in line with global climate pledges. At the same time, the country’s strategic advantages—abundant energy, rapid construction, and close connectivity to markets in the rest of the Middle East and Global South—are highly attractive to U.S. AI companies looking to expand AI infrastructure worldwide. U.S. and Emirati companies have already announced billions of dollars in partnerships. On January 21, 2025, OpenAI announced plans for a $500 billion private sector investment vehicle called The Stargate Project to build U.S. AI infrastructure for OpenAI alongside Abu Dhabi investment firm MGX and Japanese investment firm Softbank. In September 2024, MGX and U.S. firms Microsoft, BlackRock, and Global Infrastructure Partners also launched a fund for AI data centers and supporting infrastructure with an investment potential of $100 billion. Additionally, in April 2024, Microsoft announced a $1.5 billion investment deal with Emirati AI national champion Group 42 Holding Ltd. (G42). At a government level, UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan (also known as MBZ) met with U.S. President Joe Biden in Washington in September 2024, culminating in a bilateral AI cooperation agreement between the two nations. Emirati leadership has also participated in investment talks with other U.S. industry leaders, such as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, to support a $7 trillion project to expand global AI infrastructure, including in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some experts in Washington view the United States’ growing partnership with the UAE in AI as a critical opportunity to compete with China. The United States’ lead in AI—especially in AI chips—could offer an opportunity to coax the UAE and other “swing states,” which are agnostic to U.S.-China competition, away from China’s sprawling technological reach. The Biden administration’s decisionmaking rested on the assumption that foreign governments will be willing to jump through procedural hoops to access superior U.S. technology as they seek to develop their own indigenous AI capabilities. By offering access to U.S. compute power with strings attached—via export license conditions—the theory goes that the United States can regain geopolitical influence in regions where it is slipping. This bargaining position is particularly strong given that the United States can offer a comprehensive technological package—from advanced AI chips to cutting-edge models and cloud infrastructure—that China currently cannot match at scale. These export conditions could secure commitments not only for enhanced cybersecurity but also for the responsible development and deployment of AI. In the case of the UAE, this strategy has, for now, proven effective. In response to U.S. pressure, G42 has reportedly divested from Chinese technology firms, stripped Chinese tech giant Huawei’s equipment from its data centers, and implemented strict security measures (see points two and seven of this paper) to secure shipments of Nvidia H100 chips to the UAE. The U.S. government reportedly approved the export licenses of these chips to a Microsoft-operated facility in late 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, there are substantial risks to exporting large numbers of advanced AI chips to a nondemocratic country with strong ties to China and deploying leading U.S. AI models there. Unlike traditional technology transfers, AI chips can be accessed remotely, meaning their computing power could be diverted even if the physical hardware remains secure. Furthermore, hosting model weights abroad increases the risk of data exfiltration, particularly if data center security and IT infrastructure prove inadequate. Some U.S. lawmakers have raised concerns that such transfers could allow entities with connections to the Chinese Communist Party and People’s Liberation Army (PLA) backdoor access to U.S. AI technology and know-how, thereby evading U.S. export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address these concerns, the UAE has eagerly voiced its commitment to working with the United States in AI. In June 2024, UAE Minister of State for AI Omar Al Olama stated, “The honest truth is in the AI space today, I think we need to be selective of who we work with. . . . But on the AI front, I think there is going to be complete alignment between the UAE and the U.S.” At the Dubai GITEX Global Expo in October 2024, G42 CEO Peng Xiao, a former U.S. national who renounced his U.S. citizenship for Emirati citizenship, similarly remarked that the UAE’s relationship with the United States “cannot be stronger.” He added, “We’ve shown from [the] UAE side how transparent we are, and how we can guarantee the safety and security of this technology even when [it is] being deployed and used here in [the] UAE.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ultimate question is whether the United States can trust the UAE’s claims, especially when the stakes may be nothing less than leadership of a new geopolitical order. On the one hand, the United States must ensure that China cannot access U.S. technology and that the UAE is not simply hedging its bets to secure the best AI chips it can obtain by playing the United States and China against each other. More broadly, if AI reaches human-level intelligence, the United States should be cautious not to offshore its advantage too quickly. On the other hand, without rapid expansion of AI and energy infrastructure beyond current U.S. capabilities—or a plan to entice emerging powers to choose U.S. technology over China’s—the United States risks losing its global technological lead altogether. These are the kinds of tough trade-offs that the second Trump administration, which has vowed to “Make America First in AI,” must now face as it decides whether to continue approving export licenses to the UAE, at what rate, and under what conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late 2024, a delegation of U.S. technology policy and national security scholars traveled to the UAE to better understand the country’s AI ambitions, its position amidst U.S.-China competition, and Microsoft’s deal with G42. Prior to the trip, CSIS experts identified stakeholders and arranged meetings with help and independently from the UAE embassy in Washington, D.C., and solicited input from the other delegation members. The UAE embassy also suggested government and private sector stakeholders that may be of interest for the delegation to meet, which the delegation was at liberty to accept or reject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper presents the authors’ key judgments from the trip based on private interviews with top-level UAE government officials, senior Microsoft and G42 executives, a site visit to a G42/Microsoft data center, and conversations with U.S. and allied government officials. The paper concludes by presenting two strategic questions (point eight) to U.S. policymakers about engaging with the UAE’s AI ambitions in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-implications-for-us-ai-leadership&quot;&gt;Key Implications for U.S. AI Leadership&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-the-uaes-commitment-to-ai-represents-a-genuine-national-priority-with-broad-leadership-support-and-ambitious-economic-targets&quot;&gt;1. The UAE’s commitment to AI represents a genuine national priority with broad leadership support and ambitious economic targets.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many governments notionally aspire to be global leaders in AI, few are as genuinely serious as the UAE. Total Emirati AI investment is not publicly disclosed, but the figure is clearly in the many tens (to possibly low hundreds) of billions of dollars. In March 2024, Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala, G42, and the UAE state-backed Artificial Intelligence and Advanced Technology Council announced the creation of MGX, an AI investment vehicle expected to eventually reach $100 billion in assets. Six months later in September, MGX, together with U.S. firms BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners, and Microsoft, launched a global AI infrastructure fund with an initial $30 billion in private equity capital and $100 billion in investment potential. More recently, on January 21, 2025, OpenAI announced that MGX will be one of the initial four equity funders for the new “Stargate Project,” which plans to invest $500 billion in building U.S. AI infrastructure for OpenAI over the next four years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underpinning these investments is a real conviction that profound economic and social transformation from AI is near. Top UAE government strategists told the authors that the UAE aims to have 20 percent of its non-oil GDP come from AI by 2031, in line with the dates set by the UAE National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence 2031, the government’s principal AI strategy document. The strategy projects that AI will contribute $91 billion (AED 335 billion) to the Emirati economy within six years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, one foreign government official told the two CSIS authors that several UAE leaders are “true believers” in artificial general intelligence (AGI), a currently hypothetical scenario in which AI meets or exceeds human levels of intelligence across all or most domains. According to this source, UAE National Security Advisor and G42 Chair Sheikh Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan believes that AI will be able to perform any human-level job in the near future and that this will be an economic and national security revolution. Though Al Nahyan has not made any public statements on this issue, he has repeatedly met with top AI executives who have been outspoken on AGI—including Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang—as part of ongoing partnerships between G42, the UAE government, and the three U.S. companies. OpenAI’s press announcement of the Stargate Project, of which MGX is a key investor, concludes with the statement that “All of us look forward to continuing to build and develop AI – and in particular AGI – for the benefit of all humanity.” Al Nahyan is the head of a reportedly $1.5 trillion sovereign wealth empire and embodies a tech-guru persona that puts him in the same orbit as many of the world’s largest tech CEOs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-uae-officials-claim-to-be-decoupling-from-china-in-ai-while-acknowledging-that-they-are-trying-to-maintain-broader-economic-ties-with-both-china-and-the-united-states&quot;&gt;2. UAE officials claim to be decoupling from China in AI while acknowledging that they are trying to maintain broader economic ties with both China and the United States.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple UAE government officials told the authors that they see decoupling from China in AI as a critical condition for cooperation with the United States. In a private meeting, one top-level government official made this clear: “Working with the U.S. on sensitive technology—for that, decoupling is the right word. I think we have to do it; in that isolated part of our economy, it must be done.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several other officials echoed this sentiment. One high-ranking government strategist described cooperation on AI as a zero-sum game in the context of U.S.-China competition, stating, “We put all our eggs in one basket working with the U.S.” Another stated, “This relationship [with the United States] is very critical to us. We take the trust that the U.S. puts in us very seriously.” They concluded that, to meet its long-term goal of cooperating with the United States in AI, the UAE’s government understands that it must take action to enforce decoupling from Chinese AI technology in order to pursue its larger AI-related goals—even if it means hurting Emirati firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emirati officials principally cited G42’s divestment from Chinese companies as evidence of decoupling from China in AI. Prominent U.S. national security officials have openly criticized G42’s ties to China, including its portfolio companies’ ties to Chinese military and intelligence firms, as well as Xiao’s personal affiliations with companies that contribute to Chinese military-civil fusion and human rights abuses. In January 2025, Wired also published a feature on G42 Chair and National Security Advisor Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan, which detailed years of covert hacking and mass-surveillance operations orchestrated by the Emirati government and state-controlled firm DarkMatter to monitor journalists, human rights activists, and other members of state opposition. Following a public scandal in 2019, DarkMatter was dissolved and reportedly subsumed in large parts by G42.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To combat these claims, G42 argues that it has demonstrated its commitment to the United States by publicly cutting ties with China. As early as December 2023, Xiao told the Financial Times, “In order for us to further our relationship—which we cherish—with our U.S. partners, we simply cannot do much more with [previous] Chinese partners.” Xiao added, “We cannot work with both sides. We can’t.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, one senior G42 representative told the authors that G42 had “willingly” divested its passive investments in Chinese tech firms ByteDance, xFusion, and Honor in November 2023 to “disambiguate” G42’s position vis-à-vis China and demonstrate transparency. The statement supports reporting from the Financial Times in February 2024, in which 42X Fund, G42’s $10 billion investment arm, told the outlet that it had “divested from all its investments in China.” G42 also said that it is taking pains to strengthen security measures in its data centers, including additional security controls (see points four and seven) and scrapping what one of its representatives told the authors was $1.7–$2 billion worth of Chinese hardware, including from Huawei, from its facilities (although one G42 representative admitted that a sizable portion of the Chinese equipment had already significantly depreciated in value by the time it was removed from the data centers). Microsoft officials told the authors that their staff have personally visited G42 facilities and seen Huawei equipment being stripped and discarded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, there are several reasons to be skeptical of G42 and the UAE’s decoupling claims. For one, China has raised no public issue with G42 stripping Chinese hardware from their facilities (a peculiar silence given its retaliation in response to similar actions from other countries in the past), which could suggest some kind of quiet agreement between the two nations. For another, in July 2024, Bloomberg reported that G42’s divestments from Chinese firms were transferred to a new Abu Dhabi investment vehicle, Lunate. Lunate, like G42 and multiple Emirati sovereign wealth funds, is overseen by the UAE’s national security advisor. The transfer of investments raises serious questions as to whether G42—and the wider UAE—is serious about divesting from Chinese companies in AI. Lunate publicly advertises that it has $105 billion of assets under management, including one S&amp;amp;P China/Hong Kong Exchange Traded Fund with top holdings in Chinese tech companies Alibaba (27.7 percent), Meituan (18.9 percent), and Xiaomi (8.10 percent).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For another, it is not obvious to what extent the UAE is expanding decoupling from China in cutting-edge technology, including AI, to other major Emirati tech companies. G42 is undoubtedly viewed by the UAE’s government as a national champion. Through a deeply interwoven relationship between G42 leadership and the government, the company has become a symbol for the UAE’s AI development writ large. There are, however, other Emirati companies that merit scrutiny, particularly those working with U.S. and Chinese companies simultaneously. In March 2022, for instance, Huawei and UAE state-owned telecommunications company e&amp;amp; (formerly Etisalat Group) launched a 5G cloud edge computing platform called 5G Edge Box. The announcement came just months after e&amp;amp; launched a similar 5G edge cloud computing platform with Microsoft. According to Microsoft, the platform will deploy “Microsoft Azure Stack Edge to offer 5G, IoT, and AI applications.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;e&amp;amp; continues to collaborate with both Huawei and Microsoft to provide 5G cloud edge networks. In February 2024, e&amp;amp; signed a new memorandum of understanding with Huawei to build energy-efficient networks in the UAE, which states that “e&amp;amp; will continue to work with Huawei to achieve network decarbonisation across its ICT infrastructure, including . . . data centers.” It is unclear from public statements to what extent Huawei’s “network decarbonization” of e&amp;amp; information and communications technology infrastructure could affect e&amp;amp;’s current or future U.S.-operated data centers in the UAE. For example, in October 2024, e&amp;amp; and Amazon Web Services (AWS) announced a $1 billion cloud agreement, which “combines AWS’s cloud infrastructure and solutions . . . with e&amp;amp;’s network capabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, as of 2021, e&amp;amp; owns 40 percent equity in wholesale data center developer and leasing operator Khazna, the main developer of Microsoft’s AI data centers in the UAE (described in more detail in point five below). G42 owns the remaining 60 percent and claims Khazna as a G42 portfolio company. Figure 1 illustrates G42’s portfolio companies and examples of foreign partnerships, and Figure 2 maps G42’s portfolio companies across the AI value chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside the realm of technology, the UAE’s relationship with China runs deep. On November 1, 2024, China and the UAE celebrated their 40th year of diplomatic relations, marked by a public statement from Chinese President Xi Jinping in which he described the two countries as “good friends who trust each other and good partners for win-win cooperation.” UAE President MBZ likewise said, “The UAE remains committed to consolidating and developing a comprehensive strategic partnership with China.” Senior Emirati officials speak of a golden era of Chinese-Emirati cooperation, a sentiment echoed by the Chinese ambassador to the UAE who described this as the “best period of time since we established diplomatic relationships in 1984.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, China is the UAE’s top trading partner, with UAE government estimates valuing non-oil trade at $82 billion in 2023, a 34 percent increase from 2021. Despite a show of partnership with the United States in AI, the UAE continues to work closely with the Chinese government and technology firms in sensitive areas such as 5G, drones, and other military technologies. For instance, the UAE’s Air Force and China’s PLA Air Force conducted a joint military exercise in July 2024 in Xinjiang province, China, which may have allowed the PLA access to intelligence about Western combat aircraft capabilities. The joint exercise came just months before the Biden administration designated the UAE a “major defense partner” of the United States, expanding bilateral defense and security cooperation through joint military exercises among other measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, one top-level government strategist privately called the idea of a complete decoupling from China “anathema” to UAE policymakers. Because Emirati policy is driven by geoeconomics rather than geopolitics, the strategist said, the UAE will continue to develop a strong trade relationship with China at the same time as with the United States. UAE Assistant Minister for Advanced Science and Technology Omran Sharaf publicly stated in a November 2024 interview on AI and diplomacy that this delicate navigation between two great powers is what other third-party countries are “trying to learn from the UAE model.” While countries caught between U.S.-China competition are increasingly under pressure to choose between U.S. and Chinese technology and values, the “countries who are able to navigate that the best are the ones who get the most out of the opportunities that are there globally, whether economic or other areas that involve science and tech,” Sharaf said. This thinking suggests a more careful balancing of UAE diplomatic relations between the United States and China (including in technology) than the zero-sum commitment to the United States that other UAE government officials have described.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UAE’s approach to decoupling from China requires careful distinction between rhetoric and reality. While G42’s actions demonstrate company-level separation from Chinese technology in AI, the broader picture is more nuanced. First, what constitutes the scope of this decoupling remains unclear—whether it applies narrowly to AI or extends to all advanced technology sectors such as 5G. Second, the transfer of Chinese investments from G42 to Lunate suggests more of a reorganization than true divestment. Third, other major Emirati tech companies continue to maintain simultaneous partnerships with both U.S. and Chinese firms. This selective decoupling approach is perhaps unsurprising—even the United States maintains extensive economic ties with China while restricting specific strategic technologies. The critical question is not whether the UAE will completely decouple from China, which would be an unrealistic expectation, but whether it can establish credible boundaries in strategic technology sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-despite-the-uaes-stated-commitment-to-us-partnership-in-ai-china-is-exerting-significant-pressure-to-reinforce-its-technological-influence-in-the-region&quot;&gt;3. Despite the UAE’s stated commitment to U.S. partnership in AI, China is exerting significant pressure to reinforce its technological influence in the region.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese government and Chinese companies, notably Huawei, are reportedly spreading the message that U.S. delays in approving exports of AI chips to the UAE prove that the United States is a selfish and unreliable partner. One UAE government official in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs privately noted that China is putting a great deal of pressure on the UAE government to lure them away from the United States in strategic tech, posing a tough diplomacy challenge for the UAE. Similarly, a senior Microsoft representative said that Huawei is trying to leverage the United States’ slow approval to ship semiconductors to the UAE “to the extreme” in its effort to get UAE officials back on board. The representative pointed to Huawei’s top “diamond” sponsorship of the UAE’s flagship GITEX Global Expo, held in Dubai in October 2024, as evidence that China has not given up on the goal of being the dominant AI supplier to the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One government official said that while Chinese technology is inferior to that of the United States, the UAE must get advanced technology from somewhere to boost its competitiveness. In late 2024, the Chinese firm Alibaba released a new open-weight large language model (LLM), Qwen2.5. Senior executives at two top-tier U.S. AI firms told one CSIS author that Qwen2.5’s release led them to dramatically reassess the extent to which the United States has a meaningful technological lead in AI. Specifically, one executive told the CSIS author that “the conventional wisdom that U.S. AI firms have an 18-month lead on Chinese firms is clearly wrong and needs to be updated.” Jack Clark, a cofounder of Anthropic, wrote that “Qwen models outperform rival Chinese [computer code-generating AI] models from companies like Yi and DeepSeek and approach or in some cases exceed the performance of powerful proprietary models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet and OpenAI’s o1 models.” More recently, impressive jumps in the performance of Deepseek’s “V3” model have fueled concerns about China’s advancement of frontier model capabilities. On January 21, 2025, former OpenAI Senior Advisor Miles Brundage tweeted, “Stargate + related efforts could help the U.S. stay ahead of China, but China will still have their own superintelligence(s) no more than a year later than the US, absent e.g. a war.” These statements are important because Emirati officials repeatedly stated in private meetings that their perception of U.S. technological leadership was the key reason for their willingness to decouple from China in AI technology. If the United States were to lose this strategic advantage, the UAE could decide to redirect its attention to Chinese technology firms, much like it did with 5G.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, UAE, G42, and Microsoft leadership cited several reasons the UAE would not—or could not—switch so easily. First, while China is making progress in some areas like AI models, the United States maintains critical advantages in the broader AI technology stack, particularly in advanced chips and the scale of production needed for large AI infrastructure. Model performance is just one metric of technological leadership—China continues to lag significantly in AI chip development and production capability due to U.S. export controls. These controls limit both the quality of chips China can produce and, critically, the quantity they can manufacture at scale, making it difficult for China to match U.S. capacity in providing the computing infrastructure needed for advanced AI development. While model performance comparisons may narrow, China’s limited ability to produce advanced AI chips at scale could preserve U.S. strategic advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, one senior Microsoft executive argued that even if the UAE wanted to, switching back to Huawei AI infrastructure may soon become prohibitively technically challenging. Microsoft officials claimed that if the United States approves Microsoft’s exports of AI chips, they can “lock” the UAE into a U.S.-led technological ecosystem, allegedly due to high switching costs between different cloud and AI infrastructures as well as network effects for AI-enabled software applications. Creating technological lock-in becomes particularly powerful when combined with China’s limited ability to provide comparable computing infrastructure at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this claim proves true, it would suggest that the United States could exploit its current technological lead to secure an enduring advantage over China in the next few years. The authors are not in a position to assess the accuracy of the executive’s claim definitively, and it should be regarded with some degree of skepticism: Large AI companies have deep pools of engineering talent that they could use to overcome lock-in, if necessary. Additionally, the fact that companies like Anthropic use multiple cloud providers for their AI models—with Anthropic even beginning to use AWS’s custom chips—suggests that while switching and working across infrastructure platforms may be difficult for many companies, it is not prohibitively difficult for those as well-resourced as Anthropic, OpenAI, or G42.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;G42’s own strategy further illustrates this point: the company aims to “abstract the silicon away” through partnerships with multiple chip providers. It is already the largest customer of AI chip startup Cerebras and is running one of its clusters in California, while also recently partnering with Qualcomm to procure AI chips. In several conversations, representatives from Core42, G42’s sovereign cloud and AI infrastructure portfolio company, emphasized their goal to build on top of different types of AI chips and abstract it away for their customers. This diversification of chip suppliers and infrastructure suggests that while AI chips alone may not provide an insurmountable competitive moat (though Qualcomm and Cerebras are both subject to U.S. export controls), offering a comprehensive technology stack—including chips, cloud infrastructure, and AI applications—could create more durable strategic advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4-while-emirati-officials-accept-the-national-security-justification-for-us-export-controls-they-express-frustration-with-the-united-states-implementation-of-these-controls-and-the-uaes-country-classification&quot;&gt;4. While Emirati officials accept the national security justification for U.S. export controls, they express frustration with the United States’ implementation of these controls and the UAE’s country classification.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several UAE government and AI company representatives readily acknowledged and agreed with the underlying reasons for the United States’ concern in exporting AI chips to the UAE in private meetings. Most notably, one UAE government official said that the UAE understands that the United States cannot “shoot itself in the foot” regarding AI. The official stated that the United States has a right to place restrictions given what the official described as the “dual-use nature” of the technology and the boost that it will give to military and intelligence capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On October 15, 2024, in a public interview at the GITEX Global Expo, G42’s Xiao echoed the UAE government official’s words. Xiao was asked whether he felt that the United States is using then-proposed caps on chip exports to some countries, including in the Middle East, as leverage for achieving its diplomatic goals. Xiao responded:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I cannot read the mind of the U.S. policymakers, but in many ways, I understand their position. . . . When a nation, or even when a company or individual [has] invented a new technology, it’s only natural [that] you want to hold on to that edge . . . to make sure [that] because this new technology is so cutting edge, before you figure out how to properly use it, it cannot be possibly misused by others. So, in many ways, I understand that position [the] U.S. government has taken. At the same time from our side—we’ve shown from [the] UAE side how transparent we are and how we can guarantee the safety and security of this technology, even when [it is] being deployed and used here in [the] UAE. So, I think that door is opening up for us to do a lot more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another top G42 executive privately agreed with Xiao, saying that he recognizes that G42 is not the target of U.S. export controls but rather “just collateral damage” in U.S. competition with China. The executive expressed support for an “N-1” strategy, in which the United States maintains exclusive access to the most cutting-edge AI chips for a certain period before allowing them to be exported abroad. The executive said that with sole ownership of the latest and most powerful chips for six months, for example, the United States could benefit from enhanced performance first and exercise greater control over AI diffusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, the executive said that G42 has implemented strict controls to demonstrate as much compliance and transparency to the United States as possible. According to Semafor reporting from September 2024, Microsoft-operated G42 data centers use military-grade encryption and are audited by U.S. Department of Defense contractors to test for potential security breaches that could be exploited by China. The Microsoft deal also reportedly forbids G42 from using Microsoft services or AI chips for surveillance and mandates that it seek permission from Microsoft to share the technology with other governments or militaries. On top of these controls, the G42 executive stated that G42 has applied even stricter security controls on its data centers than is required by the U.S. government and Microsoft (see point seven). According to G42 documents shared with the authors, additional controls include but are not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Standard data center information security policies and procedures (such as personnel security, cybersecurity, and campus security measures);&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;U.S. export license requirements (such as entity list restrictions, conformity inspections, U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security notification of noncompliance, record retention, and computer security monitoring);&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;over 100 controls voluntarily adopted by G42 from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Risk Management Framework SP 800-53 security and privacy controls for information systems and organizations; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;enhanced customer due diligence procedures, including rigorous Know-Your-Customer requirements with particular attention to customers who train frontier models.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of these controls appear to be standard security measures commonly implemented by commercial data centers and major cloud providers. Without significantly more detailed information about their implementation—as cybersecurity effectiveness often lies in technical specifics—it is difficult to assess whether these controls represent meaningful improvements or adequately address the unique threats posed by state actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A G42 executive indicated that while these controls are necessary to demonstrate compliance and cooperation with the United States, they are placing a heavy financial burden on the company. The executive stated that “our costs are too high at the moment due to compliance,” which is causing G42 to lose customers to other companies without such strict controls. The executive concluded that they would like to see the United States standardize compliance requirements and apply them to companies around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple UAE government officials also voiced frustration that the United States’ tight restrictions are unjust given the UAE’s demonstrated willingness to play by the United States’ rules. One official said that the UAE’s categorization as a “D:4” country on the Department of Commerce Control List Country Chart (alongside countries like Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and Yemen) is unfair, objecting to being “grouped with our crazy neighbors,” given its demonstrated cooperation with the United States in AI and other sensitive technologies in the past. The official pointed to the UAE’s successful collaboration with the United States on space and nuclear projects as proof of this commitment to technological security. For example, in January 2024, NASA announced that the UAE’s Mohamed bin Rashid Space Centre will provide crew members and an airlock module for its new lunar space station, Gateway. Similarly, in January 2009, the United States and the UAE signed a so-called 123 Agreement for bilateral cooperation on peaceful nuclear energy, which remains in effect today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, UAE officials seek clearer guidance on pathways to improved country designation and more consistent, long-term policies that transcend changes in U.S. administrations. One official said that U.S. export controls are clear on an entity-to-entity basis but not at a countrywide level, making the government hesitant to take further action to decouple from China until the United States gives it a clear road map as to what it will take to move up the country designation list. Furthermore, this official said that the United States’ constantly changing export requirements makes real cooperation near impossible, stating, “We respect the U.S. system, we understand your concerns, but as a partner we need stability.” Another top-level official similarly stated that changes in U.S. administrations’ strategies toward China make it unclear how the United States expects the UAE and “countries like us” to navigate their relationship with both powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Officials stated that the recently announced Validated End User program for data centers represents a promising step toward establishing a more predictable framework for technology transfers while maintaining necessary security safeguards. The U.S. government has since (in January 2024) announced a Framework for AI Diffusion that builds upon this VEU program, though this development occurred after the authors’ field research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;5-microsofts-15-billion-investment-in-g42-reflects-a-strategic-pivot-toward-securing-leadership-in-global-ai-cloud-inference-infrastructure-and-ai-applications&quot;&gt;5. Microsoft’s $1.5 billion investment in G42 reflects a strategic pivot toward securing leadership in global AI cloud inference infrastructure and AI applications.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“It’s all inference, right?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last year, Microsoft has faced considerable scrutiny from the Department of Commerce, Congress, and U.S. national security agencies over its deal with G42 and its efforts to secure shipments of Nvidia AI chips to the UAE. This deal speaks to Microsoft’s evolving strategy for global AI leadership, which involves establishing a strong position in AI inference infrastructure to run AI models rather than an exclusive focus on training them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s FY 2025 Q1 earnings call on October 30, 2024, with CEO Satya Nadella provides some important clues to Microsoft’s views on the increasing importance of inference (referring to the general process in which an AI model is deployed post-training). In response to an analyst’s question about Microsoft’s strategy for investing in AI models, Nadella responded:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Capital outlay for training . . . is going to be rate limited by your monetization of inference in a given generation, right? So just like in the past, we would allocate capital to build out cloud based on the demand signal we were seeing and then we would project the demand, and that’s what we would build it for. So, you can think of training essentially as that, right, which is you’re building the next-generation model so that then you have a more capable model that then drives more inference demand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s interest in AI models as a way to boost cloud inference demand may help to explain its partial split from OpenAI over the last year; at one time, Microsoft needed to jumpstart AI model demand for its cloud service to run models. However, as October’s earning call suggests, demand is now booming and self-reinforcing such that it might not require continued Microsoft investment and allegiance to an individual model maker. On a December 2024 BG2 podcast episode, Nadella went as far as to say that there will be no one AI model to rule them all in the future. He said, “I don’t think it’s going to be winner-take-all. . . . The world will demand, even ex-China, multiple providers of frontier models distributed all over the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, Microsoft may view inference as the ultimate moneymaker in AI. In the October 2024 earnings call, one analyst asked:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Analyst: These models are getting bigger, more expensive, but you also pointed out how in the inference phase, we’re likely to get paid. How does that cycle look like in inference for Microsoft?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Satya Nadella: I mean the good news for us is that we’re not waiting for that inference to show up. . . . This is going to be the fastest growth to $10 billion of any business in our history, it’s all inference, right? One of the things that may not be as evident is that we’re not actually selling raw GPUs for other people to train. In fact, that’s sort of a business we turn away because we have so much demand on inference. . . . We kind of really are not even participating in most of that because we are literally going to the real demand, which is in the enterprise space or our own products like GitHub Copilot or M365 Copilot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So, I feel the quality of our revenue is pretty superior in that context. . . . If this was just . . . a bunch of people training large models and that was all we got, then that would be ultimately still waiting . . . for someone to actually have demand, which is real.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nadella reported that Microsoft’s cloud platforms, including those used to offer AI services (and therefore “inferencing” AI models), are already driving total revenue growth. He said, “We are off to a solid start to our fiscal year, driven by continued strength of Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $38.9 billion in revenue, up 22 percent.” Microsoft’s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Amy E. Hood concurred that Microsoft “saw continued share gains across many of our businesses. In our commercial business, increased demand, and growth in long-term commitments to our Microsoft Cloud platform drove our results. Commercial bookings were ahead of expectations and increased 30 percent and 23 percent in constant currency.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the BG2 podcast episode, Nadella argued that the breadth of Azure’s geographical hubs and capabilities to handle a range of different workloads will be a competitive advantage for Microsoft in the future. He said, “There is going to be fierce competition between the seven, eight, nine, ten of us [hyperscalers] at different layers of the stack,” but that Azure’s structure makes it “slightly different” than other cloud providers. Specifically:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We built out Azure for enterprise workloads with [a] lot of data residency. . . . We have 60- plus more regions than [other providers] . . . [and] we built [Microsoft] cloud for a lot of heterogeneous enterprise workloads, which I think in the long run is where all the inference demand will be.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s view that cloud infrastructure for AI inference is where it will see enormous returns on investment—and that the more geographically and computationally diverse it is, the better—helps to explain the company’s push for global AI infrastructure, including in the UAE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s Inference Bid in G42 and the UAE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private conversations with Microsoft and G42 executives revealed that G42 and Khazna are building three new data centers in the UAE for Microsoft. The centers will be 30, 30, and 100 megawatts each, the equivalent of nearly 100,000 H100 chips (approximately 15,000, 15,000, and 50,000–60,000 respectively). These data centers will run Microsoft Azure for AI inference, helping to consolidate a regional Azure hub in the Gulf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and other leading hyperscale cloud and AI firms stated that—if U.S. AI chip export licenses continue to be rapidly approved—nearly all of them would consider UAE opportunities as attractive as, or more attractive than, those in the United States, especially in terms of realizing the goal of rapidly developing gigawatt-scale data centers. While the United States grapples with how to domestically build out energy and AI infrastructure on a scale comparable to the Manhattan Project, Microsoft finds partnership with G42 and the wider UAE attractive for four key reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;5.1. Availability and Rapid Expansion of (Increasingly Green) Energy Generation Capacity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. AI companies are scrambling to secure long-term sustainable energy sources to fuel unprecedented data center growth, which the U.S. Department of Energy estimates could consume approximately 6.7 to 12 percent of total U.S. electricity by 2028. While bottlenecks in U.S. energy infrastructure currently threaten to place a de facto cap on AI development and deployment in the United States in the near future, the UAE’s capacity to build rapidly and its abundance of energy are incredibly attractive to U.S. AI companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UAE has mobilized impressive capital in recent years to build out energy infrastructure, including for renewable energy, as it strives to meet its ambitious pledge to be carbon-neutral by 2050. In 2023, the UAE government announced a $54 billion investment package to triple its renewable energy supply over the next seven years. Several large-scale renewable energy projects are already underway, such as the monumental Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park in Dubai, which is expected to reach 5 gigawatts of installed solar capacity by 2030. Though solar power has historically been problematic for data centers due to fluctuations in supply (between day and night as well as seasons), developments in energy and battery storage capabilities are changing the game. In February 2024, for instance, UAE developer Moro Hub opened the world’s largest Tier III 100+ megawatt data center powered by solar energy in Dubai. U.S. companies Microsoft and Dell, as well as Chinese company Huawei, have reportedly already signed on to be customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, thanks to a robust engineering and operations base from its oil industry, the UAE has an active labor force with strong technical know-how. As one UAE government official put it, compared to the United States, “we’re part of the world that still remembers how to build.” The official cited the speed at which the UAE built four nuclear reactors for its Barakah Nuclear Energy Plant as a prime example: According to Emirati officials and the World Nuclear Association, the time between breaking ground on the first reactor and connecting the last reactor to the grid took just under 12 years. In contrast, construction of nuclear reactor Units 3 and 4 of the Alvin W. Vogtle nuclear power plant in the United States—the most recent nuclear reactors to enter commercial operation in July 2023 and April 2024, respectively—took 14 years and ran more than $30 billion over budget. The combined net capacity of Vogtle Units 3 and 4 (2,214 megawatts), meanwhile, is only just over half that of the UAE’s four reactors (5,348 megawatts), which it completed in two fewer years. The UAE is already considering building a second nuclear power plant, which government officials told the authors would likely take only seven to 10 years due to efficiencies learned during the construction of the first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UAE investment in energy infrastructure translates to substantial gains in electricity generation capacity over the next decade. According to a 2024 analysis from PwC Middle East, the UAE’s future electricity generation capacity (from a mix of renewable, nuclear, and fossil fuel sources) will significantly outstrip future domestic demand. In 2025, PwC forecasts, the UAE will have 22.5 gigawatts of total generation capacity, while domestically consuming only 18.3 gigawatts. By 2030, capacity is expected to grow to 26.6 gigawatts while consumption remains a modest 21.2 gigawatts. Finally, by 2035, generation capacity is likely to reach 29.6 gigawatts while consumption rests at 23.2 gigawatts of electricity. If the UAE government decides to build a second nuclear power plant with the same specifications as the Barakah plant by 2035, total generation capacity could soar to 34.4 gigawatts. Figure 3 illustrates this trend:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/mC5Fxgl.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;

Authors’ note: PwC Middle East’s data reflects proprietary data from Emirati utility companies. Projected generation capacity figures incorporate major planned infrastructure projects by these companies and the UAE government up to 2035. They do not, however, include a second nuclear reactor, which has been added to this graph by the authors with approval from PwC Middle East. PwC Middle East’s projected domestic consumption figures consider factors such as expected population growth and economic expansion over the next decade (including an unspecified amount of growth in installed data center capacity). Figures have been converted from terawatt hours (PwC version) to gigawatts to be more easily comparable to other figures in this paper and are rounded to the nearest decimal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the UAE’s excess electricity generation capacity will not necessarily be directed solely to powering data centers in the UAE, even a fraction of this figure could be a considerable addition to AI infrastructure in the short term. Just 10 percent of excess capacity in 2030, for instance, would be enough to power over 500 megawatts of data centers (approximately equivalent to 300,000 H100 AI chips)—more than sufficient for the additional 420 megawatts of installed data center capacity that Khazna projects will be built in the UAE by 2029 (specifically 850 megawatts in 2029 compared to 429 megawatts in 2024).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the UAE government could decide to dedicate only a small percentage of its excess electricity generation capacity to powering AI data centers over the next decade. But if AI is indeed the kind of national priority that UAE leadership claims it is (see points one and six), this figure could be a considerable strategic advantage for adding gigawatts of power to AI infrastructure in the next decade. As AI adoption grows, this advantage becomes even more valuable since serving millions of users is substantially more energy-demanding than the occasional training of new AI models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;5.2. Rapid and Cost-Efficient Construction of Data Centers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October 2024, Khazna CEO Hassan Alnaqbi announced a new Tier-III, 100-megawatt AI-optimized data center in the northern emirate of Ajman. The 100,000 square meter facility will include 20 data halls of AI GPUs using 5 megawatts of capacity each and will be built on an accelerated timeline of 15 to 18 months. In private conversations, Khazna and G42 executives confirmed that the center is being built for Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Construction of the 100-megawatt facility is reportedly expected to cost $272 million. According to Alnaqbi, the average cost of construction per megawatt for a group of new Khazna data centers will be between $8 million and $12 million. For comparison, 2024 U.S. market data shows that the average construction cost of U.S. data centers ranges from $10 million to $11 million per megawatt and is projected to increase 5 to 7 percent annually. In terms of total construction costs, one 2023 survey of the global data industry estimates that the average price (excluding hardware) of a 20-megawatt data center typically falls between $100 million and $200 million. Moreover, construction of a 100-megawatt data center can exceed $1 billion. Therefore, if Khazna’s construction estimates are correct, they would be almost four times cheaper than the global average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;5.3. The Opportunity to Lock In High-Demand Customers with Sovereign Cloud Services and Create Network Effects for Their AI Applications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sovereign Cloud Services&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part of the Microsoft-G42 deal is to develop a sovereign cloud for the UAE government and public sector using Microsoft Azure and G42-Khazna construction capabilities. In September 2023, Microsoft announced a partnership with G42 to “unlock new opportunities for digital transformation with joint sovereign cloud and AI offering.” The announcement states:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Microsoft’s sovereign cloud offering will allow UAE public sector and regulated industries to use new platform capabilities for securing sensitive data, providing access to the latest cloud and AI features available on Azure public cloud and helping them comply with local privacy and regulatory requirements. G42’s deep understanding of UAE sovereignty requirements and technical capabilities are central to customizing the offering to help address customer’s specific needs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft reaffirmed this commitment in the more recent $1.5 billion deal with G42 from April 2024. The April press release states that “G42 will run its AI applications and services on Microsoft Azure and partner to deliver advanced AI solutions to global public sector clients and large enterprises,” as well as “to introduce sovereign cloud offerings and collaborate on unlocking the potential of advanced AI capabilities on the Azure public cloud platform.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In private meetings, G42 stressed that the Azure sovereign public cloud platform remains central to the new G42-Microsoft partnership. This platform is codeveloped between Microsoft and Core42 at the AI compute and cloud platform layers of the AI value chain (see Figures 1 and 2). G42 executives explained that G42 and the UAE government want to expand local data center capacity inside the UAE so that they can store and process sensitive data that, under UAE laws, is not permitted to leave the country. Moreover, Core42 software built on top of Microsoft Azure confidential compute encrypts all data, helping to strengthen the UAE’s data sovereignty. Specifically, any data running on the Core42-Azure stack in the UAE can be accessed—but not read—by foreign governments using extraterritorial authorities over cloud providers overseas, such as the United States’ CLOUD Act or China’s Data Security and Personal Information Protection laws. As a result, one G42 representative said that G42 can technically comply with foreign data laws while simultaneously protecting sensitive “sovereign” data by making it illegible. In return, for Microsoft, UAE companies generating data (including G42’s own companies) will become Microsoft customers, offering Microsoft the opportunity to lock in demand for its cloud services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;G42 executives highlighted G42’s healthcare portfolio company, M42, as a case study of this dynamic. M42 is creating databases of Emiratis’ biometric data as part of a government-sponsored genome sequencing project to improve healthcare diagnostics and drug discovery in the UAE. M42 has collected approximately 700,000 DNA samples thus far—an extraordinary amount of data that requires storage and management and that offers the opportunity for extensive AI analysis. Under the UAE’s Health Data Law, however, in the absence of specific government authorization the storage and processing of health data must take place within the country. Additionally, the sensitive nature of the data means that the UAE wants to host the data on secure encrypted cloud servers that prevent the data from being accessed by foreign governments. As a result, the UAE government and the regulated companies are eager to expand sovereign data center capacity inside the UAE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;G42 executives told the authors that M42’s genomics project is already consuming vast amounts of G42’s local data center capacity and indicated that the firm would be a strong and rapidly growing customer for Microsoft’s new cloud facilities. As the UAE strives to expand its healthcare and pharmaceutical sectors, it will require even greater capacity to store and process data on encrypted platforms. More broadly, G42 and the UAE’s many other companies that handle other forms of sensitive data, such as its space technology company Space42, will likely become strong customers for Microsoft Azure public cloud in the future. This all suggests that Microsoft will secure customers for its planned data centers in the UAE with little trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Creating Network Effects with Microsoft AI Products&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to capturing high-demand customers for Azure, Microsoft hopes to become the first and best developer of AI applications that stimulate network effects toward its services. The network effect describes the concept that the more people use a service or product, the more valuable it becomes. It is frequently used in relation to e-commerce or social media platforms, where the quality of the service grows as more users become members. Additionally, the more people use a particular product or service in an individual’s social or professional network, the more likely they are to use it, too, creating a reinforcing cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last 30 years, the network effect has helped to make Microsoft’s Office suite the default operations platform for businesses worldwide. Entrenched norms and efforts to make business software interoperable have ensured that Microsoft products like Word and Excel have become the backbone of the professional world. Through technological diffusion—and not just innovation—Microsoft has become the world’s largest tech companies in terms of market capitalization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft would like to reproduce this kind of effect with its consumer and enterprise AI products in the future. Nadella acknowledged this as a Microsoft strategy on the December 2024 BG2 podcast, where he said that “network effects is always going to be at the software layer, at the app layer,” and that there will be “different network effects in the consumer [sector and] the enterprise [sector]” due to different demands for its products, such as Microsoft Copilot for consumers and GitHub Copilot for software developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft executives told the authors that their ultimate hope is to supply emerging markets with their products before Chinese technology firms can get there first. Should Chinese firms overcome U.S. export controls and produce superior AI products (and be able to offer them at scale), they will still face the challenge of competing with an established incumbent across the developing world. Even if a Chinese application is technically better, network effects could ensure that Microsoft customers remain loyal to their products. For this reason, Microsoft is eager to jumpstart a virtuous cycle of demand for its AI products in the UAE and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;5.4. A Gateway to Emerging Markets in the Global South&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another key element of the April Microsoft-G42 deal is the expansion of Microsoft’s AI services to the developing world. Microsoft’s press statement about the deal is specifically titled: “Microsoft invests $1.5 billion in Abu Dhabi’s G42 to accelerate AI development and global expansion.” In private conversations, Microsoft and G42 executives stated that, like the UAE, many governments in the Global South are looking to develop their own public clouds that will store and process data locally in line with national laws (see point 5.3. above). They see this as a critical opportunity for Microsoft to expand its Azure cloud services and for G42 to finance and build out the data center infrastructure abroad. Microsoft’s press statement suggests as much:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“G42 and Microsoft will collaborate to ensure the benefits of secure AI technologies and cloud capabilities are responsibly shared with growing economies. . . . G42 and Microsoft will also work together to bring advanced AI and digital infrastructure to countries in the Middle East, Central Asia, and Africa, providing these nations with equitable access to services to address important governmental and business concerns while ensuring the highest standards of security and privacy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public announcements by G42 and Microsoft have already confirmed that one of these countries is Kenya (see below). Though other countries have not been confirmed under the deal, agreements from 2021 and 2022 between G42 and the government of Kazakhstan, as well as private and state-owned infrastructure companies in Egypt and Indonesia make these likely contenders for expanding Microsoft Azure with G42.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and G42’s work in Kenya, which includes developing a 1-gigawatt data center and building a Swahili language AI model, is the first step in this global expansion project. This project began in March 2024, when G42, without Microsoft, announced a partnership with Kenyan firm EcoCloud to build a 1-gigawatt data center in Kenya, “powered by the untapped potential of Kenya’s 10 gigawatts in geothermal energy.” According to the press release, the facility would start at 100 megawatts before scaling to 1 gigawatt to “usher in an era of cloud computing and AI services” in Kenya. Kenyan President William Samoei Ruto reportedly supported the deal personally. It was only later, in May 2024, that Microsoft announced it would join this venture with G42. One top G42 executive privately said that Microsoft’s senior leadership had been “inspired” by G42’s plans in Kenya and “saw the opportunity” to expand Microsoft’s business in the Global South. Microsoft executives likewise confirmed that this was a pivotal moment for the company’s top executives, leading them to give G42 $1.5 billion. G42 executives told the authors that the company was not initially looking for capital investment from Microsoft, only a partnership agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the second May 2024 agreement with Kenya, Microsoft and G42 will commit an initial investment of $1 billion in expanding Kenya’s digital ecosystem, in which “one of the Kenyan investment priorities is a state-of-the-art green data center that will be built by G42 and its partners to run Microsoft Azure in a new East Africa Cloud Region.” The public announcement states that Microsoft and G42 will specifically:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Work with the government of Kenya and will design and operate the new East Africa cloud region as part of a ‘trusted data zone’ based on global standards to protect digital safety, privacy and security. With technical assistance and support from G42 and Microsoft, Kenya will establish the new data center . . . under which data from other countries may be governed by their local laws, even while stored and resident in Kenya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Kenya will utilize the new data center and cloud services for governmental and citizen services.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both G42 and Microsoft executives told the authors that they see this project as the first step to expanding services to many other governments with similar sovereign needs as the UAE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft executives expressed significant enthusiasm about what this partnership with G42 could mean for increasing U.S. influence in middle and emerging powers vis-à-vis China. Though they acknowledged the U.S. national security concerns raised by the Microsoft-G42 deal, they argued that in its absence, Chinese technology companies would have snapped up the opportunity to provide AI infrastructure to the UAE. More broadly, the partnership offers an opportunity to rebuff Chinese technology companies’ dominance of critical technology infrastructure in Africa. In recent years, for instance, leading Chinese tech firms like Huawei and ZTE Corporation have developed AI-enabled “smart city” infrastructure and surveillance systems in countries across the African continent, including Kenya. “If the U.S. has the chance to win over Africa [against China], it’s because of what we’re doing here,” one Microsoft executive said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On January 3, 2025, Microsoft President and Vice Chair Brad Smith called the “promotion of American AI exports” a “critical priority” for U.S. policymakers and companies in the next year. “The rapid development of China’s AI sector has heightened competition between American and Chinese AI, with much of this likely to play out during the next four years in international markets around the world,” Smith wrote. Moreover:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“While the U.S. government rightly has focused on protecting sensitive AI components in secure datacenters through export controls, an even more important element of this competition will involve a race between the United States and China to spread their respective technologies to other countries. Given the nature of technology markets and their potential network effects, this race between the U.S. and China for international influence likely will be won by the fastest first mover. Hence, the United States needs a smart international strategy to rapidly support American AI around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple Microsoft, G42, and UAE government representatives stressed that the UAE has the diplomatic clout and available capital to become a “gateway to the Global South” for U.S. companies. With closer ties to developing countries than the United States has and enormous capital reserves, the UAE government and companies like G42 could effectively “derisk” U.S. companies’ entry into new markets, they argue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UAE committed $97 billion in foreign investment to Africa in 2022 and 2023—three times the amount of Chinese investment in the continent over the same period. It also became a BRICS+ member in 2024, joining a club of emerging economies anticipated to represent 45 percent of global GDP in purchasing power terms by 2040. According to the World Trade Organization, BRICS+ members already represent approximately 25 percent of global exports, with the UAE second only to China (and 14th globally) as the largest exporter among BRICS+ countries at 2.1 percent of the global share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;6-g42s-ambitions-extend-far-beyond-its-microsoft-partnership-it-desires-to-build-10-to-100-times-more-data-center-capacity-than-currently-outlined-in-its-agreement-with-microsoft&quot;&gt;6. G42’s ambitions extend far beyond its Microsoft partnership. It desires to build 10 to 100 times more data center capacity than currently outlined in its agreement with Microsoft.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the GITEX Global Expo in October 2024, G42’s Xiao presented the concept of an AI “intelligence grid” similar to today’s electric utility grids. He said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“As intelligence, through the form of artificial intelligence, becomes a utility, it becomes as important, if not more important than electricity. . . . That means we have to build the intelligence grid—the equivalent of [an] electricity grid; the data centers, connectivity, the computing infrastructure for inferencing, to be able to pipe that intelligence-as-utility to everyone who needs it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xiao estimates that the world today has less than 60 gigawatts of data centers but will need between 300 and 500 gigawatts to spread AI across the globe, with each gigawatt of data center and energy infrastructure costing $45 billion. According to studies of AI training and infrastructure costs and the authors’ calculations, AI chips account for nearly half of this total cost at approximately $20–$24 billion per gigawatt. Xiao further said, “That’s a type of infrastructure we’ve got to build for the world to be able to take advantage of AI and to benefit all humanity. And for me, that’s the greatest opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;G42’s deal with Microsoft to build two 30-megawatt and one 100-megawatt data center in the UAE is only the beginning of a much bigger project to spread “intelligence-as-utility” worldwide. In a private meeting, one senior G42 executive said the company wants to build gigawatt-scale data centers because “we think this [ability to rapidly and cheaply build large energy and data center infrastructure] could be our competitive moat.” Specifically, G42 and Khazna’s speed and cost-effectiveness of construction and the UAE’s abundance of energy are great advantages in domains where the United States and the rest of the world are struggling to compete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Khazna reportedly already has 360 megawatts of data center capacity spread over 24 centers in the UAE, with another eight under construction. Khazna’s Alnaqbi has publicly stated that “based on the demand we have . . . we expect the UAE to ramp up and accelerate demand to at least 850 megawatts by 2029” (see point 5.1). However, private discussions with G42 executives indicate that G42’s ambitions to build out AI infrastructure—with or without Microsoft as their partner—far exceed this number:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the end of 2025, G42 plans to bring roughly 100 megawatts of data center capacity into operation, including the two 30-megawatt centers built for Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the end of 2026, G42 plans to bring hundreds of megawatts of capacity into operation, including the AI-optimized 100-megawatt center in Ajman built for Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the end of 2027, G42 plans to reach multiple gigawatts of data center capacity, including from data centers outside the UAE, such as the 1-gigawatt facility in Kenya.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Top G42 executives told the authors that they think they will be able to generate around 5 gigawatts of data centers within the UAE, most of which will be used for AI deployment. They did not provide a timeframe for building out this capacity but implied that Microsoft may not be their only partner if it cannot fill these data centers quickly enough once they are constructed. They did not suggest which other companies G42 might pick as additional or alternative partners to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;7-according-to-g42-and-microsoft-representatives-security-controls-at-the-g42-data-center-align-with-us-commercial-standards-though-the-adequacy-of-such-controls-for-protecting-strategic-ai-capabilities-remains-uncertain&quot;&gt;7. According to G42 and Microsoft representatives, security controls at the G42 data center align with U.S. commercial standards, though the adequacy of such controls for protecting strategic AI capabilities remains uncertain.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While in the UAE, the authors toured a 21-megawatt data center built by G42 and Khazna for Microsoft. Security controls installed in this center to address cybersecurity, insider threat, and break-in risks include NIST SP 800-53 controls, over 100 SP 800-53 security and privacy controls for information systems and organizations, and Department of Commerce export license requirements. The authors of this paper are not in a position to fully verify G42’s claims about its broader security controls, though the implementation of these commercial security standards appeared consistent with typical industry practice and is plausible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key question, however, is whether these measures are wholly sufficient. Standard data center security measures typically address privacy and cybercrime issues rather than full-fledged attacks from nation-states like China. As AI capabilities advance and the stakes increase, U.S. and UAE commercial security standards may need significant enhancement to address evolving threats from state actors. A RAND analysis indicates that securing AI model weights and related intellectual property requires significantly higher security standards than what current AI companies or cloud providers—whether in the United States or the UAE—are currently achieving. While cybersecurity measures are currently a primary focus due to the risks of deploying model weights abroad and potential exploitation by adversaries, compute providers could play a much broader role in ensuring secure AI development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, cybersecurity represents only one dimension of the challenge. Today’s risks extend beyond traditional export control concerns about the physical location and ownership of AI chips. Critical considerations include how compute resources are being used, who can access them remotely, and how resulting AI models and weights might be shared or deployed. Even when AI chips are physically secure within a facility, their computational power can be accessed remotely, and trained models can be distributed widely—potentially to unauthorized users. This requires robust know-your-customer procedures and comprehensive monitoring of compute usage patterns, capabilities that current security frameworks may not adequately address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the United States deems the current controls inadequate for protecting U.S. technology in Emirati data centers or elsewhere, it should clarify what additional controls may be required and where.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;8-the-united-states-faces-two-strategic-questions-regarding-uae-ai-development-first-whether-to-continue-to-support-the-near-term-g42-microsoft-partnership-plan-and-second-how-to-approach-the-uaes-broader-ai-ambitions&quot;&gt;8. The United States faces two strategic questions regarding UAE AI development: first, whether to continue to support the near-term G42-Microsoft partnership plan, and second, how to approach the UAE’s broader AI ambitions.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States can support Microsoft-led projects in the UAE while remaining cautious of endorsing the UAE’s broader AI ambitions. If Microsoft’s claim that cloud infrastructure can create significant lock-in and network effects for its cloud services is true, then supporting the Microsoft-G42 deal could strengthen U.S. technological leadership and make switching to alternative providers (like Huawei) increasingly costly. This “stickiness” of cloud platforms could help cement U.S. dominance in global AI infrastructure while providing a model for future partnerships with other emerging technology powers. The new U.S. Framework for AI Diffusion further reinforces this advantage by allowing U.S. companies like Microsoft to obtain Universal Validated End User status, enabling them to deploy data centers globally with a single license, whereas local companies in the UAE would require an authorization which is country specific and subject to more stringent caps. As Chinese technology firms continue to strengthen their presence in neighboring countries like Saudi Arabia—which is increasing joint ventures with companies like Alibaba and SenseTime, and recently invested $400 million in AI startup Zhipu AI—developing such a model for U.S. foreign engagement on AI is more important than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the United States should also bear in mind that today’s cooperation could evolve into tomorrow’s competition. At the GITEX Global Expo, for instance, UAE Adviser to the President and Secretary-General of the Advanced Technology Research Council Faisal Al Bannai said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I think the opportunity we have, as UAE, and as the stakeholders here in the country [is]: One, you can leverage all the good technologies that are coming out, let’s say from the U.S., right? The different partnerships that are happening with G42, Microsoft, [and] a number of other entities. But at the same time, we are also building our own AI platforms—something that we control, we own, and we can take progress from.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UAE has already made a significant effort to develop indigenous LLMs such as G42’s Arabic-English LLM Jais and the government-backed Technology Innovation Institute’s Falcon 2, which the institute claims outperforms Meta’s Llama 3 model. Private conversations with UAE technology and business professionals revealed that, in reality, these Emirati models perform poorly compared to U.S. models. They said Emirati models are not reliable nor high performing enough for many industry use cases, and that they currently use U.S. options in their work. With increasing access to U.S. compute and talent, however, the United States should think through a scenario in which indigenous Emirati models—controlled exclusively by a nondemocratic government with significant ties to China—become real global competitors. If the next world order is indeed determined by who wields the best AI systems, then the decision to equip other countries with the fundamental ingredients to develop this technology (i.e., chips) should not be taken lightly. Even if the UAE remains faithful to its promise to exclusively partner with the United States in AI, it has said little so far about what a world in which it has outgrown this partnership might look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-proceed-with-caution&quot;&gt;Conclusion: Proceed with Caution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. leadership of the global AI ecosystem is at a critical turning point. Recent developments in China’s AI models have caused several leading AI executives to outright reject the belief that the United States still holds an 18-month lead on China in AI development. At the same time, Chinese technology firms’ investment and infrastructure projects in emerging economies threaten to lock the United States out of economically and geopolitically strategic markets in the Global South. However, China’s ability to produce advanced AI chips at the scale needed to support broad AI deployment could remain significantly constrained by U.S. export controls, limiting their capacity to backfill U.S. technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While renewing U.S. industrial policy and onshoring supply chains is a frequent policy priority in Washington, these policies should not be pursued at the expense of expanding a U.S.-led AI ecosystem abroad. Similarly, rigid restrictions on the deployment of U.S. AI technologies exclusively in the United States and its allies will do little to further U.S. influence in the many “swing states” that are unlikely to pick sides in the U.S.-China competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather, reaffirming the United States’ leadership in AI requires a comprehensive strategy: ensuring emerging powers choose U.S. technology to realize their AI ambitions while establishing robust frameworks for secure and responsible deployment. The traditional approach of simply selling technology without ongoing oversight is insufficient given the unique characteristics of AI systems—their remote accessibility, the sensitivity of model weights, and the potential for unauthorized sharing or deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will always be inherent risks to offshoring AI to countries outside the United States, let alone to nondemocratic ones with strong ties to China. Thus far, the United States’ approval of relatively modest clusters of advanced AI chips to G42 indicates that the potential benefits—both commercial and strategic—outweigh the risks. However, as the U.S.-UAE partnership evolves, U.S. policymakers and AI executives should maintain a healthy realism about the UAE’s vested interests in hedging its bets between the United States and China. They should have no illusions about the nature of the Emirati political regime, nor about some of the uses to which the UAE is likely to apply its AI technologies. They should ask tough questions, such as what the UAE government is doing to ensure decoupling from China in AI by tech companies other than G42, and scrutinize the UAE’s claims about these and other security measures. If they do not think that the current security controls for AI chips are sufficient to protect the United States’ advantage, they should articulate clearly and consistently what those controls should be. For now, however, proceed with caution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行提到，2019年9月黎與私人助手 Mark Simon 正在籌備10月的訪美之行。控方展示郭明瀚創立的 WhatsApp 群組「Martin, Jimmy, Mark」訊息，Mark Simon 在9月23日指，他們會在10月會見不同傳媒的編輯委員會，包括《華爾街日報》和《紐約時報》等，又提到「我們會著重聯絡參議員和眾議院（“we are going to work on the Senators and The House heavily.”）」。Mark 另指，時任美國總統特朗普和時任副總統彭斯是否有空接見，則有待確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎是否打算在訪美行程中處理香港引渡條例議題？黎否認，並指只是去會見美國議員。控方追問黎會見議員的目的，黎則指談論香港狀況，並同意是游說他們支持香港。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭指黎只給了概括的答案，追問他想美國議員支持香港什麼。黎指：「因為當時香港處於危機之中！因為引渡條例草案！」法官李運騰提到，當時修訂草案已被政府擱置，亦能肯定政府將會宣布撤回草案，因此黎所指的「危機」是什麼？黎表示，那時香港還有示威，市民爭取《基本法》下保障的權利，例如普選。李官另提到，當時示威者間是否有「五大訴求」？黎則稱當時還未有「五大訴求」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰表示，聽了十分鐘，仍未能明白黎想美國議員支持香港什麼。黎重申，他希望美國議員能替香港的自由和《基本法》所保障的權利發聲。控方重覆法官問題，指當時修例草案已經被擱置。黎指市民仍然不滿意，仍然擔心引渡條例。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訊息顯示mark-simon正安排黎見特朗普-黎稱從沒預計將會見特朗普&quot;&gt;訊息顯示Mark Simon正安排黎見特朗普 黎稱從沒預計將會見特朗普&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另提到，《香港人權與民主法案》在2019年6月13日被提出，在10月時審議程序仍然進行中，後來在11月獲通過。控方問黎是否打算在訪美行程期間推動法案？黎否認，亦稱不知道 Mark Simon 為何會說「著重聯絡參議員和眾議院」。但黎確認他將會與時任眾議院議長佩洛西（Nancy Pelosi）和共和黨參議員盧比奧（Marco Rubio）見面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰引述 Mark Simon 的訊息，指特朗普和彭斯有待確認，問黎是否計劃會見二人？黎則稱打算會見白宮官員，但認為會見特朗普的成事機會不大（never on the cards）。杜官續問，黎的訪美行程是否計劃會見白宮的高級官員，包括特朗普和彭斯？黎表示，從訊息可見 Mark Simon 正嘗試替他安排，但是他本人從沒預計自己將會見特朗普。法官李素蘭則指，從 Mark Simon 的訊息可見，黎的確有機會見到特朗普。黎遂同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱沒印象曾向美國參議員談論及游說支持香港人權與民主法案&quot;&gt;黎稱沒印象曾向美國參議員談論及游說支持《香港人權與民主法案》&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;早前證供顯示，美國共和黨參議員斯科特（Rick Scott）於9月29日在香港與黎智英會面。控方展示事前的訊息，2019年9月23日，Mark Simon 向黎表示：「60分鐘是很多，而且斯科特是真的挺重要。（“60 minutes is huge and Scott is really quite important.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/gvPy2KM.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至9月28日，即會面前一日，Mark 向黎傳送斯科特的背景，當中提到他對中國態度是「鷹派（China hawk）」，又指「一如以往他會問你，香港這裡需要從美國得到什麼（“As always he will ask what it is we need here in Hong Kong from the US.”）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至9月29日早上，即會面之前數小時，黎問 Mark Simon 剛剛在眾議院通過的香港法案是叫做什麼。Mark Simon 回答是《香港人權與民主法案》，又提供了相關程序簡介，並稱：「10月休會之後，他們期望眾議院和參議院均會全院通過，之後交給特朗普簽署。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎是否打算在會面時談及《香港人權與民主法案》？黎則稱已忘記所有細節。控方接著問黎，有沒有任何原因他未有在會面中談及法案？黎堅稱沒有印象自己曾談論法案，因為就他而言並不太關注法案。惟李素蘭指 Mark Simon 訊息提及「一如以往他會問你，香港這裡需要從美國得到什麼」，所以 Mark 已清楚向黎表明，黎可以告訴對方香港需要美國做什麼，質疑黎卻稱忘記了？黎則堅稱忘記了自己告訴斯科特什麼，又稱不記得自己曾要求美國替香港做任何事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰提到，Mark Simon 提醒黎，法案名稱是《香港人權與民主法案》。控方接著指，Mark Simon 告知黎相關背景和立法進展。黎則稱不記得，強調自己連法案的全名也不知道。惟李素蘭再度質疑黎聲稱忘記，黎稱他不關注。李素蘭遂問黎，記得自己關注什麼嗎？黎僅稱香港當時狀況，以及美國能做什麼幫助。李素蘭遂追問黎想美國怎樣幫助？黎稱他有要求斯科特幫忙，但是忘記具體向他說過什麼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李素蘭隨即質疑：「黎先生，你正在會見一名參議員！」黎重申忘記了要求過什麼。控方質疑，那麼為什麼 Mark Simon 會在訊息中提及法案？黎則反問：「法案已經通過了，為什麼我要談起它？」控方則引述訊息，Mark Simon 告訴他法案將會交兩院表決，所以黎希望美議員支持法案，並游說他們投票通過。黎否認。控方又指，黎實際上曾游說美國議員，爭取他們支持通過法案。黎稱不記得自己曾為法案游說，他不關注法案，甚至連法案名字也不記得。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mark-simon要求取得2500份特刊到美國派發-官人脈甚廣&quot;&gt;Mark Simon要求取得2,500份特刊到美國派發 官：人脈甚廣&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示2019年9月21日 Mark Simon 的訊息，他稱：「我可以拿2,500份今天的運動特刊嗎？它們超乎想像地受歡迎，我收到100個請求。我們會把它們拿到國會山莊，羅傑斯的團隊也想在議會到處派發它們。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指訊息中的「運動特刊」是《蘋果》派發的特刊《2019自由之夏》。惟黎疑惑訊息中的「特刊」是否指另一本出版物，但他不記得。雙方就此討論，黎一度指「特刊」所指為何是小事情。不過李素蘭隨即反駁，這部份可以顯示 Mark Simon 人脈甚廣，因他收到100個請求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/znRJxRO.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方繼續展示9月29日的訊息，Mark Simon 告訴黎，他走遍4個地方也買不到特刊，他在一間「7-11」便利店遇到一名友善的年輕女士，她在網上查看之後說特刊已售罄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎同意被告知人權與民主法案進展-惟不記得是否上心&quot;&gt;黎同意被告知《人權與民主法案》進展 惟不記得是否上心&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年9月17日，Mark Simon 向 WhatsApp 群組「Martin, Jimmy, Mark」傳送訊息，指最佳的訪美日子為10月21至24日，並稱：「有更加大的渴求會見佩洛西及其團隊，還有更多參議員和職員。」他們亦會見位於華盛頓的重要傳媒。Mark 續表示，有人建議他尋找資深的泛民主派參與是次訪美，才會有意義和生產力。Mark 表示他近日出席了參議院有關東亞的公聽會，和有關「香港民主法案」的會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，Mark Simon 在訊息提到「香港民主法案」，黎在當時必然知道《香港人權與民主法案》的進展。惟黎稱當時不關注《法案》。法官杜麗冰指，但是黎被告知有關進展，問黎是否同意。黎同意被告知，但他不記得自己對此是否上心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於 Mark Simon 以什麼身位出席參議院會議，黎稱不知道，也不知道誰人邀請他。黎亦稱從沒詢問 Mark ，因為對此不感興趣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mark-simon-認為資深泛民需要參與訪美&quot;&gt;Mark Simon 認為資深泛民需要參與訪美&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方繼續展示2019年9月17日，Mark Simon 另一則訊息，他認為正在遊走紐約和華盛頓的年輕人團體不會有成效，因他在《華爾街日報》和《紐約時報》的朋友均認為來訪者某程度上沒有共識，因此認為資深泛民人士需要參與訪美，例如李柱銘和黎智英。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在庭上指，訊息中的「資深泛民」包括傳統泛民，例如李柱銘和李卓人，因美國那邊的人投訴年輕人不夠認真，所以他們要求會見資深泛民。他舉例指訊息中的「年輕人」包括張崑陽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱對法案不感興趣-又指很多時法案通過之後沒有人跟進&quot;&gt;黎稱對法案不感興趣 又指很多時法案通過之後沒有人跟進&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年10月8日，Mark Simon 告知黎：「眾議院將會在下星期處理《香港人權與民主法案》和《保護香港法案》」；黎回覆：「Great!」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎在當時是否已經知道法案的內容？黎同意知道，但稱知得不太詳細。控方問黎是否知道法案是關於制裁？黎否認，因不感興趣。控方質疑，若然黎不感興趣的話，為何又會問 Mark Simon 法案名稱？黎稱只是以防萬一斯科特會問起法案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問黎，是否知道法案對香港有好處與否？黎稱：「我當時不關注，我認為它不是對香港而言是好」，又指很多時法案通過之後沒有人跟進。李官追問，那麼黎為什麼想知道法案名稱？黎回答：「至少知道法案的名稱。」李官問，如果斯科特問起法案內容呢？黎則回答：「那我會說我不知道。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指出，黎是知道法案是關於制裁。黎堅稱不知道，也沒有細看法案內容，但可能有人告訴過他法案是關於制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官質疑黎將要見參議員正計劃會見美國總統-不可能不對法案感興趣&quot;&gt;官質疑黎將要見參議員、正計劃會見美國總統 不可能不對法案感興趣&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，Mark Simon 於10月12日繼續向黎傳送法案的最新進展。黎則庭上稱對方可能很想讓自己知道相關進展。法官李運騰問，如果黎不感興趣的話，為什麼不直接跟 Mark Simon 說「我不感興趣，不要煩我」？黎表示：「如果我不感興趣，這是我的個人選擇，我不能夠無禮。」控方指：「但你是他的老闆。」黎表示，他只是不感興趣而已，反問：「為什麼我要責罵他呢？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭問黎：「你說你對法案不感興趣？」黎重申：「我不相信這個法案，我不認為它有效，當它通過之後，沒有人會跟進，它沒有實質效果（it has no substance），只是學術性質（academic）。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李素蘭質疑：「你將要見很多參議員，你正在計劃會見美國總統！」，又問：「你還可以去得多高遠？（“How much higher can you go?”）」黎僅回應：「你認為合乎邏輯的事情，不代表我也認為合乎邏輯。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎不認為美國政府聆聽了我&quot;&gt;黎：不認為美國政府聆聽了我&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方亦展示10月12日的訊息，顯示黎將《香港人權與民主法案》的最新發展，分別傳送給李柱銘和何俊仁。控方指，黎想告知泛民人士法案的最新進展，而且黎對法案感興趣，否則他不會傳送給其他泛民。黎稱自己經常將他們可能感到興趣的東西轉發給他們，不代表他自己感興趣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於黎剛才稱「法案通過後便沒有人跟進」，法官杜麗冰質疑，法案通過之後，中國和香港的官員會被制裁，為什麼黎會說「沒有人跟進」？又問黎：「你是否認為你是錯的？」黎承認：「對，我是錯的。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎被問到是否知道法案內容及是否知道有關制裁。黎重申，已忘記了當時自己有否留意，但他同意後來閱讀新聞後知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰提到，黎在公開對談中稱要凍結中共官員的貪污資產，而當時有數項議案在美國議會獲動議，似乎黎的提議獲得美國政府聆聽，可是黎卻聲稱對《法案》不感興趣？黎則表示：「我不認為美國政府聆聽了我」，又指當時很多眾議員和參議員正在談論相關議案，他並非推動者。李官指：「基本上你得到你所要求的東西。」黎僅回應：「我當時是要求凍結銀行帳戶。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎在公開場合重複要求「制裁他們」，包括凍結官員銀行帳戶，而美國合共制裁了42名中國及香港特區官員，因此《法案》必然會引起黎的興趣。黎重申他忘記了當時自己有否留意。李素蘭澄清問題是《法案》是否能引起黎的興趣？黎表示同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著指，所以在當時，黎已經知道《法案》是關於制裁？黎表示：「我可能。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎文章稱相信美國對中國的制裁能有效施壓-遭質疑與庭上說法不符&quot;&gt;黎文章稱「相信美國對中國的制裁能有效施壓」 遭質疑與庭上說法不符&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示黎個人專欄「成敗樂一笑」，於2019年10月27日發布的文章〈美國人想對我們說的話〉，並指時任《蘋果》副社長陳沛敏構思十條問題訪問黎。黎確認文章是在2019年10月從美國之行期間撰寫。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文中提到：「不要急於因為未看到成果而武力升級，不要忘記站在道德高地上忍耐，相信美國對中國的制裁能有效施壓，對爭取到香港普選也更有希望。這就是他們對我們的忠告。」控方質疑，黎剛才供稱認為《法案》沒有效用，與這部份說法不符。黎則回應，他指沒有效用的是《法案》，因法案往往通過之後便沒有人跟進，但他認為「制裁」是有效。控方問黎當時相信制裁有效？黎確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文中第九道問題：「《香港人權與民主法案》通過後是否真的可以制裁黑警、葉劉、何君堯？」黎回答：「法案已在眾議院通過，還欠參議院。今次我們有與參議院多數黨領袖麥康奈爾見面，我們覺得法案最終在參議院獲通過是相當樂觀的，只要我們能維持現時的表現，就不怕失去支持。葉劉、何君堯以至警察會否被個別制裁，他們沒有提及細節。但是造成不公不義的人、暴力鎮壓我們的人，原則上是一定要負責的，要他們感受到有後果，是必要的。相信他們就算不出現在法案裏，美國也會以黑名單方式針對這幫人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭引述「今次我們有與參議院多數黨領袖麥康奈爾見面，我們覺得法案最終在參議院獲通過是相當樂觀的」，指黎的確曾與議員談論《法案》，然而黎剛才卻說不記得？黎稱現在讀到文章後，同意有談論過，但是堅稱早前已忘記了。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指，黎在文中表示「我們覺得法案最終在參議院獲通過是相當樂觀的」，若果黎對《法案》不感興趣的話，為何又會在這裡談及它？黎僅稱：「因為我要回答問題。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李素蘭指黎剛才卻說《法案》通過後往往沒有人跟進，是「學術性」的？黎稱他是說對於《法案》通過樂觀，但沒有說對於其效用樂觀。李運騰問，若果讀者看到文章，不會知道黎這種想法，問黎認為讀者會知道他的真正想法嗎？黎稱他僅轉述麥康奈爾的說法。杜麗冰則反駁，黎不只是轉述麥康奈爾的說法，而是表達自己的感受。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文中第十道問題「香港人還可以做甚麼爭取美國及國際社會支持？」，黎在文章中回答：「要得到外國人支持，就要不斷游說。加上傳媒報道，讓他們了解我們的道德、勇氣、良知，讓他們在生活上發聲，支持只會越來越大，不會減少的，只要我們做好本份，以道德力量感動他們的良知。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎當時支持《法案》及希望它獲得通過。黎同意。控方續提議，事實上黎當時有進行游說工作推動制裁。黎不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎不認為-mark-simon-與美國政府有聯繫-但同意有時從他得到內部消息&quot;&gt;黎：不認為 Mark Simon 與美國政府有聯繫 但同意有時從他得到內部消息&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示2019年11月8日的訊息，Mark Simon 告知黎，當時有5至9名參議員私下對《香港人權與民主法案》抱保留態度，來自民主和共和兩黨，他們共同關注為中國生意。訊息又指，白宮和國務院亦不想在中美貿易談判之前，做任何事打擊中國。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指黎經常從 Mark Simon 接收到美國政府的內部消息。黎則同意是「有時」，但不是「經常」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰和李素蘭問及 Mark Simon 的背景，黎指在超過25年之前在香港的教會認識 Mark Simon，二人同是教友。Mark 曾經任職台灣船運公司的主席，在逾20年前開始替黎工作，負責看管黎的個人投資，後來成為黎的私人助手。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李素蘭問黎是否知道 Mark Simon 如何認識美國的參議員？黎稱不知道，可能逐漸認識他們並建立人脈關係。李素蘭提到黎早前供稱 Mark 是共和黨黨員。黎同意，並指 Mark 是香港分部的主席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，黎知不知道 Mark Simon 為什麼與美國政府有緊密關係？是否因為他是共和黨員？黎則稱，不認為 Mark 與美國政府有聯繫，他只是經郭明瀚和前白宮資深顧問惠頓，而得知美國政府的消息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指，數項訊息均顯示 Mark Simon 能夠從美國國家安全委員會得到消息。黎指消息乃經時任美國副國家安全顧問博明（Matt Pottinger）得到。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱希望特朗普簽署已通過法案&quot;&gt;黎稱希望特朗普簽署已通過法案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，2019年11月14日（即香港時間11月15日）《香港人權與民主法案》通過。控方展示11月14日訊息，Mark Simon 向黎傳送相關消息：「盧比奧正將《香港人權與民主法案》放上參議院，代表最早今天或下星期表決，難以看到它不獲通過。很棒的消息。（“Rubio is taking the Hong Kong human rights and democracy act to floor of the Senate. Means it gets a vote as early as today or next week. Hard to see it not passing. Excellent news.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎其後將相同的訊息轉發給李柱銘、何俊仁、李卓人、李永達和同案被告陳梓華。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年11月24日，郭明瀚向 WhatsApp 群組「Martin, Jimmy, Mark」傳送訊息，指特朗普有可能不簽署《法案》。黎在群組回應：「希望特朗普簽署，如果他不簽署的話，對他而言是很差。（“Well, hope Trump signs. It’s bad for him if he doesn’t.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mark-simon-到訪美國國安委及獲內部消息-黎否認他是美國政府一份子&quot;&gt;Mark Simon 到訪美國國安委及獲內部消息 黎否認他是美國政府一份子&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年11月28日，Mark Simon 向黎表示：「昨天我到（美國）國家安全委員會，他們正在就簽署法案做準備工作。特朗普上星期決定簽署它，但他希望嘗試不讓習近平在貿易談判上有任何籌碼。（“I was at the national security council yesterday, they were laying the groundwork for signing the bill. Trump decided last week to sign it, but he wanted to try and not give Xi any leverage on trade talks.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎是否同意 Mark Simon 與美國國家安全委員會非常緊密？黎表示：「我不會這樣假設。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到 Mark Simon 為何會到訪美國國家安全委員會，黎稱不知道，也沒有問他。法官杜麗冰質疑，Mark Simon 是黎的「左右手」，為何不問他？黎則指，不會所有關於他的事情都要問。法官李素蘭一度提高聲線問：「如果我的秘書告訴我他出席了行政會議，難道我不會問他原因嗎？」黎回應：「但他不是我的秘書。」法官追問，美國國家安全委員會不開放予公眾，Mark Simon 必定有特別之處，能夠到訪該處。黎指 Mark 聘請了惠頓作為顧問，亦認識博明，可能博明邀請他到國安委。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李素蘭問，Mark Simon 是美國政府的一份子嗎？黎指不是。李素蘭接著問，他是否美國國安委或任何政府部門的一份子？黎亦指不是。另外，黎稱沒有到訪過美國國安委。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 4 January 2025, the South China Morning Post (SCMP) newspaper published an article detailing how a Chinese-run “wargame” had modelled the sinking of a People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) destroyer by US missile attack. The missiles in question were the Lockheed Martin-made, US Navy/Air Force-employed AGM-158C Long Range Anti-Ship Missiles (LRASM). Given that these missiles are specifically designed to sink ships from range, the fact that they did so in a simulation is hardly remarkable. That such a simulation should be run and documented in a peer-reviewed academic publication is possibly a little more surprising, given Chinese military sensitivity. What is noteworthy is that the institute which ran the simulation is one that provides modelling and simulation tools for the PLA and is one of the institutes run by the China Electronics Technology Corporation (CETC), a powerful state-owned enterprise which has been involved with projects including China’s nuclear and satellite programmes. The decision of academics from the 15th Institute who presumably hold security clearances to provide interviews to a pro-Chinese government publication, a promoter of Chinese “soft power” (the SCMP) would presumably have occurred with state encouragement or at a minimum approval. This raises the question of why seemingly negative results were published in an English-language newspaper which is accessible to foreign audiences. Moreover, what can be understood regarding the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) assessment of its own capabilities based on the outcome of the exercise? This article seeks to provide some plausible rationales for the PLA to publicise the seemingly disappointing results of this simulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-technical-dimensions-of-the-exercise-a-humble-brag&quot;&gt;The Technical Dimensions of the Exercise: A Humble Brag?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on what was reported regarding the exercise, the wargame simulated a large clash between the US and China. The article details a simulation set in the northeastern part of the South China Sea where the US attacks a Chinese battlegroup from the “nine-dash line”, Beijing’s declared limit of sovereignty in the South China Sea. The attack consists of 10 LRASM launched from different platforms, all targeting a PLAN destroyer. The simulation sees the PLA disable both radar guidance and GPS navigation by means of electronic warfare (EW). However, the “thermal imaging” capability of the LRASM (its IR seeker) allows for a terminal navigation phase for accurate and successful targeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the result of the simulation would appear negative for the PLAN, several details are noteworthy. First, the claim that the PLAN’s Type-055 cruiser was able to disable the radar on the LRASM is of interest. The reason for this is that the LRASM does not use an active radar like many anti-ship missiles, but rather relies on a passive radar for wide area surveillance using emissions from enemy ships. The advantage of passive radar is that they are a relatively difficult target for directional jamming because the location of the receiver is difficult to ascertain, unlike active radar which must emit and can thus be detected. Implicit in the Chinese claim that the LRASM’s passive radar was disabled, then, is the suggestion that the PLAN vessel was deemed to have located the missile with sufficient accuracy to enable directional jamming, which would involve transmitting false signals into the passive radar’s aperture. The jamming of the missile’s onboard radar would thus suggest two things. First, the vessel was deemed to have a very accurate sense of the missile’s location despite the LRASM’s stealthy profile. Second, Chinese efforts to develop modes of jamming passive radar, into which the state has invested funding through its talent programmes, are deemed to have borne fruit. The methods of doing so might include emitting signals which produce an interference peak on a radar’s doppler map and thus create false tracks. The PLA’s claimed success here would, if true, have ramifications both for the survivability of missiles with a low radar cross-section (which the PLA is implicitly claiming the ability to track) and for US naval efforts at emissions control and the use of passive detection in the first island chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second aspect of note is that the article claims that the LRASM’s GPS guidance was disabled 10 km from the Type-055. While the jamming of GPS-guided capabilities is not new and has been achieved by the Russians in Ukraine against JDAM, blocking signals from all of the GNSS satellites from which a missile or munition can receive signals requires jamming over a wide area, possibly requiring multiple overlapping EW systems in the case of the Russians in Ukraine. Additionally, since US munitions are programmed to not receive messages that are not in encrypted M-Code, successful jamming would imply the ability either to spoof signals in M-Code or to generate enough power that all signals are blocked. All of this would point to a robust Electronic Counter Measures suite on the Type-055 and any vessels supporting it in the simulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the paper talks only of the EW defences, and does not appear to consider the host of other “hard kill”, medium- and short-range options open to the PLA and PLAN. Additionally, the article references the fact that the radar coverage AWACS and fighter aircraft were not considered. As can be seen from the indignant response to the article on some Chinese message boards, many commentators have noted this omission. This could include the 1130 or 730 Close-in Weapon Systems (similar to NATO’s Goalkeeper or Phalanx) and “Hong Qi” (red flag) family of vertical launch systems, short- and medium-range models such as the HHQ 9 and HHQ 16. Given that the LRASM is a stealth missile, the degree to which these Chinese systems would be effective remains unexamined in the article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as mentioned, the claim that the Chinese battlegroup had a good enough understanding of the missile’s location to enable jamming of passive radar is telling. A degree of knowledge sufficient to enable directional jamming of a passive receiver would also be sufficient to enable hard kill. An implicit message might, then, be that the Type-055 could have engaged the LRASM with its onboard missiles in their terminal phase, and perhaps at even greater distances with AWACS and fighter support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-pla-active-measure-to-undermine-lrasm&quot;&gt;A PLA Active Measure to Undermine LRASM?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relatedly, the claimed fidelity of the simulation is noteworthy. What is specifically alluded to is the flight profile of the missile and the assertion of a degree of “complex details” captured in the simulation by the academic paper’s author. This may be further indication to its adversaries that the PLA knows more than perhaps the US would like them to about the missile specifications. As defence industry experts know, details of the flight profiles, link communications, navigation systems, ranges and missile speeds are generally classified, and this is certainly true for the LRASM as a state-of-the-art “stealth” missile. That there are vertical launch variants for ships and that the LRASM has been adapted for multiple aircraft types is in the public domain, but specific details are not easy to come by. Officially released data or other promotional detail is deliberately vague, and official publications state that specifics have not been released for security reasons. It is, however, true that much can be gleaned from open source investigations, and it is not unheard of for classified details to appear on public forums; especially if the unwary are being specifically probed for such information. A classic example of such a disclosure was the well-publicised case of Challenger II tank specifications being released on a “War Thunder” gaming forum in order to try to win an argument. It is possible that the simulation was modelled around best guesses and supposition, or that technical specifications were (as claimed) garnered from prolonged and diligent open-source research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as discussed, it is of note that the simulation was run by the North China Institute of Computing Technology (NCICT), the 15th Research Institute of CETC. As a Chinese state-owned conglomerate, it has been implicated on multiple occasions in cases of “export violations” with certain US-based technology companies. The role of the 15th Institute and its parent organisation in the Chinese defence ecosystem would suggest that its researchers have access to classified data. Through its claims to be able to accurately model the LRASM’s flight profile and radar cross-section, the PLA would appear to be tacitly claiming to have either penetrated classified US systems or deduced highly classified data using available information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does, however, raise questions regarding the veracity of the claims. If the PLA was truly confident in its success in accessing sensitive data, it would have strong incentives to keep this private to achieve surprise in a conflict rather than alerting the US to the compromise of critical systems. Perhaps the PLA deems the programmatic disruption to LRASM resulting from any inquest within the US that this revelation causes to be a worthwhile result, especially if the programme is too late in its development for vulnerabilities to be easily fixed. However, if disruption is the aim, it should be noted that a similar effect could be achieved through false claims as well. As a historical analogy, we might consider how the USSR attempted to strengthen the hands of critics of the Strategic Defence Initiative by leaking (often spurious) technical data that reinforced the idea that any missile shield could be easily penetrated. One interpretation, then, is that the PLA is trying to undermine a programme which causes it genuine concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-pla-focus-on-realistic-blue-forces&quot;&gt;The PLA Focus on Realistic Blue Forces&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, the simulation likely tells us something about the modelling and simulation work conducted in support of the PLA, both in terms of the intelligence which supports it and the levels of realism being sought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nature of the simulation and in particular the absence of AWACS support and hard kill measures is of interest. This is, perhaps, explicable given the institute which conducted the modelling. The Beijing-based NCICT specialises in military model development and the development of major projects in aerospace measurement and control systems. The parent corporation of CETC also advertises itself as working in radar and EW-related technology. It is therefore unsurprising that the wargame appears to have limited itself to testing EW defensive measures. Industry wargaming, unlike defence ministry or military wargaming, works with different constraints and may have different or more focused aims. These can range from product design, development and testing to demonstrations and sales. It is perhaps in this light that the article should be viewed – as a declaration of capability in EW and a statement of competence to the West (and especially the US), but perhaps also an internal pitch that the NCICT has done its bit, and that it is for others to within the PLA and industry to move in by, for example, providing countermeasures against IR seekers (on which the LRASMs relied after their radar malfunctioned).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, the PLA is increasingly not a stranger to wargaming, and invests heavily in this and “opposing force training”, with “blue” (or enemy) forces occasionally even going so far as to wear the uniforms of the forces they are representing. The emphasis on using models with high levels of fidelity and dedicated experts on adversary forces is considered by the PLA to be critical to meeting Xi Jinping’s demand for realistic training and ensuring the combat effectiveness of a force that has not seen combat since 1979. The danger of what the PLA calls the “peace disease” is one that China’s leaders are acutely aware of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Chinese leaders and planners seem aware that the PLA’s lack of combat experience is both a limitation and something which likely opponents may perceive as a weakness, advertising the fact that Chinese wargames are not just scripted exercises in which the PLA always wins might, then, be seen as a way of making the PLA more credible in the eyes of its opponents. The message may be that unlike, for example, the Russian military before Ukraine – which was plagued by the habit of subordinates painting excessively rosy pictures to their superiors – the PLA is a force which confronts its own deficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the accompanying risk that the negative outcome leads an opponent to downrate its assessment of Chinese equipment is mitigated. Any potential adversary – in this case the US – will know that the limitations of the simulation as discussed in the SCMP article will be well understood by the PLA, and the findings of a military run wargame are unlikely to be so well publicised. In addition to the hard kill options and AWACS support mentioned above, the wider principles of anti-access/area denial would be at play, making any scenario as proposed in the simulation far more complex, multi-layered and multi-dimensional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the Chinese article was an interestingly stark acknowledgment that the US is the enemy, rather than using a nameless adversary with capabilities similar to the US that often features in exercise and wargames. Although framed as a “humble brag” with the loss of a PLAN destroyer, the article clearly advertised a certain Chinese confidence in the inevitable arms race in which China and the US, as technological world leaders, are engaged. The (possible) NCICT sales pitch hints at a certain level of knowledge and understanding, and leaves much unsaid for the US to consider as it continues in the development of increasingly complex, stealthy and long-range anti-ship missiles. It is therefore an article of interest to many “defence watchers”, but manages to deliver some very specific messages.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;黎智英：若修例目的確實引渡逃犯 便不會有百萬人上街 官質疑可能因市民誤解&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Klq1KxN.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，今（22日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第123日審訊，黎智英第31日作供，控方繼續盤問黎。2019年7月，黎與時任美國國務卿蓬佩奧見面後，翌日出席史丹福大學胡佛學院的公開講座對談，期間主持人稱香港政府提出修訂《逃犯條例》，意不在將謀殺犯引渡回香港，而是將北京眼中的異見者送回中國內地，黎聽罷稱：「對。」控方指出，黎聽到主持人的錯誤說法時，卻未有即場糾正，顯示他正在嘗試誤導觀眾。黎則否認誤導觀眾。黎認為政府聲稱為了引渡謀殺犯是一個藉口，並指如果這是修例的真正目的，便不會有超過百萬人上街遊行。控方和法官均指市民可能是在誤解之下上街。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，7.21元朗站白衣人襲擊事件之後，黎向 Mark Simon 表示希望邀請美國議員訪港，調查暴力，以制止建制派使用法外暴力打壓運動。當時得悉美議員正在到訪亞洲，因此嘗試經前美國駐港澳總領事郭明瀚接觸美議員，使他們更改行程提早來港。惟美議員最終在9至10月來港，黎智英確認在港會見了3名共和黨參議員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指黎向蓬佩奧談及制裁-黎稱不記得&quot;&gt;控方指黎向蓬佩奧談及制裁 黎稱不記得&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;昨日控方證據提到，黎於2019年7月9日赴美國與時任美國國務卿蓬佩奧見面。會面前一日，蓬佩奧助手 Mary Kissel 提供建議，提及制裁中共人員和香港官員子女的概念，亦提到將香港和台灣形容為冷戰時期的柏林會有好處。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行今提到，黎的確有在會見蓬佩奧期間提到制裁。黎一度反問：「我有說過制裁嗎？」控方指黎有，並且獲得報導，遂展示2019年7月25日的《蘋果》報導。當中指，黎在何俊仁主持的網上節目「細說中南海」中談及與蓬佩奧會面，蓬佩奧問黎：「美國可以怎樣做？」黎則回答美國可以實施制裁，讓中國官員知道其所作所為會有後果。惟黎庭上稱不記得自己如此向蓬佩奧說過，只記得自己在其他場合說過類似言論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官質疑黎未有明言核武是比喻-黎反駁當你使用比喻時不會明言那是比喻&quot;&gt;官質疑黎未有明言「核武」是比喻 黎反駁：當你使用比喻時不會明言那是比喻&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，2019年7月10日，即黎與蓬佩奧見面之後翌日，黎出席「保衛民主基金會」（Foundation for Defense of Democracies，簡稱 FDD）的公開講座對談，並向黎展示對談錄音謄本。黎形容中國與美國之間進入「新冷戰」，是關乎價值的鬥爭，而香港正在「前線」，又稱美國政府有「道德權威」（moral authority），其對香港的支持是「核武」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭質疑：「當你談到核武的時候，別人怎樣知道那是一個比喻？」黎則重申他正在談論美國的道德權威。李素蘭反駁指：「你所想的與別人聽到的是不一樣」，問黎是否同意。黎僅稱：「OK，我同意。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另引述黎在講座中稱「中國是敵人。」黎則否認，強調他是指價值方面，不代表他說中國是敵人。控方問黎，那麼中共是否敵人？黎則同意，但他否認憎恨中共，因為他沒有仇恨。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰指，別人聽到黎的言論，可能會覺得黎正在與美國人共同作戰、反抗中國，黎又提到「核武」，「然而到結尾你未有明言那是一個比喻。」黎則反駁：「當你使用比喻時，你不會明言那是比喻。」他重申，他只是說香港人為美國一致的價值而戰鬥。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱修例是藉口非為找出謀殺犯-控方質疑有意誤導&quot;&gt;黎稱修例是藉口非為找出謀殺犯 控方質疑有意誤導&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，主持人在講座中提到，香港政府提出修訂《逃犯條例》，意不在將謀殺犯引渡回香港，而是將北京眼中的異見者送回中國內地，黎聽罷稱：「對。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，當時台灣發生一宗謀殺案，之後疑犯逃到香港，修例目的是為了將身處香港的疑犯引渡回台灣。黎在庭上稱，雖然將謀殺犯引渡回台灣是修例目的，但客觀效果（ramification）是可以將異見者送回中國內地。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指出，黎聽到主持人說修例不是意在引渡謀殺犯回港，然而黎並未有即場糾正其誤解，顯示他正在嘗試誤導觀眾。黎則否認誤導觀眾。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指，黎認為政府聲稱修例是為了引渡謀殺犯是一個藉口？黎同意，並指如果修例確是為了引渡謀殺犯的話，便不會有超過百萬人上街遊行。控方指，那可能是因為誤解。法官杜麗冰接著指，那百萬名市民可能是在誤解之下上街，正如黎般。李官亦指，那百萬名市民可能是因為黎的言論而產生誤解。黎僅回應：「我並不是那麼強大和具影響力。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/h3JUH6I.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;蓬佩奧助手曾提議將香港視為冷戰時期柏林-控方指黎一直銘記於心&quot;&gt;蓬佩奧助手曾提議將香港視為冷戰時期柏林 控方指黎一直銘記於心&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎亦在講座中提到，當前美國總統甘迺廸到達柏林的時候，他說：「我是一個柏林人。」這給了當時的柏林人很大信心和希望，去面對蘇聯的威脅。法官李運騰問到，當黎提及柏林的時候，是否在借用 Mary Kissel 的主意。黎同意。法官李素蘭問，當黎與 Paul 討論時，是否再得到更多啟發。黎亦同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎在2020年的網上節目「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」，有好幾集均提及柏林面對蘇聯威脅，是因為黎將 Mary Kissel 的建議銘記在心。黎不同意，他稱在節目中將台灣比喻為柏林，是想說如果台灣失守的話，便會打擊西方的信譽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎撰寫文章初稿-提議美國拒絕向有份打壓香港的中港官員子女批出學生簽證&quot;&gt;黎撰寫文章初稿 提議美國拒絕向有份打壓香港的中港官員子女批出學生簽證&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎於2019年8月8日向 Mark Simon 傳送一篇時評文章的草稿，並吩咐對方檢查和修改，以讓黎之後傳送給其教父兼《華爾街日報》編輯 Bill McGurn 。黎在庭上解釋，記憶中 Bill McGurn 提議他就胡佛對談的內容撰寫成文章，因此他撰寫了上述文章，打算傳送給 Bill McGurn 是因為 Bill 的英文比他更好，冀對方能修正他的英文。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎的文章草稿籲美國人向當地的議員寫信，讓香港狀況維持在美國的政治議程之內，以及利用制裁來阻止中國侵害香港的自由，舉例指拒絕向有份打壓香港的中港官員子女批出學生簽證。文章最後一句說：「我們已經去除奴隸制度，為何不去除暴政！」（“We have eliminated slavery, why not tyranny!”）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰一度關注文章有否在香港境內發布，並提到在訊息當日國安法尚未實施，可能衍生到法律爭議。控方則指訊息可以反映黎的心思意念，以及他在《國安法》前後繼續其行為的意圖。黎在庭上確認文章沒有在香港發表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎，「我們已經去除奴隸制度，為何不去除暴政！」中的「暴政」是否指中國。黎僅指是「暴政」而不代表是中國。法官杜麗冰問「我們」是指誰人？黎指全世界的人。控方問：「包括你？」黎回答：「包括全世界的人。」控方則說：「不包括我。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎先後提出拒批和撤銷中港官員子女的學生簽證-控方提議一個比一個進取&quot;&gt;黎先後提出拒批和撤銷中港官員子女的學生簽證 控方：提議一個比一個進取&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著展示2020年5月29日發布的文章「Do My Tweets Really Threaten China’s National Security?（我的推文真的威脅到中國的國家安全嗎？）」，當中提到：「There are other ways to retaliate against China for its repression of Hong Kong: Revoking student visas for the children of both Chinese Communist Party and Hong Kong officials, and increasing scrutiny of party corruption abroad, for example.（有很多報復中國打壓香港的方法：撤銷中共和香港官員子女的學生簽證，以及提高審視黨員在海外貪污情況，舉例來說。）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎庭上同意「撤銷中共和香港官員子女的學生簽證」屬一種制裁。黎亦解釋「充份審視黨員在海外貪污情況」的意思，因為很多貪污的錢都存放在美國的銀行帳戶之中。法官李運騰問，若然中國政府要求美國將貪污的錢歸還給中國的話，黎會否贊成？黎稱會贊成。李官接著問，黎贊成的話，那麼似乎是在提出中美之間司法互助，而不是提議制裁。黎則回應，他表示贊成是因為李官作出了假設。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎實際上有提及凍結中共官員的銀行帳戶。黎同意。控方續指，黎在2019年8月提議美國拒絕向中港官員子女批出學生簽證，直至2020年5月，黎已提出撤銷中共和香港官員子女的學生簽證，可見黎的提議一個比一個進取。黎則表示在簽證方面同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎要求張志偉報導博爾頓會面-否認屬編採指示&quot;&gt;黎要求張志偉報導博爾頓會面 否認屬編採指示&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年7月11日，黎向時任《蘋果》動新聞平台總監張志偉（Nick Cheung）傳送訊息，要求他報導黎與時任美國國家安全顧問博爾頓（John Bolton）會面。張志偉其後將新聞〈【逆權運動】晤美國國家安全顧問博爾頓 黎智英促請支持鼓勵香港年輕人〉傳送給黎，並表示已將新聞置頂和推送。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Mek8WV7.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ John Bolton（左）、Donald Trump（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎庭上稱，他向博爾頓談及香港的反抗運動，呼籲美國以行動來支持香港。控方問黎口中的「行動」是否包括懲罰香港官員。黎稱他沒有這樣說過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指從報導截圖可見，黎在2019年7月的訪美之行除了會見蓬佩奧和博爾頓之外，還有會見不同議員，包括共和黨參議員克魯茲（Ted Cruz）、加德納（Cory Gardner）和斯科特（Rick Scott），目的是為了游說他們作出行動，包括制裁中港官員。黎堅稱他僅游說美國議員支持香港，作出鼓勵也是「行動」的一種，否認相關行動包括制裁，「這是你的用字，我沒有說過制裁。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰質疑，黎向張志偉要求報導，屬於下達編採指示。黎否認，強調他要求發表報導並不代表是指示，若果有一則具新聞價值的消息，他提供給對方，並不屬於「指示」；然而要求對方怎樣做，或者怎樣使用該新聞，才是屬於「指示」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在法官的追問之下，黎稱：「如果你認為這是一個指示的話，我無法跟你爭辯」，但他強調任何人也可以向記者提供新聞。杜官反駁指黎是一名老闆、是一名高層。黎堅稱他只是叫張志偉處理新聞，不同意這是編採指示。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱2019年7月渴望邀請美國議員來港調查暴力&quot;&gt;黎稱2019年7月渴望邀請美國議員來港調查暴力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2019年7月21日，黎與 Mark Simon 之間的訊息，當中黎提到：「Let’s treat the trip of the senators and congressmen as a trip of fact-finding of violence of HK resistance movement.（讓我們視眾議員和國會議員的行程為一個調查香港反抗運動中的暴力的行程。）」黎亦提及邀請時任眾議院議長佩洛西（Nancy Pelosi）和共和黨議員盧比奧（Rubio）來港調查事實，黎並叫 Mark Simon 一起商討「有什麼游說工作可以做（“And what lobbying exercise we should do to accomplish it?”）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，當時黎渴望邀請美國議員來港，調查反修例中的暴力。黎同意，惟他指佩洛西和盧比奧最終沒有來。控方指共和黨參議員克魯茲（Ted Cruz）和斯科特（Rick Scott）在2019年10或11月有來港。黎同意，但強調他們是主動來港，與上述提及的調查暴力行程不同。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;721後黎擔心重演六四-冀邀請美議員來港介入以制止暴力&quot;&gt;7.21後黎擔心重演六四 冀邀請美議員來港介入以制止暴力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示2019年7月23日的訊息，黎向 Mark Simon 說：「7.21元朗的黑社會暴力，必定是建制派陣營默許的，以製造恐懼制止反抗運動。這種想法預示了天安門屠殺會重演。我們要叫美國議員去調查暴力，不能再拖下去，以發出警告，去打破建制派打算使用法外暴力打壓運動。」黎又說：「讓我們使美國介入這種暴力，以制止它」，並吩咐 Mark Simon 與前白宮資深顧問惠頓商討，以組織一個訪港團。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同日，Mark Simon 告訴黎，7.21襲擊事件在美國國會山莊（Capitol Hill）上被討論，特朗普亦被傳媒問及7.21事件。Mark 續指，經他與惠頓數次商討後，得悉參議員克魯茲會連同美國參議員代表團，計劃在2019年10月到訪亞洲。Mark 稱前美國駐港澳總領事郭明瀚（James Cunningham）會協助經國務院接觸議員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/uSUIdki.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎回覆稱很好，形容美國議員愈快到訪香港的話，與便愈能扣連到事件，香港人便愈感受到支持，而建制派便會承受愈多恥辱。Mark Simon 提到有的代表正在前往台灣，「而我們正在嘗試騎劫（hijack）。」黎回覆：「他們可以到香港，之後到台灣，這樣能夠顯示港台兩地團結一致對抗中國。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在庭上解釋，當時美國參議員準備前往亞洲或台灣，他們嘗試令該些議員更改行程，先前往香港。黎並同意當時希望美議員愈早訪港愈好。控方問，為何郭明瀚需要經國務院接觸議員？黎則稱不理解。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭問黎是否請求美國議員來訪香港？黎則指，他們本來已打算到訪亞洲，而香港是其中一站，他只是希望美議員能比原定計劃更早來到香港。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;特朗普稱香港示威為暴動-黎同意部份示威是暴動-但大部份和平&quot;&gt;特朗普稱香港示威為「暴動」 黎：同意部份示威是暴動 但大部份和平&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示2019年8月2日的訊息，黎向 Mark Simon 傳送一則新聞，提到時任美國總統特朗普將香港示威稱為「暴動」，採用了中國的措辭。黎表示：「這出自特朗普口中，實在令人很失望。」Mark Simon 回覆指這是不好的，他已接觸博明（Matt Pottinger）及其他人，認為特朗普只是態度過於隨意。黎回覆：「好的，我們需要找出他的下屬發生了什麼事。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎為什麼感到失望？黎表示忘記了當時前文後理。法官杜麗冰問黎是否同意特朗普稱呼香港示威為「暴動」？黎起初表示不同意，但是在連番追問下，黎表示「這某程度上可以被稱之為暴動」，因它不完全是暴動，有的人只將目光集中在部份年輕人，但是整體而言大部份示威都是和平的。控方追問黎是否同意特朗普的說法？黎回答：「對，有一部份是暴動。」控方追問，那為何黎會在訊息中表示「失望」？黎重申他不記得。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問及訊息中的博明（Matt Pottinger）。黎指博明是美國副國家安全顧問，又指他與 Mark Simon 互相認識，但是黎則不太認識他，因他不在香港，一直在美國工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;美國眾議員去信蓬佩奧要求停售武器予香港警方&quot;&gt;美國眾議員去信蓬佩奧要求停售武器予香港警方&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年8月3日，Mark Simon 向黎傳送訊息，告知他美國眾議員 Chris Smith 和 James P. McGovern 已去信蓬佩奧等官員，促請美國停止向香港警隊出售武器和人群控制工具，亦要求蓬佩奧以最強烈的言辭，去反對特區政府將香港示威定性為「暴動」。Mark 又提到，特朗普因為「暴動」說法而被批評。（Trump is catching hell for “riots”…）黎回覆：「希望他找到方法去反駁它。（Hope he finds a way to repudiate it.）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰問黎，剛才黎說同意特朗普的「暴動」說法，為何又在訊息說希望他能反駁。黎稱他同意部份示威是暴動，因為有部份示威者是勇武年輕人。控方質疑黎未有明言希望特朗普反駁哪一部份。黎僅回答，他在訊息中只是說特朗普會找到方法反駁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎不同意-mark-simon-與美國政府關係密切&quot;&gt;黎不同意 Mark Simon 與美國政府關係密切&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年8月3日，黎向 Mark Simon 說：「在晚飯期間，只需要向他們報告議員的調查事實之行（fact-finding trip）及郭明瀚的角色，不要談及我或我的行程。」被問到為何不要談及他、「行程」是指什麼行程，黎表示不記得，也不知道 Mark 跟誰人晚膳。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於郭明瀚的角色，黎指他有份協助推動調查事實之行。但黎同時提到郭明瀚是一名民主黨員，而當時想邀請的議員都是共和黨黨員，他不知道郭明瀚是否認識他們。法官李素蘭問到，雖然郭明瀚是民主黨黨員，但他亦獲特朗普政府提供工作機會，所以顯示他與共和黨的關係足以密切到獲得工作職位？黎則回應，郭明瀚是一個高級的外交人員，特朗普政府可以利用他這個特質。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又問，黎是否同意 Mark Simon 與美國政府有密切關係？黎不同意。控方質疑，從 Mark 的訊息可見，他向黎提供了很多內部消息。黎則指該些消息是從新聞報導得知，並非內部消息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭問，Mark Simon 如何認識蓬佩奧助手 Mary Kissel 等人。黎指因為他與《華爾街日報》非常密切，而 Mary 等人是《華爾街日報》的時評寫手，所以認識他們，其後 Mark Simon 經黎認識了他們。控方又問黎是否與美國國務院關係密切？黎否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2019年9至10月美議員訪港-黎會見3名議員&quot;&gt;2019年9至10月美議員訪港 黎會見3名議員&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2019年9月10日的訊息，Mark Simon 向黎報告指，他們被要求將行程推至10月，以更接近「香港法案」有所實際行動的時候。黎同意當時他們正計劃在10月訪美，惟他不知道訊息中的「香港法案」是指什麼法案。黎確認當時一方面計劃邀請美國議員來港；另一方面正計劃在10月訪美。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，Mark Simon 於2019年9月18日告知黎，一眾參議員將會訪港，而共和黨參議員克魯茲（Ted Cruz）亦會於10月上旬訪港。控方續指，黎於9月29日與共和黨參議員斯科特（Rick Scott）在香港見面；其後於10月12日與克魯茲見面；至10月14日，黎與共和黨參議員霍利（Joshua Hawley）見面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到在會面時談論了什麼，黎表示事隔已久不記得。控方問是否談論香港狀況，或是游說美國實施制裁？黎表示不會揣測，重申已不記得會面內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

Counter-ransomware strategies would benefit from further interrogation from this community.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hostile cyberattacks on hospitals, energy infrastructure, and strategic ports. Retaliatory offensive cyber operations carried out by Five Eyes members. Ransomware bears many of the hallmarks of the kind of cyber conflict long imagined by academics, military planners, and policymakers, albeit one waged primarily by law enforcement agencies and financially motivated criminals rather than cyber commands. Indeed, the FBI recently announced that its agents have conducted over 30 disruption operations against ransomware criminals in 2024 alone, emphasising the importance of ransomware as a strategic challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this, scholars of cyber conflict largely overlook ransomware. This leaves policy debates about ransomware poorer. Given the increasing use of offensive cyber operations and other tools of statecraft in counter ransomware strategies, more scholars should seek to interrogate the assumptions and concepts that underpin their implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ransomware-in-cyber-conflict-studies&quot;&gt;Ransomware in cyber conflict studies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, strategic studies has focused on cyber competition and conflict in interstate relations. Academics are split between framing cyber operations as an intelligence contest or using the US-driven lens of persistent engagement. This literature has successfully tempered inflated expectations about one-off, strategically decisive cyberattacks, and helped re-orient policymaking and the study of cyber conflict towards an approach focusing on the cumulative effects of campaigns. However, these debates remain narrowly tailored to state-centred dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, theorists on offensive cyber operations have not convincingly demonstrated how these frames – drawn upon to assess interstate cyber behaviour – can be applied to countering ransomware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This disconnect is perhaps best illustrated in the widely influential cyber persistence theory, which maintains that the structural condition of interconnectedness, as well as continuous network exploitation below armed conflict, tacitly fosters an “agreed competition” between state adversaries. While proponents argue that “the strategic principle of initiative persistence remains valid against non-State actors”, there has been little sustained exploration of what value persistence can actually bring to countering ransomware actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is despite repeated evidence that ransomware operators’ prioritisation of financial gain defies structured competition, not least in their frequent disregard of the risk calculations that otherwise shape geopolitically motivated state behaviour in cyberspace. Ransomware operators have brazenly disrupted US critical infrastructure – including hospitals, oil pipelines, and food production – at a tempo and scale that no state adversary has come close to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barring Max Smeets’ upcoming Ransom War book and a conference paper by legal researchers on the impact of Western cyber operations on the ransomware ecosystem, cybercrime and ransomware have been relegated to the periphery of strategic discussions on offensive cyber operations. Not a single prominent strategic studies or international relations journal has published an article focused on ransomware. Even when issues of cyber deterrence and non-state actors are raised, the focus of countermeasures has remained on traditional law enforcement levers like indictments and prosecutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In circles where states’ offensive cyber operations against ransomware actors have taken centre stage, US researchers have framed the discussion primarily around the question of authority. The debate has focused on whether such operations should fall within the purview of law enforcement or military action – of course with important implications for legal oversight and global cyber norms – rather than critically examining the strategic assumptions and efficacy of counter-ransomware cyber operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-ransomware-boring&quot;&gt;Is ransomware boring?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lack of critical interrogation is symptomatic of a deeper issue: a cultural and strategic bias that downplays ransomware as less significant than state-sponsored cyber threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many, ransomware lacks the geopolitical gravity and technical tradecraft typically associated with state-sponsored operations. As Ciaran Martin, former CEO of the UK National Cyber Security Centre, quipped earlier this year, ransomware may simply be “politically boring” in comparison to other cyber threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a world preoccupied with great power rivalries, particularly US-China competition, researchers and policymakers have instead – to borrow the words of former US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency director Chris Krebs – “fetishised” advanced persistent threats (APTs), state actors that conduct sustained campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon goes beyond the study of cyber conflict. The cyber threat intelligence industry, with the exception of a few firms focused on cybercrime, has long prioritised reporting on advanced and persistent state actors. Although there are commercial incentives for this – as has been emphasised elsewhere – it also reflects the lived experiences and mindset of the ex-government and military intelligence professionals that dominate the industry. Given that theory-building in cyber conflict studies often relies on data-rich reports crafted by these vendors, the cyber threat intelligence industry’s preferences reinforce the academic emphasis on state activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;interrogating-counter-ransomware-strategies&quot;&gt;Interrogating counter-ransomware strategies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does the lack of strategic studies focus on ransomware matter? In the simplest terms, because ransomware policy would benefit from the same type of theory-building and debate that has informed the development of strategic and operational concepts for state activity in cyberspace. Strategies to counter ransomware go beyond a mere collection of rules and decisions; they are rooted in a broader set of beliefs and assumptions that shape how policymakers define problems, interpret information, and choose solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the US counter-ransomware strategy, which increasingly emphasises law enforcement-led disruption operations through offensive cyber and other means. This is despite lingering questions about the theory of change for this approach and its underlying assumptions. Is it simply a version of persistent engagement, which the 2023 US National Cybersecurity Strategy nods to in asserting that “disruption campaigns must become so sustained and targeted that criminal activity is rendered unprofitable”? If so, does this mean that theories advanced for interstate competition and deterrence have simply been shifted onto ransomware? If that is the case, more discussion is required to understand how the goals, strategies, and risk calculus of criminals, particularly those harboured or tacitly endorsed by hostile states, are different from governments and intelligence agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also unanswered questions about the unintended consequences of the current approach by the US, UK, and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In going after major ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) providers – criminal groups that develop and rent out ransomware tools to affiliates – James Babbage, former commander of the UK National Cyber force and current director general for threats at the National Crime Agency, has observed that the “criminal industry is effective at amending its activities and business models dynamically”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has recently been highlighted by Europol, which noted that the damaging of RaaS reputations by law enforcement prompted high-level affiliates to “lessen their dependence on ransomware service providers’ infrastructure”, instead relying on increasingly decentralised and more elusive forms of partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just some of the questions and challenges that would benefit from more interrogation and debate by scholars and researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-need-for-academic-conflict-on-ransomware&quot;&gt;The need for (academic) conflict on ransomware&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As researchers at a national-security-focused think tank, we are ourselves part of the echo chamber that has largely treated cybercrime as an afterthought or distraction from cyber competition and conflict between states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet this neglect comes with risks. First, without interrogation and challenge from those outside government, counter-ransomware strategies risk being built on shaky conceptual foundations. Second, strategic studies scholars could sideline themselves from policy debates about a cyber threat that arguably has a far greater impact on society and the economy than most state-backed cyber operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a new US administration likely to put renewed emphasis on using offensive cyber operations to achieve its goals, now is a better time than ever for scholars to shine a light on the theories and assumptions of counter-ransomware strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In doing so, scholars may reinvigorate increasingly tired debates about cyber deterrence and the utility of offensive cyber operations. They may also come to discover what we have: ransomware is one of the most compelling cyber strategy dilemmas of our time.&lt;/p&gt;

It provides an overview of Finland’s sanctions journey, the private sector’s perspective, the country’s unique challenges, and the practical steps taken to ensure compliance and enforcement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late November 2024, the Sanctions and Illicit Finance Monitoring and Analysis Network (SIFMANet), which is led by RUSI’s Centre for Finance and Security (CFS) and supported by the National Endowment for Democracy, held a workshop in Helsinki to discuss the challenges and successes of sanctions implementation and enforcement in Finland. The meeting brought together representatives from Finnish national authorities and financial institutions (FIs), as well as compliance experts and private sector stakeholders. Discussions underscored Finland’s evolving role as a key player in European sanctions policy, particularly in response to Russia’s ongoing aggression in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report synthesises insights from the workshop to provide an overview of Finland’s sanctions journey, the private sector’s perspective, the country’s unique challenges, and the practical steps taken to ensure compliance and enforcement. It also captures recommendations made by the representatives of Finnish public authorities and the private sector attending the roundtable discussion that are more broadly applicable across the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;finlands-sanctions-journey&quot;&gt;Finland’s Sanctions Journey&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All participants underlined throughout the meeting that Finland has been proactive in adapting to the EU’s stringent sanctions regime against Russia, a process accelerated by the geopolitical urgency stemming from the war in Ukraine. The country’s geopolitical and economic situation has been profoundly influenced by Russia’s illegal war. The invasion heightened security concerns, prompting Finland to abandon its longstanding military non-alignment and join NATO in 2023, marking a historic shift in its defence policy. Economically, Finland has reduced reliance on Russian energy and trade, diversifying its energy sources. Participants noted that the number of companies importing goods from Russia has fallen from about 2,000 to only several dozen, one of the biggest decreases in trade with Russia in the EU. This pivot has bolstered ties with Western nations and incentivised Finnish businesses to search for new partners to compensate for the challenges posed to Finnish industries by the loss of Russian markets. Regardless of the incurred losses, the views of private sector participants were encapsulated by one participant, who noted that Finnish industry stands for Ukraine and sees Ukraine’s victory as in its vital interest and a prerequisite for Finland’s long-term economic development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Finland had relatively limited experience with sanctions enforcement, with only one to three cases annually. This has since increased to nearly 900 cases under investigation, reflecting the sheer scale of the sanctions regime and its impact on trade patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A participant representing the Ministry for Foreign Affairs (MFA) noted that in building Finland’s sanctions capacities, Finnish authorities had leaned on prior expertise, including frameworks established in response to earlier sanctions, such as those following Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. However, the magnitude of recent sanctions necessitated a steep learning curve, especially in the MFA, which serves as Finland’s national competent authority (NCA) for sanctions implementation. In response, the MFA has rapidly expanded its sanctions advisory and enforcement capabilities. As noted by one participant, it was clear to the MFA from the early days of the EU sanctions rollout that it needed to provide advice and guidance to Finnish companies to empower the private sector to achieve effective implementation. With this in mind, the MFA undertook reforms and offered practical services, such as an “Infoline” and an online training programme. Participants also noted that due to limited exposure to other sanctions regimes, such as UN Security Council designations against North Korea, the legal expertise of law firms in Finland about sanctions was limited. Representatives of the private sector noted that this gap was promptly bridged by the MFA and now is increasingly filled by chambers of commerce that are taking over the advisory role and assisting Finnish industries in understanding the sanctions framework and compliance challenges. For example, one representative of industry shared that one of the chambers provides Dow Jones screening services to its members, which is particularly valuable for Finnish small and medium enterprises (SMEs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To coordinate national efforts and facilitate the implementation and enforcement of sanctions on Russia, the MFA coordinates three working groups:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Financial Sanctions Taskforce, which is focused on cooperation with the banking sector and regulatory bodies such as the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Sanctions Circumvention Prevention Taskforce, which was established in 2023, involves 10 public authorities, and analyses trends to pre-empt circumvention.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Public-Private Cooperation Working Group, which is a forum for dialogue between the public and private sectors, including the Confederation of Finnish Industry and FIs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;limitations&quot;&gt;Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The high degree of ongoing and well thought out coordination does not entirely resolve the challenge of constrained resources. Many Finnish authorities faced significant resource limitations in scaling up enforcement efforts. One participant noted that the FCA identified over 30,000 anomalies in trade flows since 2022, yet conducted checks on only 10% of these cases, due to staffing constraints. Similarly, participants representing Traficom shared that they had to reprioritise existing resources to address sanctions-related challenges in aviation and logistics without receiving additional funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representatives from the private and public sectors noted that deficiencies posed by constrained resources are in part mitigated by excellent cross-sectoral cooperation. As one participant noted, Finland is a small country, and stakeholders know each other very well, therefore communication is direct. There is a shared understanding that all sectors are in the same boat and this joint motivation has a highly positive impact on the national sanctions community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants highlighted that sanctions on Russia have had a significant impact on Finland’s transportation sector, particularly in aviation and railways. A representative of Traficom emphasised that aviation faced significant hurdles due to airspace restrictions and the lingering impact of Covid-19, necessitating the reprioritisation of resources, and collaboration with military and border authorities. The agency has played an important role in the implementation of sanctions, as it has issued flight exemptions and ensured compliance and enforcement despite limited resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For railways, the customs authorities have been responsible for enforcing sanctions that caused a sharp decline in Russian cargo transit through Finland (as a representative of customs noted, for some goods, such as stones and fertilisers, this reduced from 50% of the total EU cargo to less than 1%). Participants from all national agencies responsible for the implementation of sanctions in the transportation sector underlined the importance of the effective inter-agency cooperation taking place in Finland, and the valuable support they received from the MFA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;asset-freeze-and-confiscation&quot;&gt;Asset Freeze and Confiscation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the workshop, the unique Finnish asset freeze laws were discussed, particularly in the context of sanctions against Russia. In Finland, the National Enforcement Authority has extensive powers to investigate and freeze various types of assets. This includes not only real estate but also company shares and other financial holdings. The authority operates by receiving substantial information from FIs to identify sanction violations and asset concealment. Additionally, it provides guidance to businesses to ensure compliance with the sanctions regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the sidelines of the workshop, participants commented on a recent asset confiscation case in Finland, where the court had ordered $4.25 billion in assets owned by Russia in the country to be confiscated at the request of Ukrainian state firm Naftogaz. Media reported that the National Enforcement Authority was executing the order in connection with an April 2023 judgment from a Hague tribunal related to compensation for Moscow’s seizure of Naftogaz property when Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. This decision is an interesting precedent, and may trigger further reaction against Russian assets across the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;private-sector-perspective-and-challenges&quot;&gt;Private Sector Perspective and Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the sanctions against Russia reinforced Finland’s alignment with EU policies and reduced its economic vulnerability to Russia, they also necessitated increasing sanctions compliance capacities across FIs and industry, as well as the restructuring of export strategies and supply chains to minimise economic fallout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants noted that, after almost three years of unprecedented roll-out of the EU sanctions on Russia, bigger companies have a solid overview and understanding of their clients, and therefore of sanctions risks. Finnish banks and other FIs swiftly adjusted to comply with EU sanctions and mitigate exposure. However, despite national efforts, gaps remain in SME preparedness. As highlighted during the workshop by representatives of both the public and private sectors, the MFA has taken a proactive role in advising Finnish businesses, responding to 600–700 inquiries annually and providing tailored guidance, targeted outreach initiatives and press releases summarising each new EU sanctions package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in light of the constraints on national resources, private sector representatives advocated for the establishment of an EU-level SME sanctions due diligence helpdesk and enhanced end-user checks to support compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants discussed the impact on Finnish key industries, such as forestry, machinery and technology, of the loss of the Russian market, which had been a substantial trading partner. The energy sector, in particular, experienced challenges as Finland moved swiftly to end its dependency on Russian energy imports, leading to increased costs in securing alternative supplies. Finnish industry now complements public efforts to mitigate the economic consequences of Russia sanctions for Finnish businesses through organisations such as EastCham Finland (renamed from the Finnish–Russian Chamber of Commerce), which has reoriented its focus towards Central Asia to help companies diversify trade routes away from Russia. One participant representing Finnish industry noted that not all trade with Central Asia was related to sanctions circumvention and therefore bad. Before 2022, Finnish companies had exported goods to this region via Russia, but they are now actively seeking direct partnerships through the offices of EastCham in Almaty and Kyiv. The chambers have been actively supporting its members in knowledge and expertise to prevent circumvention, which remains a key consideration for Finnish corporates when trading with Central Asian countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants also discussed the pivotal role that the FCA and the FIU have in sanctions enforcement. A participant representing the FIU noted his institution has encouraged obliged entities to adopt a low reporting threshold for suspicious activity reports related to sanctions, enabling the collection of comprehensive data. With over three years of data, Finnish authorities are now building typologies to detect circumvention patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Circumvention remains a significant challenge, particularly in trade with the Central Asia region. Even though Finnish companies have adapted by reconfiguring supply chains to avoid Russia, FIs have increased due diligence with key clients, and the national authorities actively provide guidance, participants agreed that gaps in EU-level guidance on ownership, control and end-use verification persist. To mitigate this, representatives of banks pointed to the need for automated systems to detect circumvention of sectoral sanctions, similar to those used in anti-money laundering processes but tailored to the unique dynamics of sanctions compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;addressing-gaps-and-bolstering-effectiveness&quot;&gt;Addressing Gaps and Bolstering Effectiveness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roundtable discussion addressed questions about how to improve the implementation of sanctions in Finland and the EU. Foremost, participants stressed the importance of: incorporating implementation feasibility into sanctions design; cross-border cooperation; and enhanced support from the European Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representatives from the private sector said Finland could further bolster its sanctions regime by updating the guidance on ownership control and increasing resources for enforcement agencies. Additionally, publishing anonymised findings from non-criminal investigations into sanctions compliance failings provides valuable learning opportunities for businesses. As one participant pointed out, to make sanctions more effective, it is necessary to make them more understandable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants from government bodies and the private sector expressed a strong stance on a need for the European Commission to accelerate the assistance it offers to member states. The key request from participants was for the Commission to publish guidance and impact assessments concurrently with new sanctions legislation, as well as enhance transparency through codified changes to legislation. The Commission highlighting changes would ease the burden on the public and private sectors of investigating novelties in each EU package, which is especially challenging for SMEs that do not have an in-house compliance team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representatives of the FCA suggested simplifying regulations to facilitate implementation, particularly for SMEs. FCA officials noted that the technical complexity of export control regimes and the reliance on intricate tariff codes hindered effective compliance. One participant suggested adopting simpler frameworks, such as a blanket ban on trade with Russia with specified derogations, to enhance clarity and reduce circumvention risks. Participants agreed that currently, the fragmented nature of EU sanctions regulations poses interpretative challenges for Finnish authorities and businesses, and that the European Commission should be more proactive in advancing the EU framework and mitigating the challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example of one area where the European Commission could provide more guidance, one participant outlined the challenges for the private sector around navigating the TARIC, the integrated Tariff of the European Union database. According to the participant, whose opinion was echoed by other attendees, the database is difficult to use; they recommended that relevant codes be flagged as high risk to help companies identify risks quickly and easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants also pointed to challenges related to the cross-border nature of the implementation of sanctions. Discussions highlighted disparities in sanctions enforcement across EU member states, with interpretations seen as becoming less stringent the further one is from Russia’s borders. On a positive note, Finland has actively collaborated with Baltic neighbours to align practices, leveraging pre-existing information-sharing mechanisms tested during the Covid-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a consensus among participants that detecting circumvention at the international level requires effective communication with not only other EU member states, G7 countries and partners from the Global South, but also domestically, between national authorities and the private sector (corporations and FIs). Effective data exchange between all of these parties is also key. To develop comprehensive models and typologies to address circumvention, all institutions need to understand the broader context through comprehensive datasets. One participant pointed out that there is often a delay between the investigation of cases and their public disclosure, which can hinder timely learning and adaptation. In terms of communication and information sharing, one representative of the FIU noted that Finnish authorities exchange information with other EU member states via Europol and FIU.net, and underlined that the communication between FIUs has been an effective vehicle and gateway to other national authorities that otherwise might be difficult to engage with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, one workshop participant representing the Finnish private sector opened a discussion on the requirement for unanimity in EU decision-making on sanctions and the significant challenges it poses to the adoption of a robust and unified sanctions regime against Russia. Any member state can block or delay decisions, which, the participant said, can lead to prolonged negotiations and watered-down measures. It also creates opportunities for states with closer economic or political ties to Russia to exert disproportionate influence, potentially undermining the EU’s collective stance. Participants noted that the unanimity requirement often obscures the effectiveness of the sanctions regime by fostering compromises that weaken the measures’ scope and enforcement, reducing their impact on Russia’s economy and war capabilities. Participants representing the private sector agreed that Finland, as a country which has a strong commitment to supporting Ukraine, and where the geopolitical and economic situation has been profoundly influenced by Russia’s illegal war, would benefit from departing from unanimity and embracing other options, such as the qualified majority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussions at the workshop demonstrated Finland’s remarkable adaptability in responding to the EU’s expanded sanctions regime against Russia. Through proactive engagement with the private sector and collaboration across public agencies, the country has established itself as a leader in sanctions enforcement and dynamic and collaborative thinking. However, challenges related to resource allocation, regulatory complexity and EU-wide harmonisation remain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Helsinki workshop underscored the importance of aligning sanctions design with practical implementation, and fostering trust between public authorities and private stakeholders. As sanctions evolve, Finland’s experience offers valuable lessons for other EU member states, especially small industrial countries, navigating similar challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia regained the momentum on the battlefield in Ukraine last year. Although Russian progress remains slow and costly, the outlook for the year ahead is bleak. Ukraine’s energy system has been heavily damaged by Russian air strikes, and its forces continue to lose ground in southern Donetsk, where the heaviest fighting is taking place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most importantly, political shifts in some of Kyiv’s key allies – especially the US – could result in crucial financial and military aid being substantially reduced in the year ahead. Together, these trends raise the prospect of Ukraine being forced to accept a crushing defeat after three years of heroic resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this lugubrious backdrop, many analysts have seized on what appears to be a rare bright spot: Russia’s faltering “war economy”, which – according to some – is “Putin’s greatest weakness”. An acute labour shortage, persistent and rising inflation caused by soaring military expenditure, and ever-tightening sanctions will – it is claimed – finally bring about an economic crisis that will force Moscow to abandon its maximalist aims in Ukraine and bring about an end to the war on terms more acceptable to Kyiv and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, these hopes are likely to prove misplaced. Russia’s economy has confounded expectations throughout the war and, despite suffering several complications, remains well-placed to support the Kremlin’s ambitions in Ukraine and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dashed-hopes&quot;&gt;Dashed Hopes…&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not the first time that Kyiv’s supporters have placed their hopes in Russia’s economy proving to be its Achilles’ heel. In the early months of the war, analysts forecast that Russia would suffer a severe and long recession that would cause living standards to slump and the state’s fiscal resources to dwindle. Moscow, it was hoped, would be forced to make an embarrassing retreat with potentially fatal consequences for President Vladimir Putin and the ruling elite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these hopes were soon dashed. The imposition of capital controls, a surge in federal expenditure, and the successful reorientation of foreign trade at breakneck speed arrested the signs of economic distress observed in the first months of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Russia did not avoid a recession in 2022, it was much shallower than expected (GDP fell by only 1.9%) as the economy adapted to its new circumstances. Growth exceeded nearly all expectations in 2023 (3.6%), with this momentum continuing into 2024. Output is likely to have expanded by 3.6–4% last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;raised-again&quot;&gt;…Raised Again&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the quantitative expansion of the last two years has been accompanied by growing signs of weakness on several important economic indicators, raising questions over the quality and sustainability of Russia’s better-than-expected performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mounting labour shortages, fuelled by the demands of war, are just one factor that threatens to derail growth. The massive expansion of the military and defence-industrial production has drawn large numbers of men away from the civilian labour force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with rising demand from other sectors of the briskly growing economy, this has caused the supply of labour to tighten considerably. Unemployment reached 2.3% in October, a post-Soviet record low. Maintaining the current rate of economic growth will only be possible if Russia utilises its existing labour force more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Labour shortages are not the Kremlin’s only problem. Western sanctions and a shrinking trade surplus contributed to a sharp depreciation of the ruble last year, causing import prices to rise and amplifying inflationary pressures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of November, the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) recorded an annual inflation rate of 8.9%, well above the bank’s target rate of 4%. Even this rate likely understates the real extent of price growth, with some staple goods registering price increases in excess of 70%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/0fxFdgq.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to quell inflationary pressures, the CBR raised the key rate throughout the year, setting it at a post-Soviet high of 21% in October. Many businesses now find the cost of borrowing prohibitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many analysts have attributed these signs of overheating to elevated spending on the war in Ukraine, pointing to record-high military expenditure which is expected to have reached over 7% of GDP in 2024. With defence spending expected to rise by nearly 25% this year, accounting for around 40% of federal government expenditure, some have raised the prospect of Russia slipping into “stagflation”, combining high inflation with low to no growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, with new UK and US sanctions targeting Russia’s oil industry, and G7 states seeking to tighten the enforcement of the oil “price cap”, some hope that Moscow’s vital hydrocarbon revenues will be crimped even further, exacerbating the losses caused by the collapse of Russian gas exports to Europe and flagging coal sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;desperate-but-not-serious&quot;&gt;Desperate but not Serious&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, hopes of an imminent economic crisis are unlikely to be realised. Although Russia undoubtedly faces significant challenges, there is little to suggest that these will result in any significant political consequences that might prompt the Kremlin to rein in its ambitions in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tight labour market has benefitted many Russians used to stagnant income growth in the decade before the war. Real wages have soared since 2022, fuelling the fastest sustained growth in consumer spending in over a decade. Soaring military production and record-high wages for soldiers have helped reduce some of Russia’s chronic regional inequalities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the absence of a large pool of latent labour need not constrain growth so long as labour productivity continues to rise. Russia’s low-productivity economy means that there are plenty of easy wins available for firms prepared to undertake simple organisational changes or investment in new machinery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inflation also has its advantages. Rising prices send important signals to firms to expand supply by investing in areas where prices are growing fastest. Investment – chronically low for most of the post-Soviet period – has grown faster than GDP since the war began. Rising prices have also helped swell public coffers, with turnover taxes like VAT growing at record levels and boosting the Kremlin’s fiscal position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CBR’s record-high key rate is not as damaging as it might be in a Western economy, either. Large swathes of Russian business – including those in strategically important sectors – can access state-subsidised loans at considerably lower interest rates. Even those firms unable to access subsidised loans will be able to use record-high retained earnings to finance investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian consumers have also benefitted from state support. Most mortgages offered during the recent housing boom were taken on at subsidised rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the extent to which Russia has a “war economy” is exaggerated. While the broad NATO measure of military expenditure is likely to account for around 40% of federal spending this year, this will amount to closer to 20% of Russia’s consolidated state spending (that is, including both regional and national expenditure).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although this is high, it is comparable to US military spending during the Vietnam War. The militarisation of the economy has undoubtedly grown. However, it remains well below the crippling levels observed in the “hyper-militarised” Soviet economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, many of the features of true war economies – such as price controls, the centralised allocation of resources, and widespread nationalisation of private sector assets – have yet to appear in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sources-of-resilience&quot;&gt;Sources of Resilience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Russia’s weaknesses are not as severe as many hope, its sources of strength and durability also remain impressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the country’s balance sheet. Despite fighting the most intense war in Europe since 1945, Moscow has managed to fund the war with staggeringly modest budget deficits of between 1.5–2.9% of GDP since 2022. As a result, the Kremlin has barely had to borrow to fund the war. At around 15% of GDP, Russia has the smallest state debt-to-GDP ratio of the G20 economies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being cut off from most external sources of capital, Russia remains more than capable of financing domestic investment and government expenditure with its own resources. Over the past two years, Russia has recorded a surplus on its current account – that is, the gap between aggregate savings and investment – of around 2.5% of GDP. For as long as Russia can continue to export large volumes of oil, this is unlikely to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the Kremlin’s fiscal position remains very healthy. Tax revenues generated by domestic activity have soared since the war began. Oil and gas revenues are forecast to account for 28% of federal government tax receipts in 2024, significantly lower than the 53% recorded in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/VmCyqev.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if export revenues slump, perhaps due to a looming trade war or China’s spluttering economy, Russia has plenty of resources it could tap to maintain elevated levels of state spending. The largely state-owned banking system is sitting on piles of cash that could be paid as dividends to their owner: the state. Banks could also be directed to buy government bonds, as they were at the end of 2024. If all else fails, the CBR could buy government bonds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, Russia’s resilience is not purely financial in nature. The foundations of the market economy built in the turbulent 1990s remain strong. Much of Russia’s unexpected adaptability has come not only from its well-trained and professional economic managers, but also from its large and growing class of private business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accustomed to operating in an often hostile and challenging business environment, privately owned firms have exploited the opportunities created by sanctions to supply soaring demand from the government and consumers. The number of registered private businesses has grown briskly since the war began, reaching a record high in 2024. It is this strong base of commercially oriented firms that will enable Russia to continue adapting to sanctions and the demands of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;calibrating-expectations&quot;&gt;Calibrating Expectations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be clear, Russia’s economic prospects are far from rosy. Property rights remain weak, and the state’s role in the economy is high and growing. The vagaries of the international oil market always retain the potential to generate a strong external shock. Western sanctions will also continue to raise the cost of doing business and restrict the flow of know-how to Russian businesses. As a result, Russia is unlikely to join the ranks of high-income countries any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the country’s poor long-term prognosis should not lead us to overlook its short-term resilience. Throughout its 500-year history, Russia’s economic system has rarely delivered broad-based growth or economy-wide innovation for long. Instead, the needs of the market have usually been subordinated to the needs of the state, often to enable the Kremlin to pursue security-related objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s system is no different. Designed to ensure that the Kremlin can pursue a sovereign foreign policy against the interests of the collective West, it is doing its job. The market is strong enough to give the system adaptability and dynamism. And the state is strong enough to ensure that sufficient resources are mobilised towards achieving its security objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For as long as this equilibrium remains intact, Russia will be able to generate the necessary economic resources to sustain enough military power to wage war in Ukraine and, over the longer term, to rearm for a prolonged confrontation with the West. Any hopes that its economic vulnerabilities will bring it to the negotiating table are therefore unlikely to be realised.&lt;/p&gt;

To do this, government must be able to attract high quality talent in the Digital, Data, and Technology sectors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Technical talent in the civil service is key for the new Labour government to achieve its objectives, particularly given its commitment to reduce the cost to the taxpayer of employing consultants, and driving innovation and high-quality jobs across the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To achieve this, the government must improve pay and other incentives to attract and retain skilled professionals in critical Digital, Data and Technology roles in the civil service.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The civil service struggles to recruit and retain technology personnel including in cyber security, data science, and IT operations. Civil service salaries lag behind the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This leads to delays and vacancies. For example, it took nearly three years to appoint a Chief Digital and Information Officer. The new government aims to improve public service delivery through adopting digital and data driven solutions: launching patient passports in the NHS and a National Data Library. However, the successful delivery of these will require technically skilled people inside the government.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To address this challenge, the government should make the Government Digital and Data (GDaD) capability framework mandatory for all departments and centralise the costs of salary incentives. This should be expanded to include cyber and data security roles, and protected by a “double lock” in annual increases.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building on the success of initiatives in the AI Safety Institute (AISI), the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) should consider selectively reclassifying other non-AI technology roles under R&amp;amp;D spending to make salaries more competitive.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While salary will never be the main motivation to become a civil servant, pay should signal that the government values these positions, and should meet a minimum threshold to compete with the private sector. For roles in science and technology, this requires meeting a higher bar than some other specialist roles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-challenge&quot;&gt;The Challenge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delivering on the new Labour government’s missions requires talent at the heart of government. However, uncompetitive salaries for Digital, Data and Technology roles hampers the government’s ability to recruit and retain talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a particular challenge for the new government, which hopes to deliver on digital public services, including NHS patient passports and a National Data Library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building a digital workforce in the Civil Service is no small feat. The Conservatives set a target for 6% of Civil Service roles to be in the Digital, Data, and Technology profession. Today, it is just 4.8% and has barely moved from the 4.7% the year before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Alex Chisholm, former Permanent Secretary at the Cabinet Office, one of the primary barriers in hiring digital and technology professionals is uncompetitive pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly the former Deputy Prime Minister said “a cyber specialist knows they can earn five to seven times, if not more, for the same role in the private sector”. The previous government committed to improving salaries and a holistic offer for government technology roles, admitting “we must be competitive to stay ahead”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To compete on salary, the previous government introduced the Government Digital and Data (GDaD) capability framework. The framework allows participating departments to identify critical roles, such as data scientist and software developer, and provide proficiency based pay uplifts. Some roles fall outside the GDaD framework, including data security and cyber security, though we understand similar salary incentives schemes are available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is unrealistic to think the government can – or should – match private sector salaries, bonuses, and perks. Matched salaries would drive up public spending and potentially further increase taxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The civil service offers job security, favourable pensions, a good work-life balance, social impact and training opportunities. However, it also needs a realistic offer on pay if it wants to attract the tech talent necessary for digital government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the UK National Cyber Security Centre recently posted a Lead Cyber Security Expert role with a base salary of £41,935, adding £6,250 for London weighting and skills payments starting at £8,840. If Departments face shortages with specific roles, they can also add retention allowances, which would bring the total salary to around £60,000. This is still far below private sector rates - where senior cyber security experts can expect to earn between £80,000-120,000, but £60,000 is far more competitive than the advertised base salary of £41,935.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting a minimum skill level for positions – based on the GDaD framework – before they are hired could allow departments to list actual expected salaries including skills payments. Displaying the base salary without skills-based add-ons can discourage people from applying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the GDaD framework successfully provides salary incentives, it is hard to know if it has been impactful. Only some departments are part of the scheme, and only a few have published details of its use; for example, the Ministry of Justice reported that it had boosted pay by £22 million for qualifying officials in 2022-23.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, wider trends cast doubt on the GDaD framework’s effectiveness. Without controlling for the relative seniority of professions, average Digital, Data and Technology salaries rank 16 out of 31 Civil Service professions, and only just exceed the median. Education and Training Inspectors, a group of just 1,000, lead the pay scale with a median salary of £80,740. Policy roles, which encompass 34,000 civil servants, hold the fourth–highest median salary at £48,790 - 12% higher than Digital, Data and Technology salaries (£43,350).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other issues with the GDaD framework include the fact that pay uplifts do not respond to market rates and are not updated in line with inflation. Retention allowance payments are capped within grade bounds - i.e., you cannot earn more than the grade salary cap without changing jobs. Finally, departments are not automatically enrolled in the GDaD framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;low-pay-increases-reliance-on-consultants&quot;&gt;Low Pay Increases Reliance on Consultants&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without sufficient technical personnel, the government brings in consultants. From 2019-2023 spending on management consultancies increased by around 75%. In 2023, the majority (70%) of consultancy spend was on bringing in specialists to meet technical needs. Initiatives, such as COVID test and trace were a big part of this demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economists Mariana Mazzucato and Rosie Collington have argued that excessive use of consultants has been costly for government and undermined the ability of public institutions to meet citizen’s needs. Similarly, the Institute for Government has said that politicians consistently overstate the amount of money saved through outsourcing services and highlighted several high-profile contracting failures including welfare assessments. Research has also found that governments which use consultants demand them more as their own capacities diminish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is therefore no surprise that many former civil servants turn to consultancy. The government, which still needs their expertise, sometimes then contracts them back at a higher rate. This can create an unfortunate scenario where the government pays a premium to a consultancy firm to contract an ex-official who now receives a higher salary, but which is still paid for by the public purse. If salaries were higher in government, it is reasonable to think that many would not leave to become consultants - helping drive retention and save public money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new government has committed to stop “excessive” and “non-essential” spending on consultants, with the aim of halving spending from 2025-26 and saving £1.26 billion between 2024-2026. It is not clear how the government will meet this shortfall in personnel without retaining or hiring more civil servants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Civil service headcount is at a 10-year peak, due partly to Brexit and the pandemic, so there is likely to be an overall decrease in the size of the workforce. Improving the salary offer for those working in digital, data and technology roles can improve the talent density even as overall civil service numbers fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Conservative government put forward proposals to “strengthen the digital pay framework” in their Civil Service People Plan 2024-2027, which Labour is not expected to cancel. Nevertheless, the plan has scant detail with the exception of an ambition to improve pay progression within grades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-opportunity&quot;&gt;The Opportunity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, the US launched a pay incentive scheme for technical roles in the Defense Department’s intelligence components, capping it at $183,500 (around £142,000). While this is still lower than comparable US private sector salaries, it is closer than the UK scheme and evidence suggests that it has improved retention. The US approach incorporates skills-based pay incentives directly into the base salary at a fixed rate per position. This diverges with the GDaD Framework, under which pay incentives are added to the base salary and are set based on skills assessments linked to a four-tier capability framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Singapore, some parts of the government benchmark salaries against top US tech companies – Meta, Alphabet, Netflix, Google and Amazon. High pay for government officials, even relative to the private sector, matches the strong financial incentives for elected members and ministers in Singapore: ministers earn around £645,000 a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US and Singaporean approaches better reflect the cost of competitive salaries. For the UK adopting a similar approach to pay would be costly. If the Digital, Data and Technology profession grew to 6% of the Civil Service (30,000 staff), with salaries at £81,000 (top 5% earner), their total wage bill would hit £2.4 billion – 15% of total Civil Service salary costs or approximately 0.18% of total government expenditure in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might suggest that consultants are actually cost effective, as the 2024-26 savings (£1.26 billion) are only half the annual wage increase, and pay top-ups do not factor in additional costs such as employer pension contributions. On the other hand, it also does not account for how GDaD framework payments are currently costed and only considers “non-essential” consultants. Nor does it assess the impact on retention or whether more skilled tech personnel could reduce costs by digitising government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;examples-from-other-parts-of-hmg&quot;&gt;Examples From Other Parts of HMG&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make a fairer comparison of impact, it is worth highlighting two other UK government initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pivotal Role Allowance is an incentive payment for departments to retain “flight risk” senior civil servants in critical technical roles. Allowances are allocated to specific roles where there is a high risk of incumbents leaving and are removed when roles are vacated or the need passes. Payments are made in instalments and are proportionate to timescales, for example up to £20,000 for 24 months or up to £10,000 for 12. The notional cap on total allowance payments is 0.5% of the overall pay bill for senior civil servants (£670 million) or around £3.3 million. When combined with base salaries and GDaD framework pay incentives, salaries for the most senior technical roles can approach £200,000. However, the Pivotal Role Allowance only applies to current officials and cannot attract new talent, contributing to the nearly three-year-long delay in hiring a Civil Service Chief Digital and Information Officer mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good example of competitive civil service salaries is found in the AI Safety Institute (AISI), where salaries far exceed average civil service pay. The top salary for a grade 7 digital role in most departments is £78,000, while in AISI it is around double that figure. Because spending on salaries at AISI has been classed as research and development (R&amp;amp;D) under capital expenditure, it does not face normal salary restrictions. Clearly, where there is a will to pay technical civil servants more, a way can be found. The previous Conservative government’s focus on AI unlocked significant spending. A similar approach from the new Labour government, in a similarly targeted selection of technical roles, could deliver real impact in other areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;local-and-regional-impact&quot;&gt;Local and Regional Impact&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The civil service aims to decentralise digital talent and embed expertise across the UK. In 2023, 79% of digital roles in the civil service were based outside London. Over a 5 year period, digital, data and technology roles were in the top 25% of civil service professions by share of personnel based outside of London and the South East. New thematic hubs and campuses, such as those in Manchester, Bristol and Glasgow are helping drive regional growth by embracing local digital talent and strengthening ties with academia and industry. Increased pay for technical specialists in these areas would support the government’s aim to promote economic growth across the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond salaries, the Civil Service has become a hub for technical training. Initiatives like the new TechTrack apprenticeship pathways foster in-house talent and promote mid-career retraining. Similarly, secondment schemes for technical talent provide a different approach to relying on consultancies and align with commitments to public-private-partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;plan-of-action&quot;&gt;Plan of Action&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People do not join the civil service to make a lot of money. For most people, the biggest drivers include the opportunity to create social good while also enjoying a stable and secure career path, an outstanding pension, and good work-life balance. However, while these factors are important, civil service salaries must meet a sufficient threshold to successfully recruit and retain talent. This is a particular problem when it comes to technical experts in science and technology, where private sector salaries are comparatively significantly higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To provide competitive technical salaries across government, and improve recruitment and retention, the Central Digital and Data Office, Cabinet Office and HM Treasury should:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make the GDaD framework mandatory for all departments (with a cap on positions) and centralise the costs of salary incentives.&lt;/strong&gt; This would help alleviate budget concerns that have deterred departments from adopting the framework, such as trade offs between salary costs and delivering essential functions. To avoid a misaligned incentive for departments to excessively hire GDaD professionals or misclassify roles, a cap should be set per department which is renegotiated periodically.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre-assess salaries for technical roles against the GDaD framework and adjust them prior to listing.&lt;/strong&gt; This means that listed salaries would reflect actual total salaries, removing uncertainty for applicants, particularly those outside the civil service. Positions will also therefore need to have a baseline skill level rather than the tiered approach of the GDaD Capability Framework, similar to the US approach.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reinvest cost savings from reduced consultancy spending to improve pay for targeted technical roles.&lt;/strong&gt; This would help retain highly skilled personnel and allow a more competitive salary offering that will contribute to building in-house capability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explore guaranteed annual increases to GDaD Framework salary incentives through a double-lock mechanism.&lt;/strong&gt; Consider committing to introduce a system where GDaD Framework incentive payments are adjusted annually to reflect inflation or an indexed increase or decrease in comparable private sector salaries. This approach could help align payments with market conditions, increasing their competitiveness. Similarly, this mechanism could also account for decreases in demand for certain positions due to sector-level use of efficiency technologies such as AI.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make cyber and data security roles eligible for GDaD framework incentive payments (or similar).&lt;/strong&gt; Extend the GDaD framework to include digital/technology roles in the Government Security Profession, such as Cyber and Technical Security. Harmonising frameworks prevents a double-standard for how government values similar technical roles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allow Digital, Data and Technology professionals to sacrifice employer pension contributions for higher salaries.&lt;/strong&gt; Officials should be able to set the balance between their pay and pension.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DSIT should consider reclassifying select non-AI technology roles under Research and Development spending to provide more competitive salaries.&lt;/strong&gt; Drawing from the success of the AISI, other key technology roles should benefit from enhanced pay structures to attract and retain high-calibre talent in government. While reclassification of personnel expenditure is not a cure-all, it is a good example of a proven mechanism to unlock higher salaries for targeted high priority roles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extend the number of technology positions that can receive pivotal role allowance.&lt;/strong&gt; Pivotal role allowance - incentive payments to retain officials - should be expanded to cover certain technology positions at grades 6 and 7 such as Head of Cyber Security, Lead Infrastructure Engineer, and Head of Data Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;黎智英及泛民就反修例會見美國官員 前美領事郭明瀚及蓬佩奧助手獻計&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/E9Ffr3v.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，今（21日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第122日審訊，黎智英第30日作供。控方繼續盤問黎，提到2019年3月政府將《逃犯條例》修訂草案交立法會審議，前政務司司長陳方安生同月赴美國會見時任副總統彭斯，黎吩咐張劍虹將新聞「做到最大效果」。黎向李柱銘說，當時華盛頓氣氛是反中及支持反抗的力量，形容「現在似乎是在華盛頓游說的好時機。」黎同月開始與泛民等人商討訪美之行，期間提議前美國駐港澳總領事郭明瀚參與，因其人脈和影響力可令他們有機會在美國國會上提出《逃犯條例》議題。同年5月，李柱銘會見時任美國國務卿蓬佩奧，郭明瀚事前向李提出數項建議。至同年7月，黎與蓬佩奧見面之前，亦獲蓬佩奧助手 Mary Kissel 提供建議，提及制裁中共人員和香港官員子女的概念，可以融合於制裁打壓中國西部穆斯林的中共官員的概念。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;郭明瀚獲特朗普政府接觸-提供工作機會&quot;&gt;郭明瀚獲特朗普政府接觸 提供工作機會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行繼續盤問黎智英。昨日證供提到，黎在2017年6至11月期間，反覆催促時任台灣總統蔡英文的「左右手」江春男安排蔡會見前美國駐港澳總領事郭明瀚，以協助台灣在華盛頓重建外交渠道。2018年3月，蔡英文與郭明瀚會面成事之後，黎繼續向江春男傳送訊息，要求盡快考慮使用郭明瀚的能力和人脈關係。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今繼續就此盤問，並展示2018年9月2日，郭明瀚傳給黎私人助手 Mark Simon 的訊息，郭表示美國國務院曾接觸他，邀請他重返政府工作，若果他接受相關職位的話，便無法向台灣提供顧問服務。Mark 其後將訊息轉發給黎。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎庭上表示，以他所知，郭明瀚最後未有重返美國政府工作。控方提到，昨日訊息顯示郭明瀚與拜登團隊關係密切，但是他同時獲特朗普政府提供工作機會？黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎形容蔡英文政府令人失望&quot;&gt;黎形容蔡英文政府「令人失望」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年3月19日，黎向郭明瀚傳送訊息，稱「很高興你和陳方安生吃飯」，相信前政務司司長陳方安生能夠告訴郭明瀚更多有關香港的事情。黎接著表示：「蔡英文政府很令人失望。他們沒有兌現他們的承諾。我會尋求每個機會讓你幫助我們的鬥爭和台灣與北京的鬥爭。（“I’ll be looking at every opportunities to have you help our struggle and Taiwan’s with Beijing.”）」黎其後又將訊息轉發給 Mark Simon。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎為何形容蔡英文政府「令人失望」？黎表示忘記了。控方追問是否因為蔡英文未能作出安排讓郭明瀚替台灣工作？黎稱不是。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又問「台灣與北京的鬥爭」是什麼意思。黎表示台灣與北京交涉一直都是一種「鬥爭」，因為是很困難，所以是「鬥爭」。黎亦同意「我們的鬥爭」是指香港。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提到當時是2019年3月，《逃犯條例》修訂草案正準備交立法會審議。因此黎在訊息中稱尋求每個機會讓郭明瀚幫助，是指《逃犯條例》修訂？黎同意他可能是這個意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;郭明瀚指逃犯條例修例草案對整個香港而言是危險&quot;&gt;郭明瀚指《逃犯條例》修例草案對整個香港而言是危險&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後展示 WhatsApp 訊息，黎於2019年3月23日向民主黨李永達傳送新聞連結，有關陳方安生會見時任美國副總統彭斯，而彭斯稱極關注香港人權自由。黎向李稱：「她見了彭斯！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎是否對於陳方安生與彭斯會面感到興奮？黎一度反問控方：「為何你說我感到興奮？」控方指從黎訊息中的感嘆號可見。黎最終同意感到興奮。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著展示訊息，黎向李永達傳送一則長訊息，有關郭明瀚與陳方安生吃飯期間的討論內容。郭明瀚形容陳方安生關注《逃犯條例》修訂，並知道有需要「打敗」它。郭明瀚提到當時似乎香港泛民間未有凝聚、團結一致或任何計劃，而陳方安生認為修訂會以某種形式獲通過，郭明瀚則建議她要集中精神在修例上，因修例草案對整個香港而言是危險。郭明瀚表示會幫助黎和香港，建議他們應該在4月底之前好好討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李永達收到訊息後，回覆黎：「我們應該集合力量去引起公眾關注引渡條例。」黎回覆：「你是對的。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎有否建議郭明瀚在陳太會見彭斯之前，與陳太見面？黎稱沒有，又指陳太與郭明瀚本來互相認識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又問，為何郭明瀚會將他與陳方安生的討論內容報告給黎？黎指郭明瀚僅向他提供資訊，因為郭明瀚是他的朋友，並且知道他關注香港。法官杜麗冰則指，訊息似乎不只是向黎報告討論內容，郭明瀚也有提出幫助香港，又建議黎在4月底之前討論。控方遂問黎，當時有否要求郭明瀚就香港提供意見？黎稱沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;彭斯與陳方安生會面-郭明瀚曾建議黎將新聞做到最大效果&quot;&gt;彭斯與陳方安生會面 郭明瀚曾建議黎將新聞做到最大效果&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰提到，記憶中黎曾將陳方安生會見彭斯的新聞，傳送給不同人。控方遂指，黎當時將相關新聞傳送給民主黨李永達、何俊仁、工黨李卓人、時任《蘋果》社長張劍虹和時任《蘋果》副社長陳沛敏等人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提到，郭明瀚曾建議黎，「要有一個計劃去解釋，將它（新聞）做到最大效果。」（“Jimmy, it’s not enough to get it around. There should be a plan on how to explain, use it to best effect. Advice from Jim Cunningham in Washington.”）黎將訊息轉發給張劍虹，並吩咐：「大新聞，用它做到最大效果，謝謝。（“Big news. Use it to maximum effect. Thanks, Jimmy”）」張之後回覆「老闆，早安，收到。謝謝」。黎確認。翌日（3月24日）《蘋果日報》報紙頭版以〈彭斯晤陳太 關注港人權 學者：高規格接待向京施壓〉作為標題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到有否指示張劍虹報導彭斯與陳方安生會面，黎同意。控方提到，黎早前在主問階段亦同意是次有下達編採指示。黎表示他只是想向張強調這次會面很重要。控方接著問黎是否按照郭明瀚的指示，去指示張劍虹和陳沛敏「做到最大效果」？黎否認是跟從郭明瀚指示。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎向李柱銘稱華盛頓氣氛反中-是游說好時機&quot;&gt;黎向李柱銘稱華盛頓氣氛反中 是游說好時機&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示2019年3月24日，黎與李柱銘之間的對話，黎向李說：「對！現在似乎是在華盛頓游說的好時機。氣氛是反中和支持反抗的力量。兩黨對中國的敵意是明顯的。（“Yes! Now seems good time to lobby in Washington. The atmosphere is anti-China and pro-resistant forces. The hostility towards China in both parties is palpable.”）」黎在庭上表示，認為當時陳方安生做的事情是屬於游說，即引起美國的關注。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同日，李柱銘告訴黎，其秘書 Minky 提議將訪美之行延遲至5月中，他們會再討論。黎則回覆，對於《逃犯條例》而言，5月中可能太遲。黎其後又指：「只要他們在《逃犯條例》上未有放棄，你的訪美之行無論如何都會很重要。我們必須尋求公眾支持，在他們強推之前阻止它。」黎庭上表示，當時似乎有一群人計劃前往華盛頓，但當時《逃犯條例》情況很緊急，「我很渴望盡快處理它。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同年3月25日，黎向李柱銘轉發一則長訊息，關於陳方安生、郭榮鏗和莫乃光會見彭斯以及美國國安委員會職員的回饋意見（feedback）。黎的訊息紀錄顯示，上述訊息是從 Mark Simon 收到。但黎不知道 Mark Simon 從誰人接收到這則訊息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3月起計劃訪美之行-黎提議若郭明瀚參與有機會在國會上提出逃犯條例議題&quot;&gt;3月起計劃訪美之行 黎提議若郭明瀚參與有機會在國會上提出《逃犯條例》議題&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年3月26日，李卓人傳送訊息予黎，告知他經過會議之後，決定訪美之行順延至5月中，因在陳方安生會見彭斯後短期內做重覆的事情是不合理。李又指希望行程可以有更多價值，可能是叫眾議員或參議員舉行公聽會，並邀請香港訪美團出席。李指黎早前提及郭明瀚，李提議叫郭明瀚就公聽會成效給予意見，以及與李柱銘的前秘書 Minky 合作，又提到時任眾議院議長佩洛西及共和黨眾議員 Ted Yoho 抱支持態度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎回覆李，贊同5月中是好。黎提到，美國國會正被民主黨控制，而郭明瀚是一名民主黨黨員，有人脈和影響力，訪美團如果有郭明瀚的參與，可以有機會在國會上提出《逃犯條例》議題，但郭明瀚需要2個月去打通當地人脈和制定策略性做法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎，知不知道為什麼李卓人提議郭明瀚與 Minky 一同合作？是否因為郭明瀚能夠更易接觸到美國人脈以進行游說工作？黎堅稱不知道。至於佩洛西及 Ted Yoho 對於什麼抱支持態度，黎指是香港人的訪美之行，而非支持游說。控方又問，為什麼要在美國國會上提出《逃犯條例》議題。黎指為了討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指出，訪美之行目的之一是引起對《逃犯條例》的關注，以及提出制裁香港官員的主意。黎則同意「引起對《逃犯條例》的關注」是目的之一，但是當時未有提及過制裁，所以不知道「提出制裁香港官員的主意」是另一個目的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;郭明瀚提議將反送中扣連商界和法律界是很重要&quot;&gt;郭明瀚提議將反送中扣連商界和法律界是很重要&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年3月27日，黎向 Mark Simon 表示，考慮到未來兩年對中港關係而言是動盪不安的時候，郭明瀚可能是「我們能夠保留在華盛頓做香港游說的人」。（“He may be someone we can retain in DC for HK lobby considering the next two years will be very turbulent times for HK/China relationship.”）黎在庭上稱這只是一個隨意的提議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年3月27日，Mark Simon 向黎表示，與郭明瀚討論後，指郭明瀚正確地指出香港和台灣的最大威脅並不是親中共政客（panda huggers），而是失敗主義者，因他們認為香港和台灣已經回不去了。郭明瀚又指，在反送中上扣連商界和法律界是很重要，「當它變成一個人權議題的時候，便會跌入失敗主義者的偏見之中。（“… once it becomes a human right issue that plays into the biases of the defeatists.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，郭明瀚似乎提議將《逃犯條例》修訂與商界和法律界捆綁，使它不只是一個人權議題，能夠在美國得到更多支持。黎表示他沒有說同意這主意，他只是獲 Mark Simon 告知有這主意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱郭明瀚義務幫忙訪美之行-惟黎覺得有義務支付他所作付出&quot;&gt;黎稱郭明瀚義務幫忙訪美之行 惟黎覺得有義務支付他所作付出&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年3月29日，黎向 Mark Simon 表示：「當你見到李柱銘的時候，請告訴他郭明瀚義務幫忙，而不是我們聘請郭明瀚，所以李柱銘不會拒絕他的幫忙。這對李的訪美之行而言是好。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至同年4月1日，黎向 Mark Simon 表示，雖然他向李柱銘和李卓人說郭明瀚是義務幫忙，但我們肯定要支付他所作的付出。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎庭上堅稱郭明瀚是義務幫忙，而沒有受聘，但黎有見郭明瀚是他的朋友，加上了解到他的處境，所以覺得有義務自掏腰包支付郭明瀚。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指黎知悉訪美之行是推動美國懲罰香港官員&quot;&gt;控方指黎知悉訪美之行是推動美國懲罰香港官員&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指從2019年4月2日，李卓人的訊息可見，泛民的訪美之行最終定於5月13日出發，因為預料政府想在7月之前通過立法。李又提及，經過他與李柱銘、Mark Simon 討論之後，有兩項實質建議，包括要求美國修訂法律，以懲罰損害一國兩制、推動《逃犯條例》修訂的香港官員；以及一旦修例通過，美國要向其公民發出旅遊警示。李亦正在考慮將反送中議題與美國貿易談判聯繫。李指在訪美之行中，會尋求召開公聽會，並會與國會議員、參議員和傳媒等見面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，在2019年4月的時候，黎已經知道訪美之行是推動美國修訂法律以懲罰損害一國兩制的香港官員。黎僅稱這是別人通知他的事情。控方提到黎早前向李柱銘形容「現在似乎是在華盛頓游說的好時機」，因有反中情緒。黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方引述張劍虹的證供，指稱黎在2019年3月指示管理層利用《蘋果》作為平台爭取國際支持及推動制裁。黎則指：「這一定是假的，我從沒有資格去如此指示《蘋果》。」黎又指，保持《蘋果》的編採工作獨立，是他嚴格遵守的事情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過法官杜麗冰質疑，黎曾指示張劍虹使用彭斯會見陳方安生的新聞做到最大效果。黎承認那一次的確有給予指示，但只是一次例外，從不是慣例。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;蓬佩奧與李柱銘會面之前-郭明瀚提出建議&quot;&gt;蓬佩奧與李柱銘會面之前 郭明瀚提出建議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示2019年5月15日的訊息，在李柱銘會見時任美國國務卿蓬佩奧之前，郭明瀚向李提出數項建議，郭明瀚其後將相關訊息轉發給 Mark Simon，而 Mark Simon 其後轉發給黎。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在訊息中，郭明瀚建議李柱銘感謝美國支持香港一國兩制，並要求蓬佩奧等人為支持一國兩制發聲。郭明瀚指美國接受香港是中國的一部份，而香港應該作為中國的願景，惟《逃犯條例》修訂削弱一國兩制和法治，影響香港作為從商地方的地位，所以需要撤回。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在庭上指，Mark Simon 傳送上述訊息，是為了提供資訊，讓黎保持知情。惟控方指，Mark 傳送上述訊息是為了讓黎知道如何向蓬佩奧提出請求，以作國際游說；這是為了讓黎作出行動，而不只是讓黎知情。黎不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指同年7月9日，《蘋果》報導李柱銘在5月的訪美之行。其中提到：「民主黨創黨主席、資深大律師李柱銘5月率團訪問美國，爭取國際支持反對修例時，曾與蓬佩奧會面。當時美國國務院在會後發表聲明，說蓬佩奧對香港政府修訂《逃犯條例》表達關注，斥修例威脅香港法治。」控方指這一段所述與郭明瀚的建議非常相似。黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，2019年6月11日，郭明瀚創立一個 WhatsApp 群組，名為「Martin, Jimmy, Mark」。郭明瀚向群組傳送訊息，透露眾議員盧比奧等人早前已去信時任特首林鄭，亦會提交法案要求修訂《香港政策法》，以聚焦認證香港一國兩制狀況。郭明瀚又指，為了向香港商界發出訊息，使他們知道香港特殊地位不是理所當然。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎早前稱抵美後才知要見彭斯蓬佩奧-控方展示訊息反駁說法&quot;&gt;黎早前稱抵美後才知要見彭斯蓬佩奧 控方展示訊息反駁說法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指黎於2019年7月在美國會見彭斯、蓬佩奧和時任美國國家安全顧問博爾頓（John Bolton），而黎在早前主問階段供稱，他訪美之行本來是為了向參眾兩院議員講述香港情況，然而他抵達美國後才得悉將要會見彭斯、蓬佩奧和博爾頓。黎同意，並稱本來沒預料會見3人，可能是他抵達美國時，白宮相關人士才安排3人與他見面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/FddKnJB.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ John Bolton（左）、Donald Trump（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎在2019年6月25日出境，先後到英國、加拿大和美國，最後在7月16日返回香港。控方亦展示一系列訊息，顯示黎在英國期間相約「香港監察」創辦人羅傑斯（Benedict Rogers）和奧爾頓勳爵（Lord David Alton）午膳。控方亦展示6月時候 Mark Simon 的訊息，通知黎有關會見蓬佩奧的安排。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指從訊息可見，黎在抵達美國之前，已知道自己將會見蓬佩奧和博爾頓，質疑黎沒有道出真相。黎則稱只是忘記了相關訊息，又指他沒有理由去說謊。控方遂指黎記憶不準確，黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訊息顯示黎與蓬佩奧見面前-其助手和郭明瀚分別提供建議&quot;&gt;訊息顯示黎與蓬佩奧見面前 其助手和郭明瀚分別提供建議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎於2019年7月9日與蓬佩奧見面。黎早前供稱蓬佩奧的得力助手 Mary Kissel 多年前曾居港10年，黎在她任職《華爾街日報》期間認識她，二人是好友，惟對方返回美國之後便失去聯絡。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示訊息，在會面前一日（7月8日），Mary Kissel 與 Mark Simon 通話，提醒黎在打招呼時除了握手和說「Hello」之外，便不要做其他事，因她要保持專業形象。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mary 亦建議黎若有機會向蓬佩奧提出請求時，盡量說得具體，而蓬佩奧正在研究採取什麼具體行動關注香港，又指他不想談宏大議題，而是尋求可以採取的行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mary又表示，認為制裁中共人員和香港官員子女的概念，可以融合於制裁打壓中國西部穆斯林的中共官員的概念。Mary 亦指，將香港和台灣升級為冷戰時期的柏林，會有好處。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指，訊息顯示黎在會面前一天（7月8日）告訴 Mark Simon，他曾與郭明瀚有很好的討論，以及得到一些建議。黎確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late November 2024, the Centre for Finance and Security (CFS) at RUSI hosted two roundtable workshops in Brussels to bring together sanctions experts to discuss issues of implementation. The workshops involved representatives from national authorities in the UK and several EU member states – including from financial intelligence units, ministries of foreign affairs, and other national competent authorities with responsibility for sanctions policy and/or enforcement. Also in attendance were private sector representatives from a range of companies in the insurance, maritime, industrial, legal and consultancy sectors. Research institutes also participated, as did civil society groups with a focus on anti-corruption and financial integrity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The events form part of the programme of activities conducted by the CFS-led European Sanctions and Illicit Finance Monitoring and Analysis Network (SIFMANet), supported by the National Endowment for Democracy. None of the discussions from either workshop are attributable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report relates to the second workshop, which focused on the diplomatic and coercive measures available to secure greater cooperation to counter sanctions circumvention through third countries that have chosen not to adopt sanctions against Russia. These states were referred to as “sceptics” and “agnostics”, each of which has their various economic and historical reasons to oppose sanctions and/or to pursue a neutral foreign policy. Some participants also referred to these states as “middle-ground countries”, reflecting their preference for non-alignment in international affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;successes-and-limitations-of-multilateral-diplomacy&quot;&gt;Successes and Limitations of Multilateral Diplomacy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A participant from the British government began the discussion by presenting takeaways from diplomatic efforts the UK has undertaken with the US and the EU in third countries. These diplomats have jointly visited countries through which Russia has imported large volumes of key military items on the Common High Priority Items List (commonly referred to as the Common High Priority List (CHPL)), a list of 50 critical goods. On these multilateral visits, the UK participant said, they had faced “difficult meetings”, in which representatives of “sceptical” countries expressed four sets of concerns about the sanctions on Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, intermediary countries asked why they should stop this trade when, in many cases, items had originated from EU countries, the UK or the US. In relation to this point, the UK official said that it was important to show improvements in their own domestic implementation and enforcement, which, they noted, has increased drastically since 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, sceptical states also criticised complicated sanctions, and discrepancies between the different sanctions regimes. This issue had been the motivation for establishing the CHPL: “we asked exactly the same thing of each country”, the participant noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, sceptical states questioned why they should support UK, US and EU sanctions efforts. The sanctioning countries’ response had been to point out that the volume of these goods was small, and represented a fraction of a percentage of the total trade or GDP for these states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, sceptical states said that taking measures to prevent the transshipment of goods was technical or complicated. This was met with offers of targeted technical assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These engagements were viewed by government participants as having been successful. For example, as a result of these visits, a fall has been observed in trade flows through the countries involved, at least for a limited time. There were also reports that some countries had increased their monitoring of their exports to Russia. Having convinced initial countries to do this, government participants said, had eased similar conversations in subsequent countries. As a result, they said, engagement with third countries had improved. In these discussions, government representatives told sceptical states that preventing transshipment of these critical goods has little impact on intermediary countries’ economies. “This is not an unrealistic ask”, one British government participant noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These solutions were not permanent, government participants admitted: in some cases, sanctions evasion and critical items transshipment began “spiking” in other countries, including Thailand and Malaysia, as a result of displacement. In other cases, officials saw a return of transshipment to the countries with which they had spoken earlier. These changes were not, one Czech government representative said, necessarily a sign of failure, but rather a feature of the continually changing nature of sanctions policy implementation. “We have seen sanctions bite and then the effect is diminished. The target of sanctions adapts, and that calls for our further adaptation”, they said. Other government participants agreed, saying: “The game of ‘Whac-a-Mole&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;’ is also a success because it imposes additional costs on Russia to move somewhere else.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, China continues to supply most of Russia’s CHPL imports, which requires a more complicated engagement. Government representatives said that, initially, this had “felt like a problem that was too big to solve”, but they also stressed that multilateral diplomatic pressure, as well as public investigations and pressure on the financial sector, had had some impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;finding-the-right-narrative-for-government-engagement&quot;&gt;Finding the Right Narrative for Government Engagement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond these targeted approaches to individual countries and regions, workshop participants believed that the G7 countries’ overall narrative on Russia sanctions could be stronger. One issue, a participant from a research institute said, was that the sanctions regime was seen as “an instrument of Western coercion” and, in particular, as driven by the US. As a result, sanctions were seen as a tool of a unipolar order that many middle-ground countries opposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussion turned to suggestions for how to address both the narrative and the perception of unipolarity. One clear difficulty was that many sceptical countries are willing to enforce only truly international sanctions imposed by the UN, preferring to refer to the regimes from the UK, the US and the EU as “unilateral coercive measures” that they do not recognise. The counter to this is that the UN’s sanctioning capability is now absent, due to Russia’s veto power as a permanent member of the Security Council, which has gone as far as terminating the operation of the expert panel on North Korea sanctions. Despite this, a British policymaker said that the UK had not given up on the UN, and that it continued to see important areas of cooperation on issues such as counterterrorism through international institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A participant from an Eastern European research institute said there was more for their region to do to support the narrative on Russia sanctions, saying: “It is much easier for diplomats from our part of the world to present those arguments while avoiding the long shadow of colonial history.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another suggestion from participants from both the UK and EU governments was to ensure that measures to reduce harm from sanctions were better communicated. For example, there had been significant efforts to protect grain and other food supplies. Nonetheless, one researcher said, “we have failed to persuade African countries that soaring food prices are not due to the sanctions on Russia”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, with greater efforts to improve the narrative – and one participant pointed to a recent article by Josep Borrell aiming to do this – attendees agreed it may not be possible to convince the sceptical countries to support the sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;addressing-sceptical-countries-other-concerns-may-improve-relationships&quot;&gt;Addressing Sceptical Countries’ Other Concerns May Improve Relationships&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion segued into considering middle-ground countries’ concerns that the dominant narrative on Russia sanctions often overlooked human rights and corruption issues in other regions. Participants from civil society organisations (CSOs) said that their partners in regions such as Africa and Latin America were critical of sanctions’ language on universal human rights. In addition to being generally seen as “imperialistic”, participants said sceptics from the Global South believed even global human rights sanctions were applied for primarily political reasons. They pointed out that most were applied to Russian entities, which they said many viewed as further proof that human rights sanctions regimes were a tool of geopolitical censure, rather than representing genuine concerns about universal values. Human rights abuses occurred elsewhere, and the perpetrators remained unpunished. Another participant from an international CSO agreed, saying this was a missed opportunity, as “some of our best allies will be anti-corruption groups”, and that addressing local activists’ concerns was a way to foster their support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another critique was the perception that the anti-Russian sanctions were led by the US, with the UK and the EU following – supporting sceptical countries’ belief that the sanctions were merely a tool in a political dispute, rather than about values. One suggestion for tackling this was that the US and the EU coordinate, so that the US would adopt sanctions imposed by the EU, as opposed to vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To truly address the sceptical countries’ concerns, a UK government official said, governments needed to not just “communicate through press releases”, but also analyse the audiences and their concerns – and then seek to address them. A researcher noted that some of these countries’ concerns relate to their dependence on Russia for support in monetary, resource and security terms. This included, for example, the food supply issues already mentioned, as well as potential energy shortages and national security issues. These security issues must be addressed through not only statements but also through working collaboratively to develop practical solutions – for example, identifying alternative energy supplies, or developing regional trade routes that bypass Russia. One participant from a private company said that sanctioning states “need to come in with the carrot of investments, not just a stick”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A participant from a research institute said it would also be important to engage in more of a dialogue with sceptical countries that results in concrete solutions on issues that mattered to them. There were regional issues and conflicts of more concern to these states, where the EU and the UK might make concessions. “We need more give and take”, they said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;private-sector-relationships-expand-the-reach-of-sanctions&quot;&gt;Private Sector Relationships Expand the Reach of Sanctions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One area where participants from both the private and public sectors saw opportunities was in the nervousness of businesses, and especially banks, from sceptical countries to be exposed to the circumvention of Russia sanctions. Nervousness was driven by their need to continue to trade in international markets, and in international currencies. The private sector was therefore, as one participant put it, the “Achilles heel” of non-aligned foreign policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One participant from a manufacturing company said they spent “most of their time talking to customer companies” in middle-ground countries. These conversations aimed to train local suppliers and customers about the risks of potential diversion of high-tech goods (notably those on the CHPL); the manufacturing company had introduced a certification system to its customers to incentivise learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A participant from a business group said even where countries remained unconvinced about sanctions, they just wanted to know: “What companies and entities do you not want us to trade with?” In this sense, the discussion echoed the desire from the private sector to obtain more granular information from governments about what is and isn’t allowed, which was a significant part of the discussion during the first workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The private sector’s limited risk appetite was driving wider observance of the sanctions than indicated by sceptical states’ foreign policies. But some policy analyst participants said there was also a risk that over-compliance could reduce financial inclusion. For example, G7 banks apply additional scrutiny to banks in jurisdictions known to pose higher transshipment risks. If these banks are unable to document their compliance systems sufficiently, they may lose their correspondent banking relationships. This could affect national economies and citizens’ access to banking services, particularly if multiple banks in a single country faced these repercussions. The intersection of financial inclusion and compliance with not only sanctions but also anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing regulations is a renewed concern for regulators, including the Financial Action Task Force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the workshop discussion highlighted the continuing narrative challenges of gaining support from sanctions sceptics and agnostics. At the same time, the conversation revealed that perhaps the search for an ideal narrative obscures the measures that are working and could be expanded – for example, engaging with countries based on their national interests, rather than ideology. Participants believed this could be widened to consider investments and other measures to address these countries’ interests from a positive perspective (the “carrot”), rather than only engaging on potential consequences (the “stick”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses in sceptical countries may be more inclined to comply with sanctions in their trade as they recognise the repercussions of losing access to global markets. At the same time, leaving compliance to the private sector alone may lead to de-risking, which could harm financial inclusion in developing markets. Ultimately, all participants recognised that a greater focus on strategic communications is necessary if Russian disinformation about sanctions is to be confronted and the mission to restrict the resourcing and funding of the Russian military is to have maximum effect.&lt;/p&gt;
